recession weighed on stock and commodity markets on Tuesday

   Oil below  40  two year euro zone govt yield record low

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  Dec 23  Reuters    Concerns about the deteriorating
global economy pushed oil below  40 a barrel on Tuesday and
drove the two year euro zone government bond yield to record
lows  while European stocks rose  helped by gains in banks 
 Data showing New Zealand s economy contracted by its biggest
amount in eight years in the third quarter and moves by some
U S  manufacturers to cut jobs or benefits emphasised that the
global economy is worsening  which cuts energy demand and weighs
on risky assets 
 In light pre Christmas trade  investors were torn between
the gloomy outlook and views that world stocks might have
bottomed  having gained 18 percent from a 5 1 2 year low on Nov 
21 
  We see a 25 30 percent decline in earnings next year  which
is a substantial headwind for equities  But the speed at which
earnings decline will slow by mid 2009   said Franz Wenzel 
strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris 
  We would not rule out a 20 to 30 percent stock market rally
by the end of the year  So it will be a two tier year  low for
the first half or three quarters  followed by year end gains and
an economic recovery

record lows of 1 764 percent  a day after the 10 year yield hit

 U S  stock futures pointed to a firmer start on Wall Street

 Caterpillar  the world s largest maker of heavy construction

pay by up to 50 percent and offering buyouts to as many as

 Textron  the world s largest maker of corporate jets  said
it will eliminate 2 200 jobs worldwide to cope with a global
downturn 
  As the year draws to an end therefore everyone is prepared
to sit on their hands  do very little and prepare for what will

CAT,2009-02-11,"  Congress reaches deal on economic stimulus bill
   Negotiators trim price tag to  789 billion
   Votes in House  Senate possibly on Thursday
 By Jeremy Pelofsky and Donna Smith
 WASHINGTON  Feb 11  Reuters    U S  congressional
negotiators on Wednesday reached a deal on  789 billion in
emergency spending and tax cuts  handing a big victory to
President Barack Obama in his effort to pull the economy out of
a steep tailspin 
 Negotiators in the House of Representatives and Senate
overcame an apparent last minute snag on funding to help states
plug growing budget deficits and money to renovate schools that
Obama had sought 
 The huge package is aimed at reversing a deep recession and
news of the compromise sent U S  stock markets higher  A
majority of negotiators approved the deal  setting up votes in
the House potentially on Thursday and possibly later that
evening in the Senate but the timing could slip 
 Obama  whose early hopes for strong bipartisan support for
the strategy were crushed by Republicans who wanted more tax
cuts instead of spending  said the deal would help save or
create millions of jobs and  get our economy back on track  
 The compromise stimulus package is  a plan that will
provide immediate tax relief to families and businesses  while
investing in priorities like health care  education  energy 
and infrastructure that will grow our economy once more   he
said in a statement 
 Without a stimulus bill  Obama has said the country faces a
possible economic  catastrophe   Some 3 6 million jobs have
been shed since the recession began in December 2007 
 Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc would be able to to
rehire some of its 20 000 laid off workers if the stimulus
package passed  Obama said 
 About 36 percent of the package is geared toward tax cuts 
with the rest in spending  according to a Senate aide 
 The huge emergency spending will add to a federal budget
deficit already spinning out of control  The Treasury
Department said on Wednesday a  569 billion deficit was
recorded just for the first four months of the fiscal year that
began last Oct  1  a record for that period 
 Democrats control both chambers in Congress and fellow
Democrat Obama has pushed them for a quick conclusion to the
legislation in hopes it would begin to create and save up to 4
million jobs 
 His stimulus plan has won little support from Republicans
who argued it was merely expanding big government spending 
underscoring the difficulty Obama has faced trying to bridge
partisan divides after winning the November election 
 In the Senate  passage of the bill has hinged on support
from a handful of moderate Republicans  To address their
concerns  negotiators in the House and Senate agreed to scale
back earlier proposals for the package 
  The middle ground we ve reached creates more jobs than the
original Senate bill and spends less than the original House
bill   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters 
Senators said it would create or save 3 5 million jobs 
 Negotiators had worked around the clock to meld an  820
billion House bill with an  838 billion Senate measure  trying
to meet a deadline set by Obama to produce a plan that he wants
to sign into law by Monday 
 WOOING REPUBLICAN SUPPORT
 Democrats control 58 seats in the 100 seat Senate and need
some Republican support to reach 60 votes and overcome any
possible procedural hurdles 
  This unprecedented spending of taxpayer dollars is not
timely  targeted nor temporary  and it fails to address the
underlying problems with the economy   said Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell  the senior Senate Republican 
 But McConnell told also told reporters that he did not
think any Republican senators planned to delay passage of a
bill and that is was time to  vote and move on  
 Three moderate Republican senators  Susan Collins  Olympia
Snowe and Arlen Specter  had demanded that the negotiators pare
the bill to below  800 billion in exchange for their votes 
 Collins said they had agreed on a  54 billion fund for
states to help them plug growing budget deficits as well as to
pay to modernize schools 
 Originally the House had  79 billion allocated for states
and  14 billion for school construction  while the Senate cut
state money to  39 billion and stripped out its  16 billion for
building schools 
 Senators also said they trimmed tax incentives to encourage
car and home sales  but details were not yet available 
 At the suggestion of the White House  they also agreed to a
somewhat smaller tax credit for workers that would now total
 400 for individuals and  800 for couples  An earlier version
of the bill would have granted  500 and  1 000 respectively 
 Additionally  there was pressure to add more money to
infrastructure projects and Collins said there was roughly  150
billion in the compromise package  ranging from transportation
projects to efforts to expand high speed Internet service 
 A one year fix of the Alternative Minimum Tax  costing
about  70 billion  was also included the package  That would
prevent middle class taxpayers from being sucked into higher
taxes paid by the wealthiest  which Congress never intended 
 Republicans have been nearly unanimous in their opposition
to the stimulus legislation  arguing it was poorly crafted and
could end up wasting taxpayer money  Some House Republicans on
Capitol Hill complained that they had been left out of the
final negotiations 
 Alone  the stimulus package is unlikely to fix the U S 
economy because it does not address financial sector problems
that dried up credit  The Obama administration hopes that will
be addressed through a bank rescue program unveiled on Tuesday
but Wall Street expressed disappointment there were not more
details

CAT,2009-05-20,"  Obama   Some return to normalcy  in financial markets
   President discusses green economy with advisory panel
   Labor leader voices concern about free trade deals
  Recasts and updates with quotes from Obama 
 By Doug Palmer and Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON  May 20  Reuters    Americans could face higher
unemployment for some time to come  President Barack Obama
warned on Wednesday  underscoring the tough challenges the
country faces even as the economy shows signs of stabilizing 
 Obama  speaking to a meeting of his 16 member Economic
Recovery Advisory Board headed by former Federal Reserve chief
Paul Volcker  said he was encouraged by  signs of normalcy  in
the financial markets and hints the economy was steadying   
though he remained concerned in the long run 
  One of the things that we re wrestling is how do we deal
with job creation and employment   Obama said 
  The concern that we have is that even in a stabilizing
situation there is the prospect of higher unemployment for some
time to come   Obama said  noting the decline of U S 
manufacturing and changes in the global economic picture 
 The U S  unemployment rate rose to 8 9 percent in April 
the highest since 1983  following months of heavy job losses
stemming from the global financial crisis 
 There have been some signs the worst of the U S  recession
could be over  and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told a
Senate panel on Wednesday the U S  financial system was
 starting to heal  after a period of severe trauma 
 But continued high unemployment levels could be risky for
Obama as he seeks to maintain political momentum to enact major
initiatives on climate change and U S  healthcare and carry
into next year s mid term congressional elections 
 GREEN JOBS
 Obama sought to highlight the job prospects created by one
of his chief policy initiatives  reducing greenhouse gas
emissions blamed for global warming and moving the U S  economy
off its heavy reliance on oil 
  Clean energy is obviously a huge opportunity for job
creation   Obama told the panel  which includes GE chief
executive Jeffrey Immelt and Caterpillar CEO Jim Owens 
underscoring his interest in the market based cap and trade
system now under consideration in Congress 
 A Reuters survey showed Democrats on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee had enough votes to approve that bill  which
Republicans have warned could spell economic pain 
 Panel member Richard Trumka  secretary treasurer of the
AFL CIO labor federation  said there was great potential for
the United States to lead in job creating clean energy exports 
But he voiced concern that free trade agreements the
administration was considering would  disadvantage  American
business in global competition 
 Volcker s role in advising Obama is of keen interest to
many on Wall Street  where the 81 year old former central
banker remains a towering figure known for breaking the back of
runaway inflation during the 1980s 
 He remained silent through most of the meeting while Obama
led the discussion  although the two met privately earlier

 NEW YORK  June 15  Reuters    U S  stocks tumbled  marking
 their worst slide in a month on Monday after regional
manufacturing data dented optimism about the economy s health
and resource shares fell alongside commodity prices 
 After a series of signs the economy may be stabilizing 
investors are looking for more definitive signals of its

 Economists had expected to see slight improvement in the

2 8 percent at  59 31  while Caterpillar shed 4 3 percent to
 36 12 
 Oil prices fell from nearly an eight month high after
Russia expressed confidence in the U S  dollar as the world s
reserve currency  increasing the greenback s safe haven
appeal  Commodity prices and the dollar have moved inversely
of late  Gains in the dollar makes oil more expensive for
holders of other currencies 
 Chevron fell 2 2 percent to  71 08  The S P energy index
slid 2 3 percent 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 187 13 points  or
2 13 percent  to 8 612 13  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
lost 22 49 points  or 2 38 percent  to 923 72  The Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 42 42 points  or 2 28 percent  to
1 816 38 
 While the recent run up in commodity prices had helped
stocks extend their rally  there has also been concern that a
surge in oil and other commodities could hamper any budding
economic recovery  Higher energy costs are a drag on consumer
spending and corporate profits 
 In light volume  the indexes racked up their biggest
one day percentage loss since mid May 
 But the broad S P 500 is still up 36 5 percent from the
12 year closing low of March 9 
 A SPIKE IN VOLATILITY
 The CBOE Volatility Index  known as Wall Street s fear
gauge  closed above the 30 level for the first time since
early June  suggesting more turmoil could be in store  The VIX
jumped 9 5 percent to end at 30 81  its biggest percentage
gain since late April 
 This week marks quadruple witching  a term used to
describe the quarterly expiration of June equity options 
index options  single stock futures and index futures  This
can bring more volatility as players adjust or exercise their
derivative positions 
 Sentiment also cooled after Goldman Sachs cut its rating
on Wal Mart Stores Inc to  neutral  from  buy   saying it did
not see a lot of positive catalysts to drive shares higher in
the near term as expense pressures and tougher sales
comparisons persist 
 Wal Mart  a Dow component  fell 2 8 percent to  48 46  and
was among the top drags on the blue chip Dow average  The
S P s retail index fell 1 4 percent 
 The technology sector  which has helped lead the market
rally  slipped as investors took profits  Bellwethers such as
Qualcomm Inc fell 3 8 percent to  44 31 and Oracle Corp
slipped 3 percent to  20 22 
 Trading volume was low on the New York Stock Exchange 
with only about 1 15 billion shares changing hands  well below
last year s estimated daily average of 1 49 billion  On
Nasdaq  about 2 19 billion shares traded  below last year s
daily average of 2 28 billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
2 595 to 457 while on the Nasdaq  decliners beat advancers by

 HONG KONG  June 17  Reuters    Chairman Mao used to say the
truth is always kept by the minority 
 A little known private Chinese machinery company s bid for
a GM marque has been sneered at by even the patriotic Chinese
media  but the deal could succeed where mightier plays like
Chinalco s for Rio Tinto have failed 
 True that private sector firms face an uphill battle in
China against more dominant state backed firms  but it seems
like double standards when Western observers  who extol the
virtues of the private sector taking the driver s seat  praise
Chinalco s  deal but dismiss Tengzhong s bid for Hummer 
 Chinese media s disapproval of Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy
Industrial Machinery s move has tempered concerns about
technology and job transfers to China  as well as questions
whether China s military was behind the bid 
 This could give Tengzhong more bargaining power with
bankrupt General Motors  Underestimation of Tengzhong could
prove beneficial to the buyer in an environment where there are
worries about Chinese deals not being completely driven by
commercial interests 
 No matter how carefully the now busted Rio deal was
structured  Chinalco should know that buying pricey and highly
political targets like resource companies is going to be
greeted by the rest of the world with a great deal of
suspicion 
 Beijing s promotion of Chinalco s former boss Xiao Yaqing
to the State Council  or cabinet  only served to reinforce that
perception 
 In contrast with the outspoken Xiao  the man behind the
Hummer bid Li Yan  who now goes with a Buddhist name Suo Lang
Duo Ji  tries his best to hide from the limelight  but that
does not mean he does not have a plan 
 HUMMER LIFT
 If the deal goes through  the key question is whether
Tengzhong has good strategy to turn around a tarnished GM
brand 
 China has shown success in the past   GM is already selling
more Buicks in China than in the United States 
 What Tengzhong could do is negotiating full rights to the
Hummer brand and extending Hummer s powerful brand image to a
broader line of industrial vehicles 
 Industrial vehicles from airport trucks to oil field trucks
are selling like hot cakes  riding the country s construction
boom 
 If the Sichuan company  which already makes fuel tankers 
dump trucks  tow trucks and fire trucks  wants to compete
against the likes of Caterpillar in this niche market  will it
have a better chance branding its vehicles as  Tengzhong  or
 Hummer  
 While the Hummer brand has indeed become a lightning rod
for critics of America s love for SUVs  the brand has also won
acclaim as outperformers on rugged roads 
 By using Hummer for industrial vehicles  Tengzhong can
bypass Hummer s gas guzzler image problem  Will you care how
much gas a fire truck uses 
 The company is talking about selling a greener version of
Hummer and extending to emerging markets 
 If Tengzhong could further broaden Hummer s offerings to
include small SUVs  their sales are likely to jump in China  a
country just starting to fall in love with  big cars  China s
SUV sales rose 25 percent in 2008  outpacing the 18 percent
increase of passenger cars 
 Hummer might have a reputation of being a millionaire s
toy  but they are still coveted in China  An online survey by
Sina com shows that more than 60 percent people want to own a
Hummer that costs more than half a million yuan  about
 70 000  
 Of course  the global auto industry has had its fair share
of cash rich investors who tried to revive ailing brands and
failed  but Chinese entrepreneurs should not be underestimated 
 Critics had scoffed at Geely Automobile s founder Li Shufu
some 15 years ago 
 After Li dropped out of school  he made refrigerator parts 
then refrigerators and motorcycles  before pushing to make cars
for the masses 
 Today  Geely is one of the few Chinese automakers that
export   Geely now supplies London s black taxis 
 Defying media reports that regulators in China might block
the Hummer deal  China s Ministry of Commerce said on Monday
that Tengzhong s bid for Hummer is normal behaviour for a
company seeking to take advantage of the global downturn to
broaden its horizons 
 This makes sense  The acquisition has the potential to meet
China s strategy to move up the manufacturing value chain 
 Moreover  the repeated disappointment by state backed
acquirers should have taught Beijing that buyers like Tengzhong
are their best bet to drive China s great wall of money to
global markets

 NEW YORK  June 18  Reuters    U S  stocks gained on
Thursday after a recent small pullback as data on the jobs
market and regional manufacturing revived hopes that the
recession hit economy is stabilizing 
 Government data showed that while the amount of workers
filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week  the
number of people collecting aid after the first week fell for
the first time since January 
 As well  manufacturing in the U S  Mid Atlantic region in
June contracted much less than expected  and less than in the
previous month  Economic optimism has spurred stocks as much as
40 percent from 12 year lows  but analysts have said signs of
real improvement will be needed to sustain the rally 
  It really paints a picture of an economy that continues to
have a tough road to hoe  but at the end of the day the good
news is getting better and the bad news is getting less
frequent   said Burt White  chief investment officer at LPL
Financial in Boston 
  The velocity of the bad news is slowing down  which lends
a backdrop for a pretty good baseboard for equities to move
higher  
 Financial and healthcare stocks led the way higher  Lincoln
National was up 7 4 percent at  16 00 after an upgrade from
Credit Suisse  and the KBW insurance index rose 1 9 percent 
The S P financial index gained 2 5 percent 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 86 01 points  or

CAT,2009-06-30,"  Consumer confidence unexpectedly drops in June
   Broad sell off hammers tech  industrials  energy

  Updates to late afternoon  changes byline 
 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  June 30  Reuters    U S  stocks slid on Tuesday
as a surprising drop in a gauge of consumer confidence sparked
caution about the economy s recovery prospects  hurting
industrial  technology and energy shares 
 The drop in the Conference Board s measure of consumer
confidence in June suggested that the 18 month long recession
had yet to loosen its grip on the U S  economy 
 Gloom among consumers is a major setback since their
spending accounts for about two thirds of U S  economic
activity 
 But even with Tuesday s market sell off  the benchmark S P
500 was on course to close its first positive quarter in
almost two years  reflecting some of the optimism that led to
the index s gain of 40 percent from the 12 year closing low of
early March as investors bet on economic stabilization 
  Consumer confidence is the excuse du jour for the latest
market move   said Tom Alexander  head of Alexander Trading 
in Savannah  Georgia 
  For the market to go much higher  you are going to have
to see some real hard evidence of some of these things that
are being anticipated by the market start to come to fruition 
Pick one  Are the bank balance sheets really cleaned up 
Nobody knows  The market has gone up on a lot of faith here  
 The Dow Jones industrial average shed 100 82 points  or
1 18 percent  to 8 428 56  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
lost 9 60 points  or 1 04 percent  to 917 63  The Nasdaq
Composite Index slipped 11 44 points  or 0 62 percent  to
1 832 62 
 Since its 12 year closing low on March 9  the S P 500 is
up 35 6 percent 
 Among industrial stocks  shares of Caterpillar Inc  a
maker of bulldozers and excavators  slumped 4 7 percent to
 33 12  while on the technology front  International Business
Machines Corp tumbled 1 4 percent to  104 34 
 On Nasdaq  chip maker Qualcomm  off 1 8 percent at  45 25 
was the worst drag 
 Sliding oil prices gave investors a reason to sell some
energy shares  with Exxon Mobil down 1 3 percent at  69 69 
 The S P energy index fell 0 9 percent as risk aversion
resurfaced after the confidence data and helped lift the U S 
dollar  As a result  commodity prices fell 
 Crude oil futures fell 2 2 percent or  1 60 to settle at
 69 89 a barrel 
 Shares of U S  oil refiners such as Sunoco Inc and Tesoro
Corp dropped after Goldman Sachs cut them to  sell  from
 neutral  
 Sunoco was off 1 5 percent at  22 95  while Tesoro
declined 1 9 percent to  12 63 
 On the final day of the second quarter  money managers
were likely to burnish their portfolios by selling losing
stocks and scooping up winners in a move that typically fuels
volatility 
 And volume was on the lighter side due to a holiday 
shortened week  U S  markets will be shut for the U S 
Independence Day holiday on Friday 
 Tuesday s other economic news were separate reports that
showed U S  single family home prices fell in April but the
pace of decline moderated  and business activity in the
Midwest contracted again in June  but at a less severe rate
than expected

 By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    The U S  dollar fell to fresh
six week lows against the euro and a basket of currencies on
Tuesday  pressured by second quarter U S  corporate earnings
that continued to beat expectations 
 But the dollar s losses were limited ahead of Federal
Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke s congressional testimony 
Bernanke will testify on the economic outlook and monetary
policy before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a m 
 1400 GMT  
 Analysts expect Bernanke to provide more details on
possible exit strategies from the bank s quantitative easing 
especially after he wrote a Wall Street Journal article on the
same subject 
 In the run up to Bernanke s speech  investor appetite for
risk was still evident in equity markets especially after
Tuesday s generally strong earnings  Caterpillar  for instance 
posted a second quarter profit and gave an upbeat earnings
outlook for 2009 
  Markets were once again reacting to strong U S  earnings 
I would say though that the earnings beats were the slightest
of margins   said Jacob Oubina  senior currency strategist  at
Forex com in Bedminster
  But the most important thing today is Ben Bernnake s
testimony and any color he gives on exit strategies  
 Bernanke highlighted in the WSJ article on Tuesday that the
central bank has a strategy for removing its accommodative
measures once a recovery takes hold  He wrote that the huge
amounts of money pumped into the economy will not constrain the
Fed s ability to push borrowing costs higher when the time
comes 
  Today s editorial by the Fed Chairman has provided a
convenient short covering opportunity for dollar bears which
can continue for the rest of the day   said Boris Schlossberg 
director of GFT in New York 
 But he said the dollar s rally in the wake of Bernanke s
article was much more pronounced against the pound more than
the euro 
 In early New York trading  the ICE futures  dollar index
fell to 78 591  its lowest since early June  It was last at
78 604  down 0 4 percent on the day 
 The euro rose to new six week highs at  1 4277  according
to Reuters data  and was last at  1 4267  up 0 3 percent 
 Sterling underperformed  trading down 0 8 percent at
 1 6470 after public finances data showed the worst June
performance on record  with net debt standing at 56 6 percent
of gross domestic product  the highest since records began in
1974 
 The U S  dollar fell against the Canadian dollar to
C 1 0982  down 0 5 percent  after the Bank of Canada left
interest rates at a historic low of 0 25 percent and gave an
upbeat economic forecast

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    U S  stocks were set to open
higher on Tuesday  following the S P 500 s rise to an
eight month high in the previous session  after Caterpillar Inc
led a string of upbeat earnings results that sparked optimism
about the economy 
 Shares of Caterpillar soared more than 12 percent in early
trade after the world s largest maker of mining and
construction vehicles raised its full year outlook and said it
sees signs of stabilization that could set the foundation for a
recovery 
 The better than forecast results from Caterpillar followed
similar upbeat earnings from chemicals company DuPont Co and
drug maker Merck   Co  among others  which investors took as a
sign that a recent stock rally had a healthy footing 
  We re involved in a melt up and the carrot in front of the
horse is going to be very positive earnings   said Jeffrey
Saut  chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in
St  Petersburg  Florida 
 He said people view Caterpillar as a proxy of the U S 
economy  but the company s topping of estimates and raised
guidance also points also to a healthier world economy 
 S P 500 futures were up 7 points and were above fair value 
a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 70 points
and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 7 0 points 
 Investors later on Tuesday will closely watch testimony on
the economic outlook and monetary policy from Federal Reserve
chairman Ben Bernanke  expected at 10 a m   1400 GMT  
 After the closing bell on Monday  chipmaker Texas
Instruments Inc posted a stronger than expected second quarter
operating profit  but its stock slipped 1 1 percent to  23 35 
 On the economic front  U S  chain store sales rose 0 5
percent last week compared with the previous week as tracked by
the ICSC and Goldman Sachs 
 U S  stocks jumped on Monday  driving the Standard   Poor s
500 Index to an eight month closing high  The Dow Jones
industrial average shot up 104 21 points  or 1 2 percent  the
S P gained 10 75 points  or 1 1 percent and the Nasdaq

 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    The dollar rebounded from
six week lows against the euro on Tuesday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment on the U S 
economy  reviving the greenback s safe haven appeal 
 A jittery stock market also damped down investor appetite
for risk  driving up the yen while pushing down higher yielding
commodity currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand
dollars 
 Bernanke  in his testimony before the U S  House Financial
Services Committee  said unemployment was likely to remain high
into 2011  which he warned could undermine consumer confidence
and derail a recovery  He also said benchmark U S  interest
rates will stay low for a long time and expressed concern about
the U S  budget deficit 
  His comments have been construed as reasonably dovish 
generally advising caution on the timing and extent of the
economic recovery   said Samarjit Shankar  director of global
foreign exchange strategy at the Bank of New York Mellon in
Boston  adding that  has led to a slight pullback in risk
appetite  
 In late New York trading  the euro fell 0 2 percent to
 1 4199  having climbed to six week highs earlier in the day at
 1 4277  according to Reuters data 
 The dollar fell 0 6 percent to 93 69 yen while the euro was
down 0 8 percent at 132 97 yen 
 Andrew Wilkinson  senior market analyst at Interactive
Brokers in Greenwich  Connecticut  said Bernanke s cautious
tone threw the dollar a lifeline 
  His bottom line assessment that the U S  economy is still
nowhere near ready for a policy reversal flew in the face of
equity market investors who have been busily discounting a
return to growth   he said 
 The ICE futures  dollar index  a measure of the greenback s
value against a basket of six other major currencies  was
little changed at 78 889 after falling to 78 591  its lowest
since early June 
 RISK RALLY RETREATS
 Risk appetite had improved over the last few sessions after
a string of stronger than expected U S  corporate earnings for
the second quarter boosted optimism about the economy 
 Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar  for instance  posted a
second quarter profit and gave an upbeat earnings outlook for
2009  But it later warned that the third quarter would be tough
for sales and production and that it could report a loss for
that period 
 Some analysts  however  sounded a note of caution on recent
U S  earnings 
  A lot of the earnings generated in the second quarter were
due to cost cutting measures  mainly on the employment side  
said Jacob Oubina  senior currency strategist at Forex com in
Bedminster  New Jersey   The sustainability of the beats as we
head into the fourth quarter is therefore questionable  
 The U S  dollar  meanwhile  retraced losses against the
Canadian dollar to trade little changed at C 1 1057 
 The greenback had earlier fallen to session lows at
C 1 0967 after the Bank of Canada left interest rates at a
historic low of 0 25 percent and gave an upbeat economic
forecast 
 Sterling underperformed  trading down 0 6 percent at

 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    The U S  dollar extended
losses against the yen on Tuesday  but trimmed losses versus
the euro after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke gave what
some analysts saw as a less than upbeat assessment on the U S 
economy 
 That curbed risk appetite  which had improved the last few

corporate earnings for the second quarter 
 Bernanke  in his testimony before the House Financial
Services Committee  said unemployment was likely to remain high
into 2011 and warned that this could undermine consumer
confidence and derail a recovery 
 Investors sold the euro against the dollar  because
 Bernanke  wasn t nearly as bullish as he usually is   although
 this may be a fairly limited move   said Boris Schlossberg 
director of FX research at GFT in New York 
  The Fed has zero intention of tightening monetary policy
anytime in the near future  They want to keep the conditions in
place to sustain this fragile economic recovery  I expect rates
to stay stationary throughout this year and well into the

   Profit taking and Bernanke comments weigh
   Dollar steady
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  July 22  Reuters    World stocks clung close to
nine month highs on Wednesday with some profit taking in Europe
keeping a lid on further gains and cautious words from U S 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke dampening sentiment 
 The dollar was steady against major currencies 
 MSCI s all country world stock index was down 0 2 percent 
just off a 2009 high reached on Tuesday that took the index to
levels last seen in October 2008 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
0 5 percent  breaking a seven day winning streak  Earlier 
Japan s Nikkei rose 0 7 percent to hit its highest in more than
two weeks 
  Experience tells us that the market doesn t go up for more
than seven or eight days in a row and people were getting the
feeling that the market  was overbought    said Jim Wood Smith 
strategist at Williams de Broe 
 Equities have been rallying sharply over the past week as
corporate earnings reports  including many U S  majors  have
provided positive surprises 
 On Tuesday  for example  Caterpillar Inc  Apple Inc and
Merck   Co  all issued encouraging profit reports  But some
firms  including Caterpillar  have been cautious about the
current quarter 
 Bernanke also sounded a note of caution on Tuesday  saying 
U S  unemployment was likely to remain high into 2011 which
could undermine consumer confidence and derail a recovery 
 
 DOLLAR STEADY
 The dollar held steady against most major currencies 
recouping losses following Bernanke s comments  which implied  
U S  interest rates would stay low for some time 
  Bernanke was trying to improve policy credibility in the
market and anchor inflation expectations   said Lee Hardman 
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 
  The dollar has been broadly stable and that is a sign that
Bernanke s message has come across well   he said 
 The dollar index  a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies  was up 0 1 percent at 79 045 after touching
78 591 on Tuesday  its lowest since June 3 
 The euro was down 0 2 percent at  1 4183 after hitting a
seven week high on Tuesday at  1 4278  close to its peak for the
year 
 Euro zone government bond yields were flat to lower 
 Crude oil was down 76 cents at  64 84 a barrel  An

expectations  pointing to profit taking after the recent surge

  I don t want to dampen the positive sentiment  but one has
to acknowledge that expectations with regard to corporate
earnings have been very low   said Commerzbank Chief Strategist
Hans Juergen Delp 
  Caterpillar  and Apple  have shown that the
second earnings season yield results above expectations  but one
has to ask the question  Where do those expectations lie  
 Caterpillar results lifted U S  stocks on Tuesday  while

profits over the trading session   Roger Peeters  strategist at

company is not able to come up with a precise guidance  Thus  we
speculate that order cancellations might still be a topic

 On the upside  the DJ STOXX European Telecoms Index was the
top sectoral gainer  up 0 4 percent  with Deutsche Telekom
  Vodafone  and Telecom Italia  up
0 5 3 1 percent

No  2 construction machinery maker  said its April June profit
plunged to one tenth the level of a year ago as the global
downturn hit construction and mining demand 
 The sector has been under pressure since late last year as
stalled housing and infrastructure projects and the cancellation
of mining field development work hurt sales and led to a buildup
of unsold excavators  wheel loaders and dump trucks 
 Komatsu  which ranks behind U S  rival Caterpillar Inc 
maintained its full year earnings forecast  but it cut its global
demand outlook  citing weakness in Japan and the United States 
 Komatsu and local rival Hitachi Construction tumbled into the
red in the January March quarter amid a sudden collapse in
demand  Both warned in April that their profits would roughly
halve this financial year 
  The results were not so bad  apparently due to the effects
of cost cuts  We may now say that Komatsu s earnings bottomed out
in the January March quarter   said Hidehiko Hoshino  analyst at
UBS Securities 
  Looking ahead  however  the lower demand outlook leaves us
wonder whether the company will downgrade full year earnings
forecasts later or expand cost cuts   he said 
 Komatsu said on Tuesday its revenues nearly halved in the
first quarter  though it mitigated some of the pressure from the
revenue plunge on its profits by rationalising production and
cutting fixed costs 
 For the first quarter of the year to March 2010  the company
reported an operating profit of 8 27 billion yen  down 90 1
percent from the same period a year ago 
 Demand for construction equipment has been falling more
sharply than expected in Japan and the United States  while the
outlook remains cloudy for Europe and the Middle East  with
Chinese demand only showing patchy signs of recovery  the company
said 
 Komatsu now expects global demand for its main construction
machinery products to drop 30 35 percent in the full year to
March 2010 compared with a year ago  more sharply than its
original forecast made in April for a 26 percent drop 
 Even so  it kept its operating profit forecast for the full
business year at 72 billion yen 
 That exceeded a consensus forecast of 57 5 billion yen in a
poll of 23 analysts by Thomson Reuters 
 Hitachi Construction on Monday cut its full year operating
profit forecast to 24 billion yen from 27 billion yen  However 
that still beat a consensus forecast of 13 billion yen in a poll
of 12 analysts by Thomson Reuters 
 U S  rival Caterpillar reported stronger than expected
earnings last week and raised its full year forecast due to
factors including a lower than expected tax rate and favourable
foreign currency fluctuations 
 In the last three months  Komatsu shares gained 27 percent

CAT,2009-08-11,"  U S  productivity surges as businesses cut jobs
   Gain in productivity biggest in six years
   Unit labor costs tumble by the most in nine years
   Inventories fall for 10th straight month in June
  Adds details  Summers comments  new quotes 
 By Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON  Aug 11  Reuters    U S  output per worker rose
at its fastest pace in six years during the second quarter as
businesses wrung more from shrinking staff in a sign that
recovery from recession will be slow and unlikely to create a
surge in hiring 
 A Labor Department report on Tuesday showed non farm
productivity  a gauge of hourly output per worker  jumped at a
6 4 percent annual rate  the sharpest since the third quarter
of 2003 after a 0 3 percent gain in the January March quarter 
  The bounce in productivity is another indication that the
nasty U S  recession is drawing to a close  The bad news is 
however  that firms are still reluctant to hire   said Harm
Bandholz  an economist at UniCredit Markets and Investment
Banking in New York 
 A separate government report showed U S  wholesalers cut
their inventories of unsold goods for a 10th straight month in
July as businesses continued running as lean as possible in the
face of uncertainty about how durable a recovery will be 
 U S  stocks deepened losses after the wholesale data and
government bond prices rallied to session highs as investors
worried businesses were cutting inventories sharply because
they remained skeptical about a return in demand 
 Top White House economic adviser Larry Summers said on
Tuesday a foundation for economic recovery was being laid  but
warned the economy had a long way to go  For details  see
 ID nN11532586 
 Analysts said the sustained drop in wholesale inventories
posed a risk that second quarter gross domestic product could
be revised lower to show a annual rate of decline steeper than
the 1 percent reported by the government last month 
  We are lowering our estimate of the percent change in
second quarter real GDP from  1 2 percent to  1 8 percent  
said Abiel Reinhart  an economist at JP Morgan in New York 
  We also expect that the change in real business
inventories in the second quarter will be revised down from
what was already a record  141 billion decline  annual rate  to
a  162 billion decline  
 DATA REASSURING FOR THE FED
 The productivity data is likely to be reassuring for the
Federal Reserve  as it indicates inflation remains muted 
 The U S  central bank is set to start a regular two day
meeting on Tuesday and is widely expected to leave overnight
lending rates unchanged near zero 
  It gives the Fed more room to keep rates lower for longer
in order to move the economy as quickly as possible through the
recovery phase to an expansion mode   said Brian Bethune  chief
U S  financial economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington 
Massachusetts 
 The worst economic downturn in over 60 years has forced
companies to aggressively cut costs    mostly their workforce
   to shield profits from further erosion  Since the start of
recession in December 2007  about 6 7 million workers have been
laid off  according to the latest government statistics 
 Analysts said the surge in productivity helped to explain
better than expected earnings from some companies  despite weak
demand across all sectors of the economy 
 Deeper cost cuts  including layoffs and plant closures 
have helped companies such as Caterpillar Inc  and 3M Co
  to post better than expected second quarter results 
 Separately  the Commerce Department said that stocks at
U S  wholesalers plummeted 1 7 percent in June  driving
inventories to their lowest level in more than two years 
 The inventory to sales ratio fell to 1 26 months  worth
from May s 1 28 months  the lowest ratio since October 
  We believe that firms will continue to shed stocks in the
second half of the year  but at a much more moderate pace 
which implies a significant positive impetus to GDP  especially
in the current quarter   said Stephen Stanley  an economist at
RBS in Greenwich  Connecticut 
 According to the productivity report  hours worked plunged
at a 7 6 percent rate in the second quarter  while output fell
1 7 percent 
 In a sign that inflation pressures remained benign and
deflation was a threat  unit labor costs fell 5 8 percent  the
biggest decline since the second quarter of 2000  after
dropping a revised 2 7 percent in the January March quarter 
 Unit labor costs are closely watched by the Fed for hints
of inflation  Compensation per hour rose at a 0 2 percent pace 
but adjusted for inflation  it was down 1 1 percent 
  The decline in wage costs will lead to a decline in
prices  which is exactly the sort of downward wage price spiral
the Fed will be desperate to avoid   said Paul Ashworth  a
senior U S  economist at Capital Economics in Toronto 
  The economy may be tentatively emerging from recession 
but the threat of deflation will remain for some time  
 Compared with the April June quarter of 2008  non farm
productivity was up 1 8 percent  Unit labor costs fell 0 6
percent year on year  Compensation from a year earlier rose 1 3
percent and was up 2 2 percent once adjusted for inflation 
 Output  measured on a year on year basis  was down 5 6
percent in July

as signs of weakness in housing and investors  worries that
authorities might be curbing stimulus efforts too soon sparked
caution 
 World central banks said they would scale back infusions of
U S  dollars into their banking systems  fueling unease
triggered a day earlier when stocks sold off following the U S 
Federal Reserve s decision to slow purchases of mortgage debt 
 That program has been one of the key pillars of the Fed s

   Dollar at 14 month low against major currencies
   Q3 results continue to beat expectations
 
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON  Oct 20  Reuters    World stocks hit a new 12 month
high on Tuesday  powered by strong results from Apple Inc
 and Texas Instruments  and helping to push the
dollar to a new 14 month low against a basket of currencies 
 The strength in global stocks  up 75 percent from
crisis lows in March  boosted optimism on corporate earnings and
the global recovery  encouraging traders to sell dollars 
for higher yielding currencies 
 Crude prices meanwhile eased from their earlier highs but
gold prices firmed and safe haven government bonds were steady 
 The MSCI All Country World Index  was up 0 2
percent at 300 10 points  after hitting 300 77    its highest
level since late September 2008  Emerging equities 
rose 0 3 percent  hitting a new 14 month high 
 Apple s profits and sales beat forecasts on the back of
record sales of iPhones and Mac computers  extending a run of
strong results last week for leading U S  banks and companies 
 Japan s Nikkei  gained 1 percent while U S  stock
index futures    were up 0 2 0 7 percent 
pointing to a higher start for Wall Street  The FTSEurofirst 300
 eased 0 1 percent after Monday s sharp gains  
  It is what I call  steady as she goes   Stay in the asset
classes that are doing well for the moment  Don t get carry
away   said Michael Dicks  head of research and investment
strategy at Barclays Wealth 
  Obviously next year     you have got a fair amount of time
to look at how policymakers deliver their 2010 and talking about
2011 budgets  That s probably going to be the key how quickly
they decide to start tightening up in countries that have been
performing well  
 U S  housing and inflation data are due later on Tuesday as
well as results from Caterpillar  
 
 DOLLAR WEAK
 The dollar fell 0 3 percent to 90 35 yen   while the
euro  was at  1 4973 after touching its highest level in
14 months at  1 4994 earlier    a tad short of  1 5000 
 The U S  currency has been under sustained pressure this
year due to expectations for low U S  interest rates and
questions about its status as the world s reserve currency 
 Comments on the euro s strength from an adviser to French
Presient Nicolas Sarkozy and a Market News International report
quoting an unnamed Chinese government source calling for a
reversal of the dollar s slide had limited impact 
 But in Asia  the yuan jumped against the dollar in benchmark
offshore non deliverable forwards  NDFs  as overseas speculators
bet on long term appreciation of China s currency  The move
implied a 12 month appreciation versus the dollar of 4 55
percent  the most since August 2008 
Yields on benchmark 10 year U S  Treasuries  were
down 1 basis point at 3 378 percent  and those on the 10 year
euro zone Bund  were down 1 basis point at 3 280
percent 
 Crude futures  eased after rallying to a one year high
above  80 a barrel on a weak dollar  while gold  put on
0 2 percent  close to last week s record highs 
 Societe Generale said in a note this week that investors
tended to increase their positions in the best performers and
sell the worst performers as they try to  window dress  results
to look good before the end of the accounting year 
  It is highly probable  all else being equal  that risky
assets will do well by year end   the bank said

CAT,2009-10-21,"  Dollar steadies as commodity currencies  stocks stall
   Profit booking on GBP  NZD and CAD vs dollar
   But dollar downtrend expected to resume
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO  Oct 21  Reuters    The dollar stabilised on Wednesday 
aided by profit booking in rallying commodity linked and
higher yielding currencies  after being pushed to a 14 month low
against a basket of currencies the previous day 
 Traders said investors had been cashing in gains in the
Canadian and New Zealand dollars  which hit their strongest
levels in about 15 months this month  and in sterling  pushing
them down about 0 2 percent against the greenback 
 The move helped the dollar climb further off a 14 month low
against the euro after the single European currency failed to
breach a psychological barrier at  1 50 the previous day 
 The dollar also got some support from profit taking in Asian
currencies  after markets in Brazil fell on a new government tax
on foreign investments aimed at stopping the real from gaining 
 The Bank of Canada killed talk of an early rate hike on
Tuesday  warning that favourable economic developments were being
undermined by the Canadian dollar s strength and sending the
currency down sharply 
 The move spread to other pairs although comments from New
Zealand s central bank chief  Alan Bollard  that a high currency
was not necessarily an obstacle to raising the cash rate gave the
kiwi a brief lift  
  The BOC s commitment to keep rates low until well into
next year weighed on rest of the  growth  proxies   said Sue
Trinh  currency strategist at RBC Capital in Sydney 
  Besides  stocks were also struggling  offering the U S 
dollar support and tempering its fall  
 The dollar index was flat from late New York levels at
75 565  recovering from a 14 month low of 75 103 on Tuesday 
 The Australian dollar retreated from Tuesday s 14 month high
above  0 9300 to  0 9223  while the kiwi held steady
at  0 7495  having lost 1 percent on Tuesday  It briefly rose as
high as  0 7525 after Bollard s comments 
 The Canadian dollar steadied at C 1 0498 per dollar  after
slipping to C 1 0517 and having tumbled 2 percent the previous
day 
 The euro fell 0 2 percent to  1 4916  It hit a 14 month high
of  1 4994 the day before 
 JUST A PAUSE
 The dollar has been under pressure this year as investors
brace for record low U S  interest rates well into 2010 and
questions mount about its status as the world s main reserve
currency 
 It has also been hurt by talk that it is fast becoming the
new funding currency for carry trades  replacing or at least
accompanying another low yielder  the yen 
 It slid 0 1 percent to 90 67 yen  with support
seen around 90 yen and Japanese exporters expected to sell into
rallies up to 91 00 
 San Francisco Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen said
the time for tightening in the United States was still several
months away  echoing the cautious mood among policymakers there
about the pace of the economic recovery 
 Policy makers worldwide are watching the dollar s fall push
up their own currencies to the possible detriment of economic
recovery  with France joining Canada on Tuesday in expressing
concern 
 But policy makers also want to see a correction in imbalances
between exporter and importer nations which contributed to the
global economic crisis  corrections which some say will require
the greenback to fall 
 Tohru Sasaki  chief FX strategist Japan at JP Morgan in
Tokyo  expected more dollar weakness to come due to the U S 
current account deficit and lack of flows into the U S  due to
its low yields 
  It s understandable if they are worrying about dollar
weakness but it s not easy to stop this trend because it s not a
speculative movement   Sasaki said 
 The dollar got some respite from softer stocks  Wall Street
ended lower and Asian markets were in the red after disappointing
U S  housing and inflation data outweighed strong results from
bellwethers Apple and Caterpillar 
 Calyon noted the negative correlation between the dollar
index and the S P 500 is consistently high  meaning when stocks
rise the dollar index is likely to fall  and this correlation
meant earnings from U S  firms would be as closely followed as
U S  data releases 
  Should earnings continue to beat forecasts the dollar is
likely to weaken further   Mitul Kotecha  Calyon head of global
FX research  wrote in a client note 
 The Bank of England releases minutes of its last policy
meeting later in the day  At the meeting held on Oct  7 8  it
held rates at a record low of 0 5 percent and kept its 175
billion pound   287 billion  asset buying programme in place 
 Sterling came under pressure on Tuesday after Bank of
England Governor Mervyn King said Britain was likely to return to
positive growth in the second half of this year  but output would
remain below its year ago level for some time 
 Sterling steadied at  1 6385 after dipping to  1 6346
earlier  It has risen 4 percent in a week

  Recasts to lead on quarterly earnings  adds details 	
 TOKYO  April 27  Reuters    Komatsu Ltd   the
world s No 2 construction machinery maker  doubled its quarterly
operating profit and forecast further gains this year as it taps
fast growing demand in China and sees a continued recovery in
the United States and Europe 	
 Komatsu  which trails U S  based industry leader Caterpillar
Inc   said it was still unclear what impact the massive
earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast Japan on March 11
would have on its earnings 	
 Komatsu is seen as a natural beneficiary of the rebuilding 
and its shares have risen 10 percent since the disaster  The
benchmark Nikkei average is down 6 percent in that
period 	
  It is unclear how much rebuilding related demand there will
be and we have not incorporated any into our forecast  We are
looking for domestic demand to be flat year on year   Chief
Financial Officer Mikio Fujitsuka told a briefing 	
 Komatsu posted an operating profit of 60 2 billion yen
  738 5 million  on Wednesday for the January March quarter  up
from a 30 9 billion yen profit in same quarter last year 	
 For the current year to March 2012  Komatsu forecast
operating profit would rise 37 percent to 305 billion yen 
bigger than the Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 294 7
billion yen based on predictions by 12 analysts 	
 The SmartEstimate puts a larger weighting on recent
estimates by highly rated analysts 	
 Komatsu said it expected solid demand for mining equipment 
given active investment in commodities production 	
 Over the past few years Komatsu has significantly boosted
its presence in China  where aggressive spending on housing and
infrastructure projects is driving up demand for wheel loaders 
hydraulic excavators and mining equipment 	
 Komatsu said sales in its core construction machinery
division rose by more than a third in China in the past business
year  which ended on March 31  It also enjoyed gains in Europe
and North America  with sales up 34 percent and 26 percent
respectively 	
 Komatsu said quake related factors depressed its operating
profit by 7 billion yen in the past financial year  	
 It said the factories it shut after the quake were back up
and running normally and that it had enough inventory of parts
to get through the April June quarter  Whether semiconductor
output returns to normal is seen as a potential risk after June 	
  Semiconductors will be a key factor  But we don t see it as
a big risk as long as chipmakers are able to achieve a recovery
in production according to their present plans   Fujitsuka said 	
 Prior to the announcement  shares of Komatsu rose 0 6
percent to 2 762 yen  against the Nikkei s 1 4 percent gain

 BOSTON  April 29  Reuters    Caterpillar Inc is
expected to report a quarterly profit on Friday that more than

more money after saving it up during the recession 	
 But after strong earnings reports from industrials ranging
from 3M Co to Komatsu Ltd   investors in the

pretty great results this year  	
 Investors have bid Caterpillar shares up about 56 percent

  Recasts  updates with New York closing copper price  adds graphic and
details 
 By Chris Kelly
 NEW YORK  April 29  Reuters    Copper fell to a six week low on Friday 
ignoring the often supportive influence of a weaker dollar  as technical
pressures mounted and U S  data offered further evidence of slowing economic
conditions 
 Copper s losses diverged from U S  industrial share prices  which were
buoyed by a fivefold increase in quarterly profits from heavy machinery
manufacturer Caterpillar Inc 
 Instead  prices crumbled under a negative price chart picture after the
front month May contract  broke down below key trendline support around
 4 20 per lb 
  The charts do look weak     I think that the complexion is definitely for
a weaker tone given that it is an industrial metal that is performing poor in a
scenario where most industrial components are doing well   said Scott Meyers 
senior trading analyst with Pioneer Futures in New York 
 The most active July COMEX copper contract slumped to a session low of
 4 1580 per lb  its lowest level since March 15  before ending the day at
 4 1790  down 8 25 cents from Thursday s close 
 It was the second consecutive monthly loss for the metal as concerns about
rising inflation and further rounds of interest rate hikes in Asia  Europe and
Latin America underscored perceptions of lower demand for raw materials at the
start of the year 
 Copper was down overnight after data showed inflation pressures on the rise
in the euro zone  upping the chances of an interest rate increase in June 
 But losses kicked into high gear after U S  data showed factory activity in
the country s Midwest slowed this month  as tepid demand in the first quarter
left businesses with less of a need to rebuild inventories 
  The Chicago PMI was another one in a string of numbers that have been
disappointing   said Sterling Smith  an analyst for Country Hedging Inc in St 
Paul  Minnesota 
  It s showing that growth is slowing greatly  if not coming to a complete
stop   he explained 
 SHANGHAI SURPLUS
 Copper inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell for the sixth week to their lowest level since mid February 
 Despite the steady fall of stocks in surveyed warehouses  Standard
Chartered bank warned that China s copper inventories in bonded warehouses were
still on the rise in April 
 Stocks in Shanghai s bonded warehouses were hovering at around 650 000
tonnes  equivalent to roughly four weeks of China s domestic use and higher
than the 200 000 tonne average over the past three years 
  What is worrying for bulls is that the majority of these copper stocks are
tied to finance deals  meaning either that they were bought for the purpose of
collecting bank loans  or they were unable to find immediate buyers   the bank
said in a report led by analyst Judy Zhu 
  Either would indicate that there is no real demand backing these stocks 
hence  we believe a surplus of the metal in China is imminent  
 The London Metal Exchange  LME  copper three month delivery contract was
closed Friday for Britain s royal wedding  and will remain shut on Monday for a
public holiday  Shanghai will also be shut on Monday

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  May 17  Reuters    World stocks fell to a
one month low on Tuesday on Europe s debt crisis and data that
spurred new doubts about the global economic recovery  while a
late pick up in the euro brought commodities off early lows 
 The single currency rose against the U S  dollar in choppy
trade  but was seen still vulnerable to global risk aversion
and the possibility that Greece might restructure its debt 
 The euro gained 0 55 percent to  1 4233  helping lift oil 
copper and gold prices off their lows 
 U S  housing starts and building permits plunged in April
and factory output declined for the first time in 10 months as
Japan s earthquake interrupted the supply of parts to auto
makers 
 The weak data weighed on U S  stocks on concerns the
recovery is taking longer than expected  Shares of industrial
powerhouse Caterpillar Inc  dropped 3 8 percent  while a
disappointing outlook from Hewlett Packard Co  also took
a toll on Wall Street 
  Today s market largely reflects the intensifying concerns
that the global economy is slowing or worse   said Hugh
Johnson  chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC
in Albany  New York 
  Leading indicators for the economy are starting to give
ground and all of that is bothering investors  
 The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 68 79
points  or 0 55 percent  to 12 479 58  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  dipped 0 49 point  or 0 04 percent  to
1 328 98  The Nasdaq Composite Index  edged up 0 9

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top European shares
closed down 1 percent at 1 126 94  the lowest close since April
19  as disappointing economic numbers hurt sentiment 
 German investor sentiment fell more than expected in May 
indicating surging growth in Europe s largest economy could
ease over the course of the year  In the UK  annual inflation
hit a 2 1 2 year high in April 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI  dropped
0 5 percent  off for a fifth day for a near 3 percent slide 
 However  U S  dollar denominated Nikkei futures  rose
0 2 percent as the dollar rose 0 6 percent against the yen
 
 Investors face the end of the U S  Federal Reserve s  600

meeting  Jean Claude Juncker  chairman of the 17 country
Eurogroup  said there was a need to move toward what he called
a  soft restructuring  of Greek debt 
  We re going to hear a lot of back and forth as to what
politicians and other European officials think  and it would be
hard for the euro to find a clear direction   said Mark
McCormick  currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York 
 The euro was last up 0 6 percent at  1 4235   a
day after hitting a seven week low of around  1 4048 on trading
platform EBS  Some traders said as long as the euro stayed
below its 55 day average of  1 4280  it was vulnerable to a
test of recent lows

 NEW YORK  May 25  Reuters    U S  and European stocks rose

distillates  igniting concerns about supply 
 In Europe  banking shares led gains  but the problems in
Greece and other debt laden European countries cast a long
shadow over markets 
  The focus right now is on whether Greece will follow
through on agreed upon austerity measures amidst widespread
local dissent   said Michael Woolfolk  senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York 
  The growing consensus of an eventual technical default by
Greece is contributing to uncertainty  which is increasingly
undermining the euro   he added

 Analysts still expect the euro to fall below key support
around  1 40 in the next few days  which would open the door to

massive debts  to have difficulty implementing more austerity
measures as the government s main opposition party opposes such
a move   ID nLDE74O0PW

CAT,2011-10-31,The Devil Is In the DetailsIt was a week that saw German Chancellor Angela Merkel gaining acceptance in the Bundestag to lever up the European Financial Stability Facility  EFSF   or rescue fund  then all night negotiations on a plan to finally bail out Greece  increase the firepower of the 440bn euro EFSF  and a plan to recapitalize Europe s banks  It was also a week when  aside from a stupendous global rally in stocks  French President Nicolas Sarkozy admitted the obvious  It was a mistake to admit Greece into the eurozone in the first place back in 2001  It was an error because Greece entered with false  economic  figures it was not ready   he said  Asked then if he had confidence Greece can emerge from the crisis  Sarkozy opined   Yes we have no other choice  We had to face up to all this  If the euro had exploded last night  all of Europe would have exploded If Greece had defaulted  there would have been a domino effect carrying everyone away We took important decisions yesterday that avoided catastrophe   It turns out that in terms of an outline  virtually everything I have been writing all this year in particular has come to pass  the needed plans to recapitalize the banks  reduce Greece s debt  and the creation of a firewall around Italy and Spain  at least thus far in theory  Improving Europe s governance  a highly explosive issue still to come in future EU summits  threatens members  sovereignty  Greece itself is the first victim as a set of advisers from the troika  International Monetary Fund  European Central Bank and European Commission  will be riding herd on Greece to ensure it meets its austerity objectives  The debates regarding other nations  and the ever increasing power of Germany  promise to be titanic On the element of the Greek  haircut   not only is the reduction in Greece s debt dependent on current bondholders buying in  but the actual bond swap has not even begun to be negotiated  Details  details Plus  the recapitalization of the banks is not only at an amount far less than most thought was needed  but there are a myriad of issues behind the actual implementation  As I wrote a few weeks ago  the banks are to first look to raise capital internally  like through asset sales   then through private sector investors if the first step isn t enough  then to their national governments and finally   as a last resort   to the EFSF But recall  France  which doesn t want to lose its AAA credit rating  is still hoping to eliminate the step where the banks go to their government  It s unclear just what will happen after this week s EU actions  though it seems inevitable France will indeed lose the AAA rating regardless because of perceived future liabilities and that creates a whole new set of issues for the EFSF  Most agree that investors aren t going to line up to put their money into a French bank  such as BNP Paribas or SocGen  and thus the government will need to bail them out with taxpayers  money Then you have the European Banking Authority saying the banks can t curtail business lending  but the EBA will ride herd on them to withhold dividends and bonuses to raise capital if the banks can t raise it per the above  The whole issue of raising capital by June 2012  as mandated  of course means that business lending will be curtailed  so Europe s small  and medium sized businesses in particular face even more of a credit squeeze than they are already experiencing today  Yet it s growth that the eurozone needs more than ever and fast As to ring fencing Italy and Spain  especially the former  again  the devil is in the details of the EFSF  as European officials hope that China  Japan and others come to the rescue  either through the stability facility or the IMF  which would then save the day  It s about guarantees of all sorts with no one as yet understanding how they would work When it comes to Italy and its  1 9 trillion sovereign debt  ergo  too big to fail  it s about a totally dysfunctional government that is literally coming to blows in parliament over hiking the retirement age to 67 by 2026  While Spain announced this week that unemployment there is officially at 21 5 percent  this as the nation s banks keep ratcheting up the estimates for bad loans on the books because of the ongoing crash in the property market  Oh  and as for the goal of reducing Greece s debt to GDP ratio to 120 percent by 2020  This assumes  among other things  that their economy will be growing by 3 percent annually by 2016  even as the IMF says the country will contract by 5 5 percent this year and 2 5 percent in 2012 due to the crippling austerity measures So now it s on to the G20 Summit in Cannes this coming Nov  3 4  Further bombast and promises  while behind the scenes there will be more head scratching as to just how the grandiose objectives are met  At least the latest Euro program not only bought some time  but in the short run the idea of a systemic crisis and a run on a major bank would seem to be off the table  For how long is the big question For those who naively think the Euro crisis has now been solved  on Friday  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said  it wouldn t be over for at least a year   Various opinions on the Euro Fix  Editorial   Financial Times In typical European fashion  a summit deal which seemed out of reach at midnight last night was triumphantly unveiled at 4 a m  The deal does not  and was not intended to  have any effect on the core problems facing the eurozone  There is still an urgent need to restore growth to economies which are hamstrung by uncompetitive business sectors  and continuous fiscal tightening  Recession still looms  especially in the southern economies  What the deal is intended to provide is adequate medium term financing for sovereigns and banks which have been facing urgent liquidity problems  On that  it is notable that the summit has not really raised any new money  apart from an increase in the private sector s write down of Greek debt by some 80 billion euro  All of the remaining  new  money  including 106bn euro to recapitalize the banks and over 800bn to be added to the firepower of the EFSF through leverage  has yet to be raised from the private sector  from sovereign lenders outside the eurozone  and conceivably from the ECB  There is no guarantee that this can be done  The eventual out turn of this summit will depend on whether this missing 1 000bn euro can actually be raised  Editorial   Wall Street Journal  Europe s  piecemeal approach is not going to cohere into a real or lasting solution if policy makers continue to ignore the underlying economic anemia that has afflicted the economies of Europe for decades  The patient has risen from his bed and not fallen down  This is one definition of progress  Thursday s deal offers the sort of grab bag familiar in Brussels  Greece gets another package of bailout loans  totaling 130bn euro in value  Various parts of the EU s bailout machinery will be tweaked or boosted  But let s climb across the deal plank by thin plank  The biggest accomplishment is the agreement to impose a voluntary 50 percent write down on private holdings of Greek debt  This is progress for a Continent that dared not to breathe the word haircut only months ago  But that s small consolation now that the European Central Bank  the International Monetary Fund and eurozone governments hold about 40 percent of all Greek debt  a figure that will only grow as privately held bonds mature  As long as these institutions refuse to take haircuts on their own Greek holdings  a private sector haircut can only go so far toward reducing total debt   To prevent the write down from tanking European banks  the deal provides for a raft of measures for bank recapitalization  One requires eurozone banks to achieve a 9 percent capital ratio for core Tier 1 capital by June 2012  Whether these new capital requirements will do much good remains to be seen  Still fresh in most memories is that Franco Belgian lender Dexia fully met its own Tier 1 requirements before it went down earlier this month   That brings us to the summit s last plank  an agreement to pump up the 440bn European Financial Stability Facility  Details of course will be negotiated later  but the bailout fund is now authorized to act as a bond insurer  guaranteeing first losses up to an as yet undecided amount on new issuance of euro zone sovereign debt  The legal basis for this is dubious under the Rome Treaty  which explicitly forbids member states from guaranteeing each others  debt  In short  everyone is bailing out everyone  The larger problem betrayed by yesterday s agreement is that European leaders continue to act as if they are mainly dealing with a crisis of confidence  which can be restored with evermore far reaching bailout schemes  Absent from this week s communiqu s are any new ideas for promoting the structural economic reforms   both at the periphery and at the center of the eurozone   that might create real confidence in the eurozone s long term economic prospects  Wolfgang Munchau   Financial Times On the goal of bringing Greece s debt to GDP ratio down to 120 percent by 2020  The European Union has been consistently wrong in its economic forecasts for Greece  They misjudged the impact of austerity on economic growth and public sector deficits  This misjudgment is the reason why the voluntary bank haircut of 21 percent  agreed to in July  has now grown to 50 percent  What happens if the outlook were to deteriorate further  There is no sign yet of a turnaround   In the unlikely event that the banks come up with the money  and that Greece manages to hit a 120 percent debt to GDP level in 2020  it is far from clear that Greece can return to the capital markets even then   On the EFSF  the leaders reached political agreement to leverage it up to about 1 000bn  Herman van Rompuy  the president of the European Council  made a revealing comment following the meeting when he said that banks have been doing this forever  Why should governments not do so as well  The reason is simple  Banks can only do this because central banks and governments act as ultimate guarantors of the financial system  There exists an implicit insurance of unlimited liability  In the case of the European Financial Stability Facility the very opposite is the case  there is an explicit insurance of limited liability  Germany wants its exposure capped to a maximum of 210bn  I doubt that global investors will rush into the tranches of the special purpose vehicle through which the eurozone wants to leverage the EFSF  I struggle to see how this structure can lead to a significant and sustained fall in bond spreads  Leveraging can work  but only if the eurozone were willing to provide an unlimited backstop  Robert Samuelson   Washington Post There s an Orwellian quality to Europe s latest financial rescue  Words lose their ordinary meaning  Greece  for example  has clearly defaulted  but no one says so  In July  private lenders agreed  voluntarily  to accept an estimated 21 percent reduction in their loans to Greece  Now that s been pushed to 50 percent  and private lenders  consent is still described as  voluntary   Well  it s about as  voluntary as when one hands over one s wallet in response to the choice of   Your money or your life    notes Douglas Elliott of the Brookings Institution  What constitutes a default  Here is Standard   Poor s definition   We generally define a sovereign default as the failure to meet  the  interest or principal payments   contained in the original terms of the rated obligation   Not much doubt there  A 50 percent  haircut  wasn t part of the original bonds  But for political and legal reasons  it s inconvenient to declare a default  Instead  the Europeans call the write down  private sector involvement   or PSI  How reassuring   Ed  On Friday  Fitch Ratings issued a statement   The 50 percent nominal haircut on the proposed bond exchange would be viewed by the agency as a default event under the Distressed Debt Exchange criteria   The International Swaps and Derivatives Association  whose market decisions are binding  hasn t ruled on this yet  Mohamed El Erian   PIMCO  The  feel good factor will only last if this is followed quickly by two other important developments  First  and most immediate  there is a long list of details that must be specified over the next few weeks to put into practice what was agreed to in Brussels  Many of these are technically very complex  Indeed  implementation may prove as tricky as the original negotiations  if not more so  How will the reduction of Greek debt actually be executed  Will the banks that need capital be able to find sufficient private funds to meet the new prudential targets  In the event that they do not  what conditions should be attached to the financing coming from taxpayers  How will the European Financial Stability Facility be levered  How will its funds be allocated among competing claims  including between stabilizing the old stock of debt and providing partial risk insurance for new issuance  And what roles will the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund play  as well as other countries  Second Europe desperately needs an effective plan to boost employment and promote inclusive economic growth  Without this  it will be virtually impossible to stabilize the region s sovereign debt markets  and counter fragilities in its banking system   Politicians also need to decide how they will strengthen the institutional underpinnings of the eurozone  Editorial   The Economist You can understand the self congratulation  In the early hours of October 27th  after marathon talks  the leaders of the eurozone agreed on a  comprehensive package  to dispel the crisis that has been plaguing the eurozone for almost two years  They boosted a fund designed to shore up the eurozone s troubled sovereign borrowers  drafted a plan to restore Europe s banks  radically cut Greece s burden of debt  and set out some ways to put the governance of the euro on a proper footing  After a summer overshadowed by the threat of financial collapse  they had shown the markets who was boss  Yet in the light of day  the holes in the rescue plan are plain to see  The scheme is confused and unconvincing  Confused  because its financial engineering is too clever by half and vulnerable to unintended consequences  Unconvincing  because too many details are missing and the scheme at its core is not up to the job of safeguarding the euro  This is the eurozone s third comprehensive package this year  It is unlikely to be its last  Washington and Wall StreetStocks rocketed higher on Thursday thanks to a combination of the seemingly good news out of Europe  coupled with a report showing the U S  economy grew at a 2 5  rate in the third quarter  This isn t enough to put a dent in the unemployment rate  but it s better than the 0 4  and 1 3  rates of the first two quarters this year and puts to bed  at least until next year  talk of a double dip recession as classically defined  The figures though are pretty much irrelevant unless jobs are being created  It s going to feel like a recession to many of us The reason the economy grew at such a clip  though  was due to increased consumer spending  even as real disposable income declined  So we dipped into our savings some and the savings rate fell  This trend won t continue  though I m guessing the Christmas season is a little better than expected  The brakes will come back on early next year  which is about when Europe could once again be a screaming issue  not that it won t remain on the front page the balance of 2011  Italy  for example  has to roll over  400 billion in debt in 2012 Just one other item on spending  Friday s reading of personal income and consumption for September confirmed the GDP report s findings  Personal income was up 0 1  for the month  while consumption rose 0 6   Earlier in the week the government did report durable goods  big ticket items  were up a solid 1 7  in September  ex  the volatile transportation sector On the earnings front  while over 70  of those reporting are beating expectations  this is a vastly overrated barometer these days with companies doing their best to tamp down expectations in order to more often than not pleasantly surprise  the better for one s share price More important is the guidance and the accompanying statements on the outlook for business and on this  the last two weeks have shown a Corporate America that is decidedly mixed when looking at the next 6 12 months  as in many  such as Cummins Engine and 3M remain exceedingly cautious on the global picture  while others such as Caterpillar are optimistic As for the bipartisan  supercommittee  that is supposed to come up with something heroic  like budget savings of  3 trillion that could begin to put a real dent in the federal deficit  as well as restore a huge amount of confidence to the business community  rather than the minimum  1 2 trillion they are charged with finding by Nov  23  you can basically forget about our elected officials playing profiles in courage  It s the same game playing  Democrats don t want to do anything significant with entitlements  and Republicans refuse to discuss revenue increases from personal or corporate taxes Lastly  a bit on China  which played no small part in the week s equity rally  HSBC s flash report on the manufacturing sector  the PMI  rose to 51 1 in October from September s final reading of 49 9  50 0 being the dividing line between contraction and expansion  With this one figure talk of a  hard landing  fell by the wayside  I have been steadfast in saying China would see a soft landing  but it s a little too soon to declare victory on this one  If China s GDP were to stay above 8 5  or so the next few quarters  though  it would be a huge boost to global confidence  It was also helpful this week to have Premier Wen Jiabao strongly hint that the government s tightening policy is over and that it may be ready to relax credit controls to ensure employment growth   I m also going to learn a lot about the country s economy with the coming earnings release of my large holding in Fujian province  sometime in the next two weeks  ,Brian Trumbore,0.092,0.788,0.12,0.9983

CAT,2012-01-09,My Bespoke Roundtable Answers For the last few years I have participated in two different  year ahead  preview articles    one for The Bespoke Investment Group and one for Seeking Alpha   These are both excellent resources    each valuable because of the specific approach taken  Last week I suggested that readers join me in  of the Bespoke panel   If you have not done so  it is still an excellent and timely idea  I know that many readers do not click through to the links   With this in mind  I am repeating the text of my responses here at  A Dash   These reflect my current thinking on many issues covered recently in other articles  and will be the basis for continuing work  For your convenience Below is the full 2012 Bespoke Roundtable Q A with Jeff Miller of     1  Looking back on 2011  what were your best and worst calls    Thanks again for inviting me to participate   The questions are excellent  so I always learn something just by formulating my own answers   You also have a great roster of participants  and I learn from their wisdom   I know from the comments that readers of my blog also appreciate the work you do in producing this Roundtable    Turning to my own results  my best calls were sticking with Apple  trading drilling stocks in a timely fashion  and accurately predicting earnings on most of my holdings    My worst calls were in the medical device area  where earnings remain solid  but fear of policy changes is overwhelming   Even though I was underweight financial stocks  the correct weighting would have been zero    Overall  my worst prediction was that the market would gradually accept the evidence of better earnings and an improving economy   I was right on the facts  but wrong on the reaction    2  What surprised you the most about financial markets in 2011    I was most surprised about the persistence of highly correlated trading based on the headline of the day   We all know that this will eventually end  and I expected that to happen last year   The risk on  risk off  simplification underscores the irrelevance of most actual data    One lesson for us was the increased emphasis on yield   It caused us to develop a new program for yield oriented investors   By combining solid dividends with covered calls  we created a strong  income oriented investment program    3  The S P 500 hit its bull market highs in April 2011   Which will happen first   Will we first take out the April highs or have we entered a new bear market  a decline of 20  from the highs     We almost had the decline already   In October we were down 19 4  on an intra day basis   Right now it is a good question since we are about 9  off of the highs   I expect us to take out the highs in the first half of 2012    4  Depending on your answer to question 3  how long do you expect the bull or bear to last     At least through 2012   The biggest concerns come from things that most people are not already worrying about   Everyone is closely monitoring the economy and Europe  for example   North Korea is a wild card   Middle East tension and concern over nuclear weapons in Iran could generate a spike in oil prices    To summarize  some shock to the economy is the biggest worry in 2012   Barring that  a bull market will end when Fed policy sends interest rates significantly higher  probably not until 2013 at least    5  How should an investor with average risk tolerance be positioned for the year ahead    I appreciate the careful wording of your question   Most investors are freaking out  over reacting to headlines   The big market swings induce plenty of fear    If you think  incorrectly in my opinion  that your upside in stocks is only 8  for the year  why deal with a market that often moves 2 3  in a day    Most investors are not honest with themselves about risk   Even in a good market year it is typical to have a 15  drawdown at some point    In my approach the first and most important question for the investor is not what they hope to gain  but what level of risk is appropriate    With this in mind  positions should be about 30  smaller than normal because of the current risk level   I use the St  Louis Financial Stress Index as an objective means of determining actual risk   It is not a forecast of the stock market   My research found that a level of 1 1 in this index was the start of a trigger range   This level was briefly exceeded a couple of months ago   The index has pulled back into the  8 range  but not enough to give an  all clear     6  How do you see the European sovereign debt crisis playing out in 2012    This is the biggest current issue and the best source for profit by getting it right   There is an overwhelming consensus that this is an inevitable disaster   Merely questioning this and raising alternative possibilities leads to a chorus of people questioning your sanity    This is a very crowded trade  short the euro  long bonds  long puts  short US financials  100  out of the stock market for investors  and short for many hedge funds    I have a resource page linking to more detailed coverage     so this is just a summary of conclusions   Check out the link to see the argument    There will be a problem with European sovereign debt for a long time  a period measured in years   Merkel has said that it is a marathon   The market is treating it as a sprint    At a dinner in October I surprised some blogging colleagues when I told them that we would no longer be worried about this issue in eight months  June or July   Today s news reports that Mark Mobius just said something similar    What is taking place is a process of negotiation and compromise that will gradually involve many different programs and participants   The final result will be a combination of bailouts  leverage  ECB bond buying  investments from sovereign wealth funds and China  austerity  economic growth  and maybe even the departure of one or more eurozone members    Not one of these things  but all of them   Democratic governments move slowly  trying to figure out what works   They will do more of what is working and less of what does not   The partial moves  disparaged as  kicking the can  by the average talking head  actually provide some useful time    There will be no trumpet sound ringing when it is over  just as there is no gong sounding right now   The Europe story will gradually fade  and people will notice that it no longer dominates the news      7  How bullish or bearish are you on the following markets  The US  Europe  Developed Asia  China  Emerging Markets    There are many good investments  but the US has an advantage on a risk adjusted basis   I own many stocks with substantial global exposure   I like China better than the general emerging market theme    8  What do you believe is the contrarian call on equities right now    My measure of sentiment is the P E multiple on forward earnings  especially as compared to interest rates or inflation expectations   This tells you what those with assets are really doing as opposed to what they are saying    By that metric  sentiment is more negative than it was at the 2009 bottom    9  How confident are you that US companies can live up to current consensus earnings expectations    I have a contrarian take on earnings forecasts  I find them to be of some value   No one else does   I share the popular skepticism about  buy  and  hold  ratings  but I find the earnings forecasts to be helpful    Most observers will tell you that earnings estimates are too optimistic   The same people will tell you that the bar is too low at the time companies report   Well you cannot have it both ways   If these statements are both true  then at some point in time  earnings forecasts must have been reasonably accurate   My research shows that the one year forecast period is very good  incorrect only when there is a recession        I actually prefer that analysts do not try to be amateur economists and include recessions in the forecast   I can handle that myself    With this background in mind  I think that the consensus expectations for 2012 are quite reasonable   And yes  I know that profit margins are high and will revert to the mean   This will happen as labor markets tighten  new businesses form  and the economy improves    10  Are US stocks cheap right now based on the valuation methods you rely on most   Will multiples expand or contract in 2012       Stocks are extremely cheap based upon earnings expectations and the potential return from other investments   This approach to valuation is only a general guide  as experienced observers understand   Whenever there is intense skepticism about the economy  something that has been the prevalent state since the 2004 election campaign  there is a consensus that earnings estimates are too high    I have frequently invited readers to lead me to any source that has done better at forecasting earnings than the consensus methods   The most popular alternatives are backward looking methods  embraced by the bearish punditry   Since no single stock trades on the historical earnings record  we breathlessly await each new announcement  I wonder why people think that the sum of the parts is more meaningful than the whole    This leads me to the question of multiple expansion  my worst prediction from last year   I have actually done some research on this question  discovering a curvilinear relationship between interest rates and the stock earnings rate  the inverse of the P E multiple    In general  the two move together  higher interest rates lead to a lower stock multiple    The exception occurs when interest rates are exceedingly low  indicating fears of deflation   In those cases no one really believes the earnings forecasts and the result is multiple compression    Last year I was wrong because  like almost everyone else  I expected interest rates to rise   Instead  the fear and skepticism intensified   The result is like a coiled spring   At some point interest rates will move higher   When that happens  at least until the ten year note gets to the 4  level or so  the stock multiples will also increase       If the Europe story fades  2012 could be a very big year for stocks    11  Describe some of your favorite market indicators and what they are signaling for stocks in 2012    N A     12  What are your favorite and least favorite sectors for the year ahead     Since I have confidence in an improving economy  I like cyclical stocks and technology   I also think that energy can work well   The health sector is in limbo due to politics  but there will be an opportunity at some point during 2012    13  What is your outlook for Financials    Since I expect the European concern to diminish  this is probably the area for the greatest payoff during 2012   Having said this  financials may not be the winners in the first half of the year   No one believes the earnings forecasts or assurances about the lack of European exposure  so this is the most hated sector    14  What is in store for the US economy in 2012    There is a sharp divide in the approach to recession forecasting   The ECRI has made an aggressive forecast of an inevitable recession   At first they provided no time frame  but now they have narrowed it to the next six months   They went to a 100  probability without any real notice    The problem is that their methods are secret   My review of several other sources  which I started long before the ECRI call  shows that most disagree   Many of these sources have been just as good with real time forecasts  but less publicized    None of them has a recession forecast higher than 25    The mainstream economic forecast is for growth higher than 2 5     To summarize  my base case is continuing modest growth  improving from 2011    15  Economic indicators as a whole came in better than expected in the fourth quarter   Do you expect this trend to continue in the first part of 2012    Yes   There was improvement early in the year   There was an external shock from the earthquake and tsunami  as well as problems in the Middle East and higher fuel prices   You could interpret that slowdown as the result of temporary factors  or the onset of a recession    The pseudo crisis around the debt ceiling led to another economic threat   Through all of this  the base case from many indicators that I watch has been economic growth of about 2 to 2 5    This is now looking a bit stronger    16  What is your take on the employment picture in the US   Will we see the unemployment rate get below 8  by Election Day    If current economic trends continue  net job creation will improve quite a bit  taking unemployment below 8  by Election Day   The controversy over labor force participation will rage on   There is no question that some baby boomers are leaving the labor force early and also that many people are under employed   We also will have returning soldiers   I cover employment pretty extensively  including aspects generally missed in the mainstream coverage        17  Are Ben Bernanke and the Fed helping or hurting the recovery    The Fed is an easy target for politicians and pundits   I am interested in investments  making money no matter who is in power    Bernanke is a Republican  reappointed by a Democrat   He has done good service  unappreciated by many   It is interesting to note that Fed critics are of two camps     Those who think they should have done less  the crash and burn group  Those who think they should have done more  the activist wing   The two wings agree on one thing  The Fed is wrong    18  The Fed s Zero Interest Rate Policy  ZIRP  has really hurt savers and anyone out there looking for yield   Where should investors go to find yield right now    I understand that the question talks about the effect of ZIRP rather than the reasons  but we should all be clear about that   The Fed had a dual mandate   inflation and employment   They do not have a mandate to provide a guaranteed income for savers   Those making this argument typically have an intense political agenda  one that is hazardous to your investment health    I have written a series of articles on  The Quest for Yield    It was one of the most popular series on Seeking Alpha and also on my blog   It reflects the great interest in the topic    My conclusion is that it is possible to get an excellent income stream  10  or so after fees  from a combination of buying strong yield stocks and writing call options against the positions   It takes a lot of work  but it is worth it    My idea of a strong yield stock is not just a mechanical search for the highest yield   I would rather have a 3  yield from a company that will maintain the dividend and also the stock price over five years   Selling calls against these positions is very profitable right now     19  The housing market continues to struggle   Are we close to making another bottom in residential real estate   Are there specific areas of the country that you are more bullish or bearish on    N A   20  Will the Dollar  US Dollar Index  be up or down in 2012 and why   Are there any other currencies that you have a strong opinion on   How much trouble is the Euro in    There is a fundamental relationship that investors should understand   As long as the US has a negative trade balance  the dollar must move lower    21  Gold has underperformed stocks in recent months   Will this continue in 2012   Will gold see gains in 2012     I do not know how to value gold or gold stocks on a fundamental basis   The price is a function of two wildly disparate fears  hyperinflation and worldwide economic collapse   Both of these concepts are easy to sell to a gullible public and the profit margins are high    Since I have no pressing fear of either inflation or disaster  I am not currently a gold enthusiast   I want to emphasize that I am open minded and have often included precious metals in my portfolios   I just do not think that this is the time     22  The ratio of platinum to gold is currently at its lowest level ever  platinum is actually cheaper than gold right now    Is platinum a good buy relative to gold    N A   23  Where is the price of oil headed   How about the spread between Brent Crude and West Texas    The general trend of energy prices is higher   In China we have 25 million drivers and a billion to go   The headline risk is also for higher prices   This is only a matter of time    There is already arbitrage activity between Brent and WTI  so the gap will close     24  What are your predictions for the 2012 election   Which party will win the Presidency  the House and the Senate   Who will become the GOP nominee  and what are the chances that nominee will beat President Obama    As a former poli sci public policy prof  and a student at the top school for election analysis  this is right up my alley   Despite this background  I think it is too close to call   My guess at the moment is that Obama will win  mostly because the economy is improving and there is no strong opponent   My further guess is that Romney will get the nomination  beating out a weak field   It is still very early    I suspect that we face at least two more years of divided government  with the GOP keeping control of the House    That is interesting   What do you mean by weak field    Many of the candidates have solid traditional credentials  but they all come with some electoral  baggage    The GOP establishment has struggled to find their candidate   The primary process is really not ideal for finding either the most qualified candidates or the most electable   At the moment  no one seems to combine the themes that resonate with the right personal charisma and traditional values    25  How will the elections impact the stock market in 2012 and beyond    This is a really great question  but it is too soon to answer   I can do better when the GOP candidate is known    26  Will the US Supreme Court rule that ObamaCare is unconstitutional    No one really knows the answer to this excellent question   If the ruling goes with the established political lines  the answer will be  yes    There are challenges to two justices already  suggesting that they should recuse themselves from the decision because of conflicts   The key question  whether people can be required to buy insurance  has many analogies and is quite thorny    A good question for investors would be how to find stocks that will benefit from clarification  regardless of the decision   That is a current research topic for my team    27  How do you see the US tackling its debt problems in the years ahead    The Simpson Bowles approach is sound   There must be a sacrifice on entitlements and also an increase in tax revenue   People get the government they vote for   In 2010 the country voted for divided government with an aggressive minority opinion that could block most compromises   We are now seeing the results of that decision and a general lack of leadership    The most difficult problems can best be solved right after an election  a time when we can hope for a brief spurt of bipartisanship   Unfortunately  we seem to be in a perpetual election mode    28  What are the biggest threats to the global financial system right now  and are they avoidable    N A   29  Hedge funds as a whole underperformed the S P 500 in 2011   How will hedge funds perform in 2012   What is your take on the hedge fund model in general    N A   30  Will the following be up or down  positive or negative  in 2012   Where noted  what are your 2012 year end price targets   The price targets are meant to obtain a wisdom of crowds consensus number from all Roundtable participants     S P 500  up or down and year end price target  Up  say 1450   Long Term US Treasuries  up or down  Price Up  Yields Down  3 2   Corporate Bonds  up or down  The yield spread with Treasuries will get tighter  but the overall yield will move higher   Junk Bonds  up or down  Perhaps not much change  Higher overall yield and less risk   Gold  up or down and year end price target  No opinion   Oil  up or down and year end price target  Up about 20    The underlying trend is positive and the risks are all to the upside   Dollar  up or down  As long as the US has a trade deficit  the dollar trend will be lower   Average US Home Prices  up or down  There are recent signs of bottoming   We need to see improvement on employment for a real change here   GDP would be better if we just stopped the decline   China s stock market  up or down  No opinion    31  Please provide readers with any stocks that you really like right now for 2012 and beyond    I look first for themes  next for sectors  and finally for stocks   I like a number of big cap stocks as cyclical and tech plays  including Caterpillar  CAT   Intel  INTC   and Microsoft  MSFT    There are other similar names   I like energy stocks including Diamond Offshore  DO  and Chevron  CVX    I expect financial stocks to rebound so JP Morgan  JPM  is a leading candidate    I think that housing and health stocks will be winners  but it may be a bit early for these names    32  Where is Apple headed as both a company and a stock   How about Google    I love Apple  and I have held the stock for many years   I do not think that the markets for their products have maxed out   The stock is cheap on an earnings basis  especially allowing for the cash and liquid assets   It is a stock that I buy for new clients on day one    I understand that Google has had some similar growth metrics  but it has never qualified on my criteria    33  Facebook is expected to IPO in 2012   Would you be a buyer or seller of the stock at its opening price on the day it goes public   How long would you hold it    None of the recent IPOs have been attractive for the open market buyer   It just seems like many people need gains and are trying to hit a home run   They are also substituting familiarity with the product for knowledge about value    34  Which technologies are you currently the most bullish or bearish on   Are any of them game changers like the PC or the Internet were    N A   35  What are the website  magazines  newspapers  books  apps that you use the most and would recommend others to use    This is another good question   I read many sources  including the work of my colleagues in this Roundtable   It is difficult to answer without leaving out something important   Most people do not have the time or opportunity to follow as many information sources    I have a list of favored sources on the blog   My weekly column  Weighing the Week Ahead  has many citations every week  highlighting the sources that I find most useful    I religiously read Abnormal Returns as the principal gateway to news  Bespoke Investment Group for top notch research and charts  Charles Kirk for both links and a trader perspective  and Calculated Risk for comprehensive coverage of economic news   But these are just my starting points     36  What are your favorite Twitter feeds     This is difficult to narrow down  since I follow different feeds for different reasons   Since I make my own market decisions  I do not rely much on those calling for short term market moves   I follow many political commentators  mostly as general background   Simply put  I know which feeds to monitor for the topic of the moment You can see who I follow by checking out    For a favorite non market feed try  to get authoritative answers on NFL officiating and  for an irreverent  but liberal  take on politics   I am a bipartisan consumer of political humor    37  Do you have any other advice that you would like to share with readers as we enter 2012     It is important to be open minded about your investments  especially the global macro themes   We are in the political silly season  where many people have strong motivations behind their economic arguments   Most of those making comments are not trying to help your investments   I recommend that you join me in being politically agnostic  willing to make strong investment returns no matter who is in power    I also keep an open mind   While I think that I can make the best returns for those willing to be aggressive  my main focus is on risk    Most investors want to be cautious   The downside is more important to them than gains   They want to sleep at night   I respect this and have created enhanced income programs that will suit these investors ,Jeff Miller,0.095,0.768,0.137,0.9996
CAT,2012-01-17,For the last three years I have participated in a special interview series at Seeking Alpha   Editor Jonathan Liss comes up with questions that suit both the times and reader interest   I think that readers may find the discussion to be interesting  and may wish to add some comments or questions of their own  The interview was originally published  a few days ago  and the link to the series  with many fine contributions  is   Jeff Miller Positions For 2012  Biggest Mistake Investors Can Make Right Now Is Underweighting Stocks Seeking Alpha  SA   Jeff  how would you generally describe your investing style philosophy  Jeff Miller  JM   Hi Jonathan  Thanks for inviting me to participate again this year  The Seeking Alpha year end program brings out a nice range of expert opinion  You have sharp questions and a good format  I enjoy reading the interviews  and I am sure that many others do as well  Our investment style emphasizes active management  a focus on risk  and attention to each client  That has been especially challenging over the past year  Many people do not want to worry about 350 point swings in the Dow  They need yield with less volatility  The Fed policy has taken away those choices  so we need to be a little more creative  Rather than emphasizing a specific investment style  I interview each potential client and then create a blend of our five programs   something that meets the risk reward needs of each  With that background in mind  I would say that I am focused on data and objective indicators  I am resistant to hype and headlines  I am contrarian   finding opportunity where others see none  On a long term basis I am optimistic about the US  the economy  and stocks  On a short term basis I am cautious  SA  Within equities  are there any particular sectors or themes you are currently overweight or underweight  If so  why  JM  I am overweight technology and cyclical stocks  The economic indicators that have passed my stringent tests are more optimistic than the general sentiment  Many media commentaries still highlight people who  called 2008  no matter how early  At some point these pundits will be  one hit wonders  in the same way traders view Elaine Garzarelli and her forecast of the 1987 crash  Meanwhile  many of these sources have been dour and wrong since 2008  Economic growth has been modest  but it has been just fine for the profitability of the major industrial firms  The trend is favorable  I like Caterpillar  CAT  and Illinois Tool Works  ITW  among others  The technology play is excellent with economic expansion  but still works if economic growth proves to be more moderate  Many technology names are at historic low valuations on a P E basis  Why  The story has not worked recently  and investors are like jilted lovers  Microsoft  MSFT  is an obvious example  but I also like Intel  INTC   Oracle  ORCL   and Apple  AAPL   SA  Do you ever buy funds to gain access to asset classes or themes  or do you stick to single stocks exclusively  What are the advantages of your approach  JM  We do not use mutual funds  but we are very active in ETFs  Two of our five programs trade via ETFs  and we have a free weekly newsletter with ETF ratings  The trading method asks the following question  What ETF will be best over the next three weeks  We have two  experts  on this subject   Oscar and Felix  You can guess their risk reward outlook  We also have a Dynamic Asset Allocation approach  DAA   For this model we ask  What ETF will be the best over the next year  Please note that we do not have a holding period of three weeks in the first case nor 12 months in the second  Nonetheless  we ask these questions every day  This gives us 20 or so trades in DAA every year and many more for Felix and Oscar  Right now  the DAA approach is very conservative  By the nature of the method it will be slow in capturing a rebound  Essentially  it reduces volatility and gets you on the right side of big moves  Felix and Oscar were fully invested for the year end rally   This could easily change by the time of publication   To summarize  ETFs are a very important part of our trading and we have major positions for clients  It all depends on which of our programs is right for them  SA  Speaking of ETFs  which asset classes are you overweight  Which are you underweight  Why  JM  We have to start with the definition of an  asset class   There is a dangerous pitch out there  reflected in current advertising  The idea is that all of the traditional asset classes   stocks  bonds  and real estate   are over valued  The refuge first was gold  Now I see ads encouraging people to speculate in foreign exchange  Encouraging people to do active trading based upon their  market feel  is a prescription for disaster  My scientific  model driven approaches sometimes recommend oil and gold  but I do not have a good method to evaluate these choices on the fundamentals  The average investor should not confuse trading with investing  SA  Can you elaborate on what you mean by  scientific  model driven approaches  to allow readers a better understanding of what we re talking about here exactly  JM  Good question  I engage several model developers with different approaches  I test these carefully  You might think of it as my own version of a  stress test   The DAA model follows principles that have been accepted in the finance literature for decades  It is a yearly momentum model  but including some helpful tweaks  When it is applied to our universe we minimize the chance of excessive correlation  This method gets you on the right side of long term trends  In 2008  for example  the DAA approach would have led you first to gold and bonds and later to the inverse index ETFs  This cushioned the downside  but it would have been very slow in capturing the rebound  Felix combines momentum  a sense of the cycle  and the element of uncertainty  Felix does not call tops and bottoms  but he does get on the right side of fresh moves  If there is a big trend  Felix will participate  If the market is declining  Felix will get into the inverse ETFs     essentially going short  No system is perfect  and our methods do not call tops and bottoms  There is always a delay for recognition of a new trend  It depends on the time frame  SA  Name one investment that exceeded your expectations in 2011  and one you had high hopes for that didn t pan out  Do you see any particular investment surprising investors over the next year  JM  Our biggest winners were Apple and some of the energy and healthcare names  We are very good at forecasting economic and earnings fundamentals  but we do not try to time market sentiment  That was the wild card  Beginning with the Japanese earthquake  then moving to the silly debate over the debt limit  and finally fixating on the European saga  there has been a continuing reason to ignore data about what is actually taking place  This meant that the most important story of the year   fantastic earnings growth   has been given short shrift  While we had some nice winners  we expect much better next year  The negative side included two groups Anything in the financial sector was bad  Even though we were underweight and sticking to the top names  there was no correct time to buy  I still like JP Morgan  JPM   the best of the breed  U S  major financial   The market seems to think they have European exposure  despite explanations to the contrary  It is a favorite scare ploy to use nominal derivative totals instead of net  In the case of JPM  they also do not define  net  using different institutions  It is a  pure  version of determining net exposure  It is a favorite stock for a rebound this year The other negative was the medical device makers  I really got this one wrong   Our health insurance holdings did fine   We have chosen two device stocks  ResMed  RMD  and Stryker  SYK   that actually save money by reducing related costs  The earnings growth has been solid  Despite this  the stocks moved lower  The political uncertainty over ObamaCare has had a big impact SA  Some describe the current era as  The Great Deleveraging   Do you agree disagree  and does this macro consideration affect your investment planning process  JM  One of the worst things that happened in 2011 was the excessive focus on debt  The argument is seductive for most  We all try to equate government problems with our personal family experience  When the economy is bad  deficits rise  There is a  debate  about this in a highly charged political environment  I have simple advice for the average investor First  ignore the politics unless you are in the voting booth Second  understand that every macro economic model sees short term stimulus as favorable  Put aside your ideology  It is market friendly Third  every leader of whatever party has supported stimulus when they are in office If we get better economic performance  deficits will be lower  There will still be a structural deficit  But it will be more manageable  SA  2010 11 saw a notable rush for the exits from equities and equity vehicles  Is this a cyclical  or secular shift  What would it take to bring them back  JM  The individual investor will return to equities far too late   long after most of the obvious problems have been solved  That would be when the Dow is at 20K  possibly overvalued  and risk is high  The story has been repeated many times  Understanding this recurring phenomenon offers both the biggest reward and the biggest challenge for the average investor  I have tried to meet this challenge by providing a blend of programs that provides participation in the upside while limiting risk  It is not easy  SA  Do you believe gold is a genuine hedge in uncertain markets  If so  how much exposure to it or other precious metals do you have  If not  where are you turning for potential downside diversification  JM  Gold has a strange character  There is no way to determine a fundamental value  It is a safe haven in a time of disaster  deflation  depression  riots    and it will have value if there is hyperinflation  Our programs have invested in gold and gold miners during the past year  and probably will do so again next year  We have been out of gold for a month or so for all accounts  Since I expect neither disaster nor hyperinflation next year  I do not recommend gold for long term individual investors  It has been approved as a 5   or so  holding for many years   but not right now  Global markets SA  Global Macro considerations dominated the headlines in 2011  Do you see 2012 unfolding differently  If so  how  JM  This is definitely the key question  The selection of individual sectors and stocks has been secondary for three years  I expect the European story to be resolved in a few months  Meanwhile  if the US economy improves enough  that will also change the focus  SA  Will Eurozone contagion continue to drive the market s direction  and how are you protecting client assets from potential fallout there  JM  I ll go out on a limb  I think that by mid year in 2012 we will no longer have the Europe fixation  I have  explaining my reasoning  I think that the market reflects a high degree of pessimism  You can protect assets by reducing position sizes  which I have done  Buying puts is too expensive  You could do some more complicated put strategies  but something like a  put diagonal  is not suitable for most investors  SA  Do you buy into the argument that European equities are actually undervalued right now  JM  One of my pet peeves is people who answer questions when they basically do not know  I have an honest answer  While I study the European situation carefully  I am not considering specific stocks there  There are many US companies that are undervalued because of Europe  I can get plenty of octane with much less risk buying JPM and CAT  SA  How much exposure to emerging markets do you have both in terms of stocks and bonds  Are China  India or other major EMs better positioned to withstand a serious global economic downturn than the U S   JM  Most people are surprised to learn that the US has actually fared better in recent years  It is possible to get a solid amount of foreign exposure via big US firms like CAT  MSFT  and ORCL  a recent disappointment  but still a great growth story   SA  Let s move on to another potential event on investor minds  The Iran nuke situation and a potential Israeli  U S  or global attack  How serious would such an event be to oil prices and subsequently  the global economy exchanges  Is this something you re positioning for and if so  how  JM  Great question  This is one of the big wild cards for 2012  Most people are bearish on energy because it fits the pessimistic view of the world  Many energy companies are extremely cheap on a P E or cash flow basis  Owning some energy stocks will help if oil prices spike  I like Noble Energy  NE  among the drillers and Chevron  CVX  among the large integrated plays  There are many good choices in this sector  U S  Market SA  We are coming up on an election year  Will this be good or bad for markets  Are you positioning for different potential outcomes  JM  Elections  political events  and the impact on stocks really hit my sweet spot  As a former public policy professor at a top university  I have studied the political side for decades  Since 1987  I have been a player on the financial side  It is so tempting  I would love to make a prediction  but it is too soon  My team is working on a generic Obama portfolio as well as a generic GOP portfolio  I will expand on this as soon as we learn more  This is a typical area where people try to stake out positions too soon  with little information  SA  Is the U S  housing market still an issue  or not so much anymore  Will prices continue to fall  Do you have exposure to either REITs or residential real estate in client portfolios  JM  I have no position at the moment  although our short term models have been indicating good trades  three week horizon  in these sectors  When the time comes  this will be one of our major profit sources  I am willing to miss the first part of the rebound in favor of more certainty  Bonds Fixed Income SA  Where do you see Treasury yields in 12 months  Are Treasuries worth buying at current  low  yields  For clients requiring income  where have you been turning in this low yield environment  JM  This has been a great success story  but the end is near  I have two approaches for yield  First  for clients that only need to preserve wealth  Congratulations    I construct bond ladders  These include only investment grade bonds with a limit of seven years on maturity  If rates rise  we ll be able to take advantage  If you have already achieved what you need  keep risk at a minimum  For most clients I am using enhanced yield   a good dividend stock plus the sale of a call option  I do this with Abbot Labs  ABT   Johnson and Johnson  JNJ   as well as solid tech stocks like Intel  INTC  and Microsoft  MSFT   The combination of yield plus call premium is almost 10  per year after fees  This is working because of low stock prices and high volatility  It might not work in another year  but for the moment  let us take what the market is giving us  This is a great method as long as you pick stocks that will hold value and monitor them carefully  SA  What is the ideal asset allocation for someone with a long term horizon  greater than a decade  and no need to touch their investments  Can investors continue to rely on stocks after the  lost decade  we just experienced  JM  I appreciate your desire to quantify this  but I am struggling since it is so far from my individual approach  Let me try it a different way  The single biggest mistake of the individual investor   right now   is underweighting stocks  This happens for several reasons  Fear sells   in politics  advertising  and page views  Individual investors always react to highly publicized events because they do not understand how to determine what is already  in the market   It is a mistake to be  all in  or  all out   This is not poker  Most people will never attain their investment goals if they do not have a rational strategy for when and how to buy stocks  People underestimate the upside  We have just experienced a year with tremendous earnings growth and no movement in stock prices  The price earnings ratio is back where it was at the market lows of 2009  If and when some of the worries are relieved  stocks can move to a more normal P E multiple  If the European concerns are addressed  people must understand the stocks could move much  much higher  My advice  Based upon what I see in many interviews  most people should be nudging stock exposure a bit higher  It is possible to participate in the upside potential while keeping a rein on risk  Disclosure Statement  NewArc s five different programs are currently invested in all of the stocks and ETFs mentioned  The specific characteristics vary according to the investor   Here is a good illustration  New investors do not go all in on the first day   we look for good entry points  An investor in Great Stocks would own Apple tomorrow  since I think it is massively under valued  An investor in the enhanced yield program would never own Apple   To summarize  every stock mentioned is right for one of our programs  The individual investor must be cautious when reviewing market commentary like this  Everyone is different ,Jeff Miller,0.075,0.765,0.16,0.9998
CAT,2012-01-20,Although it s nearly flat for the past year  the Industrial sector has been rising strongly over the past few months Promising earnings forecasts are one of the main reasons for this sector s momentum  as it s projected to be one of the top sectors for EPS growth over the next 5 years So far  Caterpillar   CAT   has been one of the best stocks to buy in 2012 for price gains  If you bought CAT in late 2011  you d have a nice gain already Although the market has been climbing so far in 2012  many analysts are forecasting a volatile road ahead in the first half of 2012   So how can you protect your gains in CAT Fortunately  CAT has some of the highest options yields of any Dow dividend stocks  which will help you to protect a large   of your gains  via selling covered calls Different strategies you can use to hedge your gains and earn high yields 1  Sell covered call options further out in time  to capture a bigger premium  and hedge more of your gains  This table uses CAT s 2011 year end price as a cost basis  and illustrates how  the further out in time you sell these  105 00 call options  the more option premium   you ll receive In the table below  the May option pays  7 50  which hedges almost 50  of the  15 11 year to date gain for CAT  whereas the Jan  2013 option pays  13 65  which hedges over 90  of the gain  The higher  longer term call premiums will also lower your break even price The trade off is that your annualized yields decrease as you sell further out in time  However  all of these trades achieve double digit annualized  static yields   and much higher potential assigned yields   Static yield equals the call bid premium dividend by the cost basis of the underlying stock  and refers to a scenario in which the stock doesn t rise above the strike price near expiration  so you keep the underlying shares  You can see more details on over 30 high yield Covered Call trades which we ve discussed in recent articles in our Covered Calls Table  2  If you re more bullish on the market and or CAT  you could sell covered call options at a higher strike price  leaving yourself more opportunity for future price gains The table below uses CAT s 1 19 12 closing price as a cost basis  and shows the differences in potential price gains at different strike prices  all expiring in August 2012 Potential assigned yield refers to the yield on the difference between the stock s price and the strike price In this example  the  105 00 strike price is   71 below CAT s  105 71  so if the stock rises above  105 00 near expiration time in August  the underlying shares may get sold assigned away from you at  105 00   This is the big trade off of selling covered calls at a strike price  in the money    you sacrifice potential future price gains for a higher option payment now The other two higher strike prices leave you more room for potential price gains higher potential assigned yields  but pay lower call option premiums The above call options pay almost 6 to over 10 times the amount that CAT s dividends pay during this 7 month trade period Selling Cash Secured Put Options Conversely  if you re interested in buying CAT  but you re leery of its current price  you can sell cash secured puts at a strike price below CAT s current price  and achieve a lower break even price Selling put options obligates you to potentially have to buy the underlying stock at whatever strike price you sell the puts at    Cash reserve  refers to the amount your broker will set aside in your account  to insure that you have the money to pay for the stock  if it gets sold assigned to you at expiration  For example  the  105 00 strike price requires a cash reserve of  10 500 00  which equals  105 00 x 100 shares of CAT    Each option contract corresponds to 100 shares of the underlying stock In these August 2012 put options trades  each lower strike price gives you a lower break even  but also has a lower option premium   So  you have to decide how aggressive to be   should you  nibble at the edges   and sell put options further out of the money for a lower break even  such as the  97 50 strike price below  OR  be more aggressive  and sell at a strike price closer to a stock s current price  such as the  105 00 strike   Note  You can find more info on over 30 high yield Cash Secured Puts trades in our Cash Secured Puts Table  Financials  CAT s mgt  efficiency ratios are higher than its peers    CAT s Debt Equity ratio is higher  but it has an Interest Coverage ratio of 5 9 Valuations  Although CAT s Price Book is much higher than its peers  it appears undervalued on a PEG basis  and has enjoyed solid growth during its most recent quarter and fiscal year   CAT is due to give its earnings report on Jan  26  2012 Disclosure  Author is short CAT put options Disclaimer  This article is written for informational purposes only and isn t intended as investment advice ,Double Dividend Stocks,0.058,0.851,0.09,0.9862
CAT,2012-01-26,The Fed made history yesterday  achieving a new level of policy making transparency In my early days in the business  the results of an FOMC meeting were never announced   Everyone waited until the day after the Fed meeting to see what open market operations were conducted by the NY Fed   First you needed to know what was needed to maintain the current policy rate   Then you had to gauge whether the action was sufficient to maintain that rate   System wide repo s were aggressive easing and matched sales were tightening  but there was still a matter of interpretation  Various Fed experts were quoted on the newswires to offer their interpretations It was like waiting for puffs of smoke from the chimney Now  all of the old skills are irrelevant   It is almost like CNBC putting the stock names on the ticker along with the symbols    amateur hour  But that comparison is not fair   Only the skills that have changed  It is a new era  with a lot more information  See Global Economic Intersection for a  on the main story and updates with each new piece of information    During recent years    mostly in the Bernanke era    we have added all of the following An official policy statement  carefully constructed and instantly parsed by analysts to pinpoint the nuance of each change More frequent updating of official forecasts More timely minutes of meetings Eventual full transcripts of meetings Press conferences by the Fed Chair after meetings with forecast updates  and nowA granular look at the distribution of forecasts of the entire Board  not just voting members   andA statement of principles about inflation targeting and the lack of an employment target This is a feast for anyone with a brain and some analytical skill   I note with amazement that some disparage this information   Then I see that these are the same people who typically criticize the Fed regardless of what it does For most of the real world  having more data is valuable for planning and for setting expectations   We all know that the Fed cannot forecast three years ahead with any certainty  and Bernanke agreed in the press conference   These forecasts will change The key point is that we will now be able to see the changing long range forecasts of the members in real time   I  am using this in my investing  and so can you if you think about it Current Takeaways There is a lot of information  so anyone offering conclusions today is only doing a first take   Here is mine The consensus Fed forecast is for moderate  below trend growth for the next two years   Progress on US economic data has been offset by Europe   Modest growth  no recession The long term policy commitment is matched to the forecast The Fed is prepared to act more aggressively if circumstances require    QE III The Fed has an inflation target  2  in core PC Despite pleas from the liberal wing  employment and or GDP targeting is secondary Investment ConclusionThe initial market reaction was a rally of less than 1   This was a knee jerk reaction toward a weaker dollar  lower long term rates  higher commodities  and higher stocks    everyone s first take of the news This assessment is partly correct  We all need to consider each asset class   I think that the inflation weak dollar conclusion is overstated  The chance of a spike in long term rates is a bit lower But here is the big story  The Fed shows determination to fight a new recession  doing whatever it takes   The votes are there  This dovetails nicely with our recession series   The method we are putting under the microscope    accurately emphasizes Fed policy as a big factor in recessions   More to come on that subject  but astute readers will see the drift   We are earlier in the business cycle than most analysts think   This is good for heavy cyclicals and cyclical tech stocks    Think Caterpillar  CAT  and Oracle  ORCL  and the XLI Industrials ETF for names I have mentioned  or write to main at newarc dot com to get our updated ETF suggestions  This also dovetails nicely with our short term modeling from our Felix model Worst Forecasts EverThe latest Fed action suggests something interesting for market watchers   For many years there has been a cadre of Fed critics asserting that the Fed was  out of bullets  or  in a box    For any objective observer these statements have clearly been proven false   The latest Fed move is something that non of these  experts  even considered a few years ago   The same guys are now telling you the same thing about the ECB and Europe      They see no hope With the 2006 Fed transcripts we can now start to have some fun by looking back at bold assertions about Fed meetings and what actually happened   So many interesting ideas and so little time   Maybe an enthusiastic reader will take this on ,Jeff Miller,0.07,0.831,0.099,0.9791
CAT,2012-01-26,Key newsThe Fed expects years of low rates according to last night s FOMC statementIran may decide to act first on the European embargo on its oil exports  putting further pressure on Spain  Italy and Greece in particularFinancial markets were boosted by the pledge for low US rates yesterdayToday sees the release of key economic data from the US and Sweden  which in case of the latter could prove decisive for the Riksbank s action on 16 FebruaryMarkets OvernightLast night s FOMC announcement set the stage for nearly three more years of loose monetary policy  as the statement called for rates to be kept  exceptionally low  until the end of 2014  This was more dovish than the market had expected and boosted sentiment towards the end of the US trading session  Notably  however  the wording does not imply that rates will necessarily be kept unchanged throughout this period  as  the first ever published projections for the Fed funds rate revealed that 11 out of 18 members  expect higher levels in late 2014   The projections were published later in the evening and generally left a less dovish picture  see EUR USD 20to 20break 20above 201 31 20and 20caused 20USD

embargo on its oil exports  according to Financial Times  by cutting supplies to the EU before the ban is implemented  The ban on crude oil imports agreed this week was planned to take effect from  1  July  giving particularly Spain  Italy and Greece time to find alternative suppliers  Energy prices have reacted by pushing higher  and while the embargo related supply concerns were an important factor  the general rise in risky assets also played its part Chancellor Merkel presented no new cures for the debt crisis in a closely followed speech yesterday at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Rather  the German Chancellor offered no signs that Germany would pour further resources into the bail out funds  letting down hopes following unconfirmed reports earlier this week that the EUR500bn cap on the European Stability Mechanism would be lifted US equity markets rallied  taking their cues from  the Fed pledge for low rates for several years  Furthermore  earnings announcements have generally been supportive for sentiment  with 74 out of 112 S P500 companies reporting earnings above expectations  according to Bloomberg  The reaction in Asian trading has been mixed this morning Treasuries saw big moves yesterday  as the dovish FOMC statement drove the tendency for lower yields  However  the projections published later in the evening caused some of the move to be reversed USD weakened on the back of the dovish FOMC announcement  suffering both due to the correction lower in US rates and the overall pick up in risk appetite   This  led EUR USD to break above 1 31 and caused USD JPY to correct lower from the twomonth high reached yesterday  following a few days with unusually sharp price action Global DailyFocus today  US initial jobless claims are expected to increase to 370K from previous week s extraordinarily low 352K  lowest reading since July 2008   The underlying downward trend seen since September last year nevertheless seems to remain intact  Durable goods orders for December are expected to increase moderately following a strong increase in November and new home sales may gain pace giving further confirmation that the US housing market has started  to  improve  as also indicated by yesterday s strong increase in the FHFA house price index   Consumer confidence data for Germany and France may confirm that a bit of optimism is returning to the euro area core countries  The Q4 reporting season continues with earning reports from Nokia  Hennes   Mauritz  Caterpillar and AT T Fixed income markets  The Fed statement was more dovish compared to the market pricing prior  which initially caused a decent rally  lower rates  in the Fed funds futures  However  as the members  projections revealed a high degree of dispersion  the read on the individual projections is less dovish than the FOMC statement suggested   and  the rally reversed somewhat  Futures prices are now consistent with the Fed Funds rate being lifted to 0 50  by end 2014  compared to mid 2014 one day ago  As stock markets eventually performed during the evening session  it supported mild steepening of the 2 10s in the US  We still like the potential for steepening  Today the markets will keep an eye on the government issuance coming from Italy  We expect a total issuance of around EUR2 75bn  The auctions are not expected to rattle the markets given the current relief in financial conditions FX markets  Markets are likely to continue digesting the news from last night s FOMC announcement  Given the overall dovish tone  the move higher  in EUR USD could be extended further  though much will also depend on overall risk sentiment  This morning the rally in equities seems to be losing some steam  Note that today sees the release of a batch of Swedish economic data  that could be decisive for the February Riksbank decision  Hence  we look for the correlation between EUR SEK and Swedish macro data surprises to stay in place  Also  keep an eye on the sovereign bond auctions today Scandi DailySweden  Although Riksbank s Deputy Governor Wickman Parak caused some volatility in the Swedish market yesterday as there were different interpretations about what she actually said in a radio interview and which were the reporter s own words  we still find it safe to say that she  at least acknowledged that mortgage lending rates have risen more than the repo rate  due to higher margins as well as higher funding costs for mortgage institutions and banks  Hence  we are inclined to believe that Riksbank is now addressing the  problem  we have been pointing to for some time  i e  that the Swedish transmission mechanism is out of order  More important  however  is the outcome of today s batch of Swedish data for the Riksbank s action on 16 February Our base case is that Q4 GDP will print  1 0  q q  compared to Riksbank s forecast for  0 1  q q  Actually  we think today s December data for trade balance  retail sales and unemployment may

CAT,2012-01-30,Last time I wrote   The Fed s Open Market Committee meets next week and there is a little buzz they may tinker with their previous statement they would keep short term rates at zero well into 2013  A change in the language could lead to some volatility   Well  the volatility didn t occur but Chairman Ben Bernanke and his band of Fed governors did indeed tinker with the language  as in now the Fed says it will hold rates at zero until late 2014  or maybe it won t  You see  for the first time the Federal Reserve released the individual forecasts of all 17 Fed officials and six of them believe the Fed will begin increasing rates again before 2014  so it s not like the Fed is really committed to hold rates down as it told you and Bernanke later conceded as much in his press conference  What the Fed is looking for  however  is to keep long term interest rates as low as possible for as long as possible until a housing recovery takes hold  such a recovery being necessary if the U S  economy is ever going to take off again  You see  on Friday the flash estimate on fourth quarter GDP came in at 2 8  growth  or the sixth straight quarter below 3   On countless occasions I ve pointed out how during the Reagan recovery off the 1981 82 recession  we had six straight quarters of growth above 5   Oh  what the heck one more time  Dedicated to the Gipper with love  1983 Q1 5 1  Q2 9 3 Q3 8 1 Q4 8 5 1984 Q1 8 0 Q2 7 1 And   2010 Q3 2 5 Q4 2 3 2011 Q1 0 4 Q2 1 3 Q3 1 8 Q4 2 8 Hey  look at that steady progress the last few quarters  Outstanding  Then again  this is all the White House probably needs to get the chief occupant re elected enough growth to enable the unemployment rate to tick down a little more say from the current 8 5  to 8 2   After all  it s about trends and sentiment  In the latest Wall Street Journal NBC News poll  30  of the people believe the country is headed in the right direction  Hardly a positive for the White House but it s eight points better than just a month ago  60  believe the nation is on the wrong track  but that figure was 74  in October  President Obama s job approval is up to 48  and for the first time in seven months  more people approve of his performance than disapprove  46    On the economy  37  expect it to get better over the next year  17  say it will get worse  Just last month  optimists outnumbered pessimists by only a 30 to 22 margin  But back to the Federal Reserve  if the economy continues to show improvement  however haltingly  they will hike rates before 2014  That s a guarantee  even if inflation stays tame  because that would mean housing is finally recovering  In the meantime  the Fed chairman couldn t give a damn about those of you on fixed income who thought you were doing things the right way all your lives saving and putting that money in a secure instrument  such as a savings account  CD  or money market fund  I keep using the example of a  100 000 nest egg that would supplement one s Social Security check  At 2  that s  2 000 a year   40 a week  That s a lot for someone in that situation  Take the wife out to a movie and McDonald s for some simple enjoyment  for example   It s our date night   you d tell the neighbors with a smile  But not today  Ben Bernanke said in his press conference that he understands  savers are getting a lower return   Try zero  Ben  Bernanke explains   Savers are dependent on a healthy economy to get good returns low interest rates are needed to restore the economy  which in turn leads to higher returns on all assets   Some of us just want to scream  It can only be an academic exercise  but after we had turned the corner in 2009 following what was then the Fed s appropriate zero interest rate policy to prevent Armageddon  the Fed should have normalized rates  2  on the funds rate  No way the 10 year in that scenario would have then been above 4   so historically low mortgage rates would have still been the norm for prospective homebuyers  Any hints of inflation would have been extinguished  The dollar would have been stronger and chances are the commodity bubble of 2010 2011 wouldn t have occurred  which did a number on food and fuel prices  Yes  it s all hypothetical  and even I won t tell you what I received in my Economics or Finance classes back in school  One thing I can guarantee  though  shares in McDonald s would have been even higher than they are today  Mohamed El Erian   Financial Times  Policy experimentation continues unabated in the U S  with the Federal Reserve launching on Wednesday a new initiative to influence market valuations and  through this  the outlook for the country s economy  The Fed hopes to use greater transparency to mould expectations in a manner that promotes economic growth and price stability  But this new approach could also create confusion and even greater hesitancy on the part of healthy balance sheets to engage in productive investments    On Wednesday  the Fed showed how it intends to use  communication  as a much more active tool to inform and influence economic outcomes  But this approach goes well beyond the concept of greater transparency  By publishing members  individual forecasts   specifically  the annual evolution of the policy rate  the timing of the first hike and a long term natural rate   the Federal Open Market Committee wants to provide a firmer and steadier outlook to encourage investors  in both physical and financial assets  to commit to long term decisions   Few expect this new initiative to have an immediate or durable impact  Beyond 2012  individual FOMC members  forecasts are quite dispersed  including a 0 25  to 2 75  range for the target Federal Funds rate for end of 2014    We need to see a significant clustering of FOMC member forecasts that could credibly translate into a medium term vision for policy rates  and greater responsiveness on the part of households  companies and investors to price movements  But even these will not prove sufficient unless the Fed s continued activism is part of a more comprehensive policy response out of Washington  As yet  there is little to suggest that we are moving quickly enough to meet this requirement   Editorial   Wall Street Journal  The two most powerful men in Washington have a big disagreement  No  not President Obama and Speaker John Boehner  We mean Mr  Obama and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  who can t seem to agree on the health of the U S  economy   On Tuesday night  the President proclaimed that the  state of our Union is getting stronger   employers are hiring faster than they can find skilled workers  and manufacturing is booming  Less than a day later  Mr  Bernanke and his Open Market Committee downgraded their already modest growth outlook and said the recovery is so vulnerable that the Fed must keep interest rates at near zero for another three years   The contradiction may not be as profound as it seems  Mr  Obama is running for re election and this time he needs to sell austerity more than hope  while the Fed is still trying to reflate the housing market that it seems to believe is the main driver of economic growth  The Fed is straining to deliver the asset price  stimulus  that Mr  Obama can t any longer get out of Congress    The central bank had already promised to keep short term rates near zero through most of 2013  but now it feels the need to assure investors it will keep them there through the end of 2014  That would be six years in total  more than half of what may eventually become known as the Fed s Zero Decade   Mull that one over  The Fed is declaring that it needs to run the same super easy monetary policy when the economy is growing by 2  or 3  as it did amid the worst of the financial panic  The unavoidable implication is that the Fed doesn t think the economy will grow any faster until what would be halfway through Mr  Obama s second term    But intervening so directly to keep rates artificially low has made the bond market useless as a price signal or indicator of risk across the larger economy   The Fed is thus pushing investors of all kinds further out on the risk curve with consequences no one can foresee   least of all the Fed  as we are now learning from the just released FOMC transcripts from 2006   Recall that during the last decade the Fed assured everyone there was nothing to worry about as it kept rates too low for too long  only to create a housing bubble it never did recognize  Recall  too  how its second round of bond buying  QE2  in 2010 2011 was supposed to lift stock prices but in addition sent commodity prices soaring  Consumer confidence plunged as Americans felt the strain of higher prices for food and energy  and the economy has done notably better since QE2 ended   Where will the risk taking excesses show up this time  Who knows   One thing we do know about the Fed s interest rate policy  It s holding down the level of interest expense on the budget deficits  In combination with Europe s woes  Treasuries have been the place to be and that will continue to help Treasury as it sells an estimated  970 billion of bonds in 2012  according to Credit Suisse  As economist Ed Yardeni told Bloomberg   The Fed has been the great enabler of the government s fiscal excesses  The Fed s zero interest rate and quantitative easing policies have squelched any protests by the bond vigilantes   But  the debt load continues to rise and interest expense will rise as well  to  474 billion this year  according to the Office of Management and Budget  Imagine when interest rates finally take off  not that I m forecasting that any time soon  though the debt crisis will hit home at some point this year and I ve told you what will happen then  As to the U S  economy and the latest data  December durable goods rose a better than expected 3 0   but new home sales for the month were less than expected as was the leading economic indicators figure for December  Jobless claims for the past week also rose substantially off their multi year lows  And you had that 2 8  GDP number that contained less than sterling personal consumption and consumer spending data  as well as a troubling increase in inventories that could augur for diminished manufacturing activity the first half of this year  At least the inflation component of the GDP report was good  The week also saw another slew of earnings reports and while the likes of Apple and Caterpillar were excellent  many of the others were so so at best  or  as in the case of McDonald s  the stock may just be getting a bit pricey  Additionally  Chevron s big miss on Friday didn t help matters  Which leads me to the State of the Union  SOU  address  In reporting on it  one thing is easy  President Obama is always good when it comes to leaving out the details so I don t have to get many down for the record  It s just nice to know  America is back  Anyone who tells you our influence is in decline doesn t know what they re talking about   And   America remains the one indispensable nation in the world and I intend to keep it that way   U S A  U S A  Lead from Behind  Lead from Behind  The president did pull out his class warfare rhetoric  though to be fair it wasn t quite as partisan as it could have been  But in providing the one detail of the evening  that millionaires would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30   the  Buffett rule    he also talked of those earning  250 000 having to pony up more but here there were no details as to how he intends to fill the gap  Editorial   Wall Street Journal  The White House says that if a millionaire household s effective tax rate falls below 30   it would have to pay a surcharge   in essence a new Super Alternative Minimum Tax   to bring the tax liability to 30   For those facing this new Super AMT  all deductions and exemptions would be eliminated except for charity   The Buffett rule is rooted in the fairy tale that taxes on the wealthy are lower than on the middle class  In fact  the Congressional Budget Office notes that the effective income tax rate of the richest 1  is about 29 5  when including all federal taxes such as the distribution of corporate taxes  or about twice the 15 1  paid by middle class families   This is because wealthy tax filers make most of their income from investments  Such income is taxed once at the corporate rate of 35  and again when it is passed through to the individual as a capital gain or dividend at 15   for a highest marginal tax rate of about 44 75       One implication of the Buffett rule is that all millionaire investment income would be taxed at the shareholder level at a minimum rate of 30   up from 15  today    The new 30  capital gains rate would be the developed world s third highest behind only Denmark and Chile This is on top of the 35  corporate rate that is already the second highest rate in the world after Japan  That giant sucking sound you hear come January 2013 would be hundreds of billions of investment dollars fleeing to China  India  Korea and other U S  competitors   As Jennifer Rubin reports in the Washington Post  citing a Gallup survey   About half  49   of Americans agree with President Barack Obama s claim that the U S  economic system is unfair  while 45  say it is fair  At the same time  62  say the U S  economic system is fair to them personally   In a separate piece  Ms  Rubin observes of the SOU   Where is his entitlement reform  Where is his tax reform plan  He can t be bothered with actual governance   And then there was the Republican rebuttal to Obama  offered up by Indiana Gov  Mitch Daniels   In three short years  an unprecedented explosion of spending  with borrowed money  has added trillions to an already unaffordable national debt  And yet  the president has put us on a course to make it radically worse in the years ahead  The federal government now spends one of every four dollars in the entire economy  it borrows one of every three dollars it spends  No nation  no entity  large or small  public or private  can thrive  or survive intact  with debts as huge as ours   The president s grand experiment in trickle down government has held back rather than sped economic recovery  He seems to sincerely believe we can build a middle class out of government jobs paid for with borrowed dollars  In fact  it works the other way  a government as big and bossy as this one is maintained on the backs of the middle class  and those who hope to join it    The routes back to an America of promise  and to a solvent America that can pay its bills and protect its vulnerable  start in the same place  The only way up for those suffering tonight  and the only way out of the dead end of debt into which we have driven  is a private economy that begins to grow and create jobs  real jobs  at a much faster rate than today   Contrary to the president s constant disparagement of people in business  it s one of the noblest of human pursuits  The late Steve Jobs   what a fitting name he had   created more of them than all those stimulus dollars the president borrowed and blew  Out here in Indiana  when a businessperson asks me what he can do for our state  I say   First  make money  Be successful  If you make a profit  you ll have something left to hire someone else  and some to donate to the good causes we love    The extremism that stifles the development of homegrown energy  or cancels a perfectly safe pipeline that would employ tens of thousands  or jacks up consumer utility bills for no improvement in either human health or world temperature  is a pro poverty policy  It must be replaced by a passionate pro growth approach that breaks all ties and calls all close ones in favor of private sector jobs that restore opportunity for all and generate the public revenues to pay our bills   That means a dramatically simpler tax system of fewer loopholes and lower rates  A pause in the mindless piling on of expensive new regulations that devour dollars that otherwise could be used to hire somebody  It means maximizing on the new domestic energy technologies that are the best break our economy has gotten in years    No feature of the Obama Presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us  to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others  As in previous moments of national danger  we Americans are all in the same boat  If we drift  quarreling and paralyzed  over a Niagara of debt  we will all suffer  regardless of income  race  gender  or other category  If we fail to shift to a pro jobs  pro growth economic policy  there will never be enough public revenue to pay for our safety net  national security  or whatever size government we decide to have    In word and deed  the president and his allies tell us that we just cannot handle ourselves in this complex  perilous world without their benevolent protection  Left to ourselves  we might pick the wrong health insurance  the wrong mortgage  the wrong school for our kids  why  unless they stop us  we might pick the wrong light bulb      There is nothing wrong with the state of our Union that the American people  addressed as free born  mature citizens  cannot set right a program of renewal that rebuilds the dream for all  and makes our  city on a hill  shine once again   Europe In its latest policy statement  the Federal Open Market Committee warned   Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook   Gee  I wonder who the Fed is alluding to  Europe  perhaps  Oui oui  This was a week that started out with positives  as a combined eurozone reading on manufacturing and the service economy for January was above the 50 line  50 4  with Germany at 54 and France 50 9  But the figure on manufacturing alone was 48 7 for the region  so still in contraction territory  And despite the fact Italy had some successful bond auctions  with its rates coming way down on the short end  as well as seeing its 10 year trade below 6 00  for the first time since December  Italy still has 450 billion euro to go this year in terms of rolling over its debt and financing the massive deficit  Much is being made of the success of the European Central Bank s Longer Term Refinancing Operation  or LTRO  that injected 489 billion euro into the banking system in December  A second LTRO is slated for February 29  No doubt  in the short run the ECB s  Fed like  move has stabilized the banking system in terms of what was a distinct funding crisis end of 2011  a la Lehman  The system had freezed up  Banks weren t lending to each other  Well they still aren t to any large degree  but the ECB s infusion  at a 1  lending rate for 3 years  did strongly encourage the banks to go out and use the cash to buy sovereign debt  such as that of Spain and Italy  with much higher yields  Nice spread  eh  But not all the cash is being used in such a fashion  First off  much of it was used to just refinance the banks  short term obligations  Much of the rest of it is being hoarded  It s why S P is projecting that Europe s default rate may soar to 8 4  or worse  from 4 8  at the end of 2011  The lending window is closed  especially for small business  highly leveraged businesses  read risky private equity deals from the mid 2000s   and generally anything in southern or eastern Europe  I would argue that while Spain and Italy have caught a break for the time being  and as stocks rally on the continent  the contagion is most definitely spreading   Just on Friday  Fitch knocked down the credit ratings of Italy and Spain again  along with those of Belgium  Slovenia and Cyprus  having previously telegraphed their actions back in December  Fitch noted   The divergence in monetary and credit conditions across the eurozone and near term economic outlook highlight the greater vulnerability  these nations face in the event of financing shocks  This past week saw the same old arguments re emerge  The IMF wants Europe to adopt a greater firewall for the likes of Italy and Spain and German Chancellor Angela Merkel doesn t want to contribute more resources and guarantees  British Prime Minister David Cameron concurred with the IMF s Christine Lagarde in blasting Merkel at the World Economic Forum  stressing that while progress has been made  a much stronger firewall was needed to prevent contagion  U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner echoed the IMF and Cameron in his own comments at the WEF  saying   The only way Europe s going to be successful in holding this together  making monetary union work  is to build a stronger firewall   Get the picture  Europe remains a house built with sticks when it needs one built with bricks  But it seems leaders won t reassess the size of the bailout funds already in place until they meet in March  And there s the issue of growth  With the austerity cuts and ongoing credit crunch  it s hard to see where it s going to come from  Even a shallow recession  if Europe is lucky  needs to be followed by robust growth or the crisis will be never ending  Finally  there s Greece  It doesn t go away  In fact it just gets worse  The nation is in Depression and the technocrat led government is in full panic mode  needing to get private bondholders to agree to a restructuring of about a 1 3 of its sovereign debt or Greece won t be eligible for more bailout funds come March and would thus default  Those  like JPMorgan s Jamie Dimon  who say a Greek default wouldn t be that harmful are nuts  You never hear anyone talk about the pictures we d see on our television screens  You want to see riots  They ll be as ugly as any you ve seen in your lifetime  and they would spread  like to Romania  Albania and Bulgaria  for starters  It s the Balkans  after all  One must hope an agreement on debt restructuring is reached this week  though that would still in no way be the end of the problem for Greece and the eurozone  It would just supply more short term relief  Consider this  after all  The Financial Times on Friday got hold of a copy of a German government proposal that calls for Greece ceding sovereignty over tax and spending decisions to a eurozone  budget commissioner  before Germany would allow Greece to secure a second 130 billion euro bailout   In what would amount to an extraordinary extension of European Union control over a member state   write the FT s Peter Speigel and Kerin Hope   the new commissioner would have the power to veto budget decisions taken by the Greek government if they were not in line with targets set by international lenders  The new administrator  appointed by other eurozone finance ministers  would take responsibility for overseeing  all major blocks of expenditure  by the Greek government    Athens would also be forced to adopt a law permanently committing state revenues to debt service  first and foremost    Such a proposal has long been rumored  and Greek voters are already upset at existing EU representatives looking over their shoulders as every decision is made  but this would cross the line in their minds  So the crisis continues  even if it s been just simmering the past 4 6 weeks  It will boil over again  One other item

CAT,2012-01-30,Long time readers know that I am a long term commodity bull  Moreover  I have been writing on the theme of global healing for a few weeks  Despite last week s disappointing US GDP report  I am seeing signs that it may be time to get on the commodity bull for a ride  Both sentiment and momentum indicators are lining up for another upleg in commodity prices  First of all  sentiment measures indicate that commodity prices are at levels suggesting accumulation  This chart from Mary Ann Bartels of BoA Merrill Lynch  Note  the depictions of bull and bear phases are mine  not hers  shows that large speculators  who are mainly hedge funds  have moved off a crowded long in commodity prices  The chart was produced by aggregating the Commitment of Data reports for all futures exchange traded commodities in the CRB Index My depiction of the bull and bear phases show that during the bear phases  neutral readings are good times to fade the rally  On the other hand  neutral readings are good opportunity to accumulate positions during the bull phases  The bull and bear phases are best exemplified by the chart of the bellwether of gold prices  which bottomed in 2002 along with the rest of the commodity complex Just because there is a neutral signal from this is a good time to accumulate positions doesn t mean that there isn t more downside to commodity prices  To see some near term upside  you need a catalyst Bullish CAT guidance the bullish catalyst  I have offered that one of the key indicators to watch for market direction is to watch   A bullish catalyst appeared last week when Caterpillar  CAT   which is a cyclical company that does business worldwide      We expect improving world economic growth to increase demand for commodities  Our outlook assumes most commodity prices will increase slightly in 2012 and continue at levels that encourage investment  We expect that copper will average over  4 per pound  Central Appalachian coal about  75 per ton and West Texas Intermediate crude oil about  100 per barrel  In particular  mining will be a source of growth in 2012 and growth will be so high that supply will have a tough time with meeting demand  We expect mining to continue to be strong globally  and we have a sizable order backlog for mining equipment  We expect sales to increase in 2012 and are in the process of adding production capacity for many of our mining products  However  we expect sales to be constrained by capacity throughout 2012  Moreover  the  showed that the American economy continues to grow despite last week s disappointing GDP report CAT was bullish on the outlook for US housing    We expect total U S  construction spending  which  net of inflation  has declined since 2004  to finally begin to recover in 2012  We project a 1 5 percent increase in infrastructure related construction and a 5 percent increase in nonresidential building construction  We are expecting housing starts of at least 700 thousand units in 2012  up from 607 thousand units in 2011   They were sanguine on Europe because of ECB support of the eurozone   The Eurozone public debt crisis has been a lingering negative  but it is unlikely to trigger a worldwide recession  The Eurozone will likely have at least two quarters of weak  possibly negative growth  but should begin to improve in the second half of 2012  For 2012  our outlook assumes economic growth for the Eurozone near zero and growth of about half of a percentage point for Europe in total  Our expectation for improvement of European growth in the second half of 2012 rests on a continued easing by the European Central Bank  ECB   The ECB has recently lowered interest rates and could cut rates further in 2012  CAT also saw sufficient growth in China to support construction demand and commodity growth    China took its first easing action in late 2011  and we expect that further easing is likely  We expect China s economy will grow 8 5 percent in 2012  sufficient for growth in construction and increased commodity demand  In addition   highlighted some of the positive long term fundamental drivers of Chinese commodity demand  namely a population that is rapidly becoming more affluent  which will raise demand for the consumer good life  such as electricity ,Cam Hui,0.052,0.82,0.128,0.9949
CAT,2012-02-08,When politics takes the fore  we have what I call  silly season    This is a time when many investors get caught up in the emotion of politics and make bad investment decisions  For those who can keep a clear head  it is a time of opportunity   I ll start with some background  and then turn to the investment implications  The Democratic Perspective This is a pretty simple proposition   It has the following legs Obama inherited a bad situation He has made many right moves  and been blocked on others Things would be even worse without his efforts You should read every economic story with a critical eye to these themes  The GOP Perspective This is also a simple argument  with a few legs Obama promised unemployment below 8  and did not deliver Obama killed new business with additional regulations and general uncertainty Obama tax policy threatens job creators    various ways You should read every economic story with a critical eye to these themes    Interpreting Data Investors need to have a sharper eye   Right now the GOP is reaching to deny progress   Here is how you can spot this Visibility without credentialsThere is a group of people who get visibility only because they have had it in the past   There is no test about education  success in past jobs  or accuracy of prior forecasts   These guys are part of a club where they get on TV because they have been featured in the past   Check out this example  the bio of someone who has gone through more  unmentioned  firms that I can remember  while never changing his incorrect message Mr  X is the President of X Portfolio Strategies and serves as Senior Market Analyst for research firm XYZ Financial X Portfolio Strategies provides a nexus between prospective clients and a select group of the country s finest and most seasoned investment advisors  who utilize X s economic models in developing their portfolio strategies  XYZ Financial publishes award winning newsletters  critically acclaimed feature documentaries and international best selling books Mr  X is a well established specialist in the Austrian School of economics and a regular guest on CNBC  Bloomberg  FOX Business News and other national media outlets  His market analysis can also be read in most major financial publications  including the Wall Street Journal  He also acts as a Financial Columnist for Forbes and is a blogger at the Huffington Post Prior to starting X Portfolio Strategies and joining XYZ Financial  Mr  X served as a senior economist and vice president of the managed products division of another financial firm  There  he also led an external sales division that marketed their managed products to outside broker dealers and registered investment advisors Additionally  Mr  X has worked for an investment advisory firm where he helped create ETFs and UITs that were sold throughout Wall Street  Earlier in his career Mr  X spent two years on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange  He has carried series 7  63  65  55 and Life and Health Insurance Licenses  Mr  X graduated from Rowan University in 1991 So this guy worked for several unnamed firms  had an undergrad degree in an unknown subject  and has gotten on TV a lot   His resume includes the most dangerous phrase for investors   Self taught in Austrian Economics  Actually it says that he is a self proclaimed expert  but that is the same thing   It is possible to study Austrian Economics  as my George Mason friends at the Kauffman Conference regularly highlight   I find that most people who claim this credential without formal study have started with an ideology and then sought an economic fig leaf to support a viewpoint  The Super Bowl Shuffle When the data do not support your argument it is time to spin   The employment report always has a lot of room for interpretation and error  something that I always emphasize   Last week s report had a bigger opportunity than most for the spinmeisters  since the Census Bureau did updates based upon the 2010 Census results  This led to horrific blunders by the  shoot first  think later  crowd  as I noted in my   Since then  there has been a rapid retreat   without apology    by the sources that got this wrong   They are now shifting the argument to a ten year analysis of employment participation We should recognize this for what it is  My Take on Employment Participation Let s get real on this subject   We all know the following The Y2K high was induced by a  buy forward  of computers   We will never see this high again The aging population means that employment participation will naturally decline  andThe extended recession has created early retirements  extended studies  travel abroad  and other elements reducing labor participation We will never hit the old highs  Compare my take with But  with one big exception  the economy is increasingly clicking on all cylinders  Adjusted for inflation  personal spending is up  business investment is up  and   finally   home building is growing as well  January data from automakers show sales are up 53  from the bottom in early 2009  If the economy is so bad and credit is impossible to get  how is it possible for Americans to be driving so many cars and trucks off dealer lots  And notice that the recent improvement in job creation comes several months after we hit an upward inflection point in home building  which is a labor intensive industry   The major outlier is government  where purchases in 2011 were down the most in more than forty years   For GDP purposes  transfer payments are not counted as government spending   Ultimately  we believe most of the disbelief is driven by politics  Back in 1992  President George H  W  Bush was never given credit for a recovering economy by those who wanted to see someone else in the White House  Now  from the opposite side of the political spectrum  there are those who want to see President Obama replaced so badly that they refuse to believe signs of improvement no matter how clear  Investment ConclusionThe implication is that we are still early in the business cycle    something that is bullish for cyclical and technology companies that I have highlighted  including Caterpillar  CAT   Intel  INTC  and Microsoft  MSFT   as examples ,Jeff Miller,0.064,0.859,0.077,0.8932
CAT,2012-02-12,As I ve watched the ongoing saga in Europe  the discussions of sustainable Debt GDP and other elements of the  Maastrict Criteria  I ve often been puzzled at why these figures were so important  The U S  represents a large single currency union  and although different states have incurred different levels of indebtedness there is no Federal law dictating what those equivalent ratios must be  Most states are required to run balanced budgets  but those laws are passed by the states themselves So although many commentators repeat the mantra that too much borrowing by a few profligate countries is endangering the entire Euro zone  and this sounds as if it makes sense  I ve never fully comprehended the precise linkage  Why shouldn t countries in a common currency  or even cities for that matter  be allowed to borrow whatever they wish at prevailing market rates  Municipalities do go bankrupt in the U S   though far less frequently than Meredith Whitney once forecast   Orange County defaulted in the 1994 because of speculative interest rate bets gone awry  and nobody questioned the viability of the US    In 1975 the Federal government was willing to let New York City go bankrupt  although President Ford did not tell NY to  drop dead   as is popularly believed   But at no time was there any question about the viability of the US  or the single currency area So I ve been somewhat uncomfortable with the accepted wisdom that a fiscal union is necessary for a currency union to work  Fiscal transfers do take place in the U S  on a far greater scale than in Europe  but not in response to local deficits but to growth shocks Then I came across an academic paper called  Target Loans  Current Account Balances and Capital Flows  The ECB s Rescue Facility   It s quite technical and I can t claim to fully grasp its many nuances  However  the main insight is in the following example  an Italian buying a BMW car from Germany writes a check in Euros drawn on an Italian bank  This results in a series of transactions from the Italian bank to the Bank of Italy  ECB  Bundesbank  German bank and BMW  The Italian buyer obtains his car  The Bank of Italy has a liability with the ECB  and the Bundesbank has an asset  The key point is that these balances  while they offset at the ECB  never have to be settled  Italy has been running a growing trade deficit  hence the discussion of improving southern European competitiveness  while Germany has been running a surplus  because it is already an exporting powerhouse  Germany  through its Bundesbank  has an  asset  or claim with the ECB of 450BN Euros  as of September 2011   All the Eurozone members net out  but the imbalances have soared since the 2008 debt crisis  They are called  Target  balances  and according to the paper are obscurely reported by the ECB  only disclosed in footnotes  Germany s loan to the ECB is guaranteed by the other Eurozone countries  but if one was to leave  say  Greece  they may default on their pro rata share  In this way  Germany is already on the hook to its Eurozone partners for 450BN Euros  and presumably growing  These imbalances are caused by the fiscal deficits southern European countries have been running  which is why the Maastricht Treaty imposed a 3  deficit GDP limit and a 60  debt GDP limit  The architects of the Eurozone payments system understood this  But the debt owed Germany by the ECB is substantial  not widely reported  and fundamental to the crisis In the U S   a Texan buying a Caterpillar  CAT  earth mover from a California factory would trigger the analogous payments sequence through his regional Federal Reserve bank  However  the Dallas Fed would have to settle its deficit with the San Francisco Fed within a year by transferring government securities  This critical  true up  doesn t exist in the Eurozone ,Simon Lack,0.104,0.812,0.084,-0.9396

CAT,2012-02-25,Earnings season is on a roll  and traders are playing the old  earnings estimates beats misses  game  which often has tenuous ties to reality  at best  as analysts go from being over excited to being overly pessimistic   Here s just how wrong analysts have been about Caterpillar  CAT  over the last 4 quarters Could it be that CAT is just a special case   Not really   analysts were even more clueless about Boeing  BA    Can you just imagine   I shudder to think   if you were to submit an estimate to your boss that was off by over  80   and then followed up that brilliant piece of work with another estimate that was off by over  30     Do you think it might possibly prompt a reassignment or even a permanent vacation   Not so on Wall St    where being consistently and often egregiously wrong is OK Why is that   Because it supports the trading excitement of  Earnings Beats   Misses    Just think about it  the market often bases its decisions on the estimates of a group of external people  who don t have access to the daily  inside info of the stocks they re supposed to be informing us about   If this sounds like folly  it often is Instead of just listening to analysts  pie in the sky  or  gloom and doom  predictions  try looking at what companies actually earned each quarter vs  a year ago We can also look at their quarterly Revenue Growth vs  a year ago CAT has been one of the best stocks to buy in 2012 and in 2011 for price gains  but Boeing shares haven t risen nearly as much  Here s one reason why   BA is forecasting lower 2012 earnings per share  of  4 05 to  4 25  vs  2011 s  5 33 EPS  whereas CAT is forecasting continued strong growth  Even though BA has a record order backlog  unlike other companies  they can t rush their highly technical products to market BA is forecasting just  4 05 to  4 25  but analysts are estimating  4 46 share 2012 EPS  AND  guess what   Analysts are currently forecasting EPS of  5 67 for BA in 2013  which is 6 4  over BA s 2011 earnings  Do you believe them  How can a value investor take advantage of Analysts  mistakes   By waiting for the analysts  next overheated incorrect estimate  which may be so ridiculously high that even a company posting strong gains can t  beat  it  which is what happened with CAT in 2011  when analysts had somehow not factored in the expenses of CAT s multi billion dollar purchase of mining equipment maker Bucyrus When the stock gets beaten up  and discounted unnecessarily  make your move  and buy it  OR  do this Sell Cash Secured Puts  If you want to give yourself more breathing room  you can sell  cash secured put options below the stock s current price  which will give you a lower break even price  2 other important benefits   you ll get paid now to wait  and you ll often get paid much more than the next few quarters  dividends   Fortunately  CAT has rather high options yields which are much higher than its dividend yield In these two examples  CAT s put options pay over 9 to 12  times the amount of its dividends  The further out in time you sell options  the more premium you ll get paid  and the lower your break even price will be   However  your annualized yield will also be lower  because your broker will be holding a cash reserve of 100 times the Put Strike Price in your account against each Put that you sell  until the put expires or is assigned or you buy it back to close out your position How to hedge your gains with Covered Calls  Conversely  if you now own CAT shares  and you re leery of a market pullback  selling covered call options will protect some of your profit  by giving you additional option income on your shares  The caveat is that  by selling a call option  you re obligating yourself to sell your shares at whatever strike price you sell the calls at  Typically  the shares will get assigned near or at expiration  if the stock rises above the strike price   So  you re foregoing potential price gains  in return for immediate option income However  these 2 covered call trades each have strike prices above CAT s current stock price  offering you the potential for an additional  3 80 share in price gains  if your shares get assigned  The longer term August call options pay more than the May calls  and both call options heavily outstrip the corresponding dividend payouts   One options contract corresponds to 100 shares of stock  Financials  Although they aren t high dividend stocks  these two DOW dividend stocks both have attractive Mgt  Ratios  and good interest coverage  but if you re looking for 2012 growth at a reasonable price  CAT is the more undervalued of the two   In fact  CAT is one of the few DOW 30 stocks to have a low 2012 PEG ratio  However  as CAT has risen almost 29  year to date  you may want to wait for a pullback before jumping in Disclosure   Author is short CAT put options Disclaimer  This article is written for informational purposes only and isn t intended

CAT,2012-03-08,Options traders distinguish between actual volatility  recorded and measured from data  and implied volatility   The latter term comes from solving the options models using price and the various known inputs  Typically volatility is the only input term that must be estimated   High implied volatility means that traders of options are incorporating uncertainty in their estimates   With this in mind    Get ready for maximum potential volatility in a single trading hour  It starts Thursday afternoon  when we will get the results on participation in the Greek debt swap only an hour before the market close   Before the opening on Friday  we will get the most important economic news of the month  the employment situation report  The Data We all want to know whether the economy is improving and  if so  by how much  Employment is the key metric since it is fundamental for consumption  corporate profits  tax revenues  deficit reduction  and financial markets  We would like to know the net addition of jobs in the month of February  To provide an estimate of monthly job changes the BLS has a complex methodology that includes the following steps An initial report of a survey of establishments  Even if the survey sample was perfect  and we all know that it is not  and the response rate was 100   which it is not  the sampling error alone for a 90  confidence interval is     100K jobs The report is revised to reflect additional responses over the next two months There is an adjustment to account for job creation    much maligned and misunderstood by nearly everyone The final data are benchmarked against the state employment data every year  This usually shows that the overall process was very good  but it led to major downward adjustments at the time of the recession  More recently  the BLS estimates have been too low    See my  for a more detailed account of this  along with supporting data  I think the BLS is honest and does a good job  which seems to put me in a small minority of observers  Despite this support  I question the general concept  The BLS tries to estimate total employment in one month  total employment in another  and subtract the two to determine the difference  When you are talking total payroll employment of over 130 million jobs  even small errors are in the range of 100K jobs or more  Meanwhile  smaller discrepancies from expectations are unwisely viewed as significant  Competing Estimates The BLS report is really an initial estimate  not the ultimate answer  What we are all looking for is information about job growth  There are several competing sources using different methods and with different answers ADP has actual  real time data from firms that use their services  The firms are not completely representative of the entire universe  but it is a different and interesting source  ADP reports gains of 216K private jobs   Steven Hansen at Global Economic Intersection endorses the ADP method over the BLS result   He has a    For those who really want to understand the jobs story  it is well worth reading TrimTabs looks at income tax withholding data  The idea is that this is the best current method for determining real job growth   TrimTabs   down from their revised January estimate of 181 000    Their real time estimate was for a gain of only 45 000  but they came forward and  that threw off their forecast   There have been a number of changes in the tax withholding rules  so let s cut them a little slack and give credit for being honest about what happened and their methodology   They provide a useful additional method  Economic correlations  Most Wall Street economists use a method that employs data from various inputs  sometimes including ADP  which I think is cheating    you should make an independent estimate   I use the four week moving average of initial claims  the ISM manufacturing index  and the University of Michigan sentiment index  I do this to embrace both job creation  running at over 2 5 million jobs per month  and job destruction  running at about 2 3 million jobs per month   In mid year the sentiment index started reflecting gas prices and the debt ceiling debate rather than broader concerns  When you know there is a problem with an input variable  you need to review the model  For the moment  the Jeff model is on the sidelines    He looks just at initial claims and the employment report  and gets a very bullish result  a gain of 354 000 jobs   He finds a strong correlation over the last ten years  much better than I found in a longer time period when I built my model My guess is that this method is a little high  but I endorse the approach  Conclusion There was an  of the ADP versus BLS issue yesterday morning on CNBC  Joel Prakken  the Chairman of Macroeconomic Advisors is the featured guest  explaining how he has been so accurate in forecasting net job growth in recent months  The entire interview is interesting  and provides insight into how a top private economic modeling group uses data to improve estimates   Prakken is very practical in accepting that the recovery is only starting the long haul to regain 6 or 7 million lost jobs   He sees a job gain in line with ADP estimates  they helped to design those methods  and a downtick in the unemployment rate  Their data show that 125 000 jobs gained per month are necessary to tread water on unemployment  so anything above that makes some progress on reducing the unemployment rate Trading ImplicationsWhat does this mean for our trading and investing For investment accounts  I have been using the last two days as an opportunity to establish positions in favored names for new accounts and for enhanced yield while we can sell high volatility in calls For trading accounts it is reasonable to be more cautious   My experience is that you never miss much on employment Fridays   Even the strongest numbers get plenty of negative spin in the early going  that shorts can cover without much loss    You can count on Rick Santelli to check his email  as he did last month when the data seemed strong on all fronts  to learn what bloggers are saying about birth death adjustments  seasonal adjustments  labor force participation  or something similar   He will then explain why any progress can be characterized as completely bogus   These arguments might not prevail in the long run  but you only need a little time to get flat  and Rick has your back I make this observation not as a criticism  since everyone has a role and an audience   It is merely an observation about how this monthly drama plays out  told by someone who has watched it for many years   It used to be more dangerous to be short  but not so much in the age of the Internet If you agree with the thesis that the investing world is too bearish on the economy  there are many good leveraged plays for a rebound including Caterpillar  CAT   Cummins  CMI   and Allegheny Technologies  ATI   long all three  ,Jeff

CAT,2012-03-14,Since October I have been urging yield oriented investors to combine the selection of good dividend stocks with covered calls  This system has been working very well  and readers have asked for more information about how to make these trades  At the risk of giving away some information about our specific methods  I have decided to go into more detail   I hope that readers find it helpful in meeting their risk reward objectives  Background The combination of dividends and call premium will yield 10  returns     whatever happens to the stock   If your time frame is a few years  and your stock picks are reasonable  you need only break even on the stocks to get a return that will solidly beat bonds and inflation   On a total return basis you can aim to double your portfolio in eight years or so  without getting unduly aggressive  This is a sweet spot for many investors You can do it  but it will take a little work  I have already covered several key topics in prior articles in this series  You will do best if you check out the past articles as well as this one   If you want this to work  don t cut corners  Picking Dividend Stocks A great dividend stock must first be a great stock  Too many investors just screen for high yield   Many of these stocks trade as a function of the yield   It is like buying a 100 year bond   If you think that bond yields are going higher  these stock prices will go lower   Here is the chart I ran in  If the only idea you got from this article  November  2010  was buying Caterpillar  CAT   you were in at 80  Other stocks at the top of a pure yield screen might include companies about to cut the dividend since their payout ratio cannot be sustained by the earnings  When I am picking stocks I get ideas from many sources  With ideas in mind  my most important screen is earnings based  since that will eventually determine price  I am a big fan of   where you can get a long term earnings history as well as many important metrics for stock valuation   I do not take any long term investment position without  talking to Chuck  via his site   Even if you are not a subscriber  and you should be   Chuck  many of his best ideas and screens with a complete suite of charts So we now have a list of stocks with reasonable  well supported dividends  Covered Calls In my original article on selling options against your stock positions  I did not focus on dividend stocks  I did a careful description of stocks that fit the profile  Some stocks that I liked but were not suitable for covered writes  Apple  AAPL   then trading around 318  was not suitable because we did not want to cap our upside   Other names were just fine  including my example of Noble Energy  NE  although I said the Microsoft  MSFT  was also a good candidate   The article goes into some detail about sources and how to find the right call to sell  Putting the Concepts Together about why investors should combine these two concepts to create a true total return  income portfolio   The basic idea is that you should not fixate on stock price movement   If you pick good stocks  collect dividends  and collect call premiums  you will achieve your target  Do not get too frisky on your stock selection  I had an interesting section in this article  which I called   Do You Qualify   Here is the qualification test    hardly anyone can pass it  You cannot look at your brokerage statement  the daily mark to market  the monthly mark to market  or anything else for ten years  This is what you would do with a bond portfolio  You buy expecting to collect the coupon and the principal at maturity   It is a simple test  yet a difficult one  The bond investor does not worry about daily marks  Psychologically  people cannot do this with stocks  You should simply look at your statement and see if the combined flow from dividends and call sales are meeting the objective  Implementation    A Look Under the Hood I am going to share some  secrets  about how we are implementing this program  including some recent actual trades  Here are a few specific ideas that were not part of the prior articles  I am fussy about setting new positions   I do not mind holding cash for a bit while looking for the right opportunity  A good pick includes the following A stock that meets the dividend requirements described above A near term option sale that would generate nearly 1  per month if the stock had no move A reasonable bid ask spread on the option   I have the advantage of being able to split the market in many cases  but you can try the same thing if your broker permits spread orders An option sale that will compensate you fully if the stock is called away at expiration   This normally means that you get  an immediate payoff of 2  or so plus the call premium if the stock rallies   You need a broker that does not soak you for an assignment on your short call I do not worry about losing stock positions in the current environment  There are plenty of candidates  Examples To illustrate  here are some trades that we actually did last week for this program  Bought Abbot on March 6th   ABT  for 56 57 and sold the April 57 50 call for 57 cents  If the stock had done nothing  we would have collected  a nice call premium as well as waiting for a dividend  Given  the rally  we might just ring the cash register with a gain of 97 cents on the stock and 57 cents on the call premium    almost 3  in about six weeks  Bought Conoco on March 5th  COP  for 77 41 and sold the April 80 call for 94 cents If the stock does nothing we again get a good premium  If it is called away on April expiration we make  2 59 on the stock and  0 94 on the call  for a total of  3 53     5  in less than two months  There are other similar trades  This shows why we can afford to wait for good opportunities  I go shopping on days where the market declines sharply  offering good stock prices and high call premiums  My target is eight positions  but we sometimes have a smaller number when the market is not cooperating  Conclusion You can do this on your own if you have the right resources  the right broker  and watch the market closely   You must also be patient  When options expiration comes  you may have some new decisions about whether to  roll  your short calls or look for new opportunities  I ll discuss this more in the next installment  Disclosure  I still own the mentioned stocks    AAPL  NE  and CAT    as well as the specific option positions ,Jeff Miller,0.016,0.853,0.131,0.9992
CAT,2012-03-14,T2108 Status  73 VIX Status  14 7 General  Short term  Trading Call  Strong bullish bias   see below for more details and an explanation CommentaryS P 500 delivers one of its more signficant breakouts in a long timeApple  AAPL  is climbing to infinity and beyondA picture can say a 1000 words  and a stock chart can broadcast a 1000 lessons  I started this T2108 Update with these two charts because  in my mind  they perfectly symbolize the bullish significance of yesterday s trading  Buyers FINALLY stepped up in force to power the S P 500 higher  The 1 8  gain on the day featured higher than average volume  a breakout to near four year highs  and a close at the highs of the day  The market simply cannot get more bullish than this on a single trading day  A stellar trifecta  Apple  AAPL  clearly led the way for the bulls  the main differences are the ALL TIME highs on the winds of persistently strong buying pressure  Enjoy these pictures   I think it is rare to get such convincing breakouts  OK  Now that I got the excitement out of my system  I can wallow in my queasiness about this setup  T2108 re entered overbought territory after just a brief rest from   I was looking for the 7 8  sell off that has historically been the worst case scenario following extended overbought periods  I would have gladly bought with both hands under such a scenario  Instead  we got the equally likely 1 2  sell off  and I sat on the bearish T2108 bearish portfolio  I braced for a breakout  but hoped for more churn to give me more time to mentally adjust to the bullish implications of the shallow sell off  Instead  we got the most bullish breakout possible in very short order  In other words  I have not had a chance to get comfortable with the stark reality that it is time for a change in strategy  and this situation leaves me queasy Here is a partial reminder of the strategy I outlined for this period in the last T2108 Update  Going forward  I will be maintaining the current bearish configuration  SDS and VXX shares  as a hedge to this trend following strategy  I want to keep this component in place in case some black swan swoops in to deliver an extreme counter punch  In parallel  I will be aggressively executing swing trades  duration of 1 to 3 days or so  in the indices AND individual stocks  using shares and options  I will particularly focus on fading any and all pops in VXX with put options  The weekly chart reminds us that VXX s ultimate fate is always lower prices  I may drop VXX shares altogether if for some reason I am not able to stay ahead of losses with VXX put options  During the current VXX downtrend  trading these puts  has  consistently delivered attractive profits for me  but not in the T2108 portfolio unfortunately    I recommend reading    for understanding why the current crop of volatility products perform so poorly over an extended period of time   I expect the S P 500 to grind its way higher and higher over the coming weeks and months  but it should feature constant shifting in and out of overbought periods rather than another extended overbought period  While the bias will be for more upside  the churn will remind us  or at least me  of the on going downside risks  Bears will find themselves constantly frustrated  and bulls will find constant relief  However  the historical data also suggest that this next bullish phase will NOT end as well as the first one  In fact  we should expect an outcome very similar to the extended overbought periods of 2009 and 2010  That is  at the end of this road is hiding somewhere the next calamity  This time  it will be something none of us are thinking about and or worrying about  Yes  I just feel more comfortable thinking about what can go wrong To kick off this trend following  I executed two aggressive trades  calls and shares in Caterpillar  CAT  and calls in CSX Corporation  CSX   I previously discussed the bearish implications for the divergence in performance of the two stocks  I even cautioned in a separate post that CAT may have printed an ominous breakdown  Yesterday s bullish trading action invalidated the warning CAT is now poised to follow Apple s lead and break to fresh all time highsIn this next bullish phase  I fully expect CSX to play a lot of catch up  a slowdown in coal is hurting CSX  and for CAT to represent one of the favorite ways for big buyers to play an on going recovery in the U S  and global economy I consider these trades to be my first trial balloons of the shift in strategy  I am looking for confirmation that the S P 500 is truly embarking on a fresh trend  This confirmation should come with a bullish follow through day within the next week or less WITHOUT the S P 500 completely reversing yesterday s breakout  Breaking the lows of yesterday will call into question the breakout  I plan to stay flexible and nimble  especially since I am now traveling a bit away from my traditional comfort zone Finally  note that I have written about many bullish scenarios in the past few months  These areas will also be my focus on any future buying setups  commodities  housing  insider buying  and special

CAT,2012-03-15,T2108 Status  63 VIX Status  15 3 General  Short term  Trading Call  HoldCommentaryT2108 dropped so far and so fast  I had to write an email to the good folks at Worden just to verify the numbers  They indeed verified that T2108 is at 63   This is an incredible fall of 10 percentage points from Tuesday s overbought reading  especially given the S P 500 essentially remained flat with Tuesday s close Normally  I would call this a HUGE bearish divergence  it suggests that once again the rank of leaders driving the index higher are thinning out  However  I am quickly reminded that the historical data tell us that the path higher from the previous extended overbought period will be full of churn and frequent trips in and out of overbought territory  So  I am reserving judgment for at least another day  Follow through selling tomorrow will raise my yellow flag higher  And  of course  a complete reversal of Tuesday s impressive breakout  puts me right back into a pool of skepticism about the rally Given Wednesday s overall performance  it is no surprise that my bullish  trial balloons  received no love  I should have stuck with Apple  AAPL   CSX Corporation  CSX  sunk like a lead balloon and is once again hovering over critical support  The on going weakness of transports continues to hang like a dark cloud over the picnic  CSX is again dangerously close to breaking support   and throwing cold water on the partyCaterpillar  CAT  underperformed with almost a 1  loss  I am looking for follow through in CAT to confirm my reasons for being bullish The VIX attempted to bounce from its lows  As promised  I bought puts on VXX in response  This trade reminded me how I let go of my previous tranche of VXX puts too early Finally  the MOST interesting action of the day happened intraday  Out of nowhere  the S P 500 dropped just as momentum was building to close at fresh multi year highs The S P 500 s momentum hits a brick wall but buyers rush back in by the closeThe intrigue intensified given Apple  AAPL  fell in tandem  The stock had just rallied 10 points in about one hour before the wheels seemed to fall off in a climactic sell off  In a testament to Apple s core strength  pun intended    does not even show a hint of the drama  Apple gapped up on the day on high buying volume   exactly the kind of bullish confirmation you want in a strong trend such as Apple s  After Apple dipped to a new low of the day  the buyers rushed in and almost succeeded in returning Apple to its high of the day by the close For a while there it looked like Apple was ready to print another bearish reversal  The buyers did not waste much time this round Apple is so huge that I now habitually check the stock whenever some major movement happens in the general market  A friend of mine who is a longtime Apple shareholder  lucky guy   was crying crocodile tears about how Apple s rally is not all that impressive given the  average  daily gains for most of this time  As part of my rebuttal to convince him to get excited about his good fortunes  I used to generate the following list of Apple s ranking in performance against its big cap cousins in high tech over time 5 year   2  SXCI is  1 1 year   2  EQIX is  1 6 month   63 month   31 month   51 week   31 day   3Now MY tears are very real  I sold my Apple April  590 call three weeks ago to lock in profits and prepare to buy at lower prices  The darn thing has increased in value 10 TIMES since then Charts below are the latest snapshots of T2108  and the S P 500  Refresh browser if the charts are the same as the last T2108 update Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Full disclosure  long SDS and VXX  long VXX puts  long CAT shares and calls  long CSX calls  long Apple calls in spirit,Dr. Duru,0.041,0.834,0.126,0.996
CAT,2012-03-21,T2108 Status  59 VIX Status  15 6 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold with a bullish biasCommentaryTwo strange things happened Tuesday  1  T2108 fell again even as the S P 500 remained just a few points away from multi year highs  2  VXX  the volatility  VIX  ETN  fell significantly again  on high volume  even as the VIX gained slightly Ever since T2108 finally fell from historic overbought conditions on March 5  the S P 500 has GAINED 3 0   T2108 has spent just one extra day in overbought conditions over the two subsequent weeks  Until Tuesday  the S P 500 GAINED every single day after that 1 day overbought period ended  I consider all this behavior further confirmation of the continuing bullish bias in the market  With T2108 now at 59   there is plenty of headroom for another return to overbought conditions  not to mention another extended stay as T2108 s history suggests is likely to happen Tuesday delivered the morning drop in the S P 500 that I was hoping for on Monday  Per current strategy  I targeted a low point for loading up on SSO call options  I thought the S P 500 might actually reach a 1  loss  but downward momentum soon ended  Once I made that assessment I bought 40  of the SSO calls I wanted and left an order for the remaining 60  at my lower offer  The S P 500 never looked back for the rest of the day  Here is a 15 minute chart of SSO Note well how little time I had to decide to settle for a higher than desired price on the SSO calls  Although I paid more than I wanted  the weekly Mar 23  12  58 calls finished the day 25  higher  making me of course grateful I stuck by the strategy to buy  something  on the dip  I will likely sell these calls on Wednesday given the Friday expiration  Moreover  stochastics on the S P 500 have flipped firmly overbought making this trade all the more risky or at least tricky   Recall that in trending markets  stochastics can stay overbought oversold for extended periods of time  Before I move on to VXX  I want to flag Caterpillar  CAT  as the suspicious character in a room full of bulls  CAT closed down over 2   finishing the day on top of its 50DMA support on strong selling volume  The stock s rally now looks increasingly exhausted to me  It failed miserably to re challenge its all time highs even as the S P 500 continued to motor upward  I am taking it off my select list of stocks to buy on dips  In fact  it probably makes sense to aggressively short CAT  particularly as a hedge against other bullish positions  CAT must retake the  114 level to invalidate my growing bearish bias toward it I sold my latest round of puts on VXX as it hit fresh all time lows at  20  VXX went on to lose over 6  on its way to an all time low of  19 32  My profits from VXX puts are barely keeping up with the losses on the shares  Anyone trying to use VXX to hedge passively or even profit from a major sell off must be increasingly questioning the decision  I am not sure how much lower VXX needs to go before a climactic  and temporary  bottom gets carved  but it could take a while as   A lot of heads are likely getting scratched as VXX s big losses are occurring even as the VIX stabilizes with slight gains  This behavior is a stark reminder of the near uselessness of VXX as a way to play the VIX when it is not trending  strongly  upward  I am assuming that VXX is losing out to a sharp contango condition as its caretakers frantically roll over volatility futures  For more on this destructive dynamic read     Per current strategy  I will be looking to reload on puts on the next pop in VXX  I will wash  rinse  and repeat as long as VXX keeps sliding on its vicious downtrend  The VXX shares only remain on the books as a  just in case  something crazy happens overnight  VXX  along with SDS  is still enabling me to maintain the conviction to trade aggressively with call options on SSO and certain individual stocks Charts below are the latest snapshots of T2108  and the S P 500  Refresh browser if the charts are the same as the last T2108 update Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes ,Dr. Duru,0.113,0.809,0.078,-0.9793

CAT,2012-03-22,Two weeks ago  the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund  FXI  broke down below its 50 and 200 day moving averages  DMAs  just 5 6 weeks after an important breakout above these MAs  Buyers seemed to treat this as an opportunity to get into FXI before the breakout move resumed  Over the past two days  FXI has broken down again  Will buyers step up one more time This breakdown is one of those  obvious  technical setups that frequently gets faded to trap traders that are a bit too quick on the trigger  The quick recovery two weeks ago was an excellent example of this action reaction  With   this breakdown seems a lock for follow through  However  this is still the  obvious  move  so I am not interested in pressing a short or puts or FXP  the inverse of FXI  until I see a new low for this week  In the meantime  I am panning out the chart to recognize that FXI has been under performing for a while  The weekly chart below shows that FXI printed a very marginal new post crash high in November  2010 and has cascaded lower ever since  It is very possible that traders have been pricing in a slowdown in China for quite some time  The final confirmation of such a slowdown may provide a catalyst for a rally  and NOT a new bear market  Either way  I will be watching developments closely  While FXI only contains 25 stocks and is not a great proxy for the Chinese market  it is one of the better options U S  traders have to play China directly  From that perspective  I find it useful  For an additional reference point  I am watching machinery and industrial giant Caterpillar ever more closely  As I mentioned in my last technical review of the market  CAT s rally is starting to look exhausted  Yesterday s break down below the 50DMA is one more confirmation of that suspicion  While I still hold shares and call options  I moved in on puts in fellow machinery company Terex  TEX  as a first test of the blooming case for the bears Finally  on a quick sidenote  I am also watching the Japanese yen as another signal that the market is starting to really worry about China  The yen has been sold nearly non stop for six weeks now  If a strong bid returns to the yen  look out Be careful out there Full disclosure  long CAT shares and calls  long TEX puts,Dr. Duru,0.075,0.858,0.068,-0.4604
CAT,2012-03-23,T2108 Status  49 VIX Status  15 6 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold with a bullish bias  important caveats noted below CommentaryT2108 dropped to its lowest point of the year and lowest point in three months  Yet  the S P 500 had another mild selling day losing a fraction of a percent  T2108 is dropping quickly even as the S P 500 is ONLY 1 2  below its closing multi year highs set at the beginning of this week  T2108 was last overbought for just one day on March 13  on that day  the S P 500 made its big breakout move  The index is now just returning to the close of that day  I continue to interpret this stark divergence as bullish  At the current rates  T2108 will print oversold conditions just as the S P 500 finally returns all its gains from the breakout  That moment will mark one of the more critical bear vs  bull junctures we have observed in a very long time  Even the steadily rising 50DMA may serve as support for that moment The slow drip of the S P 500 has done no damage yet to the overall trend and setupIn   I noted that at 59   T2108 signaled the potential for further upside in the stock market simply by virtue of the strong likelihood of a return to overbought conditions  However  I failed to outline the scenario for a return to oversold conditions first  So  if you prefer to be bearish here  it is far from too late to enter a new position  However  I am guessing the potential returns are very small  Reversing the breakout move from here implies 1 7  downside in the S P 500  Since I am still holding plenty of SDS  and  UGH  VXX  as hedges  I am not interested in getting even more aggressive with the bullish portfolio  Instead  I continue to focus on buying dips and flipping calls in SSO  the ProShares Ultra S P 500  and buying VXX puts  which got a lot more expensive with today s ugly collapse of TVIX    I bought two tranches of SSO calls today  I will buy more calls if the S P 500 drops another 0 5  to 1 2  or so  IF the S P 500 s breakout is completely reversed into a false breakout  all bets are off for the bullish case  In such a scenario  I will expect T2108 to be a very handy guide for navigating trading from that point  For now  I am not expecting a complete reversal  Last night    the iShares Xinhua 25 Index Fund ETF given all the angst being spilled over a fifth consecutive contraction for Chinese manufacturing  In that post  I stated I could not get interested in the bearish case for FXI unless it closed at a new low  Well  it did  On heavy volume  So now FXI is officially on the bearish list even though I am positioning bullishly for the S P 500  Similarly  Caterpillar  CAT  continues to fade on heavy selling volume  If I did not have the bullish bias  I would have chased CAT on yesterday s break below the 50DMA  If it breaks to a new low for the month  I will have to officially put it on the bearish list as well  In the meantime  I am holding onto puts on Terex  TEX  which I think has a LOT of downside potential if somehow the selling and bearish sentiment turns ugly  Reviewing FXI reminded me that I have not looked at stock charts from Europe in a very long time  I was surprised by the very mixed bag of performance and could not come up with a unifying theme except that nothing that I looked at  from stocks to ETFs  had returned to multi year highs  Some country ETFs like Spain  EWP  and Italy  EWI  are so far away from that milestone  I cannot even imagine when they will gather enough momentum to retest those lofty levels  Even the Germany ETF  EWG  remains 21  below 2011 s high although it is up a nifty 20  this year  In other words  Europe is full of bargains which could look even better if a sell off in the U S  drags everyone else down  I will be waiting with open arms on the next Eurozone sell off  for some more context  see      Here are weekly and daily charts  respectively  of Siemens  SI  to further deliver the point of Europe s poor relative performance Siemens is struggling to regain its former momentumSiemens runs into stiff resistance at the breakout line AND the 200DMASiemens  SI  is up 7 3  for the year but is more than 40  off its recovery highs set in 2011  SI recently broke out for the third time in about six months over its 2010 breakout line  Siemens is a great example of the market s memory regarding breakouts and the kind of selling that can occur after the market watches the entire breakout disappear  This time around  the sharply declining 200DMA added to the stiff resistance to gains above this line  SI is already at its critical juncture  Fail this latest test  and I strongly suspect the stock will drop to the lower 90s in short order I conclude with a little forex  foreign exchange     Even more interesting now is the almost direct correlation between yen STRENGTH and stock market weakness  Trading in the yen is once again a useful barometer for the market s current risk appetite  The chart below shows the recent run up in USD JPY  you can also see the decline in the yen ETF FXE   The days of market strength in the yen versus the dollar  the red bars  correspond to all the bigger down days in the market over the past two months  I have marked the S P 500 s daily performance at the related points  USD JPY  title  USD JPY  width  500  height  350  Lately  days of yen strength have tended to correspond to days of S P 500 weaknessAgain  the labels of performance on the chart refer to the S P 500 s performance on the given day  Out of five RARE episodes of yen strength  where USD JPY drops   the S P 500 was markedly down on three of them  On another day  the S P 500 sold off only to bounce back completely for a flat close  These correlations make me wonder whether the Japanese yen is getting sold  borrowing at low rates  to buy stocks  This is just speculation for now  but something to consider So  overall  I am maintaining my bullish bias and feel much better about it with T2108 a full 20 percentage points away from overbought levels  Recall that my bullish bias is based on I will continue to flip quickly in and out of SSO calls and VXX puts as I expect the market to churn a lot up and down before T2108 gets  resolved  to oversold or overbought  If the current pace continues  T2108 could be oversold sometime next week  HOWEVER  T2108 is developing a VERY curious trend  The daily chart posted below at the time of this post shows T2108 making a series of higher lows since the gut wrenching lows of last summer  This trend will only hold up  if T2108 stops its losses between 40  and current levels  If the S P 500 s breakout is violated at the same time T2108 flips oversold  I will have a really challenging decision to make Charts below are the latest snapshots of

CAT,2012-03-28,I hate static price targets   Hate them  Most of the research we read or see on TV is a bureaucratized and sanitized version of analysis  The firm determines something  and that is the official version for public consumption  Those who pay no attention to changing conditions add no value for investors  Did you notice that things are better in Europe  That economic data have improved  If not  perhaps you have the wrong approach to your research  You need to be flexible  responding to new information   Most of those who claim success at market timing are exaggerating  If you missed  that showed how to check track records  please take a look  Examples  A big time firm sets a price target for a stock  The stock rallies and hits the target  Then they move the target up by 20    How helpful is that  Suppose it goes the other way The stock sells off and the firm lowers the target while retaining a  buy  rating   How helpful is that  This is why I do not follow analyst price targets for stocks  I review their research and I draw my own conclusions  I revise my price targets each week   I review my most recent expectations for corporate earnings and cash flow and compare this to the current price  the market multiple for similar stocks  the multiple for the overall market  and the return from alternative investments  Isn t that what you would do if you took the time  I described the flawed process of big firms in    By contrast  I described my own approach for our Great Stocks program   Analyst reports can be very helpful There is a lot of information about the business model  recent trends  and risk factors   Reading several reports can help in identifying the consensus  especially what the analyst community is worried about   Knowing these concerns can help you anticipate upgrades and downgrades  I use the raw data to set my own target prices  and I review the targets frequently  I select stocks with a target that is at least 25  higher and with attention to near term catalysts and risks   I have found that this is a good level for a goal  understanding that it will be achieved only some of the time   Trying for home runs is tempting  but not as effective  I almost never own a stock at the time it hits a target   This may seem strange  but consider two cases If the stock makes a big move  but the fundamentals have not changed  it no longer has the potential for an additional 25  gain over the next twelve months  I sell and move on to something that meets my criteria   I sell these stocks before the target is reached If the stock makes a big move and the fundamentals keep pace  the target is moving as rapidly as the stock price   This enables me to hold stocks like Apple  Current Investment Implications As the first quarter of 2012 draws to a close  there is a fierce competition to call the market top  I watch the entire spectrum of opinion closely  At the risk of oversimplifying  I will suggest two broad viewpoints  Those with a static market target These observers started the year with an idea and they will not be budged   Members of this group share some or all of the following characteristics Using prices from ten years ago to determine current market values Excessive fixation on calendar effects Excessive attention to the length of past market cycles Substituting fake data  what they personally believe interest rates SHOULD be  what they think profit margins SHOULD be  using the discredited Shadow Stats  complaining about seasonal adjustments  and making other assorted excuses  Over emphasis on debt and austerity   and most importantly    Embracing a political viewpoint that excuses all other analytical mistakes Those who remain flexible  These observers are watchful and wary  but open to new data   Members of this group share some or all of the following characteristics Monitoring earnings expectations as the best guide for future stock prices Using long term data as the basis for establishing earnings growth and profit margins Understanding that there is no set time for a market cycle   A deep recession may take a longer recovery period   We might only be in the third inning of the recovery Accepting the reality of new data   No Excuses   No changing of methods   No rejection of seasonal adjustments after always using them in the past   Not starting with a pre conception and ignoring contrary evidence Recognizing progress   If a few months ago you thought that there was systemic risk from Europe and there would be a deep recession there  did you modify  your market viewpoint when this did not happen   The successful investor constantly adjusts for risk  using indicators like the St  Louis Financial Stress Index Ignoring politics   This is true whichever party is in power   It is part of the electoral process for the  outs  to disparage any signs of progress   If you want to succeed as an investor  you learn to ignore this background noise Conclusion and Current Ideas The two profiles provide a sharp contrast  Which fits your own approach  There are many stocks that are attractive despite higher prices   Why  The earnings potential has grown faster than the price  and the risk is lower  Some stocks that I see in this group are Oracle  ORCL   Apple  AAPL   JP Morgan Chase  JPM  and Caterpillar  CAT    These are a few illustrations  but there are many other tech stocks  deep cyclicals  financials  and health care names that are worth consideration ,Jeff Miller,0.102,0.787,0.111,0.9072

CAT,2012-04-11,T2108 Status  21 VIX Status  20 4 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold Commentary Looks like the market is swiftly reaching for my worst case scenario from yesterday s T2108 Update  Everything went wrong for the bulls yesterday as buyers have now officially lost control of the market s momentum T2108 plunged all the way to 21  yesterday  close to oversold conditions  I was anticipating oversold conditions  so I sold off all my VXX calls as planned  However  I decided to keep all my SDS shares  Given the worsening technicals  I will probably be more reluctant than usual to part with them  The S P 500 dropped 1 7  and crashed right through its 50DMA  The critical March 13th breakout is now decisively erased  This move converts the last month of trading into a likely false breakout that should serve as relatively strong resistance for a while  Selling volume also surged  For example  trading volume on SPY  the SPDRs S P 500 Trust Series ETF  surged to 235M shares  This is the highest trading volume since a bout of selling last December   I consider the SPY trading volume to be more reliable in FreeStockCharts com than the S P 500 trading volume The volatility index  the VIX  jumped back to levels last seen during March s swift pullback which just happens to be the launching point for last summer s steep sell off  The VIX is now at its own critical juncture as it sits just under presumed resistance but also now has the benefit of the doubt granetd by its breakout from the former downtrend The VIX has reached  escape velocity Given the awful technicals  T2108 should easily settle into official oversold territory today  This will only act as a final stamp of approval on top of the other signs I noted on Monday that suggested the market was already oversold  The HUGE problem going forward for T2108 trades is that the S P 500 is nowhere near anything we can pragmatically call a  low price   This means that bullish trades placed in these oversold conditions must be treated as short term or swing trades  The short term trades before this sell off had short leases because I executed them without an oversold signal  The authentic oversold trades get a short lease because the bulls and buyers have lost control of the market s momentum  and I have to assume that the resistance created by the false breakout will hold  This assessment will not change until the S P 500 returns firmly into the breakout area by reversing all of yesterday s losses   a close above 1384 on the S P 500  Until then  the bears and sellers retain the upper hand  Another implication of my more dour note is that it brings into play the worst case scenarios discussed in   At that time  I was VERY optimistic that it made sense to stick with the bullish history of extended overbought periods  Now  a worst case scenario of a double digit drop looms as a larger possibility  A 20  drop takes the S P 500 to a retest of last October s lows  But one step at a time I nibbled on some more SSO calls today  I fully expect that the few SSO calls I held from earlier trades will now expire worthless  my first batch to go out without a profit    I will likely soon switch to SSO shares instead of calls so that I need not worry about losing money from time premiums that erode as the market churns below resistance levels  I will be a little more aggressive with VXX puts once T2108 officially switches to oversold  Again  I will likely favor holding SDS shares throughout whatever difficult period seems likely  Probably only a return to the breakout area or a tremendous surge in volatility will convince me to sell these  Note that I also still hold FXP  the inverse of the iShares FTSE Xinhua China 25 Index Fund  I will likely sell this bearish position once T2108 goes oversold  I do not want to be net bearish in an oversold period  Finally  I am not likely to actively short until unless T2108 approaches overbought levels again  conditioned on the prevailing technicals of course  My  Caterpillar  CAT  watch  further confirms the bearish bias in the market  CAT closed today just above  100  Its downtrend from February highs continues  CAT s failed retest of all time highs looms larger and larger now as a red flag  I sold my puts in CAT s cousin Terex  TEX  given they expire next week I end with another look at the market s poor trading volumes  My  twitter buddy   fundmyfund tweeted with me yesterday   market up on vapor  down on volume  Since 2007 yes it makes no sense but the new era   Folks like us have long complained that low buying volume and heavy selling volume are bearish signals  Yet  the  vapor  has been solid enough to propel the market for miles and miles  However  an interesting article in CNBC yesterday provided a few explanations I had not yet seen or considered to explain the drop in trading volumes  overall   In     CNBC quotes analysts and data indicating that options volume has broken records for nine straight years  This suggests that equity traders are switching from stocks to options  However  as noted in     market makers must trade stock to offset and or hedge the options trades they support  So  the net impact on stock trading volume from a switch by equity traders should theoretically be relatively small The article also notes that  high frequency trading  which accounts for half of all market activity  has been on the decline since last summer   That decline is probably evident in the much lower volatility this year  This change is perhaps a good thing overall for everyone  Yet  this change does not explain the declines seen before last summer Finally  the article also notes that  Citigroup  C  alone accounted for 7 percent of all volume in the second half of 2009 before its 10 for 1 reverse split   In other words  simply by changing the amount of stock floated in the market  Citigroup may have significantly cut down trading volumes  Not to mention that the higher price points are less attractive to the  penny chasers  who prefer trading low priced stocks because of the number of shares they can command  This is an important point to remember when an index becomes full of low priced stocks as the S P 500 did from 2008 2009 Regardless  whatever the reason  until proven guilty  the persistence of low trading volumes remains a point of cocktail conversation  but it still has little bearing on our trading strategy Here is a chart from the article showing stock market trading volumes  Note the surges during times of duress in the market and the lack of volume during the times of rallies   I will cover more extensive data again in another post  You can also see my last analysis in     Charts below are the latest snapshots of T2108  and the S P 500  Refresh

CAT,2012-04-12,Whenever markets pull back for a few days  fear sets in  You see plenty of stories about how to protect your portfolio  what stocks will fare the best in a decline  and a parade of pundits explaining what is going wrong    In an election year  it is even worse    If you are in the market  what should you do  It depends        Are you a trader or an investor    Barry Ritholtz has a   emphasizing the importance of time frame and having discipline geared to your objectives  He includes a number of specific and helpful rules    Readers of  A Dash  know that I endorse this distinction  making it carefully in my weekly WTWA articles  Despite this  and just as Barry mentions  people wonder why my recommendations may diverge from my market commentary  Since I am managing five different investment programs  geared to different investor needs  the right move depends upon the program objective and the time frame    As Barry notes  investors should not try to  play the squiggles  based upon their preferred concept of long term valuation  This is consistent with my recent article showing that none of the big time pundits is very good at market timing      Traders versus Investors   There are sharp distinctions right now  with differing conclusions  Here are some of the key topics    The Fed and QE 3   Steve Liesman today offered this analogy  Suppose your doctor gave you a clean bill of health  Alternatively  suppose your doctor said that you were really sick  but he had a prescription for you  Which would you prefer    For traders  the analogy breaks down because they are all smarter than the Fed  They know that the economy is in dire shape whether the Fed realizes it or not  For them it is all about more QE  since they have become convinced that central bank money printing flows directly into stocks  It is a simple focus on Fed policy    Investors do better to stick with traditional economic policy and forecasts    The Natural State of the Economy   Traders seem to believe that the normal state of the economy is recession and this will occur as soon as government stimulus programs end  the  sugar high  wears off  or the  training wheels are removed     Investors should realize that the normal state of the US economy is is trend growth of about 3   In the absence of any policy  that is where we will eventually wind up  Specific policy actions may make it happen sooner or later  Right now there is a huge performance gap  as illustrated by Scott Grannis  Until the gap is closed  things will seem very negative    How to React to Selling   Traders need to game the system  anticipating how other hot money players will react and beating them to the punch  This can imply trading styles that either anticipate market tops or react quickly when they seem to occur    Investors should see short term selling as an opportunity to establish positions at favorable prices  This is a fundamental lesson from the Buffett school    use your own valuation  not the current market price    Interpreting Sentiment Indicators   Traders are intensely focused on sentiment  trying to identify  dumb money   everyone other than them   and take the opposite side    Investors seeking to establish new positions hope to find periods of irrational sentiment    Calendar Effects   Traders are in love with cycles and the calendar  They have scenarios and retracements and sometimes even astrology  If something has worked for the last year or two  it is expected to happen again unless there is evidence to the contrary    Investors make decisions on fundamental values  The perceived seasonal effects merely provide opportunities to establish new positions or lighten up on those that require rebalancing or selling  Mistakes   The mistakes come when traders and investors get confused about their roles    Traders should reduce positions in recognition of the message of the current tape  I agree  In trading accounts we are not guessing exactly how deep a correction might be  Instead we watch the evidence  Some traders may get impatient to  call a bottom  in a normal market correction    For investors it is quite different  Many have been frustrated for months by a market that moved relentlessly higher  providing no obvious points of entry  Now that there is some selling  these same investors may be unable to pull the trigger for fresh buys    In our investment accounts we have been waiting to add to positions and we have a shopping list  There are many candidates  Since we think that the short term perspective is wrong on Europe and the economy  we have been buying positions in energy stocks  strong cyclicals like Caterpillar  CAT   leading technology like Oracle  ORCL   and US banks poised to exploit selling by European banks    JP Morgan Chase  JPM   We also see Aflac  AFL  as a nice back door play in Europe     good earnings  great business  good dividend  but some holdings of European bonds  This is safer than buying Europe since there is less downside  and yet plenty of upside    Conclusion   Understanding your objectives and time frame is essential to market success  We often have completely different postures for our investment and trading programs    If you do not distinguish between trading and investing  it is easy to get caught in a Twilight Zone where you are always doing the wrong thing ,Jeff Miller,0.069,0.804,0.127,0.9956

their personal circumstances  but they are worried about everything else  When it comes to the stock market  the fear is palpable  Even the pros are struggling to get a handle on this market   Readers

confess that it seemed rather silly  As an academic who began an investment career with some basic confidence in the efficient market hypothesis   I  expected fresh information to be quickly reflected in market prices    I soon learned that this was not true  Warren Buffett  one of my heroes  and we all wish him the best  put it well when he said   I d be a bum on the street with a tin cup if the

margin    Current Worries   Let us turn from the old list to the most important issues raised by current market skeptics  Dick Green at Briefing com examines the most important  bearish arguments to ignore     Dick hits a number of themes that will be quite familiar to regular readers of  A Dash    Here is      The Bearish Arguments That Are Wrong   Three of the most persistent bearish arguments were highlighted in a recent article on a major financial web site     The arguments are  1       Market valuations as measured by Price Earnings  P E  multiples aren t low  2       The 10 year Shiller P E shows stocks overvalued  3       Profit margins are high and using a  normal  profit margin shows stocks are overvalued     I strongly urge readers to check out his article  He explains that these methods are backward looking  do not reflect interest rates  and assume that margins will mean revert without any corresponding change in employment or gross revenue    As I said    arguments familiar to   and profitable for  readers of  A Dash   A Final Thought   If you are an investor who is not mesmerized by fear  you will be able to join me in doing two things Finding stocks that  have strong anticipated earnings and cash flow Finding stocks with strong dividend yield The Wall of Worry is a difficult concept to explain  and even tougher to appreciate in real time  The daily stories seem so tangible     often augmented with TV video      For those in agreement on the economic theme and Europe  I like JP Morgan Chase  JPM   Caterpillar  Inc  CAT   Aflac  AFL   and Oracle  ORCL     The dividend yield concept is more challenging  since I have an ever changing roster of great dividend stocks where we sell calls to enhance the yield  Intel  INTC  and Abbot  ABT

CAT,2012-04-26,If you are reaching an important investment decision  I have a suggestion for you Insist on data    accept nothing less Investors should monitor diverse sources of investment information to avoid confirmation bias  If you want to succeed  you still need to engage in critical thinking  Some are in complete denial about progress  There is a simple solution if you do not like the reality of strong corporate earnings Talk about  normalized earnings  This has a wonderful scientific feel to it  lending an air of credibility to those who have not studied the subject  After all  don t we want our estimates to be  normal  If the current strong earnings reports do not fit your forecast  you can just say that you want to  normalize  earnings without offering any clue about your method or how it has worked in the past BackgroundWhen the recession hit  there were many observers who felt that even the finest companies would be crushed by the economic collapse  They expected that revenues would fall  expenses would increase  and profit margins would collapse Some of us thought that the best companies    not all    would learn to get  lean and mean  and would increase earnings rapidly during the rebound  We were right  and we have profited from this investment The increased earnings had a downside  since it often came at the expense of workforce reductions  with remaining workers asked to do more The RecoveryDuring the recovery period  the companies with enhanced productivity have blossomed    better earnings and better cash flows  There is a clear lesson Profit margins went higher as pricing power and employment went lower I disagree with some observers  sometimes accused of being perma bulls  who think that profit margins have achieved a permanently higher level  My own conclusions are 1 When 2 How far We should all be open minded about the eventual profit margin level  which is a function of  primarily  new competitive entrants  When it comes to a topic like    for example    unemployment    the bearish pundits are eager to embrace the idea that there have been structural changes  OK    and what about the many companies that are protecting their profit margins More importantly  I agree with the general concept that profit margins will decline  At the same time this  mean reversion  occurs I expect  all of the things we associate with a strong recovery    Better employment  better pricing power  and more aggressive competition from new companies There is nothing surprising about any of this  since it reflects a typical business cycle Time to call  FOUL  There is a group that I ll call Pundits in Denial  They engage in static analysis  expecting profit margins to decline while nothing else changes  As a result of this misguided analysis they help to scare the daylights out of the average investor by stating that if earnings were  normalized      what a wonderful word       then the market is massively overvalued How to NormalizeWhen I am analyzing a stock with cyclical properties  I definitely consider the earnings at peaks and troughs of the business cycle  This is one of the key elements of my edge  so most people have no idea about how to do this  If you are at a business cycle trough  you must be willing to buy cyclical stocks at a high P E multiple     and vice versa To do this correctly you need to have a good theory of the business cycle and where we are right now You cannot just take a meat cleaver to earnings  saying that you reject the data because of profit margins Investment ConclusionIf you want to gain an investment edge you have to find something that most people are doing wrong  Investing in cyclical stocks combines common errors on profit margins  economic strength  and where we are in the business cycle I have a current emphasis on this theme  but today presents an outstanding candidate in Caterpillar  CAT   I had several stocks in mind for this article  but CAT is the most timely   I am choosing it as the worst performing  and therefore the best opportunity  of stock fitting this theme  since the stock sold off today despite a good report   Here is the long term earnings picture  from the excellent  source  before today s report Any investor who looks at this chart for a minute or so will be far ahead of most of the people they see in TV   You can see for yourself the worst case of earnings during recessions  the general growth rate  the ability of the company to deal with recessions  and the current potential Nothing in today s report upset this story  so you get a chance to buy a terrific stock at a discount Once again  I abbreviated this story to cite the stock with the best current opportunity  Another candidate to feature in this story was Apple  but that would have been a layup   I hope readers understand that there are many  many stocks like this To repeat the main point     normalizing  profits is not as obvious as it first seems     More to come

CAT,2012-05-13,T2108 Status  35 VIX Status  19 9 General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold Commentary It has been another week since I wrote the last T2108 Update  and another week the market has churned  The S P 500 ended the week down a little over 1   clinging to the bottom of critical resistance support formed by the May  2011 highs and the index s last big breakout to new multi year highs Note that the stochastics in the chart show the S P 500 is very oversold  In fact  the index is now more oversold stochstically than at any other point this year  Yet  the oversold conditions have also persisted for a week without generating a bounce  I only show this as a reminder that being short the index is a bit hazardous  If T2108 flips oversold in the coming week as I expect  then I will position for a large subsequent bounce  A rally back to the May highs would be consistent with   A subsequent failure to break the May highs or a failed retest of 2012 s high would be consistent with a topping market    The volatility index  the VIX  is maintaining the suspense by hovering around the critical 21 level  As a reminder  this is the level at which 2011 s summer swoon began    The Caterpillar  CAT  watch is flashing a bright yellow warning sign as it finally broke below its 200DMA last week  CAT spent the rest of the week churning below this critical technical level  Follow through to the downside should at a minimum signal  or proceed  a tumble to T2108 oversold  I will interpret the failure of CAT to regain the upperhand over its 200DMA in an oversold bounce as a very bearish signal  A week ago I posted chart reviews on stocks that all looked very vulnerable  YELP  BIDU  and SFLY  The charts below show that they have all followed through to the downside With T2108 in the mid 30s  we know that there are many stocks falling off trend  This is a clear case where the major index hides the real story  The S P 500 is still just a few percentage points away from fresh multi year highs yet there appear to be many stocks breaking down  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200DMAs  continues to flag a longer term bearish signal  The chart below shows T2107 remains in a downtrend since late 2009  This suggests that slowly but surely  fewer and fewer stocks are participating in the general stock market rally  When this happened during the last bull market  one last rally threw me off the bearish scent  If history repeats itself  we will get another strong rally to break the current T2107 downtrend before things really fall apart  Note carefully that I thought 2011 would be that year  With an election in November  it seems even more likely that a rally could ensue in anticipation of election results  whatever it is the market will consider good versus bad at that time  Another key difference with the current T2107 downtrend is that the market has already experienced two major sell offs  These periods of angst were of deeper relative magnitude  measured by T2107  than what happened before the last bull market ended  It is very possible then that a lot of selling pressure has already been released from the market  In other words  while T2107 is alarming  it remains too early to make a conclusive statement about its implications  So  I will not again boldly predict the coming of a bear market after a final Fall rally  although  to a bear market BEFORE a fresh rally    The trading call remains a hold because T2108 is still not telling us much here  However  being closer to oversold than to overbought  I have continued to bias my short term trades to the bullish side  Moreover  I still see in the rearview mirror the massive and historic overbought period that began the year  I have bought SSO calls on dips to sell into the next rally  Last week  I let profits slip and ended up partially salvaging SSO calls that expired last Friday  The last small batch expire this coming Friday  I do not think those are well positioned if the market hits oversold this week  I am putting a hold on these purchases of SSO calls until T2108 falls oversold  In the meantime  I continue to find unique stock specific opportunities  both bullish and bearish  I have described these in other posts   Note   as of May 11  2012  some glitch in FreeStockCharts com is screwing up the overlay of the S P 500 with T2108  Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Be careful out there Full disclosure  long SDS  long VXX put  long CAT shares and puts  long SSO calls,Dr. Duru,0.048,0.901,0.051,0.8457
CAT,2012-05-16,Here is a surprise for you  European leaders did better than your favorite pundit  They will also do better in the future  For the last two weeks the dollar has moved higher versus the euro and stocks have moved lower    almost an unbroken string  The European story fit nicely with trader pre conceptions about selling in May  following the pattern of the last two  count  em   years  and the lack of more QE    Setting this up  was a revival of the disaster scenario    a 2008 style Lehman like event where banks would topple and the financial system would crumble  Everyone s favorite conspiracy website teed this up by multiple posts predicting a continent wide bank run  The leading CNBC commentators are bombarded with email and tweets from traders  In the modern age  the tweeters influence the content    The bank run story has gotten widespread play  with journalists all solemnly agreeing that a Greek exit from the euro would be a disaster    The traders and pundits see European leaders as clueless bozos who did not do what they thought was correct  and did not do it in the time frame they thought was right    Let us put aside that many pundits sought austerity while many others advocated growth  They all agreed that leaders were wrong for ignoring their recommendations    An Objective View   This is going to be difficult for most people  but try to be objective about the various parties in Europe  Here is the question    Has delay and bargaining improved things   Let us start by considering it party by party  Greece  Clearly improved  Negotiated a better deal on debt on round one  and in the bargaining for round 2  The citizens want to stay in the Eurozone and they want less austerity  They may well get both France  Much the same story  Some agreement to reforms followed by pushing back from voters Germany  Position improved from last year  There were concessions on political sovereignty and commitment to more austerity  Last year it was a cliff diving scenario ECB  Better now  The ECB exacted concessions for austerity and structural reforms before agreeing to more liberal lending  This was much better than caving in a year ago IMF  Better now  By bringing together various European parties  the story was improved and the incentive for the rest of the world to participate was enhanced  The IMF has not yet reached the target in raising funds  but it is doing much better than it would have a year ago  Wasn t that when DSK had his problems Other Potential Investors  Also better now than a year ago  I am still expecting China and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to join in  Why   Because it is in their self interest to do so  Europe is China s biggest trading partner  No nation benefits from a European collapse  The terms for involvement are better than a year ago  and the concessions from the various parties are better Turning from the particular participants to the collective  are things better or worse    In the best case  things are much better than a year ago  Banks have more capital  They have lending from the ECB  with the chance to profit on the spread    In the worst case  things are also much better  The original Greek debt with the threat of CDS payoffs was a major systemic threat a year ago  Those debts were negotiated  and things are a bit different  There are various current paths for Greece  Whether it is an exit from the EZ or another discount on debt  the stakes are lower than a year ago    Investment Lesson   This is a continuing story of compromise and negotiation  Each party is benefiting from the delay  So far  it has also helped the collective    Those complaining about  kicking the can  have been wrong  Those criticizing European officials have been wrong  Those predicting disaster have been wrong  Do you see a pattern  The mainstream media has a fixation for trader pundits who have all of the answers  even if they did not take Poli Sci 101  They translate everything into how they would do it in their own business     immediate and decisive action    No matter that the recommended actions are in complete opposition  depending upon the political predispositions of the pundit    Investment Conclusion   Markets can and do pursue irrational themes  You can almost guarantee that it will happen each year  When this occurs  the long term  Warren Buffett style investor should be prepared to step up    Mr  Buffett uses his own values and treats the market as giving him mis priced opportunities  This is a concept that some investors understand in theory  but few can implement    I have been following all of the Europe news closely  I will try to provide a range of useful perspectives in the next installment  At the moment  everything is on sale  I especially like cyclical stocks like Caterpillar  CAT  that do not even emphasize Europe  technology stocks like Oracle  ORCL   which has been very resistant to slowdowns  and growth stocks like Apple  AAPL   which seems to be trading in line with the dollar ,Jeff Miller,0.095,0.707,0.198,0.9985

CAT,2012-05-18,T2108 Status  18 9   Oversold day  1  first since Oct 2  2011  VIX Status  24 5 General  Short term  Trading Call  Start closing bearish positions CommentaryI hope you are wiping out the cobwebs  T2108 has not been officially oversold for seven and a half months  Today  T2108 dropped to 19  as the S P 500 plunged 1 5  to a 4 month low  It is now up only 3 6  year to date after being up as much as 12  or so for the year  It took 3 months to make the high for the year  one month to retest that high  and fail   and  so far  less than three weeks to erase the majority of the year s gains  Such is life in the stock market It is a strange feeling to go from predicting overbought 2 weeks ago to predicting oversold for this week  I was much more confident in the latest forecast because stocks look sooooo ugly almost everywhere I look  I have posted several charts of stocks breaking down in earlier posts  These technicals also make me suspect that this oversold period will last longer than average  or median   or the market will deliver a rapid sequence of short oversold periods Even T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200DMAs  is sliding fast and furiously  confirming that stocks are losing their uptrends and feeding bearish sentiment  Note the ominous setup in T2107 s chart from a longer term perspective  Note well how the S P 500 is able to continue trending upward for years even as its underlying fundamentals erode slowly but surely  the green line in the chart  The oversold rulebook is simple  All traders should start closing out bearish trades  Aggressive traders should start building bullish positions  informal rule is to add to positions on spikes in the volatility index   Conservative traders buy once the VIX increases 20 percent from the first oversold day  a rise to 29 8 for this cycle  or buy the first day after the oversold period ends  whichever comes first  I prefer to play the indices for these T2108 trades because individual stocks are not necessarily going to follow the overall pattern  Given the patterns repeating from the last two summers   a top in May and or a VIX shooting over 21   I anticipate very short lives for bullish trades  post oversold period   Only a wash out kind of day will make me think the market has put in a lasting bottom  This could occur in many ways  but the best for these purposes would be a tremendous spike in the VIX  especially coming at least within 20  of the last spike  a rise to 36 6 for this cycle   I summarize everything in the chart below I closed out some of my bearish positions into Thursday s selling  For example  I sold all my puts in Caterpillar  Inc   CAT  as it officially wiped out all its gains for 2012  It is now down 3  for the year  and I am very likely to dump my few shares into the next rally  I am still holding the June VXX calls  I am still holding all my SDS  stubborn position    I sold my Terex  TEX  puts last week   obviously  far too early  Today delivered the big drop  10     LONG overdue in my opinion  As a reminder  I consider TEX the poorer cousin of CAT  I could go on and on with the charts  but time is short  Please stay on the look out for future chart reviews for trading ideas  There are a LOT of fascinating charts getting printed right now    Tomorrow  Friday  May 18th  is a HUGE day because it is options expiration  AND the Facebook  FB  IPO rolls out  Here are my best guesses for likely scenarios tomorrow  I am thinking a lot of market makers sold puts that expire tomorrow  They have probably been scrambling to hedge and have added to the market s downward pressure  They should try to jam the market lower right from the open  most likely a gap down  Next  they should quickly unwind those positions  buying back stocks  on the cheap   in time to sell more into the euphoria over the Facebook IPO If the Facebook IPO goes well  it just might be enough to keep the market motoring into a positive close on the day  I will re evaluate my trading bias if this scenario plays out If the Facebook IPO goes poorly   that is  sellers begin right from the open and do not stop unloading   then we should count on a very ugly day indeed If the market gaps down  aggressive T2108 traders MUST buy at least SOME SSO shares  or even calls   especially if you did not start any positions Thursday  I placed a  lowball  order for June SSO calls  but the market closed with the bid sitting on my order unfilled  If we somehow gap up tomorrow  I will of course be very disappointed  but I do have some SSO calls expiring tomorrow that should be salvageable  How could we possibly gap up  Well  global markets are going to get a total of about 12 14 hours to absorb all the negativity from Thursday and the entire week  or two    It is easily possible that the selling and bearishness simply exhausts itself by the time the U S  market opens  the Nikkei closed down 3  after gapping down 1 7    yikes    If the foreign exchange markets deliver a major bearish move before the U S  open  I will bet THAT move will carve out a springboard for bullish sentiment to take over for the day  Regardless  I am more inclined to think we get a gap down     I will have to save my foreign exchange commentary for another post  Even as I type  market action is very fluid and volatile     I will end with a dirty analysis of a trade a friend proposed  an SPY straddle using the  131 strike for puts and the  132 strike for calls  SPY closed Thursday at 130 86   The idea is to start delta neutral  meaning that both sides of the trade start with an equal profit loss potential for the next  incremental  move in the stock   Presumably  implied volatility will rise with an increase in fear and you can profit on the puts while suffering minimal losses on the calls for a net overall profit  If that scenario occurred  I would sell the entire position and be done with it  However  if implied volatility does not help enough  then I would highly recommend selling the puts on the likely gap down scenario and then riding the calls as the T2108 bullish position  Note that I would have strongly preferred this kind of position with T2108 higher  at a higher level there is more room to maneuver and more time to think through reactions to changing market conditions  Good luck  my friend     Note   as of May 11  2012  some glitch in FreeStockCharts com is screwing up the overlay of the S P 500 with T2108   Be careful out there Full disclosure  long SDS  long VXX puts and calls  long CAT shares  long SSO

CAT,2012-05-25,Caterpillar Inc  CAT  is the world s leading company in the industry of construction and mining equipment  It has 18 years of increasing dividends  and for shareholders  it can deliver a nice return over the long run  especially if purchased at the right price    This article looks at Caterpillar Inc  a Dividend Contender  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures  In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs    Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Contender is defined as a company that has increased its dividend for a minimum of 10   24 straight years  Caterpillar Inc is a Dividend Contender that has raised its dividend every year for 18 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Contenders list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Contender list  Dividend Contender Caterpillar Inc   For more than 85 years  Caterpillar Inc  has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent  With 2011 sales and revenues of  60 138 billion  Caterpillar is the world s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment  diesel and natural gas engines  industrial gas turbines and diesel electric locomotives  The company also is a leading services provider through Caterpillar Financial Services  Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services  Caterpillar Logistics Services and Progress Rail Services  Caterpillar Inc  A Dividend Contender with 18 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past   Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Caterpillar Inc s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Caterpillar Inc has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 10 3   see purple circle on graph  per annum  Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1  The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2  The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Caterpillar IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 9 7  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Caterpillar Inc would have received an additional  61 076 44 in dividends that increased their total return from 9 7  to 10 8  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Contender it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 10 24  years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Caterpillar Inc is  94  which is historically normal Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Caterpillar Inc represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Contender at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Caterpillar Inc has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 17 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Caterpillar Inc long term earnings growth at 19   Caterpillar Inc has high long term debt at 65  of capital  Caterpillar Inc is currently trading at a P E of 10 5  which is outside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 22 8  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Caterpillar Inc s True Worth valuation would be  434 36 at the end of 2017  which would be a 32 9  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Caterpillar Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Caterpillar Inc s expected earnings would be 15 1 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Contenders Caterpillar Inc  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on Caterpillar Inc Summary   ConclusionsCaterpillar has been in business for approximately 85 years  With the dividend yield at an acceptable level for income investors  it s the current price that makes this company especially attractive for long term investors  Although the stock is somewhat cyclical  looking at today s price

CAT,2012-05-25,It s 1998  You re handed  100 000 to invest  The catch is you can t invest in individual stocks  You ve got to put it all in an index that tracks the performance of one of the following regions   U S   Asia  Canada  Latin America  Australia  Japan or Europe    What do you do    If you d chosen Japan  you d have made a 7  profit by November 2009  If you d chosen Europe  you d have done more than twice as well   a 20  profit  And you d have been much better off putting your money in Canada which would have given you a return of 113     But you could have done even better    If you d chosen Asia  you d have made a profit of 179  over the next 11 years  And  if you d chosen Latin America  you d have walked away with a profit of 347     You could have chosen to put your  100 000 in the U S    the biggest and  some would say  the strongest economy in the world  Your money would likely have gone into blue chips like Microsoft  MSFT   Caterpillar  CAT   or Wal Mart  WMT   instead of into foreign companies  You could have bought  Made in the U S A   instead of  Made in Mexico   But you would have made exactly zero profit    Believe it or not  between March 24  1998 and November 16  2009  the U S  S P 500 went absolutely nowhere  Not only that  but studies show that owning stocks in international companies can cut your risk in half  So  if you re thinking about where to put your money in 2010 and beyond  include some foreign exposure in your portfolio    But how do you go about investing in the best foreign stocks     Many foreign stocks simply aren t available to Americans because of laws and regulations governing the buying of stocks overseas  One way is to buy a fund that s listed on a U S  exchange  These allow you to capture international growth without traveling outside your hometown    But there s another way to capture gains in these fast growing economies   ADRs  American Depositary Receipts   ADRs prices are in U S  dollars  pay dividends in U S  dollars and can be traded like the shares of U S  based companies  Investing in ADRs has another important advantage   It allows you to easily diversity away from the U S  economy and avoid the mistake so many investors made when they bought in 1998 and held on    America s accelerating debt   expanding federal bureaucracy are bad for investors    The prevailing political climate will sink America deeper into public sector debt and a federal bureaucracy that s unlikely to be investor friendly  Developed economies are projected to have rising deficits and debt burdens in the next 5 years  on top of a much higher level of indebtedness  while emerging economies are likely to have falling levels of deficits and debt burdens with already much lower levels of indebtedness  High debt levels will continue to restrain growth in the West  while lower debt levels will support growth in emerging markets  Economic growth will be higher in emerging markets as those economies grow from smaller bases    Asia s the place to be    So  if you re looking to invest in places that offer organic economic growth   based on a savings and investment cycle  not rising leverage ratios like in the West    you have to invest in emerging markets  mainly Asia  The right emerging markets  like those in Asia  will outperform Western ones over the long haul as they have much better fundamentals  Pullbacks in Asia should therefore be viewed as buying opportunities ,Stocks on Wall Street,0.077,0.775,0.148,0.9931

CAT,2012-06-10,Let s talk about the stock market  Let s start with sentiment  Good old fashioned emotion  Who loves and who hates the stock market  Why do they  It s so interesting when you spend time trying to understand the human condition  How it s conditioned to react to stimulus over short and long periods of time  When times are good for the average person  they are likely to take it with a grain of salt  but unlikely to mix it up  If things are good  so be it  Maybe I m not trusting as much as I need to be  but I will trust it enough to stay positive  Things are good  then things are good  I accept it  Then we have the other side of the coin  Fear  When the stock market struggles for any period of time  folks grow sour  This includes even if a market doesn t go lower too much  When it stops going higher for any extended period of time  people lose faith very quickly  We have been dealing with a market moving mostly lower for a few months now  It s nothing terrible  at all  to be honest  just a correction to this point In this time frame we have seen the bull bear spread go from 30 7  more bulls to bears  down to 7 4  more bulls to bears  A tremendous move lower  not to mention that just last week alone we saw a 10  drop in that spread  That is very unusual and shows how time can erode human emotion if it doesn t get exactly what it wants  The spread is now single digits as I just mentioned  and although it usually takes an inverted number to get things rocking up  you can t dismiss the fact that we are in single digits  That can be enough to get the market moving higher  It s best if we re near a minus 10  reading more bears to bulls  but when it s only 7 4  more bulls to bears  things are getting there in favor of the bulls from a sentiment perspective Next up  there s hope  When folks sour out on things  they need to find a way to believe things will get better  It s no fun to live life with a totally negative view on everything  Whether it s about your job  family  or even the stock market  when things aren t going well  we tend to transfer our emotional energy to the world of hope  The hope that someone or something will come along and fix the problem  or problems  that is around for the moment  When that s the case with the stock market you have to turn your focus and attention to Mr  Bernanke  the hero of all printing machines known to all of us Turn it on Ben is rocking with free dollars  and is once again  promising that he will do whatever it takes to keep this economy moving along in a positive fashion  He s clearly not worried about the future  and neither is the average person  Hope means to give me what I need and to give it to me now  There s lots of hope out there  and folks want to be in the stock market  If you want to be in you can find a way to stay in the game  Hope is how you stay in the game  The Fed has not said a word lately to take that hope away  In front of congress yesterday  he said it loud and clear  He will do whatever it takes  That equals hope  my friend  Keeps people in the game Now the real culprit as to why the bears are having a very tough time understanding what in the world is possibly holding this stock market up  Considering the news from Europe  not to mention China  and other global headaches  one would think this stock market of ours would be in a massive free fall situation  It makes sense to me that all the bad news around the globe would equate to us being in a recession  and possibly worse in time  This would normally mean our stock market is heading lower and doing so quite rapidly  It isn t  The reason is interest rates  The Fed has made it such that you can t get anything on your money if you leave it in the bank or tie it up for the long term in low paying CD s  That s not what the average person wants for their future They want to think big  To feel that once they retire there will be real money waiting for them  This means they want to be in the stock market  Interest rates  if they were higher  would be great news for a rapidly declining market  and this would make the bears do the happy dance  Problem is rates aren t going higher for many years to come  This is the number one reason why all the bad news globally refuses to crush the market for now  There may come the day where the financial devastation is too overwhelming   and the market is forced lower in a very large way  However  it appears it ll take that kind of event to get things really rocking to the down side  All the problems to this point haven t allowed for this market to tank out the way the bears think it should  It s hard to blame them  The combination of sentiment  hope and interest rates keeping the bulls in the game for now There is always the risk that the worst case scenario will play out over time  possibly a financial catastrophe in Europe that spreads around the world  If that occurs  no sentiment  hope  nor low interest rates will be able to help things out  They may prevent a retest of S P 500 666  but market death would take place for the short  and medium term  A slaughter in the financials which would drag down the entire market  Why worry about how bad it would be simply because it would be bad enough  I don t know if that can happen based on government intervention  but it did once before  thus  it can again  So much is going to happen along the way  You don t know how things are going to work out in the end  but it s safe to say that there are some deeply serious problems out there  The risk is there for both sides making the market difficult to play at best  thus  keep it light Leading stocks are not leading still  Many in bear markets  such as Deere   Company  DE   and Caterpillar Inc   CAT   to name but a few  Apple Inc   AAPL  is hanging in there  but still struggling with 580 gap resistance  The commodity world is in a confirmed bear market  but in the end  only two numbers matter  1250 support and 1340 resistance  the long term down trend line off the March 2009 bear market lows  and the 50 day exponential moving average respectively  Only when one of those breaks with force and volume will a directional move occur  The bulls did some damage on that big open gap up from a few days back  1250 and 1340 is all you need to focus on big picture ,Investing.com,0.113,0.741,0.146,0.9941

CAT,2012-06-24,When nearly everything you see or read seems to carry the same message  it is time to take a deeper look  The prevailing mainstream thinking now seems to include an obligatory nod to the  mess in Europe  featuring their clueless leaders  the fiscal cliff  the recessionary US economy  and the upcoming hard landing in China    Wow   It does not take much to convince the punditry that investors should all step aside until after the election    It is reminiscent of early 2009  when everyone searched to explain relentless selling in the absence of any fresh news  I started writing a four part series and only finished three before things changed     When it is least expected  something might go right    I ll offer some more thoughts on this in the conclusion  but first let s do our regular review of the events and data from last week    Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead    There are many good sources for a list of upcoming events  With foreign markets setting the tone for US trading on many days  I especially like the comprehensive calendar from Investing com  There is also helpful descriptive and historical information on each item    In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios    This is unlike my other articles where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context    Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market    Last Week s Data   Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good   The US economic data last week was actually pretty good  The Greek election was the best possible news  opening the way for a reasonable compromise solution  The New Athenian is a great source   The Fed paved the way for further action  The official policy extended Operation Twist as I  and most others  expected  In the press conference  apparently ignored by many who heard what they wanted to hear  Bernanke was quite clear in stating that the Fed would not be stopped by politics  The disparity between the economic forecasts and stated objectives is clear    the subject of several questions  Bill McBride at  at the August 1st meeting  but he notes that others see a further delay  See also top Fed watcher  The Conference Board s leading indicators recorded a surprising gain  of 0 3  See  The most important housing data showed strength    especially building permits   See Calculated Risk for the   Bonus    is increasing  The G20 meetings were positive for the Europe situation  The coverage of these meetings in the regular financial media is so bad that it is almost impossible to track the progress  If you want to track progress  you need to have good sources  Here is a  from the Council on Foreign Relations  What were the main takeaways of the summit     The two key takeaways are  first  the additional commitment of funds to the IMF by the large emerging markets  which indicates that they have accepted to continue a longer term process of despite the Obama administration s inability to get Congressional approval for the 2010 agreement before the October 2012 deadline  Secondly  it is the detailed commitment of the euro area  which  will   rather than intend  or should   take all necessary measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the area  improve the functioning of financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks    Sentiment is more negative than in early 2009    Conditions in Europe have improved   You would never know this unless you looked at data instead of headlines   I read  to follow this news  and so should you  Spanish bond yields are the single simplest measure of progress  Scott Grannis notes this as well as swap spreads  adding more good charts  He  The 10 bps decline in swap spreads in the past week or so is impressive by itself  and more so since it takes swap spreads back to the levels of late July last year  when the Eurozone crisis was just beginning to heat up  The ECB s liquidity injections have managed to restore a lot of confidence and liquidity to the Eurozone financial market  and that is an essential first step to allowing the crisis to play itself out    The Bad   Most of the economic news reflected weaker than expected results  This continues the pattern of sluggish growth we have seen for several months   Even the highway bill despite bipartisan support    Earnings estimates are falling  The Q212 estimates for the S P 500 have declined dramatically     Dr  Ed  has a helpful chart showing  the decline for the quarterly estimates  The overall estimate is still a healthy increase over last year  but it bears watching The Philly Fed Index had an alarming decline   For years I have expressed little confidence in this indicator    one region  with no information on the sample  response rate  margin of error  etc   It also is a diffusion index  so it shows direction rather than level   We all know that the direction is lower   The market is pretty uncritical about this   See  for a comprehensive analysis and a lot more history Chinese Economic Data are Suspect   This is a repeat item from last week  but with    At the moment the concern is that the Chinese government  not known for Freedom of Information  might be overstating growth    Fair enough  but the motives and biases may not always be clear    There are many reasons for understating growth   They may simply wish to disguise motives   perhaps acquiring assets cheaply   Here at  A Dash  we are equal opportunity skeptics Home Loans are Declining  despite lower rates   The problem   Potential borrowers cannot qualify   The Ugly   Are the    Actually  I don t think this is bad news  but it was sent to me by one of the many active emailers who make sure that investors are able to find the worst in anything  The story about foreign purchases of US real estate is an old one for veterans  A highlight is the Japanese  in 1990    As long as the US has a trade deficit  our trading partners will make investments in US assets    The Indicator Snapshot It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators   The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions    The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses    Tim Duy has a   including the SLFSI and some alternatives  He has expert analysis and helpful charts    The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found   I ll explain more about the C Score soon  We are working on a modification that will make this method even more sensitive  None of the recession methods are worrisome  Bob also has a group of coincident indicators  Like most of the top recession forecasters  he uses these to confirm the long term prediction  These indicators are also not close to a recession signal    For comprehensive recession forecasting we recommend the RecessionAlert team  They have reverse engineered the ECRI approach and improved on the recession forecasting power  Since they have not gotten the mainstream recognition they deserve  you can still enjoy the advantage from their methods  You should consider s covering various time frames and GDP forecasting  They have also initiated a new service    the   If you like the ECRI approach  you can get an advance read before their weekly announcement  The most recent take on the ECRI approach suggests a 37  recession probability  If there is no improvement  there might be a warning in two or three months    still not close to the ECRI s own prediction     of the ECRI call  updates from fresh data  a list of sources  and the famous Short Charts that you would expect   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we switched to  bullish   Last week we noted that the  neutral  call was marginal  Remember that these predictions  although made each week  are supposed to represent expectations over the upcoming month     For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer     The Week Ahead   I was correct last week in my prediction both about the FOMC decision and the week long focus  This week has more possible themes  including the Supreme Court decision on health care and speculation about the European Summit    There are three housing reports including new home sales  Monday   Case Shiller home prices  Tuesday   and pending home sales  Wednesday   Taken together with last week s housing data  these could be interesting    In order of importance  we have the regular Thursday report on initial jobless claims  consumer confidence  Tuesday   personal income and spending  Friday   and durable goods  Wednesday   There are various regional Fed reports during the week  but they will be less important unless we get a big change like last week s Philly survey  The Chicago PMI is interesting as an early read on the national ISM number  especially when there is a weekend in between as is the case next week    Trading Time Frame   Our trading positions were unchanged last week  We remain 2 3 invested in long positions  Felix is not a range trader  but is excellent at getting on the right side for big moves  There are several highly rated sectors in the penalty box  while the inverse ETFs are at the bottom of the chart  I expect to add new long positions during the week    Investor Time Frame   The successful investment strategy differs markedly from trading  It is especially important to establish good  long term positions when prices are favorable  I tried to explain the most important concept for individual investors in this article about the Wall of Worry  I have had many emails from people who had a personal breakthrough in their investing when they understood this concept  If you missed it  I urge you to take a look  You can contrast this with the many  pundits who    The big threat is for investors is the apparent safety of bond funds  The consensus expectation is that rates are rising  as shown in this  from Doug Short   Each line represents the forecasts for a new year  You can see that the consensus of economists expects interest rates to move much higher  Unless you think you are smarter  you might want to pay attention    If that happens  I outlined last week why you should be worried about holding bond funds instead of individual bonds  It is the biggest investor threat right now    Right now the market is giving you two things  Plenty of great stocks that are as cheap as they were at the market bottom in 2009  on a price to earnings basis  To pick two examples  I buy Apple  AAPL  and Caterpillar  CAT  on day one for every new client  There are many others Good dividend stocks where you can sell short term calls  I am doing this as a  bond substitute  providing the yield we need in a low rate environment  I am targeting 8 9  returns on this approach  and achieving it through an up and down market cycle  You can  too  but it takes some work Investors who play these themes will do well  regardless of the headlines    Final Thoughts on Possible Surprises   The investor quest for yield has taken sector valuations to extreme levels  Take a look at this chart No wonder we see tech stocks as cheap    There are several sources for a surprise in the next few weeks  The Supreme Court health care decision will provide clarity  Business leaders have complained about a lack

CAT,2012-07-31,This is a challenging time for individual investors  I get emails from many who wonder what they should be doing  While I offer weekly updates in my Weighing the Week Ahead series  the advice is general  I am going to share several specific themes that flow from my regular analysis  While I am very careful in offering specific advice to clients  the themes that I am mentioning are worth consideration by everyone  Worry About Bond Funds  Investors have rushed into bond funds    mostly because of the perception of safety  In this article I explained why bond funds are risky  and why those needing fixed income should instead purchase specific bonds  Doug Kass has a record of some great calls on tops and bottoms  including stocks in early 2009  He now is calling a major top in bonds   From  and Barron s   Finally  my favorite short of the next decade is the U S  bond market  for those that possess deep enough pockets  have the fortitude and the patience  I am long ProShares UltraShort 20  Year Treasury  TBT   which is the inverse  double short bond ETF  Over the past 2  years  bonds have achieved a near 60  total return  A remarkable feature is the consistency of positive returns and the absence of many drawdown years of consequence  Nevertheless  they should be viewed as a return free asset class that is very risky  The 10 year yields under 1 5   less than half the yield during the recessions in 2001 and 2008  That means I am paying over 65 times earnings for a 10 year bond  a rich price even by Amazon s or LinkedIn s standards   Whether or not you join Doug in trying to profit from a rise in interest rates  you should be wary about absolute losses in your bond fund  Find A Growth Stock Everyone can afford to own a growth stock  Google  GOOG  is fine  If you chose Facebook  FB   you were too early  but your time might come  My favorite is Apple  AAPL   Oppenheimer s Carter Worth  who has also been getting some well deserved attention on CNBC s Fast Money program  had a helpful note on Apple last week   See your OPCO rep for access   He cited a very obscure fact    the number of times that Apple has declined 4  or more in a single day   Answer to follow  I have frequently noted the difficulty in trying to do short term trading in Apple  Those who sell have a problem finding a re entry point  The stock trades on news and psychology  with frequent gaps  Those who choose to sell find themselves faced with  chasing  a rebound or perhaps missing a major rally  If you subtract the  115 billion cash hoard and look at the P E ratio on the rest of the stock price  you see a low single digit multiple on a 20  growth rate  My own price target is  750  but it keeps moving higher   Carter Worth s answer  92 times in 10 years   I guess these were buying opportunities  as was last week s selling  It is notoriously difficult to time your entry in Apple    Find A Cyclical Stock The current market prices cyclicals as if we were at the peak of the business cycle  This means that the P E multiple is at a low point  ignoring the strength in earnings  Contrarian investors may choose to reject this notion  respecting the earnings strength of some of the leading companies  My favorite candidate is Caterpillar  CAT   The company announced great earnings  but like most others  refused to puff up future guidance  I really like this choice  Partly it is company specific  but I also think that we are in the early innings of an extended economic recovery    slower and longer than past examples  The market has excessive fear of recession and too much emphasis on the  average  length of recoveries  even though there are only a few relevant examples  The Fed has had the pedal to the metal for years to come  so this recovery will be slower and longer  Find Some Enhanced Yield For several weeks I have been citing the combination of buying dividend stocks and selling near term calls as the best deal the market is offering  You should be able to pocket 9  or so without any change in stock prices  Readers have asked what sort of trades I am doing  I have a method that is fussy about entry points  but many alternative approaches would work well  Here is an example trade that I made for clients today  In BlackRock Inc   BLK   we bought the stock at 171 and sold the September 180 call for  2 00  The stock is trading at a multiple of 13 or so with earnings growth over 20  The dividend yield is  recently confirmed  at 3 5   If the stock does nothing in the next two months you will pocket the call premium of  2 and a dividend of  1 50  for a gain of over 2   If the stock rallies enough to get called away  you will make 9 points plus the call premium  for a gain of over 6  in two months  If the stock declines  you will have a cushion from the call premium and the dividend  The system requires finding good dividend stocks  Many advisors suggest that this is enough  even without selling calls  so our  enhanced  method is a big improvement ,Jeff Miller,0.047,0.825,0.127,0.9968

CAT,2012-08-09,EUR USD dropped to just below 1 2300 today as the overhead 1 2400 50 resistance remains in place  GBP USD fades after yet another upside attempt on its second worst trade deficit reading ever Asian DevelopmentsDevelopments in Asia didn t trigger much activity  The market tried to get excited about the Australian employment report  but it was pretty much in line and the mean reversion back to a slightly positive number wasn t a big surprise after the terrible June data  The Chinese data was slightly worse than expected and I find it interesting that Caterpillar is exporting equipment from China to sell elsewhere due to slow demand as more interesting than the likely massaged official numbers  The Bank of Japan was effectively a non event for JPY  as USD JPY merely eased a bit higher as U S  treasuries sold off today  The BoJ warned of the risk of weak exports in the current environment to the Japanese economy and effectively passed on hints of further easing this time  U K  trade deficit was out at a near record level for the month of June    quite a contrast to the much stronger than expected U S  trade  deficit number today  which should give one pause when looking at the sloppy attempt by GBP USD to maintain a rallying stance  The EUR GBP fell as widespread complacency is the only thing holding cable from a test of the strategic 1 5250 support   width  638  height  505    Euro Periphery NewsA Reuters article today offers good coverage of Mario Monti s attempts to force the core E U  powers to bend a bit on their unwillingness to commit more to bail out the periphery  The article points out that one of Monti s strongest cards is  the terrifying spectre of a return of Berlusconi  who has openly suggested that Italy could survive outside the Euro   The stakes will only get higher from here  Meanwhile  Greek unemployment hit a new record at 23 1   But the Greek government was quick to say it would get its mid September tranche of bailout funds and there was word of a revival of plans to dismiss more workers from the public sector as part of the commitment to meeting reduced spending targets  The market wasn t particularly impressed by the news U S  Data The data today was another argument in favour of more wait and see from the Fed  as weekly jobless claims were out at a comfortably low level and a far smaller than expected trade deficit in June argued for slightly better growth  The trade deficit was actually the smallest since late 2010  The weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort survey dropped to its worst reading in 10 weeks to  41 9  however  and has only registered two weekly readings worse than that since late January Looking AheadEUR USD failed to take out the 1 2400  area and today s trade has been an expression of that disappointment  The pair worked lower through the weekly pivot around 1 2307 and looks ready to fully reverse back into the old range if it can t pick up the rally impulse late today  AUD USD is showing creeping signs of running out of momentum as new probes higher are consistently being beaten back    stay tuned for a nosebleed watch  whether it s here or after one more attempt at the 1 0700 trendline It is worth noting  once again  that the implied volatilities in FX have collapsed to new post GFC lows and  in fact  back to pre 2008 levels  Likewise  the VIX is back near its lowest level for the cycle and the low of the long term range as well  It appears the market consensus is that central bank activism will outlaw all threats of market volatility  I wouldn t be so sure  Of course  as I write these words  the S P 500 is zipping several points higher just after the open to trade about a percent from the post crisis highs  As the problem with an

CAT,2012-10-02,Natural Gas As Primary Transportation Fuel SourceThe migration to utilize natural gas for transportation fuel is based on sound business economics  Efficiently run companies always find ways of becoming more profitable by squeezing every last drop from their cost structure  Companies routinely chase after very marginal cost savings opportunities  Moving from diesel to natural gas for a logistics fuel has the current potential to save companies 50  per gallon on their fuel costs  This equates to MILLIONS and MILLIONS of dollars in benefits for shareholders in companies like FedEx  UPS  Walmart  Target  Waste Management  Pepsi and Coca Cola  just to name a few  Companies will RUSH to implement changes when millions of dollars are on the line  and when those changes provide a competitive cost structure advantage over peers The natural gas train has left the station and adoption is occurring    this can be seen by the recent articles from major corporations like GE  Blackstone Energy  Westport and Caterpillar  just to name a few  Some of the major factors working for and against natural gas are discussed below The Factor Working Against Natural Gas AdoptionThe lack of infrastructure to support exploding demand is the primary hurdle to adoption  This is  however  only an issue of time and has nothing to do with the economics  This issue of  infrastructure build out  is what provides the investor with an economically resistant and decade long investment opportunity Factors Working In Favor Of Natural GasNatural gas is abundant and inexpensive  It is available within the United States  and therefore supplies are dependable  Worldwide demand for oil continues to increase resulting in upward pricing pressure  Instability within the Middle East continues to place a supply interruption premium on oil prices  Natural gas is environmentally more appealing when compared to oil  coal and nuclear energy  The pricing differential discussed graphically below substantially favors the adoption of natural gas as a primary transportation fuel  The chart above graphically illustrates the pricing differential between diesel and natural gas through August 2012  As noted within the chart the pricing differential is the single most important factor for investing in natural gas related companies  As this relative price gap widens  the Return on Investment  ROI  payback period shortens and the incentive to invest becomes more attractive  Note  In March of 2012 natural gas hit a 10 year low  while oil prices  and therefore diesel prices  continue to rise What has changed in the natural gas market that has allowed pricing to fall substantially since late 2008  And what structural changes have occurred that lead us to the conclusion that this pricing differential is here to stay and therefore will support future investments Technical BreakthroughsTechnology enhancements to the way natural gas is removed from the ground have resulted in significant production increases  Both horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are major contributors to this rise in production  The use of horizontal drilling  which allows a 90 degree well to be drilled into formations that are not accessible with vertical drilling  has made horizontal drilling a very valuable technology  The use of  hydraulic fracking   a process by which pressurized fluid is pumped down a well to fracture the rock  increases the flow of natural gas and directly results in higher production rates  The third factor affecting the long term price of natural gas started in about 2008 when large natural gas production zones started scaling production  A small example is illustrated below from the EIA   In conclusion  the natural gas market has gone through a permanent structural change over the last five years as a result of better technology and large discoveries coming into production  This permanent change will translate into sustainable lower costs for natural gas in the long term    Part 2 coming up    The magnitue of potential savings,RulingTheMarkets,0.028,0.807,0.165,0.9978
CAT,2012-10-15,Caterpillar s  CAT  stock from 2002 to 2008 is an example of a cyclical play that people became enthusiastic about but then subsequently sold in panic  Notice how the stock steadily rose from the end of 2002 to the beginning of 2008 then gave up a substantial portion of its gain in less than a few months  Reminds me just how much more suffering people feel when they experience loss than when something of equal value is gained  Humans have evolved that way because when the world was more resource constrained  our ancestors  survival depended much more on keeping what they had than getting something new  The emotions that arise from loss originate in parts of the brain that evolved much earlier than the parts responsible for rational thought  That s why stocks go down faster than they go up  People tend to get depressed and want to capitulate much faster than the time it takes for them to get euphoric  Furthermore  as a stock rises  many people quickly sell to lock in their gains The shareholder base gradually transitions from distressed and value investors  who contest momentum  to growth investors  who typically invest hoping to ride a trend  When a stock goes down and its momentum shifts  the only people that would be interested are the distressed or value investors  Since these types of investors tend to be less impulsive and generally more risk averse  they are usually slow to accumulate shares  After all  they know that betting against a current trend often results in initial losses  Distressed or value investors are in no rush to build fully sized positions Please see the associated with this blog ,Ravee Mehta,0.124,0.708,0.167,0.9109

 The CDIC report  which was obtained by the Economic Observer newspaper  suggested that nearly 10 000 luxurious homes had been sold by officials in Guangzhou and Shanghai last year     Li Chengyan  a professor at Peking University  suggested that about 10 000 officials had absconded from China with as much as pounds  US100 billion    link   These individuals fleeing China have been buying up luxury properties outside of the country  As you likely have noticed  the world has experienced a wave of Chinese buyers for high end real estate  While some of them are indeed individuals who have made legitimate money from business  many are in fact corrupt officials who have fled the country with vast quantities of loot    A new wave of buyers from China is snapping up luxury properties across the U S   injecting billions of dollars into the country s residential real estate market  The industry is scrambling to court the new buyers  Some developers of new projects are installing wok kitchens  following feng shui principles and putting lucky numbers on choice units  others are packaging property sales with government programs designed to encourage foreign investment  Real estate agencies are flying representatives to China  and hiring Mandarin speaking agents    In Los Angeles  New York and even Miami  buyers mostly from China and some are from Hong Kong  Singapore and Korea are radically altering the landscape  Last month  a Chinese couple paid  34 5 million for a Versailles style mansion on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills  Calif  A year earlier  a Hong Kong businessman paid around  28 million for a nearby estate  Over the last six months in New York  several full floor apartments in a new Manhattan high rise called One57  each with a price tag of roughly  50 million  have gone into contract with Chinese buyers  according to two people close to the situation     This sort of fraud and corruption is systemic in China but it doesn t show up in the GDP or other economic figures the country posts  After all  if a poorly constructed bridge collapses China can always build another one and count it twice for GDP growth  And since the Government controls the media  no one is the wiser  As a final example of how the China story will likely turn out  consider the following    Caterpillar Inc  believed acquiring China s Zhengzhou Siwei was a way for the U S  company to boost its fortunes in a lucrative but challenging market    Siwei s sales and profit growth were surging  And the company offered access to China s mining industry  where domestic companies were prospering  Siwei  which sells mine safety equipment  also boasted an American pedigree  Its controlling shareholders were James E  Thompson III  the scion of one of Asia s most successful expatriate families  and Emory Williams  a former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China  Caterpillar paid about  700 million in June for Siwei s parent  ERA Mining Machinery Ltd    Caterpillar  known for bulldozers  excavators and wheel loaders  will have to write off about  580 million over alleged accounting misconduct at a Chinese maker of mine safety equipment it bought in June  The WSJ s James T  Areddy talks about what this means for the big U S  industrial company  But now  the purchase has dealt a blow to Caterpillar s already lackluster performance in China    The Peoria  Ill   construction machinery maker on Friday said it would write down ERA s value by  580 million  blaming  deliberate  multiyear  coordinated accounting misconduct  that was designed to overstate profit at the unit before the deal  The accounting surprise contributed to the departure of a senior Caterpillar executive  a person familiar with the matter said    What are the odds that this is an isolated case  If Caterpillar  CAT   one of the largest corporations in the world  with its army of accountants and consultants was duped by a Chinese company run by American executives no less  what are the odds that ordinary investors can accurately value Chinese businesses or the Chinese economy  This is just one example of how a popular theme in the investment community  in this case that China is a superpower  can in fact turn out to be total bunk  Given how many investment professionals are banking on China leading the world to economic growth again  this trade is extremely crowded on one side ,Phoenix Capital Research,0.047,0.884,0.069,0.9735

CAT,2013-05-24,The run up in the stock market  the SPX for purposes of this article  has been nothing short of stunning  Since hitting a sell off bottom on October 4  2011  the SPX has run up a nearly non stop 47 8   In just the last month  the SPX has run up 7 5   This is in the face of deteriorating economic indicators and declining corporate revenues  The stock market has for sure taken most observers and professionals by surprise  except for maybe the most passionate  perma bulls  Given this incredible move higher in stocks  I wanted to investigate a couple of possibilities for what is fueling this near parabolic stock rally  Based on what I ve been able to come up with  it s pretty clear that stocks are rocketing higher on Fed fuel and not fundamentals  But don t take it from me  it seems that some high profile billionaire investors are unloading their big positions  especially anything related to consumption  Billionaires Are Dumping Stocks  Let s take a look  under the hood  of the economic and financial system and see if we can figure out why While Bernanke was giving his report on the economy and monetary policy to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today  in which he pretty much laid to rest any fears that the Fed would  taper  its monetary policy and bond purchase program anytime soon  I decided to look into some of the Fed s monetary data as reported on the St  Louis Fed website  Specifically I wanted to look at the Adjusted Monetary Base  which is the sum of the currency in circulation plus the commercial bank reserves held at the Fed  because this monetary account is the one directly affected by the QE program Here s the most current snap shot of the Monetary Base going to back to 1984  when the data series began Close to  2 8 trillion in money has been printed and used to purchase assets from the banking system  ranging from highly distressed toxic waste to short term Treasury notes Next I decided to  blow up  the chart above and look at just the last twelve months and compare it to the same time period for a chart of the S P 500 As you can see  there is nearly a 1 1 correlation between the near parabolic growth in the Monetary Base since the end of November 2012 and the near parabolic trajectory of the SPX since mid November  marked by the vertical red lines   I don t have time to run the data  but my University of Chicago B School training visually tells me that the correlation is probably around  8  if not higher  meaning 80  of the move in stocks since November can be attributed to the increase in the Fed s Monetary Base Without doing a data dump of recent corporate earnings reports  we know that regardless of the net income being reported  net income being potentially subjected to many forms of GAAP accounting manipulations   that the revenues being reported by the largest of the SPX companies are flat to down  This is not the sign of an economy that is capable of growth and true earnings expansion  To give one example  Caterpillar  CAT  recently reported its April revenues  Globally sales were down 9  from March  but they were down a shocking 18  in North America  CAT April revenues  This is primarily heavy machinery related to construction and homebuilding  If CAT s sales are plunging like this  it means that construction and homebuilding are likely getting ready to drop pretty hard My point here is that economic and corporate fundamentals are not supporting the rapid move higher in the stock market and the concomitant rapid expansion in the market values of individual companies  To reinforce this point  I wanted to show a chart that I sourced from Zerohedge  which maps out the accelerating decline in the per share operating income of the S P 500 over the last 12 months In other words  based on economic and corporate earnings reports which are suggestive of a slow down in the economy  combined with the fact that corporate operating income is plunging  there can be no doubt that the run up in the stock market is unequivocally not supported by fundamental factors That leaves only the money being printed by the Fed  Wall Street analysts can crow all they want about how the economy is improving and corporate earnings will improve  but the proof so far is in the numbers  which show that just the opposite is occurring Moreover  Fed officials can talk all they want about tapering QE  but if you look at their actions based on the recent move in the trailing twelve month Monetary Base above  not only are they not tapering  they are actually increasing the rate at which they are injecting liquidity into the banking system  In my mind  at least  there can be no doubt that the money being printed by the Fed is what is fueling the stock market Now we can debate whether or not the Fed is serious about  tapering  its printing  But I have no doubt based on the evidence I presented today that if the Fed were indeed to  taper   the stock market suffer a serious and rapid decline The real question now is for how long can this stock market  melt up  last  No one can possibly know that answer for certain  but at this point buying stocks right now is not about analyzing fundamentals and value  but more akin to playing stock market roulette  Anyone who has been fortunate enough to take advantage of being long the stock market should seriously consider hedging or taking a significant portion of their investment off the table ,David I.

CAT,2013-06-04,The only thing that s free right now is the air that we breathe  Other than that it costs to manufacture every object and commodity in the world  It takes a certain amount of money to extract a barrel of crude in Saudi Arabia  to make a car in Detroit or produce an iPad in China There is also a certain cost to producing an ounce of gold  It doesn t grow on trees  Tiny nuggets don t rain down from the sky  It costs to explore  It costs to extract  It costs to finance loans and to pay royalties  There are additional costs such as administration  equipment  environmental remedies and others  These are called the  all in  costs Mines age and get depleted  extracting the gold gets more challenging and costly over time  Average grades of ore have fallen by 30  since 1999  according to consulting group GFMS  making it more difficult to extract gold and from ever greater depths  Finding new deposits is becoming harder  If in 2002 gold miners spent  500 million on exploration  by 2008 they were spending  3 billion but finding much less So how much does it cost to make an ounce of gold today That is an interesting question because just like a car manufacturer will not sell a car for less than it costs to produce it  neither will mining companies sell gold for less than it takes them to extract it from the ground  And the cost of production is rising due to lower grade ore and the rise in the costs of compliance and remediation  As gold prices soared over the past decade  production costs inched higher including the prices for equipment  materials  labor and energy According to a recent Forbes Magazine article both Barrick Gold and Goldcorp  the largest mining companies  project that their all in cash costs will be between  1 000 and  1 100 an ounce for 2013  In 2012  mining companies reported all in costs such as  GG  1 082  Barrick Gold  1 227  Yamana Gold  1 247  IAG  1377 and Agnico Eagle   1 343 According to the Forbes article  a survey of 60 gold mining companies  apparently less efficient than the giants  resulted in an average production cost of  1 391  That is uncomfortably too close to where the price of gold was at the bottom this year Of course  it s possible that if the price of gold were to drop  mining companies could become more efficient and thus cuts their costs and be more profitable  It makes sense that the inverse may be true as well  that as prices were rising  mining companies expanded and perhaps operated at high capacity the mines that are the most expensive to run World gold production is currently around 2 500 metric tons per year  The all time high was reached in 2001  with 2 600 metric tons of gold production worldwide  It is interesting to note that production in 1900 was around 400 metric tons per year when the price per ounce was about  19 an ounce A Financial Times story last month says that earnings data are confirming that the decade long expansion in the mining services industry is all but over  The reduction in mining investment is severely affecting demand for equipment such as trucks  shovels and underground machinery  Caterpillar  the world s largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment  has reported a 45 per cent drop in profits in the first quarter Does the cost per ounce of mining an ounce of gold provide a floor for the price  One can argue that theoretically the price could go lower than the cost of manufacture  but it couldn t stay there for long  Mining companies would have no incentive to extract the gold and it would remain buried underground  They would have to cut capital spending  defer exploration and capital development programs and probably cut dividends  There would be a decline in supply and after a while  when demand would outstrip supply  the price would climb up again The abovementioned facts suggest that sooner or later the price of gold  and   with it   the whole precious metals sector as well  will start to rise again  to cope with the rising costs  But these facts alone cannot help us estimate the turning point itself   let us then move on to the technical part of today s essay to see what immediate future holds for the yellow metal The precious metals sector moved higher on Thursday  but the question is if the move was significant enough to change the short term outlook for gold and silver  It has been   as we wrote in our previous articles   bearish  as far as short and medium term are concerned  Let s examine the situation 1  There was a breakout above the declining resistance line in gold and silver  however  it was invalidated on Friday 2  The volume in GDX was significant during Thursday s rally  but it was surprisingly small in the case of GLD ETF  It was average in the event of the SLV ETF  Therefore  the breakout  even though it was not invalidated on Friday in case of the mining stocks  is not that reliable in our view 3  The USD Index declined quite significantly on Thursday  yet we saw a rather average move higher in gold  so we decided to analyze the relative performance  USD   precious metals  more thoroughly  USD closed approximately at the 83 level  something it had already done on May 10  On May 10 gold  silver and the HUI Index closed at   1 448   23 88 and 280  respectively  This means that mining stocks are where they were back then and gold and silver are considerably lower now  This does not bode well for the precious metals in the short and medium term 4  We have previously mentioned the reverse parabola in the GLD to GDX ratio which meant that miners were declining more and more rapidly relative to gold  This parabola was broken on Thursday  which is a bullish sign   not a strong one  but still 5  The move higher in silver just ahead of the cyclical turning point is actually a bearish phenomenon  If the price is to reverse its direction shortly  then if the most recent move is up  then the reversal should take the market lower  The previous cyclical turning point in silver worked in this way  and only too well  Silver s price plunged at the cyclical turning point after moving slightly higher   to the 20 day moving average  The chart below illustrates the situationSilver  and  naturally SLV ETF  moved lower on Friday  which may mean that the next downleg has already started To recap  at this time we still think that the breakout in precious metals is not in   and that lower values of silver will be seen before the next big rally emerges  So far the USD gold link is a strong indication against going long  and we don t think that the odds for the decline have really changed  Not only have we seen a long term breakout in the USD Index  but we also see that gold and silver are responding more significantly to dollar s rallies than to its declines ,CommodityOnline,0.059,0.861,0.08,0.9848

CAT,2013-06-20,While government data continue to show a lack of inflation in the U S  economy  the bond market screams the opposite The Consumer Price Index  CPI   the most commonly quoted measure of inflation  increased only 0 1  in May after declining 0 4  in April  Since the beginning of the year  from January to May  inflation in the U S  has edged higher by only 0 2    Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics  June 18  2013  But the bond market says this isn t true Since May  we have seen yields on U S  bonds skyrocket  Take a look at the chart below  it shows the change in yields on 30 year U S  bonds  indicated by the red line  and 10 year U S  notes  marked by the blue line   Note the circled area In a matter of a few weeks  yields on 30 year U S  bonds have jumped about 19  and 10 year note yields have skyrocketed almost 35  This is dangerous for bond investors  As the yields on bonds climb higher  their prices slide lower  bond investors face losses and they re fleeing the bond market For the week ended June 5  long term bond mutual funds witnessed an outflow of  10 9 billion  Looking at it on a monthly basis  the long term bond mutual funds haven t seen an outflow since December of 2008  This month may just be the first since then   Source  Investment Company Institute  June 12  2013  Even the foreigners  who have been providing credit to the U S  economy  seem to be

but with the optimism seen in the key stock indices  investors are ignoring their implications  I can t stress this enough  growing problems in the Chinese economy will not only hurt the global economy  but the U S  economy and the rising key stock indices as well And I believe the estimates of China s growth this year may be overly optimistic  The underlying issues in the Chinese economy

significant repercussions At the end of the day  the slowing Chinese economy means trouble for the U S  economy  What many may not realize is that some of the biggest companies based here in the U S

CAT,2013-07-11,Gold has had a rough year  At  1 300 oz  even operational gold mines are threatened with closure  All in cash costs for gold producers in 2012 averaged  1 211 oz  In other words  most gold gold mines are almost operating at a total loss  Meanwhile  the rest of the stock market is euphoric near all time highs The AttractionStill  many people want exposure to gold for general diversification  Most investors are not experts in commodities  but like most people  they know enough to want to allocate a small portion of their portfolio to gold  They also want to think for themselves  and do not want to invest in physical gold  suffering losses like  1 900 oz to  1 300 oz For investors approaching gold with fresh eyes and no existing investments  they can select anything they desire  The best place to look would seemingly be gold companies for exposure to the current bull market in equities  but as research will quickly reveal discovered  the major mining companies are falling like flies and there is nothing but carnage in the juniors Investors might continue their search  Royalty companies  Definitely not  Over the past year  Franco Nevada  FNV  is down from  60 to  40 per share and Royal Gold  RGLD  has been sawed in half from  100 to  45 per share Gold Trusts  ETFs Not even close  All the underlying assets in trusts and ETFs have crashed alongside spot gold prices  and actively managed funds are performing even worse  SPDR Gold Trust  GLD   iShares Gold  IAU   Central Gold Trust  GTU   Sprott Physical Gold  PHYS   Central Fund of Canada  CEF  and all the countless others have been devastated over the past year Of course  the inverted ETFs are doing just fine   Mining Equipment This is not exactly a sector with many options  and even the few stocks available have been falling  Caterpillar  CAT   115 to  85 per share  Joy Global  JOY   90 to  50 per share and Deere  DE  from  95 to  85 per share  Poor performance in this sector should be no surprise  Lower gold prices mean tightening the belt at all production facilities and delaying purchase orders for new equipment  To be fair  there have been a couple stocks that have done well in this sector  including Terex  TEX  and Tractor Supply  TSCO   but if commodity prices continue to languish  their share prices might also come under pressure  Regardless  this is a complicated sector with exposure to all commodities  not just gold   and equipment is just not a sector that interests most investors amid falling commodity prices So  what then  Not majors  not juniors  not royalties  not funds  not equipment  Is there any gold investment that might keep pace with the stock market s relentless rally Consider The Entire Gold SectorFundamentally  all majors carry popularity premiums in the form of multi year revenue projections  bullish analyst coverage and constant media attention  so the best investors look elsewhere  Royalties  funds and equipment simply mirror the performance of gold  which has been performing terribly  No  investors want to put gold investment dollars where they can take some risk for some legitimate upside  Here are some qualities  a sort of wish list for gold investing a stock  to participate in the incredible rally of the stock marketnot yet mining  to avoid popularity premiumscommencing production by 2014  to avoid pies in the skyall in costs below  900 oz  25  below the industry average NI 43 101 report completed  to avoid other pies in the skyUpon reflection  this seems to be the best subsector of gold for one s investment dollars  Well known mining companies have all of their ounces already priced into their stock using sophisticated discounted pricing models  but companies that are not yet mining have minimal popularity premiums  This subsector is also la cr me de la cr me of all junior miners  companies that actually complete their NI 43 101 report and have estimated all in costs below  900 oz  These are the 1  of juniors that still have a chance at attracting project level  non dilutive  financing  becoming a major  or being acquired outright Promised  900 oz Production Means Accepting Risk Everyone knows that there are risks in the junior sector  but these risks are better than losing market capitalization simply due to waning popularity  reference the stock chart of any major gold company during the past year   A junior does not have revenues  a P E ratio or any of the attributes that allow investors to traditionally value its business based on ongoing operations  Instead  a junior has property  mineral claims and a dream  It spends its entire life trying to prove to the world that its dream will become a reality by drilling test holes  pitching investors and paying mineralogical firms to verify its ability to mine  The end goal is always the same    extracting gold out of the ground    but very few of these dreams actually become reality Low Cost Pre ProducersNear term  low cost pre producers are nearing the finish line  and it is looking increasingly likely that their dreams will become the elite 1   Because these companies have low correlation to the price of gold due to their huge discount to  1 400 oz gold  they exist in their own world  They swim under the radar yet rapidly approach maturity with cash flow  analyst reports  television appearances  newspaper articles and employee union negotiations  If they succeed  their share price should start an ascent that yields hundreds of percentage points within a year  If they fail to get final permits or catch themselves on any final snags  back to the cesspit of juniors they go  That is the risk reward proposition  and investors can handle that With gold prices falling from  1 900 oz to  1 300 oz over the past two years  no one cares about juniors with projects 3 10 years away  and many are shelving their projects altogether  Likewise  optimistic valuations across the traditional gold sector  majors  juniors  royalties  funds  equipment  are crashing  The only worthwhile subsector of the gold market is near term  low cost pre production  A Few Worth ConsideringMidway Gold  MDW Midway Gold is a NYSE MKT traded pre producer planning to commence mining in 2014  Its project is located in White Pine County  Nevada  meaning reliable infrastructure  skilled labor force  no geopolitical risks  etc    Midway Gold has over  70 million in cash and has publicly stated that capital expenditures for the mine will cost  99 million  promising  no more dilutive equity   Market capitalization stands at  128 million  It completed its NI 43 101 report in November 2011 It estimates all in gold production costs at  824 oz  From a technical standpoint  the stock has traded in a wide range  with its largest rally coinciding with peak gold prices in 2011  Its share price is roughly flat over the past year but has doubled in value from its range 3 5 years ago  This company is a straightforward candidate for investors to evaluate in terms of risk to reward Pershing Gold  PGLC It is no surprise to see another company from Nevada on this list  as the state controls 80  of all domestic gold production  Pershing Gold is a pre producer led by the former COO of Franco Nevada  FNV   Its investors include major silver producer Coeur d Alene  CDE   Barry Honig of interCLICK  ICLK   Steven Alfers of NewWest Gold now Newmont Mining  NEM  and Dr  Phillip Frost of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  TEVA  and Opko Health  OPK Pershing Gold purchased a mine out of bankruptcy that had produced over 100 000 ounces of gold  Its plan is to mine gold using existing processing facilities it owns  and it has already raised most of the capital it will need to start mining  It completed its NI 43 101 report on April 12  2013 Its property is adjacent to Coeur d Alene s Rochester property and  located in Nevada  has easy highway and railway access  no geopolitical risks  skilled workers  and all the trimmings of U S  production  It should be able to produce at  800 oz by early 2014  Its CEO previously built a company and sold it for C 186 9 million  and its insider trading ledger shows millions in open market purchases  Market capitalization stands at  100 million  From a technical standpoint  the stock has doubled from  0 30 to  0 60 within the past year and recently pulled back to  0 34  allowing an entry far below 52 week highs  Pershing Gold is a very cheap company with plenty of near term catalysts that could provide nice returns for prudent investors Premier Gold Mines Limited  PIRGF This company has three main properties  a wholly owned project in Nevada s Battle Mountain Trend  a wholly owned project in Ontario s Geraldton Beardmore and a 49  owned joint venture with Goldcorp  GG  in Ontario s Red Lake  It has over  100 million in cash and boasts analyst coverage by RBC Capital  CanaccordGenuity  Scotia Capital  Cantor Fitzgerald and Stifel Nicolaus  Value investors cringe a bit at this popularity  but its market capitalization does not seem outrageously expensive Premier Gold Mines CEO Ewan Downie founded Wolfden Resources and sold it in 2006 for C 346 million  Fidelity is an institutional stakeholder  Its Nevada and Geraldton properties will probably not enter production by 2014  but its joint venture with Goldcorp will  Its cost per ounce of gold will likely fall under  900 due to its financial partnership with Goldcorp Although investors might like the strength of this company s balance sheet  scheduling has them concerned  Only one of the company s three projects will be entering production by 2014  and that project is the smallest  49  owned joint venture  On the whole  Premier Gold Mines is a well capitalized company  but it is about two years away from truly commencing its own mining operations  From a technical standpoint  the stock has traded as high as  8 per share during peak gold prices in 2011 and has retraced all the way to  1 81 per share  Nonetheless  it is still trading significantly higher than its lows during the 2008 financial crisis  and its large cash balance and analyst entourage makes it the most relatively expensive stock on this list ConclusionInvestors want to invest in gold  Most of them do not want to own the physical stuff  as anything with direct correlation has performed terribly over the past year  trusts  funds  ETFs  royalties  equipment and especially major miners   The only thing that makes sense to investors is near term  low cost pre producers  Essentially  investors want to buy gold at a discount to today s  1 300 oz spot price  and they understand that that they must accept risk to achieve that discount  Before they invest in any company  they should complete due diligence and quantify that risk in comparison to the upside potential  To this end  this article has provided another way to look at gold investing and introduced some eligible investments to evaluate further  The next task is to start looking deeper into Midway Gold  Pershing Gold and Premier Gold Mines to evaluate company specific risks,Adam

Given Caterpillar s long term track record  such a bleak outlook is unwarranted  no matter its short term troubles  Belden Inc   BDC  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Industrials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Dangerous rating  BDC has made negative  in every year going back to at least 1998  The danger in this stock  though  really lies in the valuation  At its current share price of   53 72  BDC has an extraordinarily high  of 6 1  To justify this valuation  BDC needs to grow  by 18  compounded annually for 17 years  Since 2000  BDC has only grown  by 8  compounded

CAT,2013-07-12,While the gold bullion naysayers keep their bearish view  the fundamentals for the precious metal continue to gain strength We have seen a significant amount of selling in the gold bullion market  But consider this  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  gold bullion holdings in global exchange traded products  ETPs  have plummeted 589 4 metric tons this year to 2 042 5 tons the lowest since May of 2010 And if that trend continues  it would be the first drop in gold bullion holdings of ETPs since they were brought onto the market in 2003   Source  Financial Post  July 4  2013  On top of all this  hedge funds are also predicting lower gold bullion and precious metal prices  And some of the biggest banks around the world have also cut their forecasts In the second quarter of this year  April to June   gold bullion prices plummeted 23  the most since 1920  The primary reason for that is that investors were suddenly convinced that the precious metal wasn t as precious as its price indicated once the Federal Reserve announced that it will soon be starting to apply the brakes on its runaway money printing But that move  when it comes  will only make physical precious metals more valuable  Gold is simply becoming scarce  and buyers will soon be scrambling to buy Remember and I have said this before it was only in the paper market that we witnessed increased selling  The demand for the physical market remains strong The cost of borrowing gold bullion has increased sharply  The one month gold bullion lease rate rose to 0 3  on July 9  up from 0 12  a week ago   Source  Financial Times  July 9  2013  Dear reader  you must remember  gold bullion trades globally  We are witnessing staggering demand out of Asia the usual gold bullion buyers and refineries there are operating at full capacity  UBS  a global bank  points out that the price of gold bullion in China remains  40 00 above the benchmark London spot prices Here s what my colleague and resident gold bug  Robert Appel  BA  BBL  LLB the smartest guy I know when it comes to understanding and explaining what s happening with precious metals had to say  Regression analysis of the gold market back to the 1970s suggests that the time to repair the damage is often about equal to the time to make the damage  In fact  top analyst Louise Yamada  who advises corporations and large funds  and commands large fees for her advice  has said the very same thing in many of her CNBC interviews  Assuming the base builds this fall  this suggests that the total damage was spread over 2 years  Therefore  according to  traditional  analysis  gold should be back in favor by 2015  Now  note we used the words  traditional analysis   If you factor in the unusual dynamic of this specific market all world markets joined at the hip electronically  the gold whack that was artificial and not organic  Western nations on the edge of another 2008 style event  false unemployment data  the Fed trying to walk and chew gum at the same time  Japan on a kamikaze mission  and unknown weather patterns this could happen sooner than expected I remain bullish on gold bullion prices in the future because the fundamentals are aligning perfectly  Right now  there s a significant amount of negativity towards it and other precious metals but I have to go by the old adage   In the times of most uncertainty  the greatest buying opportunity arises   Michael s Personal Notes I am watching the Chinese economy very closely  because any economic slowdown there could have an adverse effect on the already struggling U S  economy And here s what I ve seen  the stock advisors are not mentioning how critical the Chinese economy really is  how companies based here in the U S  can face hard times if it slows  and how that could ultimately lead to lower key stock indices Dear reader  the most important thing you need to know about the Chinese economy is that it s an indicator of global economic health and demand  Currently  it looks as though its health is deteriorating  Exports from the Chinese economy to the global economy plunged 3 1  in June  a month in which they were expected to increase by four percent   Source  Reuters  July 10  2013  What that means is that demand in the global economy is declining and that strengthens my belief that the global economy is headed toward an economic slowdown  In June  exports from the Chinese economy to the U S  economy fell 5 4  and those to the eurozone fell 8 3  Customs spokesman in the Chinese economy  Zheng Yuesheng  said   China faces relatively stern challenges in trade currently  Exports in the third quarter look grim    Source   China warns of  grim  trade outlook after weak exports surprise   Reuters  July 10  2013  The Chinese economy is now expected to slow to 7 5  this year  But not only exports are declining  the factory output and investment growth in China  the second biggest economic hub  are also headed downhill I think these numbers might even be too optimistic considering the economic slowdown in the Chinese economy could become severe  as the credit market problems are starting to unfold  Businesses not being able to borrow money to run their daily operations can hurt demand in the country  Consequently  high unemployment will probably become an important issue going forward Economic slowdown in China means U S  based companies operating in the country will also see their profitability decline  We ve heard from companies like Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT  that are showing concerns with their operations in the Chinese economy  meanwhile  other companies like Wal Mart Stores  Inc   NYSE WMT   which has significant operations in China are facing troubled times as well And you can add to this list the exporters to China any economic slowdown in China s economy means they will be selling less to the country  As I said before  the strength of the Chinese economy is an indicator of overall global health As I continue to point out in these pages  the key stock indices are not reflecting the reality of the economic situation it s far worse than they would indicate I remain pessimistic toward the key stock indices  because I don t see a lot of improvements  rather  I see risk piling up significantly  This irrational rally can only go on for so long  Eventually  it will all come back to where it should be  And problems in the Chinese economy might just be the spark that brings investors back to their senses Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich

CAT,2013-07-12,China releases 2nd quarter GDP data Sunday night in US time zones and it is going to be ugly based upon all the second quarter econ data we have received throughout these three months  The trend is going south fast  and as bad as the second quarter GDP figures are the third quarter GDP will be even worse because of the effects of tightening measures to try to get a handle on the shadow banking sector   The GDP number should be in the 6 7  range for the quarter  yes even with China massaging the numbers like a GE accountant under Jack Welch  anything in the 7  is just flat out an invalid number based upon the economic number coming out of China the last six months  So China either gives a credible number and the market tanks for anything industrial commodity related  or they make up such a patently false number  and lose all credibility  leading to suspicions that things are so bad that they have to blatantly fix the numbers which don t even remotely match the econ data   The market will tank under this scenario as well  This is the black swan  Europe is bad  but emerging markets are imploding and Sunday night market participants are finally going to take notice that they can no longer ignore the China bubble collapsing due to excessive lending of the last ten years that is finally coming to roost    Copper has been moved back up to  3 19 a pound  it is an easy short back to the  3 a pound level by Sunday night through Monday morning  Oil will get creamed as well as of this writing oil is sitting just above the next level of support with WTI set to break the  104   102  and  100 levels next week as stops get hit in mass exodus on the way down  and the shorts pile in after each technical level breaks  Gold and Silver have been getting slammed after bad Chinese data the past several months and it will be interesting to see if the pattern continues after the sharks have covered their shorts   If we get a 6 7  number even the safest of asset classes  equities will get hit as Europe will sell off bringing down the US equities market as well  All in all  traders are going to see a lot of red on their screens next week as bad Chinese GDP data sets the tone for the week  Throw in some bad earning s reports  and things could get real nasty after the run up of the past two weeks in most asset classes   Be advised the smart thing to do is to get out of harm s way on Friday before the carnage begins next week  Markets have had a nice run  assets are overbought  move to cash  book some profits  protect your capital  and wait for the selling to exhaust itself if you re a long only participant  Is rest assured once the selling begins next week  everyone will be trying to exit at the same time  If you want to stay long  at least buy some protective puts for your portfolio to hedge any selling if major funds start liquidating positions because they know they can buy back in much cheaper   But the market has been worried about US tapering which is the least of their worries  it doesn t matter a hill of beans whether the Fed buys  65 or  85 billion a month in Treasuries  But China s considerable slowdown is what the market should be worried about  especially anything related to industrial from Caterpillar to Oil and Copper and the other industrial metals because everything is inter related from Iron Ore in Australia and Brazil  to the mining companies in Europe  to global demand for commodities like Oil and Copper   Remember when all the talk regarding these investment themes referenced China s incredible growth engine for supporting hefty prices  well now the counter argument applies  and now the hefty premiums for some of these industrial commodities like Oil and Copper need to reflect the facts that instead of China growing at 13  it is now growing even by dubious government numbers in the 6 7  range at best and trending in the wrong direction   Copper should probably be trading below  2 50 a pound for example  and Brent and WTI both under  90 a barrel  especially if you consider China slows growth by over 7  in the last two years  Yes the Commodity Super Cycle is over folks  QE has held these two commodities up for as long as they possibly could  but China is the prime factor regarding taking major demand for these commodities out of the market  It only a matter of time before these two commodities start to get attacked by the shorts like Iron ore prices  and my guess is Sunday night with China s release of GDP with a number in the 6 7  range gets their attention real quick ,EconMatters,0.086,0.797,0.117,0.9657

CAT,2013-07-24,After a spike in flake graphite in 2011  have prices finally reached bottom  Ron Struthers  the publisher and editor of Struthers  Resource Stock Report  believes so  In this interview with The Metals Report  Struthers talks about how market psychology and fundamentals may play out in the graphite and rare earths spaces as new mines inch toward production  The Metals Report  In 2011  there was a spike in flake graphite prices  a proliferation of publicly traded graphite equities and some speculation by investors  Since then  graphite prices have fallen and most investors lost money  How do graphite investors make money now  Ron Struthers  If you ve already bought in  the best thing is to hold right now  Graphite equities have probably hit a bottom  Going forward  investors should stick with companies that have good odds of getting to production in the near term  It s a very small market  so if a few new mines come on  production can make a difference  TMR  Do you believe the price of flake graphite has bottomed  RS  I think so  But it s a different market compared to other mining sectors in that the price is mainly set by negotiated contract  There is no futures exchange  In 2011  when prices were rising  buyers  who for the most part are end users  got scared  They thought prices were going to climb higher still  so they bought more to lock in at a relatively lower price and keep ample supplies for their manufacturing requirements  Of course  because they were buying more  it drove demand and the price higher  until the market got to a point where buying slowed as inventories were built higher  Then the exact opposite happens  Buyers become leery and prices start to drop off  The buyers say   Well  I have a year s supply of this stuff because I bought it on the way up  I m just going to sit back now   The demand drop off in 2012 wasn t about less graphite being used  it was more about a change in the market psychology  The fundamentals haven t changed  There have been no new mines come on  In fact  supply probably has come down a bit as China has consolidated some of its industry  At this point  prices have been stable for a few months  That s an indication that the market is at equilibrium  TMR  What price range do you expect flake graphite to trade at for the rest of this year and through 2014  RS  It will probably trade within a couple hundred dollars of the current price  1 200 1 600 share but more than likely  it won t fluctuate that much  There will be more of an upward bias next year if we get through this change in the market psychology and the fundamentals come back into focus  Demand is still growing from new areas like electric cars  And although a lot of companies are advancing their projects  we still haven t seen a new significant mine  especially in North America  where new mines are still a few years from production  TMR  Most gold and silver companies tell specifics about how they will make money and grow production in company presentations  But graphite companies don t really talk so much about the specifics of their project or mine  Do they believe that investors don t understand this space yet  RS  It s early on in the industry for public graphite companies  We don t have a good handful of pure graphite companies in production that we can point to for historical information on costs  We have the preliminary economic assessments  PEAs  from some of the explorers  but unlike gold and silver  we don t have any pure public producers in North America to use as comparables  There are just two producing mines in North America and they are private  TMR  What don t investors understand about the graphite space  RS  The main thing is understanding the percentage of carbon content in the deposit  the flake size distribution and purity on recovery  An ounce of gold is an ounce of gold we know what the price is  It s simple  But graphite value involves more variables  Recovery rates are very important in evaluating a graphite project  Some gold mines can operate with 60 80  recoveries and produce valuable byproducts that refiners can handle like silver and copper  but graphite needs 94  purity on recovery or better to get the proper pricing  and then that pricing varies by flake size the larger the flake  the better the price  TMR  What about production costs  An average ton of flake graphite is going for about  1 500  Are there companies that can profitably produce graphite at that price  RS  Northern Graphite Corporation  NGC TSX V  NGPHF OTCQX  is the most advanced  It can make money  as most of its graphite is large and jumbo flake  There will be others  too  Graphite is actually fairly easy to mine  The costs aren t much compared to other mining projects  it s all about the flake size distribution and purity  TMR  Northern Graphite estimates that it is going to cost about  103 million   103M  to build its flagship project Bissett Creek  How much of that money does Northern Graphite have  RS  Northern Graphite has  7M in cash and a  17 5M financing from Caterpillar for equipment  So it s part of the way there  but realistically the company needs the mine permit first to secure the debt portion of the financing  It can t put the cart before the horse  so to speak  TMR  What s the earliest this mine could be in production  RS  It is waiting on a final permit and will need a final round of financing  It could be into production in H2 14 at the earliest  TMR  There is some speculation that TIMCAL Graphite   Carbon  a division of Imerys  NK PA   is probably going to need a new mine before long when the Lac des  les mine comes to the end of its life cycle  Could TIMCAL buy an emerging graphite asset in Ontario or Quebec  RS  It s interesting that you mention TIMCAL as they just temporarily shut down production  so that will help tighten the supply side of the market  It would make a lot of sense to me  Producers in gold and other sectors where the market has come down are taking advantage of low prices  It wouldn t surprise me at all to see the same thing in graphite  TMR  Which company do you think will be the first one to ship flake graphite  RS  Northern Graphite is fairly close and should be the first of its peers to ship graphite  Focus Graphite Inc   FMS TSX V  has a project with a PEA  Focus is a little different than most projects  It is the only one directly invested in the graphene market with a private company called Grafoid Inc   which is devoted to developing a standard for economically scalable  affordable graphene  It s unique in that it is both a play on graphite and graphene  Focus is well financed with  17M and over  5M in Grafoid  TMR  Do you believe that it can commercially produce graphene profitably  RS  It s been demonstrated on small bench scale tests that it can be done  They re getting refining purity levels up to 99 9  using natural graphite  which is the level needed for graphene  They re practically there now  However  we need to see this on a commercial scale to know for sure  There s been bench scale testing from a number of projects and from renowned metallurgy companies  It s something we ll see down the road  TMR  How is the grade at Focus  Lac Knife graphite project  RS  That s another advantage that it has  It does have a higher grade than most projects  around 15 17   which goes quite a way in reducing mining costs  Its graphite occurs in pod like formations  so there might be a little more overburden in the removal process  but the grade definitely makes up for that and more  Focus has the potential to be the lowest cost producer based on its recent PEA  TMR  Are there any other graphite stories you re following  RS  Valterra Resource Corp   VQA TSX V  has a project in Bobcaygeon  Ontario  with high grades and from the initial sampling  about 24 28  carbon  In Valterra s metallurgy testing  purity levels ran as high as 99 96   so there s graphene potential in this project  Valterra approached its project differently than other companies might have  It took some bulk samples right off the bat and found it had the high purity  high grade graphite  That made it a very interesting story  Now it has to prove it has enough graphite there for a mine  It s at the point of mapping out the zones  and then it will be drill testing to see if it can put some tonnage together  It s an early stage stock with a very low price  and a lot of blue sky in front of it  Also Alabama Graphite Co   ALP CNSX  just announced its first NI 43 101 resource of 38 2 million tons at 2 6  carbon  The deposit is on surface and the company should get mine permitting very quickly in Alabama  If the metallurgy and feasibility studies come back positive  Alabama Graphite could be among the first to production  The company just completed a  335 000 financing at  0 15 share above the market price and is well subscribed by management  which is a very good sign of confidence in the project  TMR  Is there enough room in the graphite space for multiple players  after the first project makes it to production  RS  There is room for a few new mines to come in  probably enough for three and four  depending on how much they produce  But they re going to trickle in over the next several years  it s not going to be a flood onto the market anytime soon  TMR  Could there be a consolidation phase in the graphite space  RS  Quite a few juniors have come into the market  but quite a number will fade away because it s difficult to raise money right now and the nature of exploration means that most projects will not be economically viable  TMR  What s your near  to medium term outlook for the rare earth element  REE  space  RS  There s potential here  A lot of the REE prices haven t gone down nearly as much as other minerals  There s some good stories  like Pacific Wildcat Resources Corp   PAW TSX V   TMR  That project is located in Kenya  East Africa  Are there jurisdictional advantages there  RS  Kenya is right on the coast  There is good infrastructure near Pacific Wildcat s project  including hydropower  paved highway and ports  It s one of the more advanced countries in Africa  It has expanded strongly in tourism  telecommunications and its traditional tea market  It is a liberal market with minimum government involvement and British based common and mining law  TMR  Does Pacific Wildcat s project lean more toward the heavy rare earth elements  HREEs   RS  It has a good mixture of HREEs and light rare earth elements  At about 5   it is a high grade deposit  Its basket of REEs is valued at around  35 45 kilogram   35 45 kg   It also has a 100 million tonne niobium deposit that s quite advanced  TMR  Why should investors be interested in niobium  RS  It s not a well known material  but it s a strategic element and has been used a long time in the steel industry for strength in different alloys and super alloys  Some of these super alloys are used in jet engines and space programs  There are only a few producing mines in the world  as it is very rare to find niobium in economic concentrations  At  40 Kg  it provides a very attractive potential return on investment for miners  It s a fairly stable market price wise  TMR  What got you interested in Pacific Wildcat  RS  It has a lot going for it  It has a large niobium project with a high grade zone that could be a cash cow  It has a smaller tantalum project that s already proven out  It has a processing plant  It just needs a little bit more money to finish some spiral concentrators and can go into production this year  It has a world class REE project that could have 5  grade or better  Recent assays show 105

mines into production  CEO Darren Townsend is an engineer and previously worked as general manager of Sons of Gwalia  which operated the world s largest tantulum mine  Terry Lyons  who is the chairman  has more than 30 years  experience  He was a past chairman of Northgate Minerals Corp   NGX TSX  NGX NYSE MKT   The company has management with experience in the tantalum industry  It also has some directors with experience in Africa  TMR  What is tantalum used for  RS  Tantalum is used in alloys but mostly in capacitors for electronics like computers and phones  It is highly corrosion resistant  The tantalum price has moved up quite a bit  from about  80 pound   80 lb  last year to  130 lb currently  It s one of the few metals or minerals that has seen an increase in price this year  TMR  Why should investors be interested in this space overall right now  RS  A lot of these materials are an important part of our future  Technology we re developing requires more graphite and REEs  If you can find companies that can put these into production soon  you ll see strong cash flow  earnings and even dividends  TMR  Dividends in the REE space  That s interesting  RS  I m talking down the road  after companies outside of China go into production  A number of the graphite stocks Focus  Northern Graphite  Alabama  Valterra have come down in price  So has Pacific Wildcat  Any of those

CAT,2013-07-25,Troubles in the Chinese economy are mounting as the economic slowdown in the world s second biggest economy takes its toll troubles that could wash ashore here in North America sooner than most expect The Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  registered at 47 7 for July a new eleven month low   Source  Markit  July 24  2013   Any reading below 50 on the PMI represents contraction in the manufacturing sector contraction of this magnitude indicates a severe economic slowdown for the country And that s not all Gross domestic product  GDP  for China s economy is quickly slowing  After growing for years at 10  per annum  in the first quarter of this year  China s economy grew at only 7 7   in the second quarter  the rate slowed further to 7 5    Source  MarketWatch  July 23  2013   Growth of 7 5  per year for the Chinese economy is embarrassing when compared to its historical average So why would an economic slowdown in China s economy be a problem for us here at home China s economy is the third biggest destination for U S  exporters As the economic slowdown in the Chinese economy strengthens  demand for goods and services within the country will decline  American exporters will face more downward pressures on profits as they export less to China  And U S  GDP will get hit as exports are considered one of the major factors in its calculation But the damage the economic slowdown in the Chinese economy could have on American and Canadian exporters is just one small piece of the puzzle  Corporate earnings of U S  based companies operating in the Chinese economy will also become an issue Giants like Wal Mart Stores  Inc   WMT  and Caterpillar Inc   CAT  have a major presence in the Chinese economy  Wal Mart operates 380 stores in China  employs 100 000 120 000 people in that country  and has been opening 50 60 stores a year in China Pfizer Inc   PFE  has a significant stake in the Chinese economy  with business operations

the first quarter s revised U S  gross domestic product  GDP  numbers  we found consumer spending in the U S  economy was slow  dragging U S  economic growth lower  Going forward  I can t help but to expect more of the same We are already getting warnings from major financial institutions that U S  GDP growth in the second quarter will be dismal  The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   GS  expects the U S  economy to grow at only 0 8  in the second quarter  The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc  RBS  and Barclays PLC  BCS  both expect U S  GDP growth to come in at 0 5    Source  Wall Street Journal  July 15  2013  It shouldn t go unnoticed  consumer spending makes up about two thirds of the GDP in the U S  economy  If consumer spending declines  or remains stagnant  then it would be foolish to expect the U S  economy to experience any growth Let s look at retail and food services sales  a key indicator of consumer spending in the U S  economy  Since the third quarter of 2009  the average rate of growth quarter over quarter in real retail and food services sales in the U S  economy has been 0 9   In the second quarter  April though June  of 2013  these sales only increased 0 81  from the previous quarter   Source  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis web site  last accessed July 24  2013  Unemployment another indicator of pressure on consumer spending remained a problem throughout the second quarter  While the mainstream media and politicians told us everything is great on the employment front  the reality was quiet the opposite In the U S  economy  the underemployment rate  which provides a better look at the U S  labor market situation  actually increased from 13 9  in April to 14 3  in June of 2013   Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics  July 5  2013   It s common sense that when people don t have jobs  they pull back on their spending Aside from a slowdown in retail and food services sales and rising real unemployment  the U S  housing market remains depressed  as real homes buyers stay away from the market  Right now  we have institutions fueling home purchases  First time home buyers fuel the economy as they buy lawnmowers  appliances  and furniture to fill their homes  Recently  I ve heard stories of big institutions buying homes in bulk  to rent out  and filling them with appliances they are buying directly from overseas in bulk All this happened during the second quarter of 2013  as the key stock market indices continued to rally In the first half of this year  key stock indices like the S P 500 rose roughly 13   Is this sustainable when the U S

CAT,2013-07-26,Carlo and I went to high school together about 30 years ago  We remained friends after we left school even though we went our separate ways  Our common thread is that we are both entrepreneurs running our own businesses  After years of not seeing each other  last night we spent a couple of hours together discussing the economy and investing  Carlo s complaint last night  which is characteristic of many investors today  was that he worked hard all his life  watching what he spent and saved   But I m being punished for it   he lamented  Why  Carlo looks at other investors who had less than him  but who borrowed heavily after the credit crisis of 2008 to either buy stocks or buy real estate  And they ve done remarkably well   I worked hard  saved  and bought bonds  Meanwhile  I lost money because the return I ve gotten over the years hasn t kept up with real inflation  What the government tells me is the inflation rate is a lie  I m upside down  Carlo went on and on   I know people with no education  people who have never ran a business  people who never saved  but they made millions since 2008 because they bought properties  interest rates went down  and real estate prices went up  The government  by lowering interest rates so aggressively since the credit crisis and keeping them low   punished savers but boosted speculators   he noted Yes  Carlo would have been better off to close his business in 2008 or 2009  take all his money  borrow as much as he could and either have bought stocks or real estate  He would be further ahead by millions of dollars today Investing is about risk and reward  The higher the risk you are willing to take  the greater the return  But it can go against you  too  If you borrow heavily to get into an investment and it turns against you  you can easily get wiped out By this point in this story  my readers are probably asking   What should Carlo do now   That s because I assume many of my readers are in Carlo s situation  too If I were Carlo  the first thing I would recognize is that the greatest investor fortunes of our lifetime have been made by getting into investments when they are the most depressed and holding on until they come back Today  investors can go out and buy a share of Amazon com  Inc   AMZN  at  300 00 a share  The company lost money in the most recent quarter  It trades at 100 times expected earnings for 2014 and doesn t pay a dividend  There is huge demand for Amazon com shares  which explains why the price has hit a new record high Also  today  investors can go out and buy the shares of Goldcorp Inc   GG  at  28 00 a share  Goldcorp is down 50  from its 2011 high  the stock trades at 14 times earnings  and it pays a dividend equal to a yield of 2 13   The company produces about 600 000 ounces of gold a quarter at a cost of between  1 000 and  1 200 an ounce  Demand is falling for Goldcorp shares as gold prices have fallen and the company has taken some write offs to recognize the lower price of gold  By the way  the shares of gold companies relative to earnings are selling at the lowest level in decades Sure  there is risk if gold prices fall below  1 000 an ounce  But there is also a huge reward if gold prices go to  2 000 an ounce Hence  the risk reward play is always there for an investor like Carlo to act upon  He just needs to eventually take action on one of those plays when the opportunity is presented Michael s Personal Notes The second quarter earnings reporting season is underway  and mainstream stock advisors have high hopes  But what we are seeing is  more of the same  of what we saw in last quarter s S P 500 company corporate earnings  revenues are lower  corporate earnings are mediocre  and share buyback programs are boosting per share income  Take E  I  du Pont de Nemours and Company  DD   a constituent of both the S P 500 and the   as an example  The chemical giant reported corporate earnings of  1 03 billion  or  1 11 per share  for the second quarter  These earnings were 12  lower than the same period one year ago Caterpillar Inc   CAT   the mining and construction company that is also a component of both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500  reported a decline of 43 5  in its second quarter corporate earnings compared to the same period one year earlier  Caterpillar slashed its outlook for the entire 2013 year  The company s profit fell to  960 million in the second quarter from  1 7 billion a year earlier  On a per share basis  the company s corporate earnings declined from  2 54 to  1 45   Source  Reuters  July 24  2013  This April  Caterpillar announced its first share buyback in more than four years  The company has or will purchase  1 0 billion worth of its own shares at market prices   Source  Associated Press  April 25  2013   And  of course  this will boost per share earnings Halliburton Company  HAL  is one company that reported corporate earnings slightly above estimates at  0 73 per share compared to  0 72 expected  But the company s profit actually went down for the second quarter to  679 million compared to  737 million from a year ago a decline of almost eight percent So how did Halliburton beat the Street with its per share profit  In the second quarter  Halliburton purchased  1 0 billion worth of its own shares  hence it reduced the number of shares in circulation  pushing up per share earnings even though actual profits were lower  Halliburton recently announced it raised its share buyback authorization to  5 0 billion Pfizer Inc   PFE   the major drug maker included in the S P 500  has announced another share repurchase program valued at  10 0 billion the fourth increase in its share buyback program in two and a half years  bringing its total share buybacks to  39 0 billion This is not what you call real corporate earnings growth  dear reader  S P 500 companies are barely meeting already lowered analyst corporate earnings expectations in the second quarter  Hence  these companies are resorting to stock buybacks to prop up per share profits Companies cannot continue the practice of buying their own shares to increase per share corporate earnings for the simple reason that sooner or late  they will run out of cash to make the stock buybacks  You really have to look at this from the outside in  as they say  If big public companies can t achieve real profit growth  and they resort to share buyback programs to boost per share profits as a result  how far away can the end really be for the stock market rally

CAT,2013-07-29,The economic policies of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that has seen the value of the Yen plunge  has been a boon for Japanese exporters as their earnings surge with most of the nation s larg est exporters expected to exceed forecast first quarter earnings  The yen has weakened more than 20  in the past year and this had bolstered earnings for iconic manufacturers such as Toyota and Sony  First quarter earnings for Toyota may rise as much 50  in the first quarter to  4 3 billion whilst analysts are forecasting a jump of more than 70  in year to March earnings  The weakness for the yen may yet continue with banks such as Credit Suisse AG predicting it to weaken to 120 over the next year  USDJPY opens the week trading at 98 10 Meanwhile  in Europe  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble  has said that Europe must maintain pressure on Greece to maintain it austerity pledges before an upcoming German election that is due in 8 weeks where Chancellor Angela Merkel will seek a third consecutive term in office  Most political pundits expect that the next government will be even more pro  euro than the current administration with a solid message of German commitment to the euro zone expected  Given the importance of German to the stability of the still fragile euro zone  a strong message of solidarity will certain assist with the fortunes of the common currency  The euro is currently trading at 1 3275 U S  stock markets recorded their first weekly loss in four weeks as investors continue to focus on a possible tapering of stimulus from the Federal Reserve and weaker than corporate earnings from be hemoths Caterpillar and McDonald s  MCD  weighed on the markets  Home building stocks fell almost 9  during the week in response to worse than expected earnings from the leading components of the sector  Although falling less than 0 1  for the week  the S P 500 managed to gain 0 08  on Friday to close at 1 691 65  Earlier in Europe  the DAX fell 0 65  while the FSTE lost 0 5  GOLD has settled at support just above  1 320  We had successfully locked in profits from long positions entered at below  1 280 last week and then entered into new positions as gold hovered above  1 320  The lack of physical supply throughout all of Asia and an increasingly obvious disparity between the price fixings in Shanghai against the other major markets of London and New York will most certainly provide a strong impetus for the next move higher in gold  We could easily see a short squeeze catapult the gold price to above  1 400 in a matter of a number of trading sessions over the next week  We believe that the worse is now over the metal and that a period of consolidation and steady price gains will be observed over the next quarter  Last week  revised both our short term and medium term outlook on gold to bullish  Compass DirectionShort Term Medium TermBULLISH BULLISHUS Oil  WTI  suffered its first weekly fall in more than a month on speculation that China will introduce measures to cut excess manufacturing capacity  We had warned that China would be the catalyst to bigger correction in WTI over the past fortnight and it appears that this scenario is starting to play out  As the Brent  WTI spread narrowed to zero and WTI traded fleetingly above  108 00  we took the opportunity to enter into new short positions in WTI and maintain these positions which are now well in the money as WTI trades below  105  We expect this downward trend to accelerate in the short term as WTI falls back below  100 00  We also expect now that the Brent WTI will start to settle above  5 00 with a possibility that the spread may widen out to as much at  10 over the next quarter  Today look for a range of  103 20 to  105 50 Compass DirectionShort Term Medium TermBEARISH BEARISH,Keagan York,0.051,0.874,0.075,0.9312

CAT,2013-09-13,Automakers in the U S  economy are getting a significant amount of attention these days because they are selling more cars  In August  total light vehicle sales by the automakers in the U S  economy increased 17  from a year ago  They sold more than 1 5 million cars in August compared to 1 28 million cars last August   Source  Motor Intelligence  last accessed September 10  2013  On the surface  sales reported by the automakers are exuberant  They show consumers are spending  And if this continues  maybe we will see some economic growth in the U S  economy Sadly  this is a one sided conclusion  When I look into the details  it turns out Americans are indeed buying cars from automakers but on borrowed money Here s what you really need to know other than just focusing on the sales by automakers Since the Federal Reserve introduced its easy monetary policies  there has been a significant increase in auto loans to the subprime borrowers those with a low credit score of less than 620 compared to the prime borrowers those with a credit score of 760 and above   Reminds me of the housing crisis we saw in the U S  economy not too long ago  In the second quarter of 2009  there was  10 8 billion of outstanding auto loans to the subprime borrowers in the U S  economy  Fast forwarding to the second quarter of 2013  this number stood at  21 2 billion an increase of more than 96  in just a matter of a few years  In the same period  the amount of auto loans to prime borrowers only increased 38    Source  Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site  last accessed September 10  2013  Unfortunately  the problem doesn t end there  Auto loans continue to increase in the U S  economy  In the second quarter of this year  auto loans as a whole increased to  92 0 billion the highest level since the third quarter of 2007   Source   Household Debt and Credit Developments in 2013 Q2   Federal Reserve Bank of New York  August 2013  Now this will really alarm you Auto loans delinquent for 90 days or more in the U S  economy now sit at 3 6  of all loans  With interest rates already rising  I can only see this number growing Are auto loans going to be the next big bubble to burst in the U S  economy I remain cynical of the optimism we are seeing regarding the automakers  If all of the pieces of the puzzle fall into place as I expect  this won t end well  Those automakers enjoying higher stock prices now may quickly see their fortunes turn Michael s Personal Notes I keep a keen eye on the second biggest economy in the world simply because China is experiencing an economic slowdown that can and will affect the U S  economy  and hurt the profitability of our U S  multinational companies  Since the beginning of this year  the economic slowdown in the Chinese economy has been gaining strength  In the second quarter  we saw the economic growth rate in the Chinese economy fall  the second biggest hub in the global economy grew at 7 5  in the second quarter  compared to 7 7  growth in the first quarter When it comes to economic analysis  one thing I focus on is the long term trend in statistics  When I do just that  the Chinese economy is going the wrong way and I believe there s trouble ahead for China We ve seen this in the past with our own economy  when there s too much credit and rapid expansion  an economic slowdown usually follows  Just look at what happened during the housing boom in the U S  economy credit grew  and we saw ruthless lending practices to attract subprime borrowers Right now  we are witnessing a significant amount of credit expansion in the Chinese economy  The total credit to the private sector has increased more than 166  between the first quarter of 2008 and the last quarter of 2012   Source  International Bank of Settlement web site  last accessed September 10  2013   In the chart below you can clearly see how much credit has risen in the Chinese economy  This should be taken as a warning sign of just how deep the economic slowdown in the country must be My concern  What happens to the profitability of U S  based companies operating in the Chinese economy Let s use General Motors Company  NYSE GM  as one example  In 2012  the company sold 2 8 million vehicles in the Chinese economy  This brought in  33 36 billion for the company  a staggering 22  of its total sales   Source   2012 Annual Report   General Motors Company web site  last accessed September 10  2013  If we see the economic slowdown in the Chinese economy continue on its path  would companies like General Motors  GM  be able to keep the same levels of sales  And what would happen to GM s stock price GM is just one example of a company embedded in the Chinese economy  there are many more  including Wal Mart Stores  Inc   NYSE WMT   NIKE  Inc   NYSE NKE   Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT   and YUM  Brands  Inc   NYSE YUM   and other big American names I can t stress this enough  the U S  economy is highly connected to the Chinese economy  If the economic slowdown in China continues  then you can expect many large cap companies in key stock indices to see their stock prices fall What He Said  If the U S  housing market continues to fall apart  like I predict it will  the stock prices of major American banks that lend money to consumers to buy homes will come under pressure these are the bank stocks I wouldn t own   Michael Lombardi in Profit Confidential  May 2  2007  From May 2007 to November 2008 the Dow Jones U S  Bank Index of the world s largest bank stocks was down 65

CAT,2013-09-22,"Recovery   or the extent of recovery   from the 2008 global crisis is still fairly modest  Achievement on this front  as witnessed from the equity market improvements  has been quite remarkable but the pursuit to reach the pre crisis level is still on  According to the International Monetary Fund s  IMF  World Economic Outlook published in Jul 2013  the world economy will likely grow by 3 1  in 2013 and 3 8  in 2014  Growth in advanced economies and emerging and developing countries are projected at 1 2  and 5 0  in 2013 while the same for 2014 are estimated at 2 1  and 5 4   respectively  These projections represent a slight decline to what was predicted by the IMF in April 2013 due primarily to weak domestic demand  slower than anticipated growth in emerging markets and prolonged Eurozone crisis  No doubt obstacles still persist  nevertheless  the overall growth picture may not materially deteriorate or deviate from the IMF s July 2013 forecast  Talking about the Machinery industry  increasing economic activities spur demand for industrial products  which in turn also boost the need for new advanced machinery  Based on this direct correlation  anticipation of improvement in global economic growth is a positive sign for the future prospects of the machinery industry  The major end markets for the machinery industry include agriculture  construction  mining and energy industries  among others  A brief discussion with a glimpse of the future prospects of the machinery industry among different nations has been provided below Machinery Industry Prospects in the United States The IMF expects the United States to grow 1 7  in 2013 as against 1 9  predicted earlier and roughly 2 7  in 2014  High unemployment still seems to be a disturbing factor  though there is a glimmer of hope emanating from evidences of strengthening demands in the housing as well as durable goods markets  Conditions in the credit markets are also improving slowly  The Machinery industry is one of the most attractive industries in the United States  Growth prospects for this industry can be deduced from the indicators to the performances in the recent past  In the second quarter of 2013  Apr Jun   industrial production in the United States rose by an annual rate of 0 6  while the same in the month of Aug rose by 2 7  as compared with the year ago period  Manufacturing output decreased 0 2  in the quarter  According to the US Census Bureau report published in Aug 2013  machinery shipments in the first half 2013 increased 4 1  year over year while new machinery orders grew 4 5   However  machinery order backlog at the end of the first two quarters were down 10 0   Shipments for construction and industrial machinery rose by 27 2  and 10 4   respectively  while that for mining equipment and farm machinery dipped 6 5  and 7 3   respectively  Exports demand has been considered crucial for the future growth prospects of the US machinery industry  According to a report published by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers  AEM   the United States  construction equipment exports fell 21  in the first half 2013 while agricultural equipment exports registered a 9 5  decline  In years to come  international demand for technologically advanced construction and agriculture equipment are expected to improve for the United States  In this respect  it is worth mentioning that the US Russia trade bill will boost U S  exports of construction equipment to Russia  the 11th largest export market for U S  construction equipment Japanese Markets According to the latest report published by Japan s Cabinet Office  on a monthly basis  core machinery orders in Jul 2013 grew by 4 4   Recovery in capital spending and higher orders from private sector  manufacturing industries and governments were the main drivers of the growth  Also  overseas demand for machinery grew 1 4  in July  indicating prospects of a solid demand growth in the months ahead  Industrial production in the month grew 1 8  over the year ago quarter  as reported by the Ministry of Economy  Trade   Industry  According to the IMF  the Japanese economy is projected to grow 2 0  in 2013 and 1 2  in 2014 Emerging Nations China and India  the two major emerging developing nations  are expected to show signs of tangible growth in the years ahead  According to the IMF  the Chinese economy is projected to grow 7 8  in 2013 and 7 7  in 2014  The Chinese government is focused on rapid urbanization  with major investments planned towards this end  Domestic demand is strong in the country while exports are also on the rise  Further  efforts on improving trade relations with Brazil  Russia and others are expected to boost growth  Industrial production in India revived in the month of July 2013 increasing 2 6  compared with the year ago period attributable to increase of 3  in the manufacturing sector and 5 2  in the power generation sector  According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 5 6  in 2013 and 6 3  in 2014 fuelled largely by rise in domestic and external demand  expectation of policy improvements and better monsoon conditions  Brazil is fast growing as a favorable destination for foreign direct investments  With a population of over 200 million people   according to the data released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics  IBGE    the country s hunger for better infrastructural and agricultural requirements are fast growing  Industrial production in the month of Jul 2013 has grown 2 0  compared with the year ago period  Industries like tourism  steel  electricity  among others offer promising growth especially as the country is gearing up to host the upcoming 2014 Soccer World Cup and 2016 Olympics sporting events  In the second quarter 2013  the country s Gross Domestic Product  GDP  grew 3 3  compared with the year ago quarter while a sequential growth of 1 5  was registered  The Brazilian government  under its Growth Acceleration Program or PAC   phase II  has major investments planned for development of ports  railroads  airports  wind farms and roads  Other areas of focus are sanitation  energy  logistics etc  Also  to boost its export businesses with other countries  roughly 24 Free Trade Zones  FTZ  are being set up across 20 Brazilian states  The first  the Pecem free

period a year ago  The government is focused on improving its mining  manufacturing chemicals  and agricultural sectors  Huge public investments have been announced under the infrastructure development programs  Also  the country is keen on expanding its trade relations with its largest exporter cum importer country  China  According to the IMF  South Africa is expected to grow 2 0  in 2013 and 2 9  in 2014 Other Major Players Korea s industrial production in the month of July 2013 decreased 0 1  compared with the previous month  according to the latest data released by Statistics Korea  Despite the decline  the country seems to be recovering slowly from the impacts of weak exports due to global uncertainties  especially the Eurozone crisis  Thailand s industrial production declined 4 5  in the month of Jul 2013 compared with the year ago period  as reported by the Office of Industrial Economics  The country is making huge investments  both domestic and foreign  to improve its service and public utilities  metal products industries as well as machinery and transport equipment related industries  To further enhance its exports  the government is laying emphasis on infrastructural developments and free trade agreements Eurozone   Still a Hurdle The Eurozone exhibited meager sequential recovery of 0 3  in the second quarter 2013  according to the data released by the Eurostat in Aug 2013  Industrial production  excluding construction   on a monthly basis  in the Eurozone fell by 1 5  in Jul 2013  On a year over year basis  industrial production in July 2013

Net earnings for the year are projected to be approximately  3 45 billion  up from  3 3 billion expected earlier Caterpillar Inc   CAT  posted a 17  decline in Machinery and Power Systems sales in the second quarter of 2013  For the year 2013  the company expects revenue to range within the  56  58 billion range as against  57  61 billion expected earlier due primarily to the expectations of weak demand for mining equipment and expected reduction in dealers inventory  Italy based CNH Global NV  CNH  posted a year over year increase of 9  or 10  on a constant currency basis in its equipment sales in the second quarter 2013  Equipment sales comprised of 83  agricultural sales and 17  construction equipment sales  For 2013  management anticipates agricultural equipment unit volume in the

  ROK   Illinois Tool Works  Inc   ITW   Analyst Report  and Manitowoc Company  Inc   MTW   among others Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  Machinery is broadly grouped into the Industrial Products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  As a guideline  industries with Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower are considered to have a positive outlook  those between  89 and  176 have a neutral outlook while the ones with  177 and higher possess a negative outlook  Machinery industry is further sub divided into five industries at the expanded level  machine tools and

94  machinery   construction and mining is  95  machinery   electrical is  97  machinery   farm is  98 and machinery   general industries is  99  Looking at the Zacks Industry Rank of all the machinery related industries  it can be deduced that the sub segments of the Machinery industries have a neutral outlook Earnings Trend of the Sector Considering results of all the companies within the Industrial Products sector  it can be seen that results for this Zacks sector in the second quarter 2013 were disappointing on a year over year basis  Earnings fell 4 5  while revenue managed just a 0 6  increase  Earnings and revenue beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  were 66 7  and 37 5   respectively in the quarter  However  results exhibited a positive trend when compared with the 8 9  earnings fall and 0 5  revenue decline reported in the first quarter 2013  In a view of all the Zacks sectors combined  second quarter 2013 results were dominated by the finance sector which drove the overall earnings growth to 2 5  year over year  Excluding finance  earnings in the quarter registered a 2 9  fall  Sectors that dragged the results were Oil Energy  Basic Materials  Technology  Industrial Products  Conglomerates  Medical and Consumer Staples  Going forward  the trend seems positive for the Industrial Products sector  as the earnings decline is anticipated to further contract to 1  in the third quarter 2013 while earnings growth of 15 8  is expected in the fourth quarter  For 2013 and 2014  earnings growth of 1 6  and 10 8   respectively are expected  Revenue growth is likely to remain same in the third quarter but to increase slightly in the fourth quarter  For 2013 and 2014  revenue is anticipated to grow 0 8  and 3 3   respectively

CAT,2013-10-03,"I haven t written recently because it is hard to figure out what to do here  Market action at this point seemingly has little to do with fundamentals  and isn t even in  risk on risk off  mode because no one seems to be sure how the government shutdown affects risk  the debt ceiling debate is another issue  which I will discuss later   I often get comments to the effect that  political uncertainty is a fact of life   or  the Fed always manipulates markets   implying that we cannot simply refuse to invest because markets aren t trading cleanly off of economic fundamentals  which don t directly translate into market action even in the best of times anyway   This is true  but I always hearken back to the notion that uncertainty implies a smaller bet size  a long time ago  in which I discussed the implications of the Kelly Criterion for thinking about how one invests   When the economic signals are clear but the market isn t pricing them properly  then you have a great edge and the market is giving you good odds  and most of your chips should be on the table  When the economic signals aren t clear  or when stochastic political events are likely to overwhelm them  then your bet should be small because your edge is lower even if you are getting good odds  In this case  of course  no matter what market you are talking about it isn t at all clear how the debate  perhaps calling it a  debate  is generous  about the continuing resolution to fund government operations  the ACA  and the debt ceiling will be resolved  We can speculate about what various outcomes might mean to the markets  but even here our analysis is fraught with uncertainty  Would an extended shutdown be good for equity markets because it would imply a greater chance of lower ACA costs and a lengthier period of Fed quantitative easing  Or would it be bad because of the short term impact on growth as government spending is delayed  Would bonds rally because there would be no incremental supply  or sell off because of the implied risk of default  A lengthy government closure might be bad for the dollar because it implies more monetary ease  but might be good because it represents  fiscal discipline   admittedly  in this case it s discipline in the fetishistic sense rather than in the self control sense   The only thing I am certain about is the uncertainty  and that spells a smaller bet  Retail investors are especially at a disadvantage  because of the huge amount of misinformation that is out there about likely scenarios and the results of various outcomes  This misinformation is often unwittingly disseminated by media outlets  but I suspect it is rarely unwittingly initiated by the original sources  For example   was pretty good at discussing the possible outcomes  but flunked on at least one aspect when it stated what would happen to the economy as a result of a federal default  I don t mean to pick on the Times here  and in general it is a good article  But at one point the writer said that a default could cause a spike in Treasury yields  likely true   but then continued 

The price tag on a huge range of other debt products is benchmarked to the cost of Treasuries  That means a spike in the federal government s borrowing costs would translate into pricier mortgages  car loans and corporate borrowing costs  

Well  that s wrong  It s not offensively wrong  but it s wrong  and I m pointing it out partly as an example of how even simple stuff is confused right now   The interest rate on any nominal debt instrument consists of several components  the real cost of money  a premium for expected inflation  and a premium for the riskiness of the credit  1  Normally  with Treasuries we can say the credit spread is effectively zero  so that we refer to the spread that a corporate bond trades over Treasuries as  the  credit spread because that spread minus zero equals that spread  But there is no reason to think that spread would remain constant if the Treasury s credit was diminished  any more than it would remain constant if the corporate s credit was diminished  If Treasury rates spiked because the government s perceived credit spread was no longer zero  then unless that also affected the perceived credit of  say  Caterpillar then there is no theoretical reason that CAT yields should also rise  2  In any event  a federal default is not going to happen unless someone in the Administration wants it to happen  The government s  2 9 trillion in revenues is quite a bit more than is needed to pay the  300bln or so in interest costs per year  so unless the Treasury simply decided to default  see an  by my friends at TF Market Advisors  it isn t going to happen  The Treasury has made some mystifying statements about how they don t have the capability to pay some expenses and not others  but in the worst case someone can sit down and manually wire the money to every holder  So that s nonsense that is meant to scare us  So I don t have any decent  trading opinions  on the basis of the government shutdown  What I do believe is that this is an unmitigated positive for inflation  positive in the sense of pushing it higher   and thus for breakevens and inflation swaps  The longer the government stays shut  the longer quantitative easing will be in force as the Fed attempts to counteract the short term contraction of economic activity  the fact that monetary policy is ineffective at affecting growth rates never seems to enter their minds   furthermore a long shutdown will be more likely to push the dollar lower in my opinion   although  as I said above  I can argue the reverse position as well  On the other hand  if the Republicans cave quickly  as is likely in my view  and the ACA goes into effect  prices for consumer purchased medical care will rise rapidly  This is less a statement about whether the ACA will push aggregate health care costs higher  although I believe that it will  It s more an observation that controlled prices in the government purchased sector will produce higher prices outside of the controls  and it is this latter group that will be sampled for consumer prices  since the price the government purchases at is not a  consumer  price   Since it is the Medical Care subgroup of CPI that has been pressing core CPI to be lower than median CPI  any rebound in Medical Care inflation will push aggregate core inflation higher  Was that said in a confusing enough manner  TIPS should do well while the government is shut  because there is ongoing growth in demand for TIPS while the supply will be drying up  Unlike with the nominal Treasury market  there is no corporate inflation linked bond sector that can replace the inflation exposure  although there should be  demanded by investors  so TIPS will tend to outperform nominal bonds in the event that both sets of auctions are canceled  1  There are other costs  such as the discount to the interest rate that the Treasury pays as a result of the status of Treasuries as superior collateral in repo and similar exchanges  but they are not relevant to this point   2  There may be a practical argument that there might be a substitution effect  but that s also saying that investors would bet the selloff in Treasuries makes them a better risk adjusted bet than CAT bonds  However  if the Treasury s credit spread moved permanently higher  it would not affect the equilibrium bond yield of a corporate bond ",Michael Ashton,0.099,0.746,0.156,0.9982

CAT,2013-10-24,Joy Global  JOY  isn t having a very good year  as its orders have plunged amidst a slow down in capital spending in the mining industry due to tepid global growth  This is a very solid company that can be characterized as a  growth cyclical   and the time to buy stocks like this  in my view  is when things don t look so great  The earnings are likely to decline sharply in 2014 based on weak orders currently  but then pick up in 2015  If this proves correct  2014 should be a better year for the stock as investors look forward to the upturn  I estimate that JOY could trade to 73 over the next year  which would represent a total return of 33   Background Based in Milwaukee  Joy Global makes mining equipment that is used for coal and mineral extraction  The company competes closely with cross town rival Bucyrus  which was acquired by Caterpillar  CAT  in 2011  The two companies were very similar  but JOY now differentiates itself for its direct selling  which puts it closer to the customer than CAT s model of using a network of outside dealers  a strategy that should ultimately allow the company to gain market share  One key to understanding JOY is its early 2012 purchase of International Mining Machinery  While strategically sound  the buy of this Chinese company was very poorly timed  JOY divides its business into two segments  Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment  both similar in size with respect to sales and operating income  Importantly  the company has a very large  aftermarkets  business and doesn t focus solely on new equipment sales  CEO Mike Sutherlin  67  has led the company since 2006  but he will be retiring in December  with Ed Doheny  51   who has served as COO since March and as COO of the Underground Mining Equipment Division previously  succeeding him  Doheny joined JOY in 2006 and worked with Ingersoll Rand for two decades previously  Fundamentals JOY reported its Q3 results on August 28  and it was not pretty  though  encouragingly  the numbers were better than had been feared and the outlook was in line with prior expectations  The key metric was that bookings fell 36   suggesting weak sales in the quarters ahead  Sales declined 7   triggering a small decline in earnings from 1 87 to 1 70 excluding one time items  Within bookings  which totaled  695mm  aftermarket represented  599mm and fell 13  while original equipment plunged from  394mm to just  96mm  The weakness was more pronounced in Underground relative to Surface  The company reports backlog  and it fell from  2 2 billion to  1 6 billion from Q2 to Q3  The decline in bookings and backlog is a sure indicator of the rough year ahead for sales  The balance sheet has improved as the company has been using free cash flow to pay down debt  As of July  the net debt totaled  843mm  down from a peak of  1 24 billion six quarters ago  Encouragingly  inventory has declined about 12  in the first three quarters of this year  mitigating risk of future pressure on prices  The company recently authorized a  1 billion share repurchase over the next three years  Valuation On a forward PE basis  at 14X  JOY is priced at a fairly low multiple considering the trough nature of its current earnings  When earnings are rising  the stock typically commands a PE between 15 and 20  Like many stocks in the crash of 2008 09  forward PE s fell to very low levels on JOY in early 2008  as investors feared extensive losses  Notably  JOY EPS never got even close to negative  and this may explain a higher valuation now than the giveaway levels then  I have also included an alternate valuation metric of price to tangible book  noting that by this measure  the stock has rarely traded this inexpensively  My own forecast is that the PE can rise to 17 5 or so as soon as investors become confident that the low is in  FY14 EPS are projected to decline 37  to 3 68  which is down from 5 52 in July and 6 44 six months ago  The current outlook for FY15 is that EPS will then rebound to 4 15  The last peak was near  7 in FY12  and I would expect the next peak to be higher given the larger size of the company  At 17 5PE while it is trading closer to the trough  and perhaps 12X the next peak ultimately   JOY could reach 73 over the next year  perhaps 108 in the cycle  after having hit 103 in the last cycle  Technicals JOY recently bottomed near 48  creating a double bottom near the summer of 2011 lows   I am leery of stocks that have declined  as I expect this to be a very tough tax loss selling year due to huge gains in the market and few stocks that offer large potential write offs  With that said  while JOY is down about 15  in 2013  it s down only slightly more for its 52 week high  So  I don t expect a lot of pressure  I see a bottoming formation even outside the double bottom  The 50dma has been below the longer term 150dma since April  but we are about to cross  I think a beak of 56 suggests a potential move to 58 50 60  The stock seems to have support near 50  Note that rival CAT reduced guidance rather sharply on 10 23  which could push the stock back towards the lower end of the recent range  Conclusion JOY has been under pressure now since peaking in 2011 near 103 as its earnings have fallen sharply as sales have declined following reduced orders  I like JOY here as a contrarian investment leveraged to global economic recovery that should benefit especially on improved prospects for Chinese growth  The stock has been forming a base and looks to offer a good entry between 50 55  offering upside of almost 33  to my one year price  Disclosure  I have no position in JOY  though I have recommended a short term trade at The Analytical Trader at Marketfy ,Liston Street

The MarketsStocks pushed higher on Tuesday as investors positioned portfolios ahead of the FOMC announcement on Wednesday  Investors overwhelmingly expect no change to present stimulus measures as a result of recent lacklustre employment reports that were less than expected  Despite the risk on trading environment that would be implied by maintaining stimulus measures  consumer staples  a defensive sector  continues to dominate market performance  Sectors that have lagged the market activity as of recent  such as the consumer staples and energy  outperformed the market on Tuesday in what may be construed as month end positioning  cyclical sectors that have led the markets higher over recent weeks  such as industrials and materials  underperformed broad market benchmarks during the session  The Russell 2000 Small Cap Index  the classic risk on play  is also starting to show signs of lagging broad market performance  Stocks remain significantly overbought and some sort of consolidation appears to be in order to rejuvenate upside momentum 
The gains on the session pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new closing high as the blue chip index attempts to join the other benchmarks in previously uncharted territory  The Dow is presently testing the upper limit of an over 6 month trading range  The Dow has significantly underperformed the S P 500 since mid April due to lagging performance in Exxon Mobil  IBM  and Caterpillar  each of which typically trend positive into the end of the year 

One of the factors contributing to equity market strength over recent months has been the declines in the US Dollar Index  Correlation of the US Dollar index and stocks is generally negative  indicating that as the US dollar declines  stocks gain  and vice versa  The dollar index is presently testing long term support around 79 0 and a short term positive momentum divergence with respect to MACD has become apparent  The US dollar index seasonally rises into the month of November  which typically weighs on equity market momentum into the middle of the month  The trend in the US Dollar Index will remain dependent on Fed policy  which we ll find out about on Wednesday  Further gains in the dollar index from this significant level of support could have the potential to weigh on equity markets once again 
And finally  with the Fed meeting announcement this afternoon I thought it be prudent to present a chart of the S P 500 with previous FOMC event days noted  The last two FOMC announcements saw a market peak shortly thereafter  the S P 500 was lower during the few weeks that followed  Will today s Fed announcement bring an end to the present short term trend Seasonal charts of companies reporting earnings today Sentiment on Tuesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 74  Complacency is showing signs of spiking ahead of Wednesday s potentially market moving FOMC event S P 500 IndexTSE CompositeHorizons Seasonal Rotation ETF  TSX HAC

CAT,2013-11-30,"The one aspect to our earnings work that might not be readily apparent to readers is that sometimes there is little new or  value added  to say about the weekly S P 500 earnings data  that would be worth reading  At those times  we will pick specific data series  put them here on the blog  and share some thoughts for readers   There are 3 key aspects to our earnings work where we think readers should pay particularly close attention   1   Weekly  The year over year growth rate of the  forward 4 quarter  S P 500 estimate  After dropping the weekly data into our spreadsheets every weekend  immediately I check the year over year growth rate of the forward estimate  As long as that forward estimate is climbing  or at least stable   then the market P E is likely to expand  which is where the majority of gains occur in a bull market anyway  As a caveat to readers  this aspect of the model failed me in 2008  which we ve written about prior on this blog  The forward 4 quarter EPS estimate didn t peak until early July  2008  and then started to roll over  about 8 months after the S P 500 peaked in October  2007   2   Weekly  Changes in y y growth estimates of the 10 S P 500 sectors  particularly absolute changes in estimates  and trends relative to the other sectors as a whole  In the fall of 2012  we started noticing that the Financial sector y y growth estimates were stable as the rest of the S P 500 estimates were being reduced  at a rate that is typical with the pattern we see every quarter   so we went to a Financial sector overweight  and remain so  as we entered 2013  The trick to this analysis is that absolute changes in the growth rates are critical  but the relative changes are important as well  since outperformance of the S P 500  the so called alpha every advisor seeks  is relative performance   Confusing I know  but I hope the reader sees the point    3   Quarterly  The actual dollar estimate of the S P 500  forward 4 quarter  series  at the first full week of the start of every quarter  We traditionally see a  3   4  increase in the core EPS estimate of the S P 500 as ThomsonReuters  rolls  into the next forward quarter of the  forward 4 quarter  series  As long as we continue to see the  bump  and the increase in the roll forward  then forward earnings should not be an issue for the market   There could be other issues  as we saw on 9 11 and then in 2008  but in terms of the general health of corporate earnings  the  bump  is critical in terms of gauging the health of earnings  in our opinion  So on to this week s data  per ThomsonReuters as of 11 29 13 The forward 4 quarter earnings estimate slipped  0 02 last week to  117 70 The S P 500 P E ratio on the forward estimate rose to 15 3 x   still slightly ahead of the 10 year  average  P E of 14 x  per the Factset data The earnings yield on the S P 500 is 6 52  as of Friday 11 30 13  some use the S P 500 earnings yield as an equity risk premium  ERP  proxy   We use the earnings yield calculation as part of the Fed Model calculation  Either way you care to use it  either as a relative yield indicator  as an ERP measure or as an important metric of the Fed Model  it seems to be telling us that the S P 500  despite the doom and gloomers  remains fairly valued  and certainly not at any extreme in terms of overvaluation The growth rate of the forward 4 quarter estimate stayed even with last week s 7 57   at 7 57  as of 11 29 13  The long run post WW II growth rate of S P 500 earnings is 7   so today S P 500 earnings are growing about in line with the historical average  and are certainly not the runaway  40  growth we saw in technology in the late 1990 s Sector data  per Thomson  2014 full year EPS estimates for the S P 500 are expected in the 11  range  which would be stronger than 2013 s expected growth of 6    7   Despite the Iran deal last week  and the ending of sanctions which could put more Iranian oil on the market  Energy estimates have shown the best upward revisions since July 1  in terms of 2014 estimates  By way of comparison  Energy sector earnings growth was the lowest of the 10 S P 500 sectors in q3  13  and is also expected to be the lowest earnings growth of any 10 S P 500 sectors in q4  13  For Q4  13  Factset s chart shows that Financials are expected to show  10  revenue growth for the quarter  I don t have the detail in terms of why Financials are expecting 10  decline in revenue growth in Q4  13 As we wrote about last week  Energy and Financials are still the two sectors that have seen upward revisions for full year 2014 estimates as the rest of the S P 500 sectors have seen slight downward revisions Not set in stone yet  but again we are paying attention to relative and absolute changes in the earnings data Which stocks have seen the greatest upward   downward revisions to Q4  13 estimates  This data from Factset is very useful  John Butters who is now writing Factset s weekly Earnings

This is pretty good information detailed by Factset  but is just a starting point for more individual work on my part  For example  Deere  DE   and Caterpillar  CAT  are two big laggards in 2013  with an S P 500 up almost 30  on the year  The fact that DE s EPS estimate is starting to get revised higher  means it is time for me to do additional work on the company and stock  we have our spreadsheet already  and make sure the gain is operating driven  and not just GAAP or non operating generated

Our attention is now turning to 2014 estimates and what might be the better sectors next year  We wont fully know 2013 s EPS and full year earnings growth rate until the last day of March or first week of April 2014  given the lag in reporting 
Our assumptions remain the same 
Q4  13 s S P 500 earnings growth will be close to 10  and the best quarterly growth rate in 2 years 


2014 s S P 500 earnings growth will likely be stronger than 2013 s earnings growth  The key question is or will be the multiple assigned to that growth 
The two sectors with upward earnings revisions already to 2014 estimates are Financials and Energy  It is still early in the game though

CAT,2013-12-31,Mining success is not measured in ounces and dollars but instead by healthy margins  argues Robert Cohen  lead portfolio manager with Dynamic Funds  In this interview with The Gold Report  Cohen declares that investors should seek out projects that will earn profits of 20 35   regardless of size  and takes us on an around the world tour of companies that hit this sweet spot    The Gold Report  Since you last spoke to The Gold Report in March  the price of gold has collapsed  What happened    Rob Cohen  Gold has collapsed when compared to the U S  dollar  but not when compared to other hard assets  For instance  since gold was allowed to float in 1971  its average price ratio per ounce to the price of a barrel of oil has been 15 1  Right now  it s about 13 1  so it s not that far from the mean  We remain a little puzzled by what has happened  Going back to 2008  there s been a strong correlation between the expanding balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and the rising price of gold  but that link has been cut  at least for now    We have also had some positive economic data out of the U S    TGR  Is this positive data really all that positive    RC  We do question the fundamentals underneath the data  Unemployment numbers are beating expectations  but the U S  doesn t count  discouraged workers  as unemployed  So the true number is not 7  but really about 11 3   The trade deficit has narrowed  but this is due to increases in domestic oil and gas production and not from increasing exports    TGR  Do you think that  1 300 ounce   1 300 oz  is gold s new ceiling    RC  Not necessarily  There are a lot of signs that the U S  dollar could crack  It faces serious stresses from trade deficits with China and Europe and countries like China that manipulate their currencies in order to put U S  exporters at such a disadvantage  This cannot go on indefinitely  If the U S  dollar loses purchasing power for whatever reason  this will be manifested in a higher gold price    TGR  To what extent is the price of gold affected by Indian purchases  The government of India has moved against gold buying to protect the rupee  Is this a battle it can win    RC  I don t think so  Don t forget  Indians were buying gold quite happily at much higher prices than today  India is a country where the fiat currency is not that dependable as a store of value  Restricting gold means smuggling  and the current illegal premium is estimated to be the old import tax plus  200 oz  And now the Indian government isn t getting that tax    The world has mined about 2 500 tons year of gold for the past decade or so  With the falloff in the demand from India  whatever it may be  China and other countries have stepped in and picked up the slack  There is no evidence of huge amounts of gold floating around with nowhere to go    TGR  Is Asia becoming the dominant continent for ownership of gold bullion    RC  The desire is there  but the amount of gold available is so restricted  there s a perennial demand for more  China has more than  3 trillion of foreign exchange reserves  and if it wanted to back that with gold  it would need to buy hundreds of tons a year  This year is perhaps unique because 800 tons were released when investors flooded out of exchange traded funds  China would have had the capacity to absorb that  but it is a Communist country  and it doesn t announce its gold purchases to the world    TGR  In this depressed market  how do companies stand out from the pack and prove their worth to investors  Are healthy margins essential in this respect    RC  I look at this industry as having a relatively constant profit margin in the 20 30  range  In other words  when gold prices go up  the cost structure will go up  Expenses such as oil  chemicals  tires  Caterpillar equipment  etc   are not as much in the control of companies as investors might think  Market prices are determined by the purchasing power of a dollar  and when dollars lose purchasing power  absolute price levels move up    TGR  Have precious metals miners cut costs substantially      RC  In Q3 13 many companies met or beat expectations and patted themselves on the back for getting their costs down  But many of these costs fell because of the dollar s increased purchasing power  Let s say a company produces gold for  1 000 oz  Many people think that s an absolute that will withstand time  but that s not quite true  If the price of gold fell to  1 000 oz  that would not wipe out profits  Eventually  costs would come down to say  800 oz  and companies would still have an approximate 20  margin  And if gold goes up to  1 300 oz and beyond  costs such as energy prices will have an equivalent rise    TGR  Is there a right way and a wrong way to cut costs    RC  Absolutely  We have companies saying   OK  we ve cut our exploration budget in half   but they haven t truly cut that budget until they ve truly cut the amount of meters drilled  If a company cuts the number of meters drilled in half  exploration costs should probably be one quarter  The market should be better attuned to whether management is truly cutting  say by cutting employees and creating efficiencies  as opposed to taking credit for reduced costs on the downside    We can expect the oil gold ratio to stay at probably at least 13 1  So if gold goes up  oil will likely go up correspondingly as will mining companies  energy bills  This cannot be controlled  Investors should learn to focus on profit margins  rather than absolute dollar margins  They should think of companies producing at 20  margins regardless of the gold price    TGR  Given how low equities have fallen  do you anticipate a wave of takeovers    RC  We ve already had quite a few this year  However  most of the acquisitions are head scratchers as far as I m concerned companies buying cheap but not necessarily profitable ounces    Some examples are IAMGOLD Corp  s  IAG  acquisition of Trelawney Resources  New Gold Inc  s  NGD  acquisition of Rainy River and B2Gold Corp  s  BTG  acquisition of Volta Resources Inc   VTR   All these projects have fairly skinny economics at these gold prices  As did Osisko Mining Corp  s  OSK  acquisition of Queenston Mining at the end of 2012    I would rather have seen companies buying projects with robust economics  even at today s gold prices    TGR  Which companies are well placed to buy small companies with robust projects    RC  Companies with really good balance sheets in a good position to do acquisitions include Goldcorp Inc   GG  and Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD   But any company with a half decent balance sheet could make an astute buy in this market    TGR  What would you consider an astute buy    RC  The companies out there owning projects with 25 35  rates of return  as opposed to some of the acquisitions we ve seen  which have rates of return in the 10  range    I ll name two examples  The first would be Papillon Resources Inc   PIR   an ASX listed company with a  310 million   310M  market cap  Its Fekola open pit gold project in Mali has more than 5 million ounces  5 Moz  at 2 35 grams ton  2 35 g t     TGR  You ve called Fekola a world class discovery    RC  Yes  In the early years of the mine  Papillon can mine a higher grade  which would enhance the economics and allow a somewhat faster payback  We don t typically find open pits with relatively low strip ratios capable of producing gold around  500 oz  like Fekola  Open pits in Nevada or in Canada  such as Osisko s Canadian Malartic mine  typically grade 1 g t    Fekola is 20  held by the Mali government and 4  by a local joint venture partner  so with its 76  credit  Papillon could produce about 245 000 ounces  245 Koz  a year and have a fairly comfortable cash flow  even at these prices  of  110M a year  Against capital costs  this would result in a two and a half year payback  Its rate of return would be 25  at today s gold price  which is considered unhealthy  but pretty healthy given the size of the project    TGR  And the second company    RC  Roxgold Inc  s  ROG  Yaramoko underground gold project in Burkina Faso  which has barely 1 Moz gold but extremely high grade at 11 5 g t  It has a  100M capital expense  which isn t huge  but it can throw off  50M year in cash flow  so that s a two year payback  Even at this gold price  that equates to about a 34  rate of return    TGR  Many of the top 10 holdings in the Dynamic Strategic Gold Class Fund are in Africa  What do you like about Africa  and how are your holdings affected by considerations of country risk    RC  Africa is one of the less explored gold regions  so there is certainly a lot more low hanging fruit to pick  Generally  you find projects there that have 25 35  rates of return  which helps compensate for political risks    Having said that  we ve seen lots of problems with companies getting permits right here in the U S  and Canada  There aren t any slam dunks anywhere anymore    TGR  Burkina Faso is certainly rated highly in West Africa  What else do you like there    RC  Orbis Gold Ltd   OBS   which has the Natougou open pit gold project in Burkina Faso  We re talking 3 5 g t average grade  about 1 5 Moz so far and a lot of growth potential  There is a high strip ratio  in other words  a lot of overburden to remove  but because the grade is so high  it pays for the removal of that overburden  Again  this is a project that should have a less than two year payback    TGR  You mentioned Randgold earlier  How do you rate its operations    RC  Randgold has been one of the best senior gold companies for delivery and execution  In 2013  it is expected to produce around 900 950 Koz gold at  700 750 oz  It just started up its Kibali mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  slightly ahead of schedule  Its other important project is the Loulo Gounkoto project in Mali  And it has the Tongon project in Cote d Ivoire    TGR  Randgold just announced a quarter on quarter profit increase of 80     RC  That is because the company is growing production  In 2014  this should rise to 1 2 Moz because Kibali will have booked a full year  By 2017  Randgold s balance sheet could rise to about  1 5 billion  which means free cash flow of about  500M per year  That would support a dividend policy  Actually  the company has completed a large part of its capital spending phase  so it could start paying dividends now    TGR  How bad is Mexico s new taxation regime for mining    RC  I think we can weather it  Certainly  introducing this at a time when the industry is struggling is not great timing and does eat into company profits  This is another example of why it would be good for the industry to foster a margin driven attitude  Governments see a company producing gold for  800 oz  and then  when gold surges to  1 800 oz  they assume falsely that the company has a  1 000 oz profit margin  Governments need to be taught that these measures cut more heavily into margins than they think    TGR  How do you rate the Mexican companies you follow    RC  Alamos Gold Inc   AGI  is advancing its projects in Turkey  but all its production currently comes from Mexico  It has done a fantastic job navigating the bear market and has maintained a very healthy balance sheet  with  430M in cash  Production in 2014 should be about 190 Koz gold  Its all in cash costs at its Mulatos mine in Mexico should be around  850 oz  It has good exploration growth potential  Alamos is probably in the top quartile or even top decile of all gold companies    TGR  And Fresnillo Plc  FRES     RC  Fresnillo is the world s largest primary silver producer  It has had a problem with an ejido  communal land activists  around Herradura  the gold mine in Mexico it holds in a joint venture with Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   Its blasting permit around the ejido area has been suspended  but the company is working swiftly toward a resolution  It is working with the ejido group on that  Fresnillo is a well run company with some of the premier silver mines in the world  It has good prospects and a 12 3  compounded annual growth rate in silver production over the next five years  It might not be the cheapest stock  but it is quality    TGR  Does resurgent resource nationalism globally make companies operating in Canada more attractive to investors    RC  It depends on what commodity you re looking at  Canada is a big producer of iron ore and nickel and  to a lesser degree  gold and copper  I always look first at the quality of projects  Yes  we have a couple of new copper projects being built  but for the most part  I think our status will not necessarily rise  Operating mines will probably become more attractive when investors are ready to get exposure to those commodities    TGR  Osisko announced last month that Canadian Malartic had surpassed production of 1 Moz gold total  What does the future hold for Malartic    RC  It is a fantastic ore body  very homogeneous  I expect the free cash flow to really pick up now that the mine has ramped up to nameplate capacity  It can start opening up the pit  now that it is getting deeper  Osisko had to be quite cautious previously because it was mining right up against the edge of the town    Malartic also has the higher grade South Barnat open pit to still develop  Before this can happen  the highway that passes through the town must be rerouted  Osisko is working its way through the permits on that  but when it actually gets into South Barnat  this will certainly add more fuel to its profits  I think Malartic will have excellent years to come    TGR  Any other companies you d care to mention    RC  Regis Resources Ltd   RRL  in Australia and Tahoe Resources Inc   TAHO  in Guatemala  Regis is a mid cap gold producer  The startup of its Garden Well project in Western Australia has been a disappointment  as there have been grade reconciliation issues  But overall  it has been a company that has executed fairly well on building its mines and delivering  It has  like its entire sector  been challenged by this market  but  overall  it still has good value    TGR  Tahoe s Escobal silver project in Guatemala just produced its first concentrate    RC  That s correct  Escobal is one of the best new silver mines in the world and is one of our preferred methods of getting exposure to silver    TGR  Tahoe Resources has had a significant increase in its stock price since its low of around  13 share in July    RC  That s because Escobal has been derisked  During its construction phase  it was plagued with protestors from local groups and non governmental organizations  We ve seen this in Guatemala before  What happens is that once a mine goes into production there  its opponents realize they have lost the battle and then pick a different project to attack    I talked with management just the other day  Tahoe is working on getting its recoveries up to a steady state  Startups can be very tricky  This one is going fairly smoothly    TGR  Rob  thank you for your time and your insights    A mineral

CAT,2014-01-05,I do not think the US stock market is in a bubble   If you don t think you have a good alternative for your money  don t sell your stocks  The US stock market as measured by the S P 500 rose by 29 6  percent in 2013  Many investors who were perspicacious enough to participate in this rally might be tempted to take profits and sell  Given the high tax cost of this strategy  I would argue this is a bad strategy given what in my opinion appears to be the paucity of attractive alternatives   I m not going to get into stock market valuation issues since the numbers can be manipulated to produce whatever conclusion the analyst wants  Other than to say that  while stocks are not at 2008  with hindsight  give away prices  I do not think the US stock market is massively overvalued   This is not 2000 The US economy will continue to recover albeit at a subpar rate   The resiliency of the US economy will continue to show itself despite the impediments thrown its way by the Obama Administration  The economy has to deal with such things as Obamacare  higher taxes  the Administration s war on coal  misallocation of resources to less efficient  green energy  projects  the continued harassment of the banking system via endless lawsuits and Dodd Frank  spikes upward in minimum wage laws and the Administration s refusal to approve the Keystone project  Add to this lackluster foreign growth Technology is accelerating at an rapid rate  Investors   including retirees   need to be invested in growth in one form or another   Investing in tech companies is one approach  But  it is not the only one  The tech revolution underlies the prosperity of all major global companies  from Starbucks to Caterpillar to Citibank  They are the beneficiaries of the tech revolution  Reviled by the left  I view the global corporation as one of the major achievements of mankind  Major global companies are the place to look for conservative investors who lack the sophistication and information to play the tech game  The global companies reinvest for you and avoid the double taxation of dividends  And buy and hold strategies avoid capital gains taxes   Of course not all major global companies are great investments  Some  like Microsoft or Proctor and Gamble  get stuck in long periods of stagnation    Management  products and valuation count as well  The acceleration of technology   which makes possible things like the internet  artificial intelligence  globalization  biotechnology  benefits all humankind but it especially favors the talented and the well educated  But  based on objective family income and educational achievement metrics  substantial segments of modern populations cannot be considered talented and well educated   Rightly or wrongly they may view themselves as unfairly left out as beneficiaries of the technology revolution  This situation is aggravated when   as in the US   there are racial differences between high performing and low performing groups in terms of family income and educational achievement  Investors  who generally belong to the higher performing groups  can expect lower performing groups to pressure their elected representatives to confiscate via taxes on their incomes and possibly their wealth  The various  rights  asserted by activist groups e g  education  health care  food  shelter  none of which are mentioned in the American constitution   can be viewed as confiscatory claims on the incomes of higher income groups who pay the bulk of the taxes    This situation is further aggravated by the fact that the major democracies are already overloaded with entitlement obligations and face longer term solvency issues  The elections of populists Barack Obama  Francois Hollande and now Bill de Blasio  as mayor of New York  reflect this trend  Investors must therefore carefully plan their investment strategies with taxes and populist politicians in mind  Investors should applaud the removal of Quantitative Easing although under Fed Chairperson Janet Yellen it may never happen  Of course this statement flies in the face of current market beliefs  Trained like Pavlov s dogs  any talk of tapering and the stock and bond markets go down  My own view is that QE is an irresponsible monetary experiment that offers dubious short term stimulus gains   Investors should think of the Federal Reserve  and the world s major central banks  as just another government agency  in this case the one in charge of printing money  The Fed is not a real bank and but is a massive ATM machine financing the government  Since it is part of the government  the Fed s spending in an economic sense should be consolidated with the Federal Government budget  When the Fed buys government debt  this adds zero to government spending  When the Fed buys non government debt or non government assets of any kind  this is an addition to government spending  Removal of these non government purchases under a tapering program will have an insignificant contractionary effect on the economy  But when the Fed prints high powered money under QE that represents substituting Fed money printing for  currently  low interest on government debt borrowing  The Fed is simply an alternative source of funds for the government  But with the potential to destroy the currency Stay away from investments that do not have a growth component  That means stay away from longer term bonds and purely fixed income products  The Quantitative Easing programs haven t produced the inflation that the simple monetarist models predicted   yet  But the reserves added to the banking system sit in the Fed like a bomb  ready to go off sometime in the future  Hybrid fixed income products like REITs and MLPs have a growth possibility as do  less tax efficient  dividends  But straight fixed income products will be left out of the party if we move back to a world where inflation is a significant factor  The traditional advice for retirees is to buy bonds  I think this is bad advice when we have central banks that actually target positive inflation rates and think they can manipulate their currencies to suit current political objectives  The world does not operate under the gold standard  It operates under a fiat money standard run by a group of central planners called central banks I m not calling for a major collapse of the Chinese economy   But the Chinese economy is no longer a shining star  Unfortunately nobody really knows how bad things might be in China and there is a real chance things could be worse than I am expecting  George Soros has said the Chinese economy represents the greatest risk to the global economy  I would agree with this   Other than some of the Chinese internet stocks that trade mostly in New York and which cater to the Chinese consumer and private sectors  Chinese stocks should be avoided  And given China s size and importance  this puts a damper on all emerging market stocks especially those in Asia  There are two offsetting factors regarding the Chinese economy  The first is that the Chinese economy is structurally unsound  Via expansive state owned bank lending  massive resources have been misdirected into municipal infrastructure  real estate and state owned companies  Environmental costs have been disregarded and have become very significant  The banking system  which finances all of this  sooner or later will require a bailout since so many of its borrowers cannot repay their loans  The non bank financial system  which has evolved in response to this state sponsored misdirection of resources  is itself filled with risk   China with over three trillion dollars in reserves can probably afford this bailout but this not a healthy situation  The offsetting factor is the character of the Chinese people  The Chinese people are hardworking  driven by materialism and a love of technology and modernity and devoted to improving their educational levels  Economists  partly because of the need to be politically correct  pay little attention to the character of a people in evaluating countries  potential for economic development  My own view is that the character of a people is very important  In Southeast Asia and Hong Kong Chinese have made huge successes of themselves in environments where the rule of law and respect for property prevail  But can these hardworking people continue to offset the damage caused by their malfunctioning  government  Communist Party  directed economic system I have argued that the euro would not break up even if the Europeans were going about saving it in the wrong way with money printing and bailouts  So far that forecast is correct and I see no reason to change it  Europeans are overall well educated and with first class work skills  But Europe still remains a group of nations whose economies are tied down by socialist restrictions Gold will make a comeback someday but only when the world starts worrying about inflation  2014 doesn t not look to be a year to worry about inflation  Overcapacity  lingering debt overhang and technology globalization productivity gains will keep inflation off investors  near term radar screens  Bitcoins are the new internet gold  Their popularity has already provoked negative reactions in several countries notably China  Bitcoins compete with national currencies  So far the Obama Administration for some strange reason has not been hostile  Bitcoins like Teslas are  cool  especially in Silicon Valley  Obama has other things to worry about right now and perhaps he doesn t want to lose his vaunted cool status  But sooner or later  if bitcoins prove a big success and start to threaten the status of the dollar  odds are the US government   maybe led by some uncool Republicans   will turn against bitcoins ,Peter T.

CAT,2014-01-24,"By    Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT   the world s largest producer of mining and construction equipment  will report a 12 3 percent drop in fourth quarter earnings due to high dealer inventories and low global demand for mining equipment that can t be offset by recent cost cutting measures or a flat growth in their construction segment 
When the Peoria  Ill  based company announces fourth quarter earnings on Monday before markets open  it will likely report a net income of  826 million  or  1 28 per share  on revenue of  13 64 billion based on the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters 
In the same period a year earlier  net income was  977 million  or  1 46 per share  on  16 08 billion in revenue 
The manufacturer in the third quarter lowered its outlook for all of 2013  revising sales and revenue predictions down to  55 billion from  64 billion  This represents a 16 6 percent drop from its revenues of  66 billion in 2012 

Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast a 50 percent fourth quarter revenue decline year over year due primarily to the resource sector  Though the company is attempting to control its inventory problems   we believe this will be a long and arduous process   the note read    
It s been a bad year for mining in general  and recent months haven t been better  Companies have stopped opening new operations and ordering new equipment  which will hurt revenues in the fourth quarter 
In a note  Wells Fargo analysts wrote that Caterpillar  continued to encounter difficult market conditions  driven by weaker mining equipment and construction equipment demand   and lowered their earnings guidance down to  1 30 per share from  1 56 
In October  Caterpillar management forecast a 40 percent drop in their resource sector  which is mainly mining  for all of 2013 
Caterpillar doesn t sell its products directly to companies or customers but to dealers who build up their own stock to sell in the future  When the industry started to slow in 2012  dealers had purchased more equipment than demand required  which created excess inventory  At the end of the third quarter  backlog was  19 1 billion  down from  23 1 billion for the same quarter a year earlier   
At a Dec  4 conference  Mike DeWalt  Caterpillar s vice president of strategic services  told analysts that the company is making a variety of changes to help lower expenses 
 We really started in earnest with that in the second quarter  did more in the third quarter and there is more coming in the fourth quarter   he said 
When they last reported earnings on Oct  23  worldwide full time employment for Caterpillar was 121 506 in October  down 7 607 since the year before  
On Oct  30  Caterpillar announced that a plant in Kilgore  Texas  would be closed by the year s end  Over the course of the entire year  roughly 90 percent of employees took three weeks of paid leave  Meanwhile  De Walt said at a presentation in December that a  large chunk of production  was moved from Australia to Thailand  affecting about 200 people 
 In and of itself that one item is not massive   he said 
 The cost reductions that we re doing across the company in a lot of ways are like that  it s many  many actions spread across the company  It s allowed us this year to actually get pretty good cost reduction  
Analysts from Zacks Equity Research updated their rating of Caterpillar stock to neutral on Jan  17  citing these and other cost cutting efforts as a major reason   
Caterpillar also has a large construction segment  Though its revenues are likely to decrease again  it won t be as severe a loss as other sectors 
While the resource industries sector revenues dropped by 42 percent last quarter since the year earlier  construction sales lost only 7 percent 
 The construction group  which underperformed through the first half of 2013  gained momentum in anticipation of a recovery in non residential construction in the U S   and finished the year up 41 percent  ahead of the broader market   reads a note from J P Morgan analysts  
Though this segment remains at risk  it makes them  more optimistic about the outlook for CAT   for the quarter and the year  despite the general underperformance of the machinery sector in 2013   
Morgan Stanley analyst Nicole DeBlase wrote in a note on Tuesday that she is  skeptical  about Caterpillar s 2014 outlook  given the potential for mining end user demand to take another leg down  as growth projects roll off  ",International Business Times,0.065,0.871,0.064,0.9029
CAT,2014-01-24,"By    U S  stocks tumbled on Friday  after the Dow plunged 318 points  and Wall Street suffered its worst week since 2011 on emerging market concerns 
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1 96 percent to close at 15 879 11  The S P 500 Index lost 38 15 points  or 2 09 percent  to end at 1 790 29  The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 90 70 points  or 2 15 percent  to finish at 4 128 17 
 There s no question that January so far is a bit disappointing  at least what s happening over the last few days and I suspect that while I don t think that this is the beginning of the correction that everyone is talking about  and that we re expecting as well  the market is undergoing a pretty severe pullback over the past two days and I think that s due to the fact that there s a lot of uncertainties within the emerging markets   said chief market economist Peter Cardillo of Rockwell Global Capital 
The Dow recorded its worst week since November 2011 after falling 3 5 percent  while the S P 500 posted a drop of 2 6 percent for the week  its worst since June 1012  The Nasdaq reported a weekly decline of 1 7 percent  The S P 500 fell under the psychologically important 1 800 level  while the Dow lost 4 2 percent since the end of 2013 
Thus far  122 companies in the S P 500 have reported earnings results for the previous quarter  Of those companies  63 9 percent topped Wall Street estimates  slightly higher compared with the long term average of 63 percent  according to Reuters 
Meanwhile  emerging market currencies continued to get slammed on Friday due to political turmoil in countries such as Turkey and Argentina  sending the Turkish lira 2 34 against the dollar  a new record low  while the Argentine peso dropped nearly 20 percent this week against the dollar to 8 00  according to Bloomberg data 
 Look what s happening over the Turkish lira and of course the Argentinian currency and some of the other currencies  you ll see that there s a lot of chaos  and that s I think what s really holding hostage the market here   said Cardillo   In terms of fundamentals  so far nothing has really changed  We have earnings for the most part been pretty good  Yes  some of the big names have missed and you might want to label this earnings season so far as a mixed bag  you might say  Again  nothing that would  I think  induce the beginning of a serious correction  
Consumer discretionary stocks have also taken a hit thus far in January  after outperforming all other sectors in the benchmark S P 500 Index during 2013  The sector is down 5 03 percent this month and has risen 26 09 year to date  Meanwhile  consumer staples stocks have fallen 3 70 in January and have risen 12 82 percent in the past 12 months 
 I don t think that s a reason to believe that this is a beginning of a major selloff   added Cardillo 
Ahead on the economic calendar next week  the Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting of the year on Jan  28 29  with the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  scheduled to release a statement at 2 p m  Eastern on Wednesday  The policy meeting will mark the last for outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke  as current Vice Chair Janet Yellen prepares to take over  In addition  the initial estimate of U S  fourth quarter gross domestic product  GDP  is reported on Thursday 
 Next week we have a heavy week of economic data and of course consumer spending is on top of the list and I think we re going to see a fairly good number   said Cardillo   I think we re looking at a 3 7 gross domestic product  a revision there  but I think that is downward from the third quarter and I think still that s pretty good considering the 2 9  3 percent that we ve been counting  However  I think that the first quarter obviously will come down more to a more reasonable level of about 3 25 percent

CAT,2014-01-24,"The life of a professional short seller can be lonely   When you celebrate a successful trade you do it largely in private because  more often than not  everyone you know lost money 
And when you lose   Well don t expect much in the way of sympathy 
Given that you are constantly going against both popular opinion and the normal upward bias of the stock market  you have to be confident in your research when you take a large short position   But given that  in the words of John Maynard Keynes  the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent  you also have to have disciplined risk management in place and be willing to cut your losses early 
This is a long way of saying that short sellers are a special breed 
John DelVecchio  co manager of the Ranger Equity Bear ETF  HDGE  a dedicated short fund  and manager of the Forensic Accounting ETF  FLAG   is one of those special breed   I reviewed DelVecchio s book    about a year ago  and I consider it required reading for any aspiring short seller 
I can  however   summarize the book in one short paragraph   A sky high valuation is not sufficient justification to short a stock  as expensive stocks often have a way of getting more expensive and gimmicky fad stocks can stay trendy longer than you think   You need a catalyst  and the signs for DelVecchio that the jig is up are aggressive revenue recognition and inventory management   Quoting What s Behind the Numbers     The time to sell or short is not when you think a business model can t survive   The time is when the numbers suggest that management is covering up poor performance  
With the market off to a slow start in 2014 and valuations looking a little stretched  you might be itching to try your luck as a short seller   Let s take a peek at what DelVecchio and co manager Brad Lamensdorf are shorting to find some promising candidates 
Top Five HDGE ETF Short Positions as of 1 20 2014
The largest short position in the HDGE ETF portfolio is one of the bluest of blue chip stocks  IBM  IBM   It takes a certain amount of chutzpah to short IBM given that it is one of Warren Buffett s largest holdings  but Big Blue did have a losing year in the market in 2013  a year in which the S P returned 32  including dividends 
Next on the list are telecom operator Centurylink  CTL  industrial supplier Fastenal  FAST  and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar  CAT   all of which have struggled over the past year   Caterpillar in particular has faced a double whammy of lower demand from emerging markets and lower commodity prices  which have discouraged new projects   Rounding out the top five is Tempur Sealy International  TPX   which performed surprisingly well in 2013   Nearly two years ago  I wrote about the demographic trends driving Tempur s business  suggesting that over the long term the business faced enormous headwinds   In the immediate near term  it will be the family formation of Generation Y  and the resulting need for new furniture  that makes or breaks the company 
Other shorts of note are Harley Davison  HOG   Netflix  NFLX   Tesla Motors  TSLA  Michael Kors  KORS  and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  KMP  
Last year  I wrote about  Harley Davidson s Flat Tire  Demographics   and I share the managers  bearish outlook for the company   And while I admire Netflix as a company  I have long been skeptical of the sustainability of its growth and its stratospheric valuation 
Tesla Motors which was Kyle Woodley s pick in InvestorPlace s Best Stocks for 2014 contest  and the current leader by a wide margin  is a risky short given its momentum  and one that I probably wouldn t have the stomach to execute   The same goes for upstart fashion designer Michael Kors  which has taken the aspirational luxury market by storm in recent years   Though both stocks are significantly more expensive than the broader market 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is an interesting case   Hedgeye  a risk management and research firm  made a stir last year by calling KMP a  house of cards   arguing that the company was engaging in aggressive accounting related to maintenance and capital expenditure spending   While I believe this is probably true  at least to an extent  I would hesitate to short a stock with heavy insider buying     As I wrote recently   Richard Kinder has put  60 million dollars of his own money into KMP s general partner  Kinder Morgan Inc  KMI  
I ll wrap this up with some general short selling advice from DelVecchio and co author Tom Jacobs from What s Behind the Numbers 
First  don t be too eager to jump into a short position   As DelVecchio and Jacobs point out   You make as much money shorting a stock that falls from  70 to  5  93 percent  as one that falls from  100 to  5  95 percent    Getting into a trade too early will turn a would be profitable short into a frustrating loss 
Second  watch out for crowded trades   Don t short a stock if the short interest is too high as a percentage of the float   This puts you at risk of being short squeezed as your fellow sellers all scramble to buy at the same time and send the share price to the moon

CAT,2014-01-27,"Caterpillar Inc   CAT  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Monday  January 27  Shares of Caterpillar did not do well in 2013  On a year when the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index returned 26 5   Caterpillar stock regressed from  93 28 to  90 81  
Caterpillar had beaten the Wall Street profit consensus 5 quarters in a row  but has failed to meet the mark in the past 3 periods  This quarter the buy side is expecting Caterpillar to continue its decline  but simultaneously beat the Wall Street expectations which could serve as some consolation and satisfy investors  
The information below is derived from data submitted to the  platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Caterpillar to report  1 29 EPS and  13 503B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 22 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 32 EPS and  13 594B revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Caterpillar to beat the Wall Street consensus on both profit and revenue 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing an average differential between the 2 groups  forecasts 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus  
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from  1 23 to  1 85 EPS and  13 200B to  15 150B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a large distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A larger distribution of estimates signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings  because the market is less certain of what it should expect 
This quarter we have seen downward analyst revisions from both Wall Street and Estimize  The Street s profit consensus has fallen from  1 82 to  1 29 EPS while the Street s revenue forecast has dropped significantly from  14 939B to  13 503B  Meanwhile the Estimize EPS consensus has also fallen from  1 47 to  1 32 while the Estimize revenue consensus has also decreased from  14 135B to  13 594  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy  and declining analyst sentiment going into an earnings report is often a bearish indicator  
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91 who projects  1 23 EPS and  13 275B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season  BradHewitt91 is currently ranked as the 14th best analyst and is also ranked 14th overall among over 3 500 contributing analysts  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case BradHewitt91 disagrees with the Estimize consensus and is forecasting Caterpillar to miss Wall Street s expectations on both EPS and revenue

  As a result  we took substantial actions to reduce costs which helped mitigate the impact on profit

CommentaryIn the last T2108 Update  I gave this list of  keys to watch  
The post taper low  a close below this apparently critical support will be very bearish 
The VIX  it is proving surprisingly resilient and raising my alarm bells for a a steep slide ahead 
Speculative stocks  it is hard to imagine a steep decline starting in the market without more of the typical speculative and momentum stocks tumbling as well  see special note on Amazon com below  
Currency market  Traders are watching currencies more closely and reacting more quickly  My favorite tell remains AUD JPY   the Australian dollar  FXA  versus the Japanese yen  FXY  
I followed that list by stating 

 My fundamental bias remains bearish  but it is a  soft  bearishness that tells me to fade the market on a relief rally into overhead 50DMA resistance  I am NOT bearish because I expect the critical post taper support to give way imminently  I am waiting to see the market s behavior after a bounce  

Clearly  I was NOT nearly bearish enough 
The alarm bells from rising volatility reached a deafening pitch today as the VIX soared 16 5  to 21 4  and the S P 500  SPY  crashed through post taper support with a tremendous 2 3  loss  T2108 also came tumbling down to 37   losing a whopping 11 percentage points in the process 

Volatility wins


The S P 500 hurtles through post taper support in a move so bearish it extends well past its lower Bollinger Band


T2108 comes tumbling down as well


Although T2108 barely budged on Friday  today s plunge easily qualifies my favorite indicator for a quasi oversold reading  The T2108 trading model produces 64  odds of a bounce in the S P 500 for Tuesday  This bounce would be VERY consistent with the S P 500 s previous tendencies to lose ground on Mondays and bounce on Tuesdays  Today s plunge is out of character for the first trading day of the month  Anyway  the activated branch of the model triggers from a change in the VIX less than 21 3  and at least 15 9   T2108 at least 12 3  and lower than 38 3   and T2108 2 day change at least  51 7   quite an extreme    If T2108 had simply closed above 38 3   and below 42 0   with the VIX change above 5 3   the odds of a bounce on Tuesday would have gone to 100   So the model s instability here at least reinforces the expectation of upside 
At times like these  I immediately dig up T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200DMAs  Lo and behold  T2107 hit a 14  month closing low  It just missed the intraday low from June  2013 

T2107 hurtles toward the low of its recent range   a 14 month closing low


All the ingredients are in place for a bounce on Tuesday that could sustain itself for several days if not longer  a tremendous surge in the VIX suggesting a washout of sellers and fear  the S P 500 well over extended below its lower Bollinger Band  T2107 at its apparent lows  and quasi oversold conditions for T2108  While I suspected tonight s T2108 Update would turn up bullish tidings  I did not dare replace my now worthless SSO call options with a fresh tranche  Strangely enough  a low ball limit order for a fresh tranche of iPath S P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN  VXX  puts did not execute  This lack of execution makes me suspect even more that a bounce is coming and volatility is finally peaking  We will see 
Three important lessons for this latest cycle  1  a rapid and steep pullback from overbought conditions is indeed a strong warning sign  2  a stubborn VIX IS a likely sign of imminent selling  and 3  finessing the trading bias is too complicated  In other words  on  3  instead of waiting for a bounce to fade to get aggressively bearish  I should have just focused on bearish set ups in individual stocks offering good risk reward characteristics  Now  it is  too late  to get aggressive as the risk reward strongly favors buyers here  The next fade attempt might be a retest of taper support turned resistance  If the S P 500 gaps down on Tuesday  that event would be a near automatic buy signal   especially if T2108 manages to go below 30  or  even better  hits oversold  I will NOT chase a gap higher 
I conclude with two interesting charts  Starbucks  SBUX  and First Solar  FSLR   These are the kinds of setups I should have focused on earlier with my bearish bias instead of fading a bounce on the S P 500 
I traded in and out SBUX on the short side thanks to Doug Kass tweeting about SBUX breaking  70  It reminded me that SBUX had broken down below its 200DMA  a bright red trigger to go short on an ugly day like this  I closed out the trade after a point  not wanting to hold this kind of short overnight  However  SBUX stays on the short list until it manages to close above its 200DMA again  Even then  the current stock pattern looks like a classic top in the making and the downtrend from recent highs will be intact 

Starbucks breaks down and looks toppy


First Solar  FSLR  has been on a downtrend since November s two year high  It is now struggling to hold 200DMA support and closed just below it today  I do not think this support will hold given the weight of the current downtrend and a 50DMA that is closing down fast  I have just one put option as a speculation play that a bigger breakdown is imminent 

First Solar is in the process of breaking down

CAT,2014-02-05,"The past few years  since 2009 to be exact  we have seen a rise in the markets to new highs  Along with that rise I have also witnessed that there are less of the major players volatile enough to trade in a reasonable price range  In other words either the volume has dried up or the prices have risen so much that it makes it impossible for most non professional traders without big accounts to trade them  Time was that we traded GOOG  AMZN at much lower prices along with others like AZO  ISRG  MA  I remember CME  CAT  FCX  MON to have nice ranges  and along with good volume to move them more than a few dimes a day  Now they have lost daily volume and ranges became tight  I suppose it s the price you pay for good rise in the markets  yet I wonder if it s really good for us   Given the premise that the markets predict the future economy  then we are either heading for hyper  inflation and a much more divided society that gives socialists strength  The two class system that they like to create dependence and true elitism  can only be thwarted by a strong middle class  The market was an opportunity for the middle class as well as the super rich  and even the savvy poor  to have a chance to grow wealth at a better pace than bank interest rates  Now  however  I wonder how many are investing or better put  how many can invest even if they are not scared off by the past decade and half of events   If there is a conspiracy to divide the society it is certainly helped by the over exuberant rise of the market this past year and hyper   inflation would just price most of the people out of it completely  creating a much more divided society  resulting in perhaps near total disappearance of the middle class along with the USA  I m sure not everyone will see it my way yet I wonder if it were not better to have let the 2007 crisis play itself out naturally  rather that a government fueling the fire to create what we have now  Debt and inflation  most of which they hide from reports  We may have had the survival of the fittest to carry on but from the ashes would have risen much more opportunity in my humble opinion  So as you may dread a correction in the markets  I assure you it  s for the good  Look at history  it has always come back stronger  The unfortunate part of the scenario now is that once the government involves itself especially like it had for the past 7 years  they have a harder time not to step in once again

CAT,2014-02-20,"By    Global retail sales of machines at Caterpillar Inc   NYSE  CAT   the world s biggest construction equipment maker  fell by 8 percent in the three months ending in January  according to a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday 

The data  shows the beginning of a broader recovery in construction sales across the regions while mining remains severely challenged from a new equipment standpoint   said William Blair   Co  analyst Lawrence De Maria  

It s a modest improvement from the 9 percent drop for the three months ended in December 
 By geography  we saw improvement in all but one area  although it seems that on an underlying basis  the critical Asia Pac region saw no change in underlying demand   wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Nicole DeBlase in a Thursday note 

Asia Pacific saw the greatest drop  17 percent  while North American sales actually increased by 1 percent  The company sells most of its machinery to independently owned dealers and manufacturers 
The Thursday filing is also the first time Caterpillar has provided a geographical breakdown of its construction vs  resource sectors 
Though the single month of data is of limited use for now  but should become more helpful as the year progresses 
Sales in resources industries were down 37 percent globally  with the biggest dip in Asia  which saw a 53 percent decrease 
 We remain concerned that Resource inventory overhang will persist into 1Q14   wrote DeBlase 
Meanwhile  the company s construction sector saw more positive results  with a 9 percent increase all around ",International Business Times,0.065,0.835,0.1,0.9221
CAT,2014-02-26,"Introduction
This is final installment of a 6 part series of articles on stocks for 2014   In the previous five installments          and   my focus was primarily on stocks of various categories that I believed were fairly valued even after the strong run that the market has had over the past several years   However  with this final installment  my focus has changed to evaluating the potential pitfalls and or challenges of investing in cyclical stocks  or more precisely  companies  
Nevertheless  I will be highlighting two cyclical stocks  Caterpillar Inc   CAT  and Deere   Company  DE   which I believe are attractively valued cyclical stocks today   Candidly  there were many other cyclical stocks that I came across that also appeared reasonably valued   However  as I will be expressing throughout this article  I believe that cyclical stocks should be approached with both great caution  and a clear understanding of the nature of the beast 
Depending on what your overall investment philosophy and or approach is  stocks with cyclical operating records present investors with unique challenges   This is especially true for the retired long term  buy and hold oriented dividend growth investor   In other words  it can be relatively easy to buy and hold a company with a consistent long term record of earnings growth and accompanying dividend increases  
This is simply because when the inevitable short term stock price volatility occurs with a consistent grower  especially to the downside  the investor can focus on the company s earnings strength and dividend increases that can provide them the confidence to stay the course   I think this is important  because I am a firm believer in investing for the long term   This has little to do with trading stocks  and everything to do with positioning yourself as a shareholder owner of a great company 
In contrast  during those inevitable periods where the earnings of a company with cyclical characteristics are dropping in tandem with stock prices  it s often emotionally difficult to hold on  even if it makes sense to do so   Consequently  this article will address some of the issues and challenges associated with long term buy and hold investing in cyclical or semi cyclical dividend growth stocks   In addition to discussing how to deal with long term investing in cyclical stocks  I will also provide my personal perspectives on whether it s a rational idea or not 
As an aside  since I am a believer in long term investing versus day trading or swing trading  it is my personal strategy of choice   However  I am not brash enough to suggest that trading strategies are wrong  instead  I m simply suggesting that long term buy and hold investing suits me and my temperament better   Therefore  this article is likely to make more sense to other like minded long term buy and hold investors   Moreover  there is a fundamental mindset that differentiates the prudent investor from the speculator trader 
My associate    a young investor who I believe is wise beyond his years  has a way of expressing this differentiation of mindset in a manner that I really admire   Instead of referring to it as a buy and hold strategy  Eli calls it  partnering with a wonderful business    To my way of thinking  that simple phrase both elegantly and profoundly says it all   The owners of  wonderful businesses  are in it for the long haul   The notion of selling their wonderful business  especially on a whim or as a knee jerk reaction to what might be happening in an often wacky world  stock market   is simply not part of their DNA 
The Commonly Held Definition of a  Cyclical Stock 
Moreover  in order for this article to make sense  I believe it s imperative that we start by defining  as precisely as possible  exactly what a cyclical stock is   I feel this is both essential and important because  like many terms and concepts glibly thrown about within the financial services industry  there is often a wide lack of precision regarding the true meaning of the term   In my humble opinion  the term  cyclical stock  is one of those quite often loosely utilized and or imprecisely defined terms 
For example  Investopedia defines a cyclical stock as follows 
 An equity security whose price is affected by the ups and downs in the overall economy  Cyclical stocks typically relate to companies that sell discretionary items that consumers can afford to buy more of in a booming economy and will cut back on during a recession  Contrast cyclical stocks with counter cyclical stocks  which tend to move in the opposite direction from the overall economy  and with consumer staples  which people continue to demand even during a downturn  
Frankly  although I believe that this definition does provide some insight into the general characteristics of a cyclical stock  I contend  as I will explain in greater detail later  that it lacks true precision   Perhaps that is part of the reason why Investopedia then goes on to attempt to explain a cyclical stock more fully as follows 
 Cyclical stocks rise and fall with the business cycle  This seeming predictability in the movement of these stock s prices leads some investors to try to time the market by buying these stocks at the low point in the business cycle and selling them at the high point  Examples of companies whose stocks are cyclical include car manufacturers  airlines  furniture retailers  clothing stores  hotels and restaurants  When the economy is doing well  people can afford to buy new cars  upgrade their home furnishings  go shopping and travel  When the economy is doing poorly  these discretionary expenses are some of the first things consumers will cut  If a recession is bad enough  cyclical stocks can become completely worthless as companies go out of business  
The above expanded discussion of cyclical stocks does attempt to provide a deeper insight into the nature of a cyclical stock   However  although I agree with much of how the above commentary denotes the general characteristics of a cyclical stock  like many other financial terms  I believe it offers too general of an explanation   Moreover  I think the above discussion referring to some investors trying to time the market  is also overly simplistic 
I especially have a problem with the phrase  seeming predictability in the movement of the stock s prices    First of all  I don t think there is predictability in the stock price movements of any company  and secondly  cyclicality to my way of thinking is more about short periods of time when earnings are dropping   In other words  the so called business cycles are periods of time when business temporarily becomes weak  and stock price follows these weak business results   Stated more precisely  cyclicality is more about profits  than prices 
With the above discussion in mind  I would now like to offer my own personal definition of what a cyclical stock is to me   Instead of thinking in broad terms such as restaurant stocks are cyclical  I prefer to base my judgments on the specific or individual company or business that I am examining   For example  if a company has a steady history of increasing its earnings each year  I would not think of it as a cyclical stock merely because it operates in a broad category that is considered cyclical   In other words  I will base my judgment about what kind of a stock a given company is  based on its specific operating history 
For example  according to the explanation of a cyclical stock explained by Investopedia as described above  restaurant stocks are cyclical   Therefore  if I come across a restaurant stock that I was interested in examining or researching  I might assume that I would see a company with an erratic or cyclical earnings history   However  in reality I might find a powerful growth story with little or no cyclicality with its earnings history   Consequently  the generalization that all restaurant stocks are cyclical would prove false   The operating earnings history of Panera Bread Company  PNRA  offers a quintessential example of my point 
  Note  these next three examples focus on earnings history in order to depict cyclicality  or the lack thereof  with no regard to stock price or current valuation 
 Panera Bread Company  PNRA 
Panera Bread Company operates a retail bakery cafe business and franchising business under the concept names such as Panera Bread  Saint Louis Bread Co   and Paradise Bakery   Caf  
To my way of thinking  the following graph plotting Panera Bread s earnings since 2001 depicts a powerful growth stock  not a cyclical stock   Therefore  even though it is clearly a restaurant stock in the general sense  in the specific sense I cannot think of it as a cyclical stock 

Biglari Holdings Inc   BH 
Biglari Holdings Inc   through its subsidiaries  is engaged in the operation and franchising of restaurants in the United States  The company s subsidiaries include Steak n Shake Operations  Inc  and Western Sizzlin Corporation 
In contrast  the following graph plotting the earnings of Biglari Holdings Inc  depicts a true version of what I would consider a cyclical stock to be   With this specific restaurant stock  we see wide swings and variations of earnings per share from one year or time period to the next   Therefore  in this case we see a specific example of a restaurant stock that is clearly also a very cyclical stock 
 
Starbucks Corporation  SBUX 
Starbucks Corporation engages in roasting  marketing  and retailing specialty coffee worldwide  The company operates in approximately 62 countries 
My third and final example of a restaurant stock  Starbucks Corporation  could be looked at as a hybrid comprised of a powerful growth stock with a moderate or occasional amount of cyclicality   In this case  earnings did falter slightly during the Great Recession of 2008  but only modestly and temporarily  Therefore  I would argue the case that Starbucks is better defined as a growth stock than as a cyclical stock  Or perhaps a semi cylical growth stock  but hardly a true cyclical 

As an aside  this is one of the reasons I tend to question the validly of many of the so called studies conducted  presented and utilized by Wall Street and academia   I m not suggesting that the studies are wrong  or conducted improperly   However  I am suggesting that the underlying data that is being scrutinized is all too often using overly generalized definitions of the various characteristics studied as they pertain to individual companies   Companies are as unique as people are 
For example  there are numerous studies comparing dividend paying stocks to non dividend paying stocks   However  a closer examination of individual companies indicates there are wide differences in the true characteristics of the many individual companies being included   Consequently  I believe that putting all dividend paying stocks  or all non dividend paying stocks into the same general pot could simply lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn 
Critical Thinking Or Thinking Logically
To provide an additional perspective of what I discussed in the above section  I believe one of the most important subjects I studied in college was logic  One of the primary premises behind this course is that it teaches  critical thinking   This is the mental process of ascertaining whether a statement or position is valid or invalid  More simply stated  this allows you to evaluate an argument through reasoning as to whether a premise leads to an accurate conclusion  If the original premise is false  it leads to a false conclusion even when the argument itself appears valid  Through logic I learned that arguments can be valid or invalid  but not true or false  and only that premises and conclusions are true or false 
Logic utilizes a tool referred to as a categorical syllogism  which reveals to the critical thinker whether an argument is valid or invalid  based on whether or not the original premise is true or false  Therefore  the argument that all restaurants are cyclical stocks presents a false premise  Consequently  drawing the conclusion that all restaurant stocks are cyclical stocks leads to a false conclusion 
Therefore  the primary point I was attempting to illustrate with the above examples is the validity of judging companies based on their own specific attributes  characteristics and merits  over thinking of them in more general terms such as a cyclical restaurant stock   Moreover  my own definition of a cyclical stock is one that has a history of erratically rising and falling earnings over time  But most importantly  I make my judgment of the cyclicality of a stock specifically based on reviewing each individual stock  one company at a time  Consequently  the premise that some restaurant stocks are cyclical is valid  while the premise that all restaurant stocks are cyclical is invalid 
Investing In Cyclical Or Semi Cyclical  Wonderful Businesses 
There is an interesting perspective that can be articulated when analyzing the proper strategy for investing in cyclical stocks  I ve seen many heated arguments between dividend growth investors focusing on dividend income  versus total return oriented investors  The dividend growth investor is most concerned with a rising dividend income stream  In contrast  the total return investor is more focused on maximum portfolio gain calculated by adding capital appreciation and dividend income together 
Frankly  I am somewhat amused by these arguments  To my way of thinking  neither side is right  nor are they wrong  They both have a legitimate position  which is uniquely supported based on their unique needs  goals or objectives  For example  the retired investor living off the income their portfolio provides is most concerned with yield and the growth thereof  Since they don t plan on selling their stocks anytime soon  price volatility is of little concern to them 
In contrast  the total return investor  perhaps in the accumulation phase  is most concerned with how fast their portfolio grows  and how big it gets  Consequently  price volatility is often a greater focal point than dividends  However  I would add that price volatility will likely also cause the total return investor more angst  which is more likely to initiate an emotional response  In other words  total return investors are less likely to remain calm in a tumultuous market environment 
With the above thoughts in mind  cyclical stocks pose additional challenges to both the dividend growth investor and the total return investor  To illustrate this point  I will utilize the blue chip dividend growth company Caterpillar Inc   which is a Dividend Contender   To those not familiar with this list  these are companies that have increased their dividend for 10 24 consecutive years   David Fish provides this list and others on    Caterpillar Inc s streak is currently 20 years 
Caterpillar Inc  CAT 
Caterpillar Inc manufactures construction and mining equipment  diesel and natural gas engines  industrial gas turbines and diesel electric locomotives  The company was founded as Caterpillar Tractor Co  in 1925 in the State of California   In 1986  the company changed its name to Caterpillar Inc 
However  before I focus on dividends I will utilize the F A S T  Graphs  fundamental stock research tool and graph Caterpillar s earnings since 1996  the orange line on the graph    I have added arrows to indicate the cyclical nature of Caterpillar s earnings per share over that time frame   I believe this represents a clear example of a company with a cyclical long term operating history   Moreover  I might add that forecasting these exact cycles would be difficult  if not impossible to predict 

With my next 20 year graph on Caterpillar I will include the full complement of what a F A S T  Graphs  provides in order to illustrate one of the primary challenges that cyclical stocks present to investors   Note  on a F A S T  Graphs  exceeding 15 years  only every other year s data is typed on the graph s headings  but all data is plotted    The black line on the graph plots monthly closing stock prices  and here we see that stock price follows and correlates highly to earnings  the orange line on the graph    The challenge to investors is that stock price will be weak  and performance poor during the weaker periods of Caterpillar s business cycle 
On the other hand  we might also conclude that periods of weakness are typically temporary and followed by periods of strength   Consequently  this might also suggest that periods of cyclical operating weakness would be the best times to take a position in this cyclical Dividend Contender   Of course  this last point would be true whether your focus was on dividends or capital appreciation and or total return   Buying low  in order to someday sell high  is one of the most basic of all investing tenets 

With my next graph  I m going to shorten the time frame from 2005 to current   At the beginning of 2005  Caterpillar was trading at a fair value P E ratio of approximately 15  price was touching the orange line    However  that fair value P E ratio of 15 was based on current earnings at that time  But most importantly  when earnings in 2009 fell to  2 29 from  4 21 in 2005  the fair value P E ratio of 15 that was originally paid in 2005 meant that you were paying an overvalued P E ratio of 22 for 2009 s ultimate forward earnings  This is where one of the biggest challenges of investing in a cyclical stock rears its ugly head   Everything was fine until we entered the Great Recession of 2008   In the spring of 2008 price turned down  apparently in recessionary anticipation of future earnings weakness  which did  in fact  soon occur   
Consequently  owning Caterpillar from 2005 to 2008 would have resulted in an annual loss averaging 2 2  per annum  from the perspective of capital appreciation   Naturally  this would not be acceptable to the total return oriented investor   Accordingly  and especially for the most impatient total return investor  this might more than likely instigate a sell decision somewhere along the way   On the other hand  these impatient investors would simultaneously be selling at what in truth would be one of the most opportune times to invest in the cyclical company Caterpillar Inc   Investing in cyclical stocks can be very challenging for the total return investor  or very profitable if their timing is correct 
In contrast  Caterpillar Inc  s price and earnings volatility or cyclicality  might be less concerning to the dividend growth investor focused on a rising dividend income stream   The pinkish colored line on the graphs plots dividends per share  which in the case of Caterpillar Inc   steadily increased each and every year including the Great Recession years   However  that would only be true if the dividend growth investor was aware of the cyclical nature of Caterpillar Inc  in the first place   In other words  they would expect to see some cyclicality in earnings and price along the way   Moreover  they would only truly be concerned if their dividend income stream was interrupted 

Moreover  from a long term total performance perspective  Caterpillar Inc  would have provided index beating returns in spite of the cyclical nature of its operating results   Both capital appreciation and total cumulative dividend income have exceeded the S P 500 from the beginning of 2005 to current time   In other words  an investment in Caterpillar Inc  did work out over the longer term  but it s the cyclical periods of time in between that presents the challenges 
If the total return investor were to be patient  or if they were interested in partnering in a wonderful business over trading in and out of the stock  the rewards eventually manifest   At the same time  the dividend growth investor experienced no interruption of their important dividend income payments  and averaged just below 13  per annum average growth of their dividend income   Consequently  for those living off of their dividends  they received a nice average increase in pay   Admittedly  their pay raise was lower during the Great Recession  but increased nevertheless 

I offer Deere   Company as a second example of a blue chip dividend paying cyclical stock with similar characteristics and performance that we saw with Caterpillar Inc   I will let the graph speak for itself  and only offer the second example to illustrate that other cyclical blue chips share the traits discussed above as we saw with Caterpillar 
Deere   Company   DE 

ConAgra Foods  Inc  CAG 
ConAgra Foods  Inc  operates as a packaged food company in North America  The company has a commercial foods presence  supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products  as well as other vegetable  spice  bakery  and grain products to various restaurants  foodservice operators  and commercial customers   ConAgra Foods  Inc  was founded in 1919 
With my next example to illustrate the challenges of investing in cyclical stocks  I offer ConAgra Foods  Inc   I present this example to illustrate that there is a real danger  even to the dividend growth oriented investor  of investing in cyclical stocks   By focusing on the pink line which plots dividends on the ConAgra Foods  graph  we discover that they did find it necessary to temporarily cut their dividends  see red circle on graph   Even though their dividend today is higher than it was before the cut  dividend growth investors that owned ConAgra Foods  Inc  when the dividend was cut would have experienced a cut in pay  albeit only temporarily 

Summary and Conclusions
Hopefully this article illustrates why I have always personally preferred investing in companies with consistent long term records of operating excellence   So much so  that I have a tendency to prefer a consistent record of earnings growth over a higher rate of earnings growth   But with that said  and in all fairness  I must add that it is very rare to find a company with a long term perfect operating record  
Even a quintessential dividend growth stock such as Church   Dwight  will occasionally have a year of flat earnings or even the occasional small drop in earnings from one year to the next   I ve included a 20 year graph plotting Church   Dwight s earnings per share that are circled at times where earnings flattened or dropped slightly   Minor drops like you see on the following graph do not indicate cyclicality  Note  on a F A S T  Graphs  exceeding 15 years  only every other year s data is typed on the graph s headings  but all data is plotted  

However  there is a difference between occasional minor interruptions in earnings and several years of a cyclical drop of earnings   A minor interruption will usually not have much of an impact on stock price  or it will usually only be short lived if it happens   On the other hand  the company that goes into a two to three year or longer down cycle is much more troubling and difficult to navigate 
Consequently  the use of cyclical stocks in a retirement portfolio where the investor is focused on income should be limited  at least in my opinion   I m not saying that the dividend growth investor should never invest in a cyclical company   Instead I m suggesting that they should only do so sparingly  and with their eyes wide open regarding the true nature of a cyclical stock   In other words  they should be mentally prepared for the potential problems that a down cycle might bring 
As it relates to the total return investor  there are times when investing in a cyclical stock can be very profitable   Of course that means having the courage or fortitude to invest in cyclical stocks when there is the proverbial  blood in the streets    In other words  the best time to take a position in a cyclical stock is when the cyclical is weak   Then  as the business prospects of the cyclical company improve  earnings growth can be quite substantial  at least for an intermediate period of time 
Therefore  if and when you decide you want to invest in a cyclical stock  regardless of your investment objective  caveat emptor  buyer beware    Knowledge is power

CAT,2014-02-27,"By    China bulls  take note  It s time to drop the conventional wisdom that urbanization will underpin long term growth in China  The pace of urbanization is set to slow and its contribution to economic growth is set to decline  Nomura warns 
 While urbanization has undoubtedly served as a pillar of growth in the past  we believe it may become a source of future volatility and risk   Nomura economists led by Zhiwei Zhang said in a note 

The pace of urbanization in China has already showed signs of significant slowdown in recent years  In 2013  the urbanization ratio  measured as the urban population s share of the total population  rose by only 1 16 percentage points  That s the slowest since 1996  except for 2008  when the global financial crisis hit China 
Growth of the urban population has also fallen in the last three years  to 2 7 percent in 2013 from 3 9 percent in 2010  having averaged 4 0 percent from 2000 to 2010 

Nomura economists believe the pace of urbanization is set to slow further   If the trend since 2010 holds  we estimate that the annual increase in the urbanization ratio may drop to around 1 percentage point in 2014 15 and below 1 percentage point thereafter   they said 
Zhang and his colleagues see three structural factors driving this slowdown 
1   Rapid industrialization and servitization may have ended 
Industrialization played a crucial role in China s urbanization process  A typical example is the transformation Shenzhen  a city close to Hong Kong  experienced  Between the 1980s and 2012  Shenzhen developed from a small fishing village of 30 000 into China s third largest city  with a population of 10 6 million 
The amazing growth was driven largely by market forces as multinationals moved their production basis into Shenzhen to take advantage of the cheap labor and its convenient location close to Hong Kong  Shenzhen s gross domestic product per capita hit  19 524 in 2012 
As households with higher incomes demand more services  the service sector growth starts to outpace industrial sector growth  The service sector share of Shenzhen s GDP rose from 46 percent in 2005 to 57 percent in 2012 
For the country as a whole  the share of industrial and service sectors of GDP rose quickly during the period from 1960 to 2006  averaging 0 64 percentage points of growth per year  economists at Nomura pointed out  However  that figure has fallen from an average of just 0 16 percentage points between 2007 and 2013 
Countries like Japan and Korea have experienced similar sharp slowdowns of industrialization and servitization  after which the pace of urbanization slowed by an average 0 9 percentage points per year 
2  Lewis turning point and depletion of rural surplus labor 
The second structural factor that drove rapid urbanization was the migration of surplus rural labor to the cities 
According to the National Bureau of Statistics  the amount of migrant workers rose from 225 4 million in 2008 to 268 9 million in 2013  accounting for 36 9 percent of the urban population  The increase in the number of migrant workers itself pushes up the urbanization ratio by 2 8 percentage points over this period  while the urbanization ratio rose from 47 0 to 53 7 
But a spate of worker unrest and rising wages in China suggest that the world s second largest economy has passed what economists call the  Lewis turning point   when low cost manufacturing industries become less competitive  forcing a change in the nation s growth structure 
When an economy first becomes industrialized  it grows very fast by importing foreign technology and employing capital and plentiful  cheap labor mainly drawn from the agricultural sector  The migrant labor force accepts lower wages corresponding to the living standards prevalent in farming 
However  a point is reached when no more labor is forthcoming from the underdeveloped sector and wages begin to rise  This is known as the  Lewis Turning Point   named after the late economist and 1979 Nobel laureate W  Arthur Lewis 

This is a key reason why companies like Caterpillar Inc   NYSE  CAT  and Ford Motor Co   NYSE  F  are either  re shoring  from China back to the U S  or relocating their factories to India and the ASEAN economies 
The number of new migrant workers halved to 6 3 million in the three years to 2013  despite salaries on offer almost doubling   If this deceleration trend continues  as we expect it to  the number of migrant workers may begin to contract by 2016   Zhang said 
A paper released by International Monetary Fund economists Mitali Das and Papa N Diaye     Chronicle of a Decline Foretold  Has China Reached the Lewis Turning Point      predicts China would move from a vast supply of low cost workers to a labor shortage economy sometime between 2020 and 2025 
3  Government driven urban expansion is unsustainable 
 The pace of urbanization did not slow until 2011  despite the significant moderation of industrialization and servitization since 2007   Zhang said   This was largely due to urban area expansion  driven by the government  which picked up speed after the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis  
However  government driven urban expansion is facing binding constraints  It has been financed by government debt and land sales  while fiscal conditions have deteriorated sharply 
The actual fiscal deficit  based on IMF estimates  rose to 10 percent of GDP in 2012    comparable to India  Japan and the U S  If local government financing vehicle  LGFV  debt  railway debt and asset management companies  debt are included  Nomura estimates total public debt to GDP reached 75 percent in 2013 
Nomura estimates that more than half of LGFVs would be unable to service even their interest expenses  not to mention the principle repayments

CAT,2014-02-27,"Investing com   U S  stocks climbed higher on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested harsh winter weather may have been the reason behind a string of disappointing economic indicators this year 
At the close of U S  trading  the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0 46   the S P 500 index rose 0 49   while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0 63  
Recent manufacturing  unemployment and other economic indicators have come in short of Wall Street expectations  leaving investors unclear if recovery has hit a soft patch or if a string of winter storms has put commerce temporarily on hold 
Speaking before the Senate banking committee  Yellen told lawmakers it was hard to say how much the recent soft data was due to rough winter weather and added that the bank would remain attentive to signals on whether the recovery is progressing in line with expectations 
Stock market investors concluded that monetary authorities do believe winter storms have bruised economic indicators somewhat  and that when spring arrives in a matter of weeks  recovery will pick up and improve corporate fundamentals in the process 
Elsewhere  the Labor Department said the number of people filing for initial jobless benefits rose by 14 000 to 348 000 from the previous week s total of 334 000  Analysts had expected an increase of just 1 000 
Also on Thursday  the Commerce Department reported that U S  durable goods orders declined by a seasonally adjusted 1  last month  less than expectations for a 1 5  drop

Looking at this  I can t help but ask if investors have completely lost touch with reality  It seems the fundamentals that drive stock prices higher corporate earnings have been ignored 
And as investors are driving key stock indices higher  the state of the global economy is becoming worrisome  This can t be stressed enough  the U S  economy isn t immune to a disturbance in the global economy  But this isn t all  if the global economy sees an economic slowdown  the companies on U S  key stock indices suffer as well 


One clear example of this  as it stands  is Caterpillar Inc   CAT   a giant industrial goods manufacturer and component of the S P 500  The company reported that annual sales declined 16  in 2013  Caterpillar s revenues were  55 65 billion compared to  65 87 billion  The company s corporate earnings per share were down more than 32  in 2013  The reason for this  a challenging business environment in the global economy   Source  Caterpillar Inc   January 27  2014

Other major economic hubs in Asia  such as Japan and India  also show the region is in trouble 
The eurozone  the biggest economic hub in the global economy when looked at as a whole  continues to show signs of stress  Countries like Spain and Greece are in a deep economic slowdown  but we continue to see economic data that suggest Germany s economy  the biggest in the region  is also under stress  In February  manufacturing output in the German economy declined to a three month low   Source  Markit  February 20  2014

On Sunday  Secretary of State John Kerry said that the United States and other industrialized countries were ready to  isolate Russia economically   if Putin doesn t cease Russian activities in Ukraine   
It could affect more than  38 2 billion worth of trade volume between Russia and the United States  mostly in mining  manufacturing and banking 

In just over a decade  Caterpillar has invested over  1 billion in the country 
CEO Doug Oberhelman testified in June 2012 that exports to Russia from the United States have nowhere to go but up  and touted his company s future there 
 There is tremendous opportunity to increase U S  exports to Russia   he said  in an effort to convince the United States to offer Russia  Permanent Normal Trade Relations  
 From Caterpillar s perspective  Russia ranks among our top ten export destinations   he said  adding that he was optimistic about its burgeoning economy  growing population and demand for products   
Richard Lanvin  Caterpillar s Group President and Chairman  said he was looking forward to future opportunities in the country  in a 2012 interview 
 We re very optimistic about the growth prospects for Russia   he added  citing Putin s focus on infrastructure investment and overall growth 
 We want to be involved in building the bridges  roads  ports and everything else that s going on in the Russian Far East in the coming five  10  20 years   he said

CAT,2014-03-14,"One of Canada s top ranked industrial investment analysts  Tom Varesh of M Partners  tells The Energy Report where to find the best positioned oil services companies in the oil fields of western Canada  With many pipeline and E P projects approved and still more seeking approval  western Canada looks primed for an energy renaissance  At this point  it s a case of  if you build it  they will come   Find out about the companies doing the building  and get exposure before share prices start sprinting 
The Energy Report  Tom  are you positive about oil and gas 
Tom Varesh  Our focus at M Partners is on North America  We are specifically bullish on the oil and gas sector in western Canada  Many of its pipeline projects  oil sands projects and natural gas projects are now approved  and many other projects are in various stages of being green lighted  We predict that 2014 is going to be a better year for the oil and gas sector than last year  and  15   16   17 are set up to experience significant growth in this region because a wide range of projects are attracting a lot of capital investment 
TER  Are there impediments to ramping up this growth during the next two or three years 
TV  At a macro level  regulatory approvals have to be obtained for many of these projects to go ahead  At the micro level  the larger oil and gas companies have to decide on a timeline for pushing significant amounts of capex into the projects  The base price of the oil and gas commodities has to make sense to warrant large capex  but the discount that western Canadian producers get should shrink as a result of building out the pipelines and related infrastructural themes 
I cover infrastructure niche plays and construction dealership companies in the oilfield infrastructure segment in western Canada  Services are seeing a significant pick up in activity it is basically all hands on deck for the booming economy in Alberta and other provinces in western Canada 
TER  Within this space  are there dominant firms that are making acquisitions and driving up the potential value of energy service juniors 
TV  The rollup theme is very prevalent  WesternOne Inc   WEQ TSX  and Enterprise Group Inc   E TSX V  both have the currency to roll up private enterprises working in the service sectors in western Canada  Other acquisitive firms include Entrec Corp   ENT TSX V    McCoy Corp   MCB TSX   Petrowest Corp   PRW TSX  and Macro Enterprises Inc   MCR TSX V   just to name a few  These are publically traded companies with access to the capital markets with access to equity  debt or bank financing  And they are actively and steadily rolling up the smaller private companies 
TER  Why is there an influx of acquisition capital into this space 
TV  With more and more investors looking for alternative investment options that are not based in metals  capital is generally gravitating toward the oil and gas infrastructure sector  WesternOne and Enterprise Group have already benefited from recent successful capital raises and it s full steam ahead for both of them 
These companies not only have the cash to make acquisitions  but they also have the ability to immediately invest in the operations of the acquired companies and grow their organic lines of business  Private companies are often starved for capital and therein lies the opportunity  The acquisition strategy keeps picking up  and we expect to see double digit organic growth from the acquiring firms during the next five years 
TER  Do you have a top pick 
TV  Enterprise Group is a great infrastructure play it is very acquisitive  In 2012  it bought a heating business called Artic Therm  It also owns TC Backhoe  which does a lot of pipelining and cable laying for utility companies in Alberta  And it acquired Calgary Tunneling last summer  At the start of this year  Enterprise closed on Hart Oilfield Rentals  This group of service related companies can cross sell their services to their major oil field clients in western Canada 
TER  In terms of blending these acquisitions into the corporate structure  is Enterprise functioning as a holding company  or is it doing hands on management with daily operations at its new acquisitions 
TV  I characterize Enterprise as a hands on management entity  In the not too distant future  we will likely see a rebranding of this corporation and each of its businesses  The reason that Enterprise will rebrand is to demonstrate that it is very active in each of the business segments  Each of the managers or previous owners of those various businesses is still running operations under the Enterprise umbrella  The executive management team at Enterprise is making the capital allocation and the growth strategy decisions in concert with the managers running each business unit  It is a very collaborative effort intended to grow each business and to cross sell the services 
TER  How has the Enterprise Group s stock been performing over the past period 
TV  When we launched on Enterprise a year ago  the stock was at  0 35  It is now in the  1 10 range  That is great performance  and there is more to realize in the stock as it proves out the earnings potential of its recent acquisitions  Our current target price for Enterprise is  2 25 and it is our top pick 
TER  What other service juniors do you like here 
TV  WesternOne is an oil and gas infrastructure play with two distinct business lines  About 55  of its revenue is driven by its manufacturing business  Britco  Britco builds out modular work camps and offices for mining and oil and gas companies  One of its biggest repeat clients is Devon Energy Corp   DVN NYSE   And Britco is working on another contract for Devon in northwestern Canada  The other side of its business model caters to rentals and propane sales  It has a large heater rental business  which competes with Enterprise s Artic Therm  But WesternOne provides the propane to run the heaters  unlike Artic Therm  It has a well integrated business and it has been performing quite well since it did its initial public offering in 2006 
TER  WesternOne s stock has fallen a bit over the last year  Why 
TV  WesternOne expanded into Australia at the start of 2013  It acquired a company similar to Britco that makes modular workforce camps  With the general downturn in mining  that business underperformed and dragged down the earnings  Management has taken steps to rationalize this business line  and it is on track to exit 2014 as a profitable entity  While the WesternOne stock went sideways during the last 12 months  we expect it to firm up as it becomes clear that the Australian business unit is turning around 
The neat thing about the WesternOne story is its high dividend  which currently yields 8   This is a story where investors are paid to wait and the dividend has been stable since 2007  Indeed  the dividend has increased twice since the firm went public and it is now steady at  0 60 per year  The payout ratio is expected to be 60  this year which is up from 41  last year  due to the losses in Australia   We fully expect the payout ratio to fall back into the low 40  range in 2014  Our target price for WesternOne is  9 35 
TER  What other firms do you favor in the energy services space 
TV  The two names we ve touched on thus far are  100  200 million   100  200M  market cap companies with high growth profiles  If an investor is looking for something in the large cap space  we really like Finning International Inc   FTT TSX   Finning is strictly a dealership business model  It sells Caterpillar construction and mining equipment in western Canada  South America  the U K  and Ireland 
TER  What are the fundamentals for success in the heavy equipment dealership business 
TV  Finning s success is largely tied to what is going on at a macro level in the Canadian oil and gas sector  About 55 60  of its revenue is from western Canada  selling into the oil sands industry and the construction industry  Alberta and western Canada the prairies are going to lead Canada in terms of GDP growth  That dovetails nicely into the Finning story because growth is accompanied by infrastructure spending and buildouts  That means there are steady sales of construction and mining equipment in the oil sands and also in the conventional gas sector in Alberta 
In South America  Finning s equipment is used to mine copper and gold  While metal prices have come off and that sector is facing a reduction in capital expenditures  we continue to like Finning because of its recurring revenue theme  During the last half decade  Finning has sold so much equipment in Canada and South America that iron in the field has risen by nearly 40   And that equipment generates recurring revenue for Finning s parts and maintenance services  which generate high margins  Finning is on track to ramp up its product support revenue to 50  of its overall revenue  It ended 2013 with product support at 46  of revenue which was up from the prior year s 42   Finning s product support revenue will continue to grow so long as metal mines and oil sands keep producing  Finning is expected to generate significant free cash flow in 2014  I believe the company will increase its dividend this year  A solid investment  we say 
TER  Are the share prices of the three firms that we have talked about today tied to the volatility of the oil and coal and fossil fuel investment markets 
TV  These share values are tied indirectly to oil prices and  in the case of Finning  to copper and gold prices as well  To the extent that commodity prices remain strong  share price activity will remain strong 
TER  Thank you for your time  Tom

CAT,2014-04-23,"By    Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  the world s largest maker of construction and mining equipment  is expected to report a 6 percent drop in earnings for the first quarter of 2014  an improvement over the 44 7 percent drop in the same quarter last year  as the global economy slowly improves their construction and electricity sectors  barely offsetting a dismal global mining industry 
When the company announces earnings Thursday before U S  markets open  it s likely to report net income of  755 million  or  1 23 a share  on revenue of  13 2 billion  flast since the same time last year  based on the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters 
In the same period a year earlier  net income was  880 million  or  1 31 a share  on  13 21 billion in revenue  Excluding one time items  Caterpillar is expected to report earnings of  1 13 a share 
J P  Morgan analysts maintained their neutral rating of Caterpillar  based on  the company s long term growth prospects and exposure to global GDP  which we believe will be a positive for equipment demand over the long run   they wrote in an April 10 note  adding that this is balanced by its exposure to the mining industry   which we believe has entered a long down cycle  
Last year  the Peiroa  Ill  based company saw  10 billion in sales and revenues  down from  66 billion the year earlier 
The main problem had to do with inventory  As the global mining sector slumped in 2012  demand for resource equipment decreased  leaving dealers with an excess of inventory  which the company has been slowly fixing  By the end of the third quarter backlog had dropped from  23 1 billion to  19 1 billion in the space of year 
Revenues fell 16 percent last year to hit  55 7 billion  and earnings fell 32 percent as demand for mining equipment plummeted as companies cut spending  The sector accounts for at least a third of their total business 
 Our inventory problem   said Doug Oberhelman at the analyst meeting at Conexpo in April   was painful on the way up and it was very painful on the way down  
Resource sales were down 37 percent in the three months ending in February  as miners continue to be reluctant to purchase new equipment  In their annual outlook  the company predicted a 10 percent fall in mining sales  though offset by moderate growth in other businesses 
For the three months ending in February  resource industries declined 37 percent  including a 55 percent drop in Asia  their weakest region thanks to major de stocking of inventory  and tight fiscal conditions 
Over the past two decades  Caterpillar has set up 26 manufacturing plants in China and employees more than 15 000 people    more than a tenth of its global workforce 
Though analysts from Macquarie expect that Caterpillar will continue to  make strides in China from a market share perspective   they re dubious about a strong rebound in the region  Larry Hu  their China economist  indicated in a note that he has  not seen signs that destocking has turned into restocking   and also noted that liquidity conditions could worsen on policy decisions from the People s Bank of China and capital inflows  which would decelerate growth in the second quarter of 2014  according to an April note 
 The China construction bubble fueled a rise in commodity prices   wrote William Blair   Co   analyst Lawrence De Maria  citing iron ore  metallurgical coal and copper  40 percent of which are consumed in that region 
 Absent another emerging market bubble  we do not see a reason for another huge capital expenditure cycle   they wrote  adding that they expect miners to continue being cautious about buying new equipment to conserve cash flow during a tough time for prices 
But others disagree  Deutsche Bank analysts wrote that despite a track record of missing earnings in the past five quarters  they expect a modest uptick in the first quarter on  positive commentary on construction and signs of recovery in mining to act as a positive catalyst for shares   they wrote  adding their prediction that earnings could be as high as  1 27  five cents over consensus 

Indeed  Caterpillar does much more than mining 
  As deep as the cycle seems to be  I like where we re positioned with power systems  construction  resources and financial   said Oberhelman at the conference 
A slow uptick on the post recession global economy  emphasized by growth in the U S  has been a positive development for Caterpillar s energy and transportation sector  formerly called power systems  as well as construction 
The company recently started publishing data from its 178 independent dealers  outlined by sector and geography  For the three months ending in February  construction sales were up nine percent 
 In our view  higher profits from these two segments aided by cost cuts will likely more than offset the decline in the company s mining profits   wrote analysts from Trefis Team on Forbes com 
Another offset to mining trouble has been a variety of cost cutting initiatives  Caterpillar  which is used to adapting to commodity cycles  has been making various adjustments  for more than two years now to help survive the tough climate  Last year  the company managed to reduce manufacturing  research and administrative expenses by  1 2 billion  Execs reduced their workforce by around 9 700 employees  cut 17 percent from research and development costs  slashed administrative costs by six percent and shut down plants 
 We figure in the first quarter  gains from these large scale cost cutbacks will protect CAT s profits from the decline in its mining sales   wrote the Trefis analysts 
Analysts at William Blair are also optimistic  and expect a positive quarter for Caterpillar  raising their earnings estimate due to  better constriction and margin estimates as a result of higher production rates in the quarter   according to a recent note 
 Increasingly positive sentiment has trumped economic  weather  and geopolitical fears  causing an industrial repositioning into capital goods stocks   reads a note from analysts at William Blair  who gave Caterpillar an  outperform  rating  citing completed inventory cuts  higher demand for oil and gas and stable mining aftermarkets as tailwinds ",International Business Times,0.061,0.85,0.089,0.9912

CAT,2014-04-29,"In the FT this weekend  Prasenjit Basu writes that China s crisis is coming   the only question is how big it will be 

 financial crisis in China has become inevitable  If it happens soon  its effects can be contained  But  if policy makers use further doses of stimulus to postpone the day of reckoning  a severe collapse will become unavoidable within a few years 
The country is in the middle of by far the largest monetary expansion in history  On one widely used measure  M2  its money supply has tripled in the past six years  an expansion four times as large as that of the US over the same period 
 China s economy is in an unbalanced state  It can stay that way for some time   but the longer it does  the worse the eventual outcome will be  The industrial sector is already plagued by falling prices  To avert a wider deflationary spiral  the country needs to wean itself off the false cure of perpetual policy stimulus 

We re bemused by this perspective 
On the one hand    duh   Virtually everything we know about financial history and long run economics says that policies of artificial growth  overlaid with serious corruption and capital misallocation  aren t sustainable  Then too you have stories like these 
Huge strike in southern China over more than just wage demands  Economist 
Middle class now fleeing China as well as the rich  Economist 
Chinese replace Russians as top foreign apartment buyers in Manhattan  Reuters 
At some point   we know not when   there is going to be a huge mess  But the trader in us shrugs and says  Meh  Where s the opportunity  
It s hard to get excited about the downside of China  when one remembers Japan 
Shorting Japanese Government Bonds  Japan Govt  Bonds  was supposed to be a slam dunk  The whole impossible Japan debt structure  200  of GDP etc blah blah  was supposed to have imploded something like  what  ten years ago  Twenty 
Shorting JGBs thus became known as the  widowmaker trade  because so many traders lost their butts on something that HAD to happen  that was so compelling and just around the corner   Oops  
But predictions of doom are lower probability in the real world simply by their nature  It s sort of like going to the doctor and testing positive for an extremely rare disease  If the actual statistical occurrence of the disease is  say  one out of 10 000 people  then you have to probability adjust for a greater likelihood the test gave a false positive   The standard margin of error on the test  as a percentage  is magnified by real world rarity of occurrence  something that many doctors frighteningly don t understand  
At any rate  we see China as fraught with real and serious problems  But  as with Japan  they are more  slow crisis  problems than issues of immediate blow up 
The idea that China will  dominate  the 21st century  and strike fear into the hearts of American capitalists the way Japan did in the 1980s  seems laughable  There will be too many fires for China to put out   to many creeping problems to manage  As for a dramatic result though  Probably not 

If China serves as a widowmaker for bearish macro guys  it could be through vehicles like Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   Stuff that was supposed to have imploded a long time ago via  obvious  tie ins to the China implosion thesis  but nope 
China itself  and the confounding nature of  the China trade   is yet another reason to emphasize respect for probability and price  If China really does implode   and it could  for reasons we listed in detail some time back   we will be Johnny On The Spot  But price will give us a heads up if that happens 
Until then   take doom calls with a grain of salt  or maybe a whole shaker  ",Mercenary Trader,0.126,0.785,0.089,-0.9623

CAT,2014-07-28,"Earlier this month  Jeremy Siegel  a well known  bull  on CNBC  took to the airwaves to predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average would go beyond 18 000 by the end of this year  Acknowledging overpriced valuations on the key stock indices are being ignored  he argued historical valuations should be taken with a grain of salt and nothing more   Source  CNBC  July 2  2014  
Sadly  it s not only Jeremy Siegel who has this point of view  Many other stock advisors who were previously bearish have thrown in the towel and turned bullish towards key stock indices regardless of what the historical stock market valuation tools are saying 
We are getting to the point where today s mentality about key stock indices the sheer bullish belief stocks will only move higher has surpassed the optimism that was prevalent in the stock market in 2007  before stocks crashed 
Corporate Earnings
At the very core  when you pull away the stock buyback programs and the Fed s tapering of the money supply and interest rates  there is one main factor that drives key stock indices higher or lower  corporate earnings  So  for key stock indices to continue to make new highs  corporate profits need to rise 
But there are two blatant threats to companies in the key stock indices and the profits they generate 
First  the U S  economy is very  very weak  While we saw negative gross domestic product  GDP  growth in the first quarter of this year  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  just downgraded its U S  economic projection  The IMF now expects the U S  economy to grow by just 1 7  in 2014   Source  International Monetary Fund  July 24  2014   One more negative quarter of GDP for the U S   and we are in a technical recession  We re already halfway there 
If the U S  economy does not improve  companies on key stock indices will have troubles selling their goods and services  and their corporate earnings will suffer  It is that simple 
Next  the global economy is in trouble here in 2014  The Baltic Dry Index  BDI  is breaking down to new lows  The BDI suggests demand in the global economy is reaching multiyear lows since the beginning of the year  the BDI is down 65  
Chart courtesy of 
An economic slowdown in the global economy affects the corporate earnings of companies in the key stock indices because they earn a massive amount of their revenues from overseas 
Consider Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT   In the second quarter of this year  the company earned more than 55  of its revenue from outside North America  It experienced a three percent decline in overall revenue in its second quarter because of weak sales in the global economy   Source  Caterpillar Inc   July 24  2014   Almost 50  of the revenues for the S P 500 companies come from outside of the U S  economy 
Dear reader  I may be the last bear standing  My skepticism toward the key stock indices grows every time stock prices tick higher 
Stocks are overvalued by the majority of historical stock market valuation tools  the price to earnings  P E  multiple  the dividend yield  earnings growth  revenue growth  the VIX Fear Index  insider selling  bullishness amongst stock advisors  the amount of money investors have borrowed to buy stock  and the economy 
The problem with reality in 2014 is the same problem we had with reality in 2007   Historical stock market valuations no longer matter  was the language of 2007  It s frightening to see it s the same language of 2014 ",Michael Lombardi,0.126,0.825,0.05,-0.9945
CAT,2014-07-30,"Last week  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  reported earnings that sent the stock gapping below its 50 day moving average  DMA  with a 3 1  loss  The stock followed its lower Bollinger Bands    BB  until today  July 29  2014   The stock rallied earlier in relative out performance to the market before fading to flatline 
All this might be rather unremarkable EXCEPT this is the fourth time this year CAT has closed below its rising 50DMA  The last two were in quick succession  This trading action suggests CAT s primary uptrend at the 50DMA is in trouble  A retest of 200DMA support is likely on the near horizon at this rate  CAT broke out above tis 200DMA back in December  2013 and has not looked back ever since  so a 200DMA retest will be a must watch 

Caterpillar breaks down again   is the fourth time a charm 


After the post earnings breakdown  I thought I lost a chance for a good entry point to get put options on CAT  So  I rushed to fade CAT as it approached its 50DMA today  I purchased the Sept 105 100 put spread figuring  100 is a good downside target for even a modest sell off in the market  As a reminder  I find bearish bets on CAT to be a good hedge against the potential for a market sell off  Since August and September tend to be the weakest months of the year  I think now is a great time to put on this hedge 
The good folks at StockTwits are evenly split on CAT  but sentiment is notably down from a month ago  That seems to me a large enough non confirmation of CAT s recent highs given how well StockTwits folks seem to crowdsource opinion on stocks  that s an informal anecdotal observation that I would LOVE to study with hard data   Howard Lindzon  are you listening

Commentary The relatively quiet churn in the general market is masking two potentially important developments  an apparent bottoming in volatility and an on going drop in T2108  The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   ended essentially flat on the day after a big news day of GDP and another Federal Reserve decision on monetary policy  Incredibly   and I just can t make this stuff up even if I wanted to   the S P 500 hit a low right at the 1962 bear bull line before bouncing to flatline 
The bear bull line holds yet again   in picture perfect form no less


While the S P 500 has barely moved all month net net  T2108 has fallen to closing and intraday lows last seen in February of this year  It is part of what has been a steep downtrend from overbought conditions that began the month  I believe that this is one of the most dramatic divergences I have seen since I started tracking T2108 many years ago  T2108 has now fallen five straight days during which the S P 500 made a new all time high  T2108 even looks like it is ready to plunge into quasi oversold status  Even MORE importantly  T2108 is again on the edge of violating its higher lows for the first time since it bottomed out in oversold conditions June  2013 

T2108 is on the verge of finally breaking a very bullish uptrend in place since June  2013 s oversold conditions


In conjunction with this  quiet divergence   volatility continues to look like it is bottoming  The post Fed plunge I was looking for did not quite happen  perhaps another confirmation of bottoming  I was fortunate enough to fade ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Fut  ARCA UVXY   with put options on Monday s temporary surge  but I decided to hold through the Fed decision  I am back to flat and watching developments quite intently 

The VIX still looks like it is bottoming 


Add this quiet divergence to the high likelihood that August and September will be the weakest months of the year  and I think we get a strong case to continue the latest volatility watch and to position for a notable pullback 
The follow through in selling on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  seems to confirm my short term bearish read on the stock and it has reinforced my sense that it is time to brace for a pullback  As always  stay tuned

The Markets
Stocks once again traded lower during Tuesday s session  rolling over from the highs charted last week amidst the euphoria surrounding the Alibaba IPO  The S P 500 declined by nearly six tenths of one percent  falling back towards its rising 50 day moving average  a level that has previously acted as intermediate support  The equally weighted counterpart to the capitalization index fared even worse  declining by nearly seven tenths of one percent  breaking through its respective 50 day moving average line and confirming a lower short term high  below the early September peak  The S P 500 Equally Weighted Index has significantly underperformed the capitalization weighted index this month  suggesting weak breadth  A few heavily weighted stocks in the capitalization weighted index  such as Apple  have kept the large cap index afloat near the all time market peak  but the majority of stocks within the benchmark are becoming increasingly weak  just over 48  of stocks in the index remain above 50 day moving averages  almost half of what the reading was back in mid June  The downward trajectory in this technical indicator is suggesting weakness ahead  unless a catalyst is provided to halt the slide 



As alluded to in yesterday s report  a number of indicators are giving rise to concern that economic struggles could lead to declines in stocks   One stock that has a significant sensitivity to the economy is Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   the chart of which is showing a potentially bearish technical setup  Since April of this year  the stock has charted what appears to be a head and shoulders topping pattern  a bearish setup that would be confirm upon a break below the neckline around  100  currently equivalent to the 200 day moving average  Implied downside target of the bearish setup points to  90  or around 10  below present levels   The stock has been underperforming the market since July  dragging on the broad sector  which is similarly showing a negative setup  double top resistance on the chart of the industrial sector ETF  XLI  could suggest significant downside potential should support break at the mid summer low around  50   Caterpillar  along with the reset of the Industrial sector  remains seasonally weak through to the end of October 




Investors that follow seasonality may have heard of the strategy of  Selling Rosh Hashanah and Buying Yom Kippur   The trade entails selling the S P 500 Index short on Rosh Hashanah  which begins on Wednesday evening  and covering the position on Yom Kippur  this year beginning on the evening of October 3rd   The theory follows that as traders take the days off to observe the High Holidays  positions are closed out  leading to downward pressure on equity indices   Traders then buy back into positions ahead of the third quarter earnings season  which begins a week or two into the month of October  Since 1970  the trade has worked nearly 60  of the time for an average gain of 0 53   the S P 500 Index has fallen by an average of 0 53     The trade typically falls in and around the weakest three week period of the year for the market  which generally spans the last two weeks of September and the first week of October   Should the recent trajectory of the market continue  stocks are on course to fulfil this short term seasonal phenomena

Commentary When T2108 closes below 30   it is time to get on high alert 
I am torn  however  as I cannot issue a definitive buy or sell recommendation  1  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   and the NASDAQ Composite  via PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   have printed ominous topping patterns this month  as described in previous posts   and 2  no major technical levels have broken to the downside  It is an odd state of limbo for the T2108 Update as conditions rapidly approach true oversold  below 20   
Let s start with quasi oversold conditions   what I will now sometimes colloquially call  over stretched  to make my post titles sound less technical and hopefully more inviting  T2108 has dropped into quasi oversold conditions for the second straight day  With a 34  2 day loss and the VIX soaring by 15   the T2108 Trading Model  TTM  is predicting another down day with 70  odds again  The associated decision  regression  tree is basing the entire prediction on the 1 day decline of T2108 of 18   The guidance from the last T2108 Update holds again  operate as though the S P 500 will close the day in the red  but be prepared to jump if the market responds to any positive catalyst  After all  30  and lower has often been  low enough  to form a  trading  bottom 
The catalyst to cause a jump may not be an influential analyst or journalist this time  It may simply be 50 day moving average  DMA  support 

The S P 500 has made a roundtrip from a 50DMA retest just over a week ago

The NASDAQ is churning slowly but surely into a major retest of 50DMA support
An odd aspect of the current rush to true oversold conditions is that the major indices are NOT experiencing anything close to a major  steep  uncomfortable  or even swift sell off  There is little here that says sentiment has become overly negative  This explains why I am not comfortable getting ready to aggressively buy call options on ProShares Ultra S P500  ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO   for example 
I CAN say that many individual stocks are experiencing some swells in selling  T2108 s 26  is a near 6 week low  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  has plunged further to 48   a level last seen February 7th as the market began to recover from the early year sell off  So  it is very possible that when  if   the time to buy on oversold conditions comes  it will be best to pick over a list of choice individual stocks 
While these technical conditions are not conducive to an aggressive buy recommendation  they are also a possible trap for overly aggressive bears  For example  a very classic form of whiplash could feature a breakdown below 50DMAs on the major indices that bears chase downward  They will lick their chops assuming a top is confirmed with more selling to follow  If T2108 is oversold and T2107 is matching lows from earlier this year at the same time well  you get the picture hopefully the spring could pop at any time from there to catch sellers flat footed  Ironically  more cautious bears may get the worst whiplash if they wait for a confirmation of the breakdown and find themselves opening fresh shorts just as T2108 sinks ever deeper into oversold territory 
Oh  and I did mention that the market is overdue for some kind of  
In other words  shorter term traders have a VERY tricky playing field ahead  Neither bear nor bull will likely be allowed to get comfortable   These are OK conditions for playing both sides of the fence as I have done  For an example  see my summary of trades from the last T2108 Update  
I conclude with a look at two other key indicators that I follow when trying to sort through a confluence of trading signals  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT    my favorite market hedge  and the Australian dollar  via Rydex CurrencyShares AUD Trust  NYSE FXA    particularly versus the Japanese yen 
Caterpillar made a very bearish break below its 200DMA and failed to maintain a  meek  bounce off  100  Again  I sold my last round of CAT puts last week  I am ready to fade the next rally here  This is the lowest close since April 1st  Note in the chart below the very weak and unconvincing breakout above the 50DMA in August  The subsequent lower high and rounded dome is a CLASSIC setup for shorting 

Caterpillar is definitively in the dangerzone
The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  has been a relatively reliable indicator this year for bear bull trading conditions  AUD JPY is still in bullish breakout territory first established in early April and re established with the breakout to new highs a month ago  The Australian dollar has been so weak this month that not even a strong bout of weakness in the Japanese yen has saved AUD JPY from a sharp and abrupt fall from its previous uptrend  AUD JPY has confirmed that upward momentum in risk attitudes has likely come to an end  but it has not yet given the green light to bears either  Such a confirmation will need to wait for a breakdown below the 200DMA a key support which held very nicely in May and August 

The Australian dollar is quickly reversing fortunes   an ominous indicator that still awaits confirmation with a major breakdown
Overall  bears and bulls alike   brace yourselves

Commentary
I always assume that the first trading day of a month is weighted in favor of buyers and bulls  NOT yesterday  not this month 
For the first time since June  2013  T2108 FINALLY closed in oversold conditions  below 20    This could be a watershed moment for the stock market  especially since the resulting 50DMA breakdowns on the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   and the NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   both confirm topping patterns that I have periodically referenced for both indices  Let s step through the key charts first 
The S P 500 lost 1 3  as it pulled away from a now failed test of 50DMA support  The index is now over stretched well below the lower Bollinger  Band  BB   Note that the S P 500 traded below the lower BB six times during the July August pullback before hitting a bottom 

The S P 500 breaks down below its 50DMA and confirms a top in the form of an  evening star 
The NASDAQ  QQQ  lost 1 6  as it too pulled away from a now failed test of 50DMA support  The index is now in the uncommon position of being well stretched below its lower BB 

The NASDAQ breaks down below its 50DMA and confirms a top in the form of a  bearish engulfing  pattern
The result is a large drop in T2108 to FINALLY close in oversold conditions  The intraday chart shows how T2108 first nailed 20 0  EXACTLY before attempting a bounce  You just cannot make this stuff up  I would have fallen out of my proverbial chair if T2108 had managed yet another close just a hair above the 20  threshold 

T2108 FINALLY oversold on a close

An attempt to bounce away from oversold conditions soon fails in a big way
T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  is now at levels unseen for two years  Market participants are now looking at a LOT of their stocks sitting below very critical technical levels  This represents a major test of bullish resolve 

T2107 plunges to levels unseen for two years
The volatility index  the VIX  surged  but it actually faded from highs and thus failed to take out the highs of the last pullback in July August 

The volatility index fails at resistance from the highs of the last stock market pullback
Putting the picture altogether  the pullback was severe relative to the Bollinger  Band but not severe relative to earlier surges in the volatility index  Moreover  the percentage losses on the market indices are not large by any means  My first read is that the next bounce will likely be weak and fail to generate enough momentum to break through 50DMA resistance 
HOWEVER  when I look to the currency markets for guidance  I see that my favorite indicator  the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  has been holding firm at 200DMA support  This is a bullish divergence  Note well how AUD JPY held 200DMA support when the S P 500 found a bottom in August 

The Australian dollar is holding firm against the Japanese yen despite a global sell off in stocks
If this support breaks  I will get a lot more bearish  like fade strength kind of bearish and NOT chase weakness kind of bearish  
Notably  my favorite bulldozer in the coal mine  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   has confirmed a breakdown from the 200DMA and has no  natural  support levels nearby  Support at  95 from the March lows will likely prove to be weak  Stronger support awaits around  86 where CAT sharply  yet briefly  broke down  As I have noted earlier  CAT is printing a classic pattern of a breakdown and new downtrend in the making 

No sign of a bottom anywhere close for Caterpillar
This picture is mixed enough to warrant plenty of caution  In particular  the VIX is not demonstrating enough fear  But for aggressive traders   still allow for accumulation  Accumulation gets most aggressive once if the VIX surges past the last high 
More conservative buyers can wait for T2108 to end oversold conditions  The big caution there is that such an end may occur very close to 50DMA resistance  Either way  this is a time for bears to start closing out some short positions and taking profits  I closed out a bunch of put options but no short positions yet  I do not have time to go into details on trades  but  basically  all of the bearish chart patterns I have pointed out in the past two weeks or so have paid off well  You can click on  to see a sample 
Given the clock is ticking on selling pressure based on the T2108 30  underperiod  I started slowly into ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  call options on Tuesday  September 30   I was also motivated by the possibility of a start of the month surge  I accumulated more call options on yesterday s big swoon  Neither trade was technically within the T2108 trading rules  so I kept the overall position small  I am now in T2108 oversold trading mode and will be following the above mentioned rules for aggressive traders  I am also ready to buy SSO shares outright to wait out potential churn in the oversold period  Regardless  my current operating assumption is that I should be prepared to bail on my positions on the next test of 50DMA resistance  I will cross that bridge when the market gets there  
Next  let s see where the S P 500 performance fell relative to historical periods outside oversold conditions  The incredible 319 days above the 20  oversold threshold places this period in rarefied company 

S P 500 Performance By T2108 Duration Above the 20  Threshold
Incredibly  the 20   overperiod  ended just as the projected S P 500 performance peaks around 27   see the red  open circles   This chart shows that this is the maximum performance we should EVER expect out of the S P 500 between oversold trading conditions  Oversold conditions last ended on June 26th  The S P 500 closed at 1603 26 that day  The S P 500 s close at 1946 16 means that this extended overperiod delivered a 21  performance  This is pretty close  especially given the implied error shown by the chart above 
As a reminder  here is the chart showing the median and average times to expect for T2108 underperiods 

Mean and Median Duration Below Given T2108 Threshold
T2108 spends an average of 5 to 6 days in oversold conditions  The median is a mere 2 to 3 days  The 30  underperiod is already 7 days old  The clock is ticking

Commentary While most of the financial media focuses on how the U S  jobs report presumably drove a major recovery in the indices  T2108 followers know better  Last week was all about oversold trading conditions 
On Thursday  October 2nd  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   plunged again well below its lower Bollinger  Band  BB   Unlike the day before  buyers rushed in  T2108 dropped as low as 13 0  before buyers punched in the bottom  The resulting rush was enough to close the S P 500 flat on the second day of the oversold period  The oversold period ended with a nice buying surge that took the S P 500  and the NASDAQ  close to 50DMA resistance 

The S P 500 rebounds sharply from oversold conditions

The NASDAQ also rebounds sharply with a gap up that seems to confirm the bottom left behind by the long hammer pattern
The looming overhead resistance will be the immediate challenge for bulls next week  However  I strongly suspect that enough bears and sellers were caught chasing stocks and the indices downward too far  and enough buyers and bulls were caught unprepared to buy into the surge of negativity  that Monday could deliver a clean gap up to and or above the 50DMA resistance  This gap up could be caused by an abrupt shift in sentiment that can come with some thinking time over the weekend  Even if the gap up does not deliver  the advantage is now firmly back in the court of the bulls with a clear stop at the low of the last oversold period 
The VIX action is even more telling  As I mentioned in the last T2108 update  I like to see a surge in the VIX during an oversold period that takes it to or past the previous high  This round did not disappoint  The VIX surpassed the last high and soon thereafter reversed in a wave of buying that followed  That was a great time for me to pick up my second tranche of ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  call options  The peak in volatility was all but confirmed with Friday s gap down below the 15 35 pivot point 

In perfect oversold fashion  the VIX breaks the former high only to reverse sharply soon thereafter
That peak in volatility was also a great time to load up on puts on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY   As I noted in the last T2108 Update  it looked like UVXY was peaking even as T2108 first plunged into oversold conditions 

The oversold period delivers another likely peak for UVXY
The timing of the oversold period worked out well too  As I reminded readers in the last T2108 Update  the median oversold period lasts 2 to 3 days  this one lasted 2 days  Next up is the time ticking on the 30  under period which has a median duration of 6 days and average of 7  This current 30  under period has now lasted 9 days and counting  Here is a look at the projected performance for the S P when the 30  under period ends  Note how expected S P 500 performs turns negative starting around a duration of 16 days 

S P 500 Price Change By Duration Below the T2108 30  Threshold
Now that the oversold period has ended  more conservative T2108 traders can step in and buy  Underlying this strategy is an assumption that the oversold period marks a significant and important behavior  As I cautioned in the last T2108 Update  the conservative strategy might trigger trade entries just as 50DMA resistance is getting tested  It makes a lot of sense to continue waiting until the indices prove that resistance here will not be a problem 
Over in the world of currencies  the Australian dollar just barely hung on for dear life to important support  The ever surging US dollar pushed the Australian dollar back down to and through the 2014 lows  So much for    it was ever so brief  However  AUD USD just managed to close above the  now  former 2014 low  There is still a glimmer of hope 

A burst of volatility in the Australian dollar at the 2014 lows   still holding
More importantly  the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  is still holding onto 200DMA support 

The Australian dollar is still hanging tough with the Japanese yen
Note well that I am not counting on the Australian dollar to trigger T2108 trades  I like that it confirmed the need to buy into the oversold period  If AUD JPY breaks down  I will be watching for signs the S P 500 will follow suit  Since the Australian dollar currently has its own issues with being over valued  it is very possible that AUD JPY and the S P 500 begin a significant period of divergence from here  I will be watching closely 
While the T2108 oversold trade worked very well  bulls and buyers cannot yet give the all clear signal  The topping patterns I have pointed out on the NASDAQ and the S P 500 are still in play until fresh highs occur  Moreover  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   my favorite hedge on bullish positioning  did not participate in Friday s rally  After an initial move up  CAT closed the day marginally lower than the previous trading day  This weak behavior is very consistent with my expectation that CAT has no near term technical support levels beyond a very weak  95 level 
After a very poor relative performance in 2013  CAT spent a good portion of 2014 playing catch up  See the chart below  The general market has accompanied CAT on the last 2 downlegs  so I am looking over the shoulders of my bullish case very warily at CAT 

CAT s effort to make up for lost time in 2013 may have come to an end for now

Commentary I should have used yesterday s pop in Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  despite market weakness to launch a new fade on the stock 

The 200DMA breakdown accelerates as the anticipated selling continues
I had been waiting for CAT to bounce and retest 200DMA resistance to rebuild my favorite downside hedge  That moment never came and instead CAT has continued on the slide that I feared was developing soon after CAT broke  100 below its 200DMA  I am still targeting a fill of the January gap up as CAT s first solid locus of support 
The free fall in CAT is the clearest sign that sellers are starting to take firmer control of the market  However  there is still an oversold condition to cause sellers likely angst 
T2108 closed at 17 4  to begin a second oversold period just 2 days after the last oversold period  For context  recall that oversold period was the first since June  2013  The chart below is a reminder that the 20  over period  the set of trading days where T2108 stays out of oversold conditions  can be quite short 

S P 500 Performance By T2108 Duration Above the 20  Threshold
 When I last presented this chart  I neglected to point out that I should have and could have used this to predict the end of the 20  over period that began in June  2013  The projected maximum gain of 27  was tagged almost exactly on September 18  2014   the current all time closing high on the S P 500  The next day came the  evening star    a classic candlestick topping pattern at the end of an uptrend  You just can t make this stuff up   
Time is still ticking on the selling pressure if the history of the 30  underperiod is any indication  As a reminder  the 30  under period has a mean duration of 7 days and a median between 3 and 4  The current 30  under period is now 11 days old 
The chart below suggests that if sellers are able to maintain this pressure for another 5 trading days or so  suddenly the expected performance for the S P 500 upon exiting this under period starts to decline  It first becomes negative around 19 trading days 

S P 500 Price Change By Duration Below the T2108 30  Threshold
The 30  under period began on September 23rd  The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   is down 2 4  since then  well below projected levels for the end of this period  Since this period WILL end  trust me   aggressive traders can start buys here in anticipation of the next oversold bounce  And that is exactly what I did today  I started a fresh round of call options on ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  expiring this Friday  very cheap but very risky  and next Friday  a lot less risky   I will not add to the position  or start a new one as the case may be  until if the VIX spikes above the last high  That trigger worked well in the last short oversold period 
The volatility index  the VIX  spiked 11 3   It fell short of the August 1st high but still hit a 7 month closing high 

The VIX surges again
Supporting this spike in the VIX was the surge in selling on the S P 500 and the NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   

The S P 500 now trades at a 2 month closing low with a downtrend firmly defined by a rapidly declining 20DMA

The NASDAQ now trades at a 2 month closing low with a downtrend firmly defined by a rapidly declining 20DMA
Both major indices are moving in nearly identical technical patterns now  At the current intensity of selling  a rendezvous with the 200DMA at some point seems very likely for both indices  intervening oversold bounces notwithstanding  An ideal retest would involve a a gap down or large swoosh that sends the VIX skyward 
So why not just follow the short term downtrend and press short positions  My explanation is simple  oversold trading conditions are an extreme  and the market does not like sitting still in extremes   especially selling extremes  The risk reward for NEW short positions is much better on rallies  I am guessing plenty of bears took that risk as the S P 500 ran into its 50DMA resistance  Ultimately  the biggest reason for not going overboard with shorts is that this is still a bull market  and there is still a very strong uptrend in place  I think charts are handy  visual reminders  I use SPY  weekly  here because my S P 500 chart is full of notes 
A bull market uptrend for the ages
This chart is what has helped make oversold periods such successful trades and overbought ones so tough to deal with  It is quite remarkable how few times since the historic lows in 2009 that the S P 500 has actually printed a lower low on this uptrend  The most significant lower low was in the summer of 2011 when the U S  government seemed intent on sending the U S  back into a recession  That period produced an extremely sharp and notable sell off  The last lower low was part of the January February sell off and that only lasted a few days before the S P 500 shot higher  In other words  the perma bears and sellers have yet to prove they can do serious damage to this market 
I contend that when this bullish uptrend hits its next true speed bump  we will know from a lower low  a break below the August low of 1899  Such a break will happen to coincide with a 200DMA breakdown   notable in of itself  given the LAST break of this powerful uptrend was in November  2012  This also means that  is reaching a historic two years without going negative 
Here is a very  from CNBC featuring an anchor and some pundits trying to take to task my favorite permabear Bill Fleckenstein  Of all the bears I follow  I respect Fleck the most  but both sides of this lively argument missed key points  Bulls need to appreciate that this super rally can easily drive us all to become very complacent  Bears need to admit that trying to call tops year after year has simply helped absolutely no one  To Fleck s credit  he is sooooo non committal on when to start shorting this market that he has been able to avoid the many wrong calls so many perma bears keep making  But he has also not participated in the upside these many years and as you will see from the video  he really doesn t care  I can only assume he remains confident he will make it all up in a hurry once he finally decides to go short again 
But let s not get too ahead of the game just yet  What is currently in front of us is a fresh oversold period  featuring intensifying selling pressure  Both the S P 500 and the NASDAQ printed classic topping patterns last month that are helping to embolden sellers  As I have noted during each oversold period  remember these things always feel painful as they unfold and they look like  obvious  buying points after they end  So  I stick to the time test T2108 rules to guide the way 
And here is a chart of the Australian dollar vs the Japanese yen  AUD JPY   It is STILL holding firm at 200DMA support and failing to confirm this sell off 

AUD JPY STILL oblivious to the sell off
Finally  here are charts to highlight  I made on Monday  October 6th when I failed to monitor how BOTH major indices were faring at their 50DMAs  Google  NASDAQ GOOG  is now breaking down below BOTH its 50 and 200DMAs and looks like a short  especially if it cracks the August low around  560  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  ARCA EEM  closed BELOW the 200DMA after gapping up and trading above that important line of resistance  Yesterday  the follow through selling  printed an ominous  abandoned baby top  which essentially trapped buyers like myself  I definitely prefer to be short EEM here regardless of T2108 conditions  The T2108 rules are only for the S P 500 anyway  Like CAT  I consider EEM to be a great downside hedge at this juncture especially with the U S  dollar soaring and commodity prices continuing to collapse

CAT,2014-10-23,"Investing com   Global construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  saw shares rise 6  in pre market trade on Thursday after reporting stronger than expected third quarter earnings 
Caterpillar said earnings per share was  1 72 in the three months ended September  blowing past expectations for earnings of  1 35 per share

The company now expects 2014 sales and revenues to be about  55 billion  the middle of the previous outlook range of  54 to  56 billion  While the mid point of the sales and revenues outlook range has not changed  profit per share expectations for 2014 continue to improve 
With 2014 sales and revenues of about  55 billion  the revised profit outlook is  6 00 per share  or  6 50 per share excluding  450 million of restructuring costs  That is an improvement from the previous profit outlook of  5 75 per share  or  6 20 per share excluding  400 million of restructuring costs at the mid point of the previous sales and revenues outlook range of  54 to  56 billion

CAT,2014-10-23,"By James B  Kelleher   Reuters    Caterpillar Inc  N CAT  shares jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday after it reported a stronger than expected quarterly profit and raised its 2014 outlook  citing strong demand from the North American energy and construction industries   Sales to those markets offset continued weak sales of its earth moving machines to the mining industry  a market Caterpillar bet on heavily through acquisitions in 2010 and 2011   right before a slump in commodity prices prompted resource companies to slash their investment in new equipment    Since then  Caterpillar has focused on cutting production costs and boosting margins  a process that has involved thousands of layoffs but permitted the Peoria  Illinois based company to grow earnings even as sales have flat lined    That was the case in the most recent quarter  when the company managed to boost its net profit by more than 7 percent  on sales growth of just 1 percent   For the third quarter ended Sept  30  Caterpillar earned  1 1 billion  or  1 63 a share  up from  946 million  or  1 45 a share  a year earlier   Analysts  on average  expected it to earn  1 36 a share on sales of  13 2 billion   Excluding restructuring costs  Caterpillar said it now expects to earn  6 50 a share in 2014  against an original forecast of  5 85    They crushed the estimates   said Brian Langenberg  principal at the independent research firm Langenberg   Co   Overall sales rose 1 percent to  13 54 billion  lifted by a 15 percent increase in North American sales  driven by demand for equipment and diesel and gas engines from oil and gas companies and builders   RISKS AND A FLAT 2015  Caterpillar  which also makes diesel electric locomotives  got a boost during the quarter as railroads raced to buy engines ahead of tough U S  emission rules that take effect in 2015   But those sales gains were offset by a 21 percent sales slump in Latin America  a 7 percent sales drop in most of the Asia Pacific region  and flat sales in China  Europe  the Middle East and Africa   Looking toward 2015  Caterpillar said there was  a reasonable likelihood that world economic growth could improve    But it warned a number of  significant risks    including tensions in the former Soviet Union and the Middle East and slowing growth in China   could hurt business confidence and weigh on sales   As a result  the company said revenue was expected to be essentially flat in 2015    Caterpillar is being cautiously optimistic  which is really all they can be  given all the gremlins out there   said Lawrence De Maria  an analyst at William Blair   Co   But even with revenue flat  they ve shown they can deliver solid  earnings per share  growth

Their earnings statement pointed out that their profit per share was hindered by  restructuring costs  that incurred a negative impact of 9 cents per share   Excluding restructuring costs  profit per share would have been  1 72 per share  Caterpillar is expecting restructuring costs to be about  450 million for 2014  higher than previous estimates of about  400 million primarily due to restructuring programs related to mining  The earnings release stated that the third quarter of 2014 included a negative impact of  0 09 per share for restructuring costs  Excluding restructuring costs  third quarter 2014 profit per share was  1 72  Third quarter 2014 sales and revenues were reported at  13 549 billion  up from  13 423 billion since the same period last year  In their respective divisions  North America reported third quarter revenue of  5 973 billion  up 15   Latin America reported  1 629 billion  up 19   EAME  Europe Africa Middle East  reported  3 251 billion  up 2   and Asia Pacific reported  2 696 billion  up about 7    In addition to the profit improvement  we have a strong balance sheet and through the first nine months of the year  we ve had good cash flow  So far this year  we ve returned value to our stockholders by repurchasing  4 2 billion of Caterpillar stock and raising our quarterly dividend by 17 percent   CEO of Caterpillar  Douglas Oberhelman  said   We are confident that  when we see more significant economic growth around the world  our consistent focus on operational performance will have prepared us to deliver even better results   Oberhelman added  Although the stock has been on a slight decline in the past months  Caterpillar continues to smash earnings expectations as it continues beating estimates by an average of 11 60  since last September  2014 Outlook
The company now expects 2014 sales and revenues to be about  55 billion  about in the middle of the previous outlook range of  54 to  56 billion  While the mid point of the sales and revenues outlook range has not changed  profit per share expectations for 2014 continue to improve 
As previously stated in the example  the profit per share outlook is being adjusted with and without anticipated restructuring costs  With 2014 sales and revenues of about  55 billion  the revised profit outlook is  6 00 per share  or  6 50 per share excluding  450 million of restructuring costs  That is an improvement from the previous profit outlook of  5 75 per share  or  6 20 per share excluding  400 million of restructuring costs at the mid point of the previous sales and revenues outlook range of  54 to  56 billion   In January we provided our first profit outlook for 2014 at  5 85 per share excluding restructuring costs   our current outlook excluding restructuring costs is  6 50 per share  a substantial improvement  The fact that we continue to raise our profit per share outlook on relatively flat sales is a testament to our diverse portfolio of businesses  disciplined cost control and operational execution  Preliminary 2015 Sales and Revenue Outlook Caterpillar views that the economic growth with continue to prosper in 2015 which will have a beneficial spill over impact on Caterpillar  From the report   In developed countries  growth oriented monetary policies should support continued modest economic improvement  In addition  we believe there is potential for increased investment in infrastructure in countries such as the United States  India and Turkey  In developing countries  constraints on liquidity and raised interest rates are starting to slow down in 2014   This was imposed to control inflation or to protect their exchange rates and with the implication of slowing down  economic growth for developing counties seems promising  More recently  interest rates in many developing countries have stabilized and we saw the first monetary policy easing the third quarter of 2014  There are still significant risks and uncertainties that remain and that could temper growth in 2015  Political conflicts and social unrest continue to disrupt economic activity in several regions  in particular  the Commonwealth of Independent States  Africa and the Middle East  The Chinese government s push for structural reform is slowing growth  and the ongoing uncertainty around the direction and timing of U S  fiscal and monetary policy actions may temper business confidence  As a result  our preliminary outlook for 2015 expects sales and revenues to be flat to slightly up from 2014  Bottom Line We currently rank Caterpillar as a Zacks Rank  3 hold   and estimate that fourth quarter earnings will come in at  1 61 per share   Consensus estimates also project the 2014 earnings to be projected at  6 24 per share   In the last two months  a majority of analysts have downgraded their earnings estimates for the current year until next year which could be attributed to their slightly lower than expected 2015 outlook   Caterpillar is a reasonably priced stock with a P E of 15 15 and with the stock taking a hit in the past couple months  investors should consider this a possible entry point for a reasonable price  The PEG ratio of 1 49 is indicating a growth rate in EPS of about 10  in the next year  This is an upward looking growth rate  and with a positive 3Q earnings result  investors should be very intrigued by the prospects of this Fortune 50 company ",Zacks Investment Research,0.03,0.8,0.17,0.9991

Support for the commodity was seen at  79 10 a barrel  last Thursday s low  and resistance at  83 26 a barrel  Tuesday s high 
Oil prices got a boost after Saudi Arabia said it cut crude oil production by about 328 000 barrels in September to a total of 9 36 million barrels 
London traded Brent prices have fallen nearly 26  since June  while WTI futures are down almost 23  from a recent peak of  107 50 in June

OPEC oil output hit a two year high of 31 million barrels per day in September  led by higher production from Iraq and Libya

Commentary The bears failed  miserably  As I anticipated from   the major indices were indeed setup for a major breakout above their 50DMAs  The S P 500  SPY   the NASDAQ  QQQ   and even iShares Russell 2000  IWM  ALL broke out decisively above their respective 50 day moving averages  DMAs  

The S P 500 makes a very convincing breakout above 50DMA resistance


The NASDAQ confirms its 50DMA breakout with an exclamation point
Despite the doubts  iShares Russell 2000  ARCA IWM  also managed to print a major 50DMA breakout 


Even iShares Russell 2000  IWM  manages to make a major 50DMA breakout that reaches as far as its 200DMA
Speaking of Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   it has  surprisingly  managed to reconquer the psychologically important  100 level  It is now directly under converging 50 and 200DMA resistance  This position now makes CAT a more perfect hedge on long positions than ever  HOWEVER  experience has taught me that these converging forms of resistance rarely hold  especially without some direct and related catalyst to provide the selling pressure 

CAT bottomed with the stock market and is now providing the rallies next critical  proxy  test at converged 50 and 200DMA resistance
The strong rally in the stock market helped to escort the volatility index on a rapidly descending escalator that sent ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  right back to very familiar territory 

The volatility index collapses again   seemingly ending what I thought would be a longer lasting uptrend bias


In a flash  ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  is right back to a very familiar position
The advantage clearly goes back to the bulls even with all time or multi year highs still looming above as resistance  Bulls can now buy FRESH positions with stops below the 50DMA  Bulls can hold positions and wait to see what happens when  if   the highs get re challenged  Bulls can especially take some more profits from hard earned positions opened during the recent oversold periods 
T2108 closed at 55 3   well off a new overbought period  yet  the S P 500 has already hit   In fact  almost on the nose  This means that if the S P 500 continues higher into overbought conditions  it will produce a rare period where the 70  underperiod produces a positive gain for the S P 500  That is  the drop from and return to overbought conditions would deliver a positive S P 500 performance  Seeking consistency with the historical behavior in T2108  I am watching now for a period of significant churn that allows T2108 to increase much more slowly with overbought conditions conveniently triggering at the recent highs 
Given my bullishness going into this week  I bought ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  call options into Monday s dip  This was one of several positions in other stock setups  Tuesday delivered bigtime with the breakouts shown above  and I closed out the SSO call options with a cool double  I am still holding onto my SSO shares purchased during the oversold period  The breakout gives me renewed confidence  but it also now provides a clear stop for exiting the position if needed 
There are some traders who are just now getting bullish given the clearance of the technical hurdles  The waiting is understandable from a conservative risk reward standpoint  but these traders now have to wait out a breakout to fresh highs for a big payoff  The real reward was in sticking to the trading rules during the oversold period  The latest big move only further validates my technical case for a bottom in the stock market  The breakout makes me a little more aggressive on buying dips as long as T2108 stays below overbought territory  70  or higher  and the S P 500 above its 50DMA 
I continue to be bemused by the bears who are overly focused on the trees and forgetting the forest  The latest excited shouts of glee  on twitter anyway  offering  proof  of the bearish thesis have come from the 10  or so after hours post earnings drop by Facebook  NASDAQ FB   While I continue to short FB as part of a hedged strategy I laid out a long while ago  I do not see FB s stumble as proof of any over arching bearish thesis  The forest is rapidly healing all around the few fallen  hyper expensive  stocks  The oversold period was all about panic over everything under the sun that could possibly produce worry and concern  It was a technical breakdown and a violent one at that  The end of the oversold period and the subsequent buying on volume has been all about putting those fears to bed and in the rearview mirror  It is a technical recovery in that it has pressed reset on the prior technical breakdown  The poor reactions to a few over valued stocks do not change the larger picture 
Moreover  it is so much better to follow the technicals here than to go through the extremely difficult exercise of staking a claim to a market top  Exhibit A is Alibaba Group Holding Limited  Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd  NYSE BABA   

Alibaba Group Holding Limited  BABA  is now sprinting higher 
Today  October 28th   BABA made a marginal new all time high before closing right at tits all time intraday high  BABA as made four straight new closing all time highs in a row now  This is NOT the behavior of a stock that has signaled a market top  As a technical signal  believers in an  Ali Blah Blah top  should now recognize the red flag on the thesis and ponder the possibilities for the stock market to soar right past the highs set in mid September at the time of BABA s IPO  Something tells me the introspection and re examination will not happen 
Fortunately  the 50DMA breakout has made the trading call very simple and BABA independent  Shorts placed in anticipation of of firm 50DMA resistance should have been stopped out  Traders following the T2108 rules are OK to take a few more profits here  especially to fund future purchases on the next dips and or to sit tight through any coming retest of 50DMA as  now  support

CAT,2014-11-09,"By Michael Martina BEIJING  Reuters    There will be no  major announcement  on a Washington backed Asia Pacific free trade deal during a meeting of leaders from the region in Beijing this week  U S  Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Sunday 
Few expected that a deal on the ambitious 12 country Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  could be reached this year  largely because of a deadlock between the pact s two biggest economies  the United States and Japan  over how widely Japan will open its doors to farm exports 
Business leaders  however  have been looking for indications of momentum on TPP talks at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  forum which runs through Tuesday 
 There certainly will not be a final agreement  an agreement  a major announcement   Froman told reporters during an APEC briefing when asked about the TPP talks 
 This is an opportunity when we have leaders altogether in one place for them to take stock of where they are and give political impetus to complete the rest of the negotiations  
The United States insists that Japan lower barriers to agricultural imports  but Tokyo wants to protect sensitive products including pork  beef  dairy and sugar 
Some TPP partners hope that whatever is agreed between the United States and Japan will serve as a blueprint for bilateral agreements with other countries 
China is pushing for a separate trade liberalization framework called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific  FTAAP  at APEC  but some see a proposed study on the plan as a way to divert attention from the TPP  which excludes China 
The TPP  which would span from Asia to the Americas and cover 40 percent of the world economy  is a key part of the U S  effort to build stronger ties with Asia amid China s rise 
U S  President Barack Obama  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and leaders from the 10 other countries negotiating the TPP are set to meet in Beijing on Monday 
Japan issued a statement after Abe s bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper  saying the leaders agreed on the  need to confirm the political determination to settle a deal  at Monday s TPP meeting 
Myron Brilliant  Executive Vice President of the U S  Chamber of Commerce  told Reuters the business community was looking for a sign 
 Everyone wants to see leadership from President Obama and Prime Minister Abe in closing the deal  If that is clear and decisive coming out of these meetings  we have a chance of wrapping up TPP soon   Brilliant said 
Many business leaders say that Republican wins in the recent U S  mid term elections may ease the passage of a potential TPP deal through the U S  Congress 
 My sense is that the odds were long before the mid terms  but they narrowed a bit  I think it has a better chance today than it did a week ago   Douglas Oberhelman  CEO of construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc   told Reuters 
Chin Leng Lim  a trade expert and professor of law at the University of Hong Kong  said there should be a TPP deal before U S  presidential electioneering picks up next summer if it is to avoid U S  domestic political hurdles 
 Your window is pretty tight  You re looking at getting it done by the spring if you want to get it done   Lim said 

 That s not a bad thing for negotiations  because all the other parties in the TPP know that as well

Commentary


The above tweet comes from an Australian economist whom I follow relatively closely as a check on my views about the Australian and global economy  The rates are on Australian bonds  but bond yields are falling all over the globe  I post it as just one example of a very palpable fear I feel is growing as commodity prices continue tumbling seemingly with no end  Such an extended collapse is simply not part of our normal  recent  experience  so assumptions and conclusions that demand is plummeting in places like China strike a very loud chord  Then again  commodity prices got to current levels after a run up that had not been seen for a very long time either  Here is an example from Australia s latest commodity price index 

Is THIS a bubble that is in the middle of an epic collapse  Ten years and running without stabilization 
Note very well that this collapse in commodity prices has unfolded for 3 1 2 years  Thus  it makes little sense to say  the market is going down because commodity prices are plunging   Perhaps commodities finally reached a tipping point  like adding oil to the plunge  but clearly the story is more complex with the S P 500 just a few percentage points off all time highs 

Having said all that  traders must fully appreciate the havoc that can descend upon market sentiment when unusual events are happening with no end in sight  Until market participants think they have a sense for just how far oil might go  the oil related  disaster  narrative will take a firm hold on minds and hearts  Bottom line  the early warning from T2108 and then Caterpillar s  NYSE CAT  reversal and now a confirmation from the Australian dollar Japanese yen combination  AUD JPY  should be assessed very seriously  The chop on the way to this point has been distracting from the fundamental message that some kind of top seems to have appeared 

Now  the charts 

T2108 plunged a massive 10 percentage points  This means a LOT of stocks are breaking critical technical levels all at once  As a reminder  T2108 was our earliest warning signal that  something  was not right with the stock market   its descent began on November 28th  Black Friday 

T2108 continues its fade away from the overbought threshold
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   was unable to muster any buying interest off the lows today  unlike yesterday  Trading volume was very strong  and the index  punched  its lower Bollinger Band   BB  hard enough to bend it downward a classic warning sign of an imminent continuation move  A retest of the 50 day moving average  DMA  seems almost certain now especially with it coinciding with the round number 2000 

The S P 500 is on an apparent rendezvous with 50DMA and round number support
The volatility index provides an emphatic confirmation of the selling pressure and sharp  relative  surge in fear 

The VIX propelled itself off the 15 35 pivot and is well above its upper Bollinger Band
ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  responded in kind with a 24  pop  I clearly was not expecting anything close to such a pop given I sold my UVXY call options yesterday  I have switched now to my more comfortable positioning of fading UVXY with some put options expiring next Friday  I am fully expecting next week s Federal Reserve meeting to be another volatility killer 

UVXY springs to life yet again
Finally  AUD JPY provided all the confirmation I needed of a refreshed bear  This important currency pair punched through 50DMA support as its breakdown from recent highs continues 

The Australian dollar crashes through its 50DMA against the Japanese yen  but is fighting to hold onto this critical line of support
So now it seems my sale of my ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  shares yesterday was timely even as my sale of UVXY call options was premature  As planned  I sold my Caterpillar  CAT  put spread given little remaining upside exists with the stock dropping well past the low point of the put spread  100 95   I closed out some short positions  like CSIQ   a play whose theme is explained in  Solar Stocks And Oil  A Potential Setup For A Solar Relief Rally In 2015   

Overall  I am on alert  Given the chop since the November 21st breakout and my expectation for more chop  I will not be surprised by additional fake out moves  The good news is that this chop provides almost daily trading opportunities to the upside and downside  The bad news is that it will continue to be easy to get distracted from the main storyline  a topping market whose longer term uptrend remains well intact   that is  consider bearish opportunities to be temporary opportunities and continue looking for good entries to buy the dip 

I feel freer to short individual stocks that meet strict technical criteria  I am not a bear  just a protective bull  With T2108 already at 45   I know I need to pay close attention to the distant horizon where oversold conditions may await the market s arrival  Ideal oversold conditions  T2108 less than 20   would occur right as the S P 500 is testing its 50DMA and even better if the volatility index is soaring at the same time to or past the previous high point  But I know how the market loves to ignore the specifics of my desires 

Finally  per my trading calls  bulls should have already taken some profits  Hopefully you feel comfortable with the leftovers on your plate  You should try to ride out those remaining positions through the coming storm and look forward to buying from your shopping list at a discount

CAT,2014-12-17,"Investing com   U S  stocks shot up on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would be patient when deciding when to hike interest rates  with firming oil prices giving stocks a shot in the arm as well 
At the close of U S  trading  the Dow 30 rose 1 69   the S P 500 index rose 2 04   while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 2 12  
The S P 500 VIX index  which measures the outlook for market volatility  was down 17 52  at 19 44 
The Federal Reserve said earlier it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0 00 0 25  and added it will exercise patience when raising interest rates to make sure the economy continues to improve 
In past statements  the Fed said it would take  considerable time  to make sure recovery is underway before tightening policy 
In Wednesday s statement  the Fed left in the dovish phrase  though the context of the language suggested that the  considerable time  wordage applied to past statements  leaving markets to conclude that rate hikes are on the way though monetary authorities will be  patient  when acting 
 Based on its current assessment  the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy  The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1 4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October  especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee s 2 percent longer run goal  and provided that longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored   the Fed said in its statement  referring to its monthly bond buying stimulus programs it ended in October 
 However  if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects  then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated  Conversely  if progress proves slower than expected  then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated  
The Fed s language fueled a rally on Wall Street by boosting hopes that borrowing costs will remain low for some time to come while economic fundamentals continue to improve and bolster top and bottom lines 
Elsewhere  higher oil prices boosted stocks as well  energy companies especially 
The U S  Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report earlier that U S  crude oil inventories fell by 0 847 million barrels in the week ending Dec  12  and while short of expectations for a decline of 2 36 million barrels  markets applauded news of a draw a day after industry data rattled nerves 
The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported an unexpected 1 9 million barrel increase in U S  oil stockpiles  which investors later branded as an anomaly 
Stocks have tracked oil prices in recent sessions due to concerns that ample supply notwithstanding  falling crude futures may reflect a cooling global economy as well 
Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average performers included Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   up 4 25   UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH   up 3 43   and McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   up 3 30

CAT,2015-01-06,"European markets are set to start where they left yesterday and they are trading lower despite the fact that we had a slightly better number for the Chinese HSBC manufacturing data  Perhaps  traders are focusing more on the oil rout and on the global sell off and using this occasion to book their profit and selling those equities which had a tremendous run last year  You cannot blame them  it is difficult to convince the investors when you have only talk from the president of the ECB to do  whatever it takes  and in reality he is still struggling to come up with full blown QE 
Nevertheless  there is one thing in common across all global market which is a panic sell off as the price of oil dropped into the 40 handle  Although  you would expect that lower oil price should be a good news for the stock market  but in fact it is not  because the fact is that lower oil price could trigger a completely new affair  which we have not experienced in some very long time  Hence  the energy and construction stock such as BP  NYSE BP   Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  are under heavy selling pressure since the rout in oil prices have started  The reason is simple  if the oil price is below the break even price  this will put more burden on the balance sheet of energy companies who have billions of debt on their books and at the same time it also increases the stress on the lenders  a perfect scenario for debt default 
However  this is only one part of the equation when it comes to the global sell off  The main concern is about the euro and if the currency is irreversible  So far  traders had a firm believe that the eurozone members will do whatever it takes to keep the currency bloc together  but the recent rumours out of Germany have changed the odds of that  as some investors have started to price in that perhaps it is time to cut the losses and let those countries go which are dragging the currency down  But  only if it was that simple  the fact is that Greek economy is the size of Apple s market share  so if the problem could be solved by letting Greece go  this options could have been selected long time ago  The major concern is that this event could fuel other anti austerity parties in much bigger economies such as Spain and Italy  which are of the same mind set that austerity is a German way of resolving the affairs and this will not solve the problems 
In addition  we have the president of the ECB bank who is perhaps not as free as he talks and is in a constant battle with Germany when it comes to the topic of massive and full scale quantitative easing program  The German CPI data released yesterday clearly had the effects of falling oil prices and the eurozone CPI data  which is due tomorrow  will not be able to escape the impact of this either  There are even questions if Mario Draghi is allowed to trigger the button of full blown QE  the sharp sell off in the oil prices will still be a major hurdle when it comes to tackling the inflation part of the equation 
On the other hand  the decline in the euro could also be blamed due to the divergence in polices between the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve bank  The kind dollar is not only strong against the euro but also against the basket of major currencies  The sad fact is that this trend could very well continue for rest of the year unless the cracks in the U S  economic data do become more visible which may push the Federal Reserve bank to change their policy once again

Commentary
Just as I was bracing for more losses  the stock market of course threw a surprise yesterday  The S P 500 gapped up and gained 1 2  to reverse all of the previous day s losses while bouncing off  support  from the start of the Santa Claus rally  T2108 surged over the 40  threshold  Perhaps most importantly  the volatility index  the VIX  gapped down for a 8 6  loss  Suddenly  I now have to consider that a bottoming process from the latest pullback may already be underway 


The volatility index gapped down   likely bringing the latest up cycle to an end  Before I continue  I need to point out something I completely missed from the previous day s close  I showed how the S P 500 was rebounding nicely off its lows in tight concert with my favorite indicator from the currency market  the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY   However  I completely missed the strange nature of the close in the final minutes  As usual  I have to use  ARCA SPY  to make it plain as the open and close on the S P 500 did not do the trading action any justice 
In the 15 minute chart below  SPY started a sudden reversal at 3 30pm Eastern time yesterday  Volume surged as it often  usually   does in the final 15 minutes  I include yesterday s earlier trading for comparison  Note how the gap up in SPY started trading as if the previous 30 minutes never happened  It was if someone  or some people  were forced out  washed out  into the close  If I had noticed the potential purge  I would have been a little more hopeful for a positive day of trading despite the T2108 Trading Model s prediction for a down day 

SPY gapped up and immediately erased the impact of the previous day s closing action  The strongest case for a bottoming comes from AUD JPY  Note that just like the December low  AUD JPY it broke down below the 200DMA and jumped right back over it the following day 

My favorite stock indicator Caterpillar  Inc   NYSE CAT  is even winking at a bottom  The stock printed a hammer pattern the previous day and confirmed the bottoming pattern opening higher  ever so slightly  and finishing with a gain on higher volume  This puts in play at least a fill of Monday s calamitous gap down and plunge 

Finally  it is interesting to note how the S P 500 is still  loitering  around the levels it traded when the Bank of Japan pumped up its program of quantitative easing and soon thereafter China cut rates  And now the support line from the Santa Claus rally may even prove important for trading in the near term 
Since I am expecting an extended period of chop  I am not getting overly excited  Note that the S P 500 must now contend all over again with overhead resistance at the 50DMA  Bulls have a very clear stop below January s low  Bears need to look out for yet another downside fake out 
Speaking of bottoms  I have become VERY intrigued by gold s ability to consolidate in the last two months even as the U S  dollar index has soared about 7   I am definitely NOT going to call a bottom in gold  but it is definitely tradeable to the long side here  with stops in place adjusted to risk tolerance of course   If SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD  manages to breakout from its 200DMA  another 4  higher   I might even have to turn full out bullish  for the short term  

SPDR Gold Trust  GLD  is flatline since the end of October even as the U S  dollar has soared 7   Gold may actually have begun to bottom here and is likely tradeable from the long side

Commentary The S P 500  SPY  sank as low as 2085 44 within the first 30 minutes of trading  I thought at last the market was providing a definitive trading signal  Recall that in the last T2108 Update  I drew 2087 as my latest line of support to determine whether to act on the bearish divergence at that time  It is a good thing I usually wait until the market close to make the final call  The S P 500 traded nearly straight up from its lows  cruising right past the 2100 round number  Notch one more all time high for the S P 500 


The S P 500 rebounds sharply into a fresh all time high

Ordinarily  I would take this opportunity to flip firmly bullish in order to catch what could be a refreshed uptrend  After all  an uptrend between the Bollinger Bands  BB  is starting to unfold  However  the behavior of T2108 continues to confound me  Instead of flipping overbought  T2108 barely budged  It closed at 64 0  and remains below its level two weeks ago when it just missed hitting overbought status  This is now day  155 for T2108 trading outside of overbought conditions  The S P 500 has gained an incredible 6 7  over this time period  To put this in perspective  see the chart below that shows the S P 500 s performance charted against the duration of the T2108 70  underperiod  meaning trading outside of overbought conditions  


The duration of the current T2108 70  underperiod is exceptionally long compared to the historical record

Not only is it extremely rare for T2108 to go this long without hitting overbought conditions  but also the performance of the S P 500 is at the top of the expected range fror any duration  Moreover  other periods that have gone this long without overbought conditions have delivered very poor performances for the S P 500  This chart also suggests that the odds are higher than ever that this tease below overbought conditions will end soon   hopefully THIS week 

The rally on Friday even succeeded in pushing the volatility index to its lowest point since it last bottomed in late December  Bears can certainly make a case that the odds favor a rebound over further losses for the VIX  The VIX is also now below the 15 35 pivot 


The VIX drops below the pivot point  Will it bounce off support or set new lows 

While I remain wary until I see the market s behavior when T2108 finally hits overbought  I know there have to be some itchy trade fingers out there  I can certainly sympathize with an assessment that the market is once again a train leaving the station  For buyers of the S P 500  I offer up a simple rule  load up on ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  call options and stop out on a S P 500 close below 2085  The dip on Friday has moved the dividing line a tad lower but also made that line all the more significant  I will be making a definitive bearish trading call once if that close occurs  If the S P 500 manages a strong close into new all time highs when T2108 hits overbought  I will be inclined to rejoin the bulls  with 2085 as a likely stop  

Two of my other favorite supporting indicators are not helping much in tandem these days 

The Australian dollar  Rydex CurrencyShares AUD Trust  NYSE FXA   has managed to rally against the Japanese yen in the aftermath of a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA   This is a bullish development  in retrospect  I could have used this bottom to make a case for playing an eventual breakout on the S P 500  Now  I am anticipating stiff resistance at the declining 50DMA 


Much to the certain chagrin of the RBA  the Australian dollar has increased in strength in the weeks following the first rate cut in about 18 months 

Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  reported an awful sales report on Thursday  The stock gapped down and ended its post earnings relief rally right at the point of closing the post earnings gap down  This move was a definitive score for the bears  However  the very next day CAT came back and nearly closed the latest gap  I continue to load up on put options on CAT  and any bullish plays I make on SSO will be tuned to the amount of hedging I think I have with CAT 


CAT s post earnings relief rally ends with a poor sales report  The stock is now struggling to remove resistance at the 20DMA  50DMA resistance looms overhead 

Here are some of the other charts on my radar 

Zillow  Z Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ Z  has surged in response to news that the company has closed its deal to acquire Trulia Inc  NYSE TRLA   I made several trades into this volatility and missed several  I will summarize to say that I was quite stubborn at several points of resistance including the 200DMA and the apparent resistance formed from the launching point when rumors of the Trulia deal sent the stock soaring a whole 7 months ago  The big payoff came on Thursday as the stock dropped back to the upper Bollinger Band  BB  which happened to coincide with the 200DMA at that point   Regular readers know how much I like to make contrarian trades on stocks that move extremely far away from the upper lower BBs   I am still  at these levels but a close above Wednesday s high will be definitively bullish 


Zillow  Z  gets even more volatile than usual in the wake of the closing of its acquisition of Trulia

Splunk  SPLK As expected  Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK  surged ahead of earnings  I was not positioned as well as I would have liked and managed not to earn enough on my call options to pay for my puts  These puts are a play on an expected post earnings plunge  The puts have a strike at  55 and are highly unlikely to benefit from a post earnings plunge from current levels  definitely a case of poor positioning   With the earnings report not until Thursday  Feb 26  I may re initiate the hedged trade 


As expected  Splunk  SPLK  has surged ahead of earnings

Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ICPT I have written several times about trades on ICPT  My last trade setup was a hedged one going short shares and long call options  I was actually expecting a pullback after the stock offering but instead ICPT has surged well past its  176 offering price  I am thoroughly impressed with the resilience even with these extremely low trading volumes  If the stock manages to breakout above its 200DMA  I will have to assume a fill of the November earnings gap down is in play  I am watching volume closely under the assumption that the next volume surge will point the direction for the next sustained move 


Intercept Pharmaceuticals  ICPT  has surprised me with on going strength post offering  The stock is now fighting to break through 200DMA resistance

Coach  NYSE COH Coach Inc  NYSE COH  broke out above its 200DMA several times in January  The final breakout was in response to earnings  The subsequent selling stopped right on the 200DMA  The stock has barely looked back since  It now looks like a bottoming process is confirmed for COH as it finally seems ready to leave behind a lot of post earnings angst  I will like this stock a LOT when I am in a more bullish mood 


Coach  NYSE COH  is starting to leave behind post earnings angst as a bottoming process seems to be underway

The date was January 5th when T2108 skipped an entire 10 percentage point range going from 50 6  to 38 8   At the time  the S P 500 broke down below its 50DMA for the second time in 3 months  I supplied a bevy of bearish individual stock charts  I prepared for an S P 500 retest of 200DMA support and oversold conditions  Instead  the index sold off just one more day before continuing along its chopping range for another 5 weeks  That chop included two days where the S P 500 made fresh marginal closing and intraday lows for 2015 
I provide this context because T2108 has made another dramatic move  T2108 skipped right through the 50s again but this time to the downside  moving from 60 3  to 49 1   This is a very bearish move  but the recent history prevents me from over extending the bearish implications of the drop  Friday s move could be yet another prelude to a quick change in direction for the S P 500  especially with 50DMA support close at hand 
Nevertheless  the index closed below my bearish dividing line of 2085  so I am sticking to my earlier stated rule  Over the last few days  I have been firmer in my warnings because T2108 absolutely refused to respond to the S P 500 s sluggish creep higher  Today s 1 4  drop on the S P 500 provided convincing follow through to  

The S P 500 takes a sudden tumble toward 50DMA support
The index and T2108 are now singing the same bearish tune  The index definitively closed below my 2085 dividing line for changing my trading call from mildly bearish to bearish  I did not buy any put options on ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  because I wanted to wait for a confirmed close  In fact  I sold my put options on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   CAT  as the stock broke down below  80 for the second time during the day  The stock traded below its lower Bollinger  Band  BB  for the third day in a row  so I think it could bounce sharply at any moment  Moreover  the post earnings low is barely a point away  Since my CAT put options are a hedge on SPY bullishness  I no longer need to hold them as I turn outright bearish   there are many other better targets out there with a lot more downside risk 
With my last batch of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  expiring on the day  I bought a fresh round near the day s open  It was a timely purchase  and I decided to hold them given the bearish move on the S P 500  I will likely lock in profits on the next move downward and prepare to focus on SSO positioning  The volatility index  the VIX  surprisingly faded into the close even as the S P 500 closed on its low of the day  In other words  the bears have not yet won any important victories from the technical perspective 

The volatility index tries gain new life but the 15 35 pivot again proves too strong to stay broken
The headline angst for the stock market was a  surprisingly  strong jobs report  Apparently  this good news was bad news for the market as the odds for a Fed rate hike increased for June  This in turn sent the U S  dollar  NYSE UUP   much higher on the day and bond yields higher  The weekly chart shows just how strong the U S  dollar has become as it neatly follows a sharp angle higher  On the daily chart  the dollar index has extended far about its upper BB  The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  ARCA TLT  has gone from a bullish cup and handle pattern to a very bearish  confirmed breakdown of the 50DMA  The 50DMA has gone from support to resistance  My play on support is obviously over  I have turned my gaze to rate sensitive plays  excluding home builders   

The U S  dollar continues to tear higher

iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  kicks into a lower gear as the rally seems to be coming to an end
As a reminder  March is one the  as far as average drawdowns  but it is one of the most dangerous months in terms of maximum drawdown  Hopefully this month s drawdown will come with oversold conditions but one step at a time

CAT,2015-04-23,"It s been a tough morning for European markets on Thursday and this is likely to carry into the US session as weaker PMI readings from China and the eurozone and disappointing UK retail sales weigh on investor sentiment 
Markets were initially happy to shake off the decline in the HSBC  LONDON HSBA  manufacturing PMI from China because despite falling to a one year low and deeper into contraction territory  the People s Bank of China remains very active and this will only encourage it to cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ration further in the coming months  China is of course a concern and a threat to the global economy but I think people have faith in the PBOC to prop it up and the more it props it up  the happier investors are because this means more liquidity 
While the ECB is also considered to be a very active central bank  it is going to take a far more considered approach than the PBOC as its interest rates are already in negative territory and it s buying  60 billion of debt every month  I see little chance of the ECB loosening monetary policy again this year but the same can certainly not be said for the PBOC  With that in mind  poor data in the eurozone is a concern and is bad news for the markets 
We were just starting to get a little more optimistic about the eurozone following months of improving PMI readings on the back of a weaker euro that seemed likely to stimulate the economy  Unfortunately  the ongoing negotiations between Greece and its creditors have significantly increased the odds of a Greek default and the uncertainty that this creates appears to be denting the fragile confidence that has arisen this year  The good thing is I do expect a deal will be reached which should be followed by a rebound in the PMI readings 
UK retail sales produced another disappointment this morning  surprisingly falling by 0 5   while core sales only rose by 0 2   The only upside here was the decline in retail sales was largely driven by a decline in fuel sales which isn t necessarily a bad thing  Hopefully it just means consumers have a little extra cash in their pockets heading into the summer 
On a more positive note  public sector net borrowing was pretty much in line with expectations and February s number was revised lower meaning borrowing in the last fiscal year fell by more than  10 billion  I m sure the Conservatives will welcome this news only a couple of weeks before an election in which the economy and deficit cutting are two of the biggest issues

After a wild week  the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY  closed below resistance but still with a substantial gain from the previous week
While I was able to stave off some sense of regret for not locking in profits on Wednesday s close  I could not shake the sense that I should have tried a counter trade on UVXY or ARCA VXX  I noticed too late that the VIX had bounced cleanly off the good ol  15 35 pivot line  This pivot line continue to perform surprisingly well  This was one of those rare moments where it was not front and center for my trading 

The volatility index  the VIX  bounces cleanly off the 15 35 pivot line
The VIX s relative resilience since Monday s surge and UVXY s surprising divergence in performance with a decline of just 4 2  versus the VIX s 11  decline combined represent a persistent unease in the market  The coming Greek referendum on the bailout package from the country s creditors leaves residual uncertainty in the air  I do not think the outcome matters at all to the larger scheme of things for trading  Greece has effectively defaulted  and it has been quite clear for some time that Greece cannot service its debts without a generous restructuring  Only the removal of uncertainty matters  If I am correct  volatility should experience a large plunge next week  At a minimum  UVXY s out performance versus the VIX should come to a rapid close with a decline commensurate with the VIX s performance  it SHOULD move double   The currency markets  for example  are still not flagging any out sized concerns after Sunday s initial plunge in the euro  NYSE FXE 

China is likely presenting another salient concern for the market  The Shanghai Composite s  SSEC  breakdown continues  While this index is not representative of the Chinese economy  it does hold a lot of psychological value and is a proxy for the speculative frenzy among retail investors in China  As I demonstrated earlier  the Shanghai Composite is collapsing much like the NASDAQ bubble from 15 years ago 

The Shanghai Composite Index has a confirmed breakdown with a well defined downtrend from the recent high
This situation will not likely resolve anytime soon with another rate cut in China failing to stem the losses this time  This trouble reminded me to look at Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   As soon as I saw that CAT had broken down below its 50DMA as well as the June low that found support at the 50DMA  I rushed to fade CAT s meager bounce with a small number of put options  As regular readers know  CAT is my favorite hedge  I really should have been ready with puts a lot earlier   like the day of the breakdown or even the failure to break through recent highs

CAT,2015-07-20,"The construction industry is cyclical  You may think the industry would not produce any consistent dividend stocks  but that s not the case 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  has been paying dividends since 1925  The company has not reduced its dividend payments since 1982  
Caterpillar  CAT  is the construction equipment manufacturing industry leader  The company has grown to reach a market cap of  50 6 billion 
As a large cap stock  Caterpillar divides its operations into 5 smaller segments  Each of the company s 5 segments is listed below along with the percentage of total operating profits generated in Caterpillar s  
Construction Industries generated 33  of total operating income
Resource Industries generated 4  of total operating income
Energy   Transportation generated 44  of total operating income
All Other Manufacturing generated 10  of total operating income
Financial Products generated 10  of total operating income
The construction and energy transportation segments together account for 77  of Caterpillar s operating income  These segments are by far the most important for the company 
Caterpillar s Growth
Caterpillar operates in several highly cyclical industries  As a result  the company s earnings fluctuate wildly from year to year  This makes it impractical to judge the company on growth in any one year 
To gauge Caterpillar s growth  I took the company s average earnings from 2005 through 2009 and compared them to average earnings from 2010 through 2014  Using this  smoothing  technique  Caterpillar has grown earnings per share at 9  a year over the last decade 
The company has grown its dividend payments even faster  Dividends per share have compounded at 12 2  a year over the last decade 
Caterpillar is currently in a  down  phase  The company s expected earnings per share in 2015 are forecasted to be down 46  versus all time earnings per share highs set in 2012  Nevertheless  the company s long term growth prospects remain bright 
Caterpillar is the global leader in the construction and earthmoving equipment industry  The company s earnings are tied to commodity prices  When oil  gas  metal  and mineral prices are high  the company sees massive profits  When commodity prices fall  as has happened recently   the company s earnings fall  With that said  Caterpillar s long term trend earnings trend is upward 
As the global population continues to rise  more construction occurs  and more commodities are needed  Caterpillar s equipment is needed for construction and earthmoving  The company s long term growth drivers remain 
Valuation of Caterpillar Stock
Caterpillar s wildly fluctuating earnings make using the price to earnings ratio a fool s errand for valuing the stock 
Caterpillar s dividend payments are remarkably stable  however  Caterpillar s dividend yield is a good way to identify when is a good time to buy into the stock  The chart below shows Caterpillar s dividend yield over the last 15 years 

As you can see  Caterpillar s yield is higher than it has been since the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009   when the yield absolutely sky rocketed  Now is the best time in the last 5 years to buy Caterpillar stock based on its dividend yield 
Is Caterpillar Stock Safe 
Despite Caterpillar s fluctuating earnings  the company remains profitable  Caterpillar still managed to make  895 million in net profit in 2009  during the depths of the Great Recession 
Caterpillar s earnings per share through the Great Recession and subsequent recovery are shown below to give greater insight into the company s earnings during serious economic downturns 
2007 earnings per share of  5 32
2008 earnings per share of  5 71
2009 earnings per share of  1 43
2010 earnings per share of  4 15
2011 earnings per share of  7 81
Caterpillar carries a significant amount of debt on its books  The company currently has  38 8 billion in debt with an interest coverage ratio of 5 9x  In addition  the company s pension is underfunded  Caterpillar has  17 4 billion in pension assets  but pension obligations of  21 1 billion 
The combination of high debt and an underfunded pension with irregular earnings is not good for safety  I would rather see a highly cyclical business carry less debt than Caterpillar 
With that said  the company is in no danger of bankruptcy  Interest expense  excluding the company s financing segment  was  129 million in Caterpillar s most recent quarter  while operating profit was  1 527 million  The company would have to face a financial crisis significantly worse than the Great Recession to be in any real danger from its debt  The company is safe  but not as safe as many other  more conservatively financed businesses in less cyclical industries 
Final Thoughts
Caterpillar ranks in the top 20  of stocks with 25  years of dividend payments without a reduction  The company s solid earnings per share growth over the last decade combined with an attractive valuation bodes well for shareholders 
In addition  Caterpillar offers investors a dividend yield of 3 7   The company has total return potential well over 10  from its dividend and future growth prospects 
Caterpillar stock is not for the faint of heart  The company s stock has a standard deviation of 33 5  and a beta of 1 2  Caterpillar stock is more volatile than average  The stock is more volatile than average because of its dependence upon commodity prices  Caterpillar makes a good buy for  looking for high yields who are able to withstand volatility ",Ben Reynolds,0.061,0.756,0.183,0.999

CAT,2015-07-23,"Strength Of Steel
On Wednesday I discussed the issues surrounding the Fed s ongoing determination to hike interest rates despite evidence of a weakening economic environment  To wit 

 The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to slow economic growth to keep an economy from overheating which would potentially lead to a sharp rise in inflationary pressures  Since commodities are the basis of everything that is bought  consumed or other utilized  if there were indeed inflationary pressures on the rise commodity prices should be on the rise  As shown  this is clearly not the case  

Wednesday night  the World Steel Association released its  that showed volumes declining to 136 million tons  This is a drop of 2 4  from a year ago 
The decline in steel production  and subsequently the components that go into making steel like iron ore and coking coal  are further evidence that economic activity is far weaker than most analysts currently estimate  This is particularly the case in the U S  where production of crude steel in June fell by 8 5  on an annualized basis 
Furthermore  the crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the 65 countries that the WSA tracks was 72 2  which is 3 5  lower than a year ago 

It is widely believed the Q1 slump in economic activity was simply a weather seasonal adjustment error problem  However  there is mounting evidence from other economically sensitive sectors such as retail sales  manufacturing and commodities that there is more to the story 
Steel production is just the latest clue in the solving that puzzle  however  a look at reports  and charts  of basic material companies have been signaling the decline for quite some time  The latest comes from Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   which once again reported a dismal quarter and even worse forecast 

 While economic conditions in the United States are modestly positive  the global economy remains relatively stagnant  Many of the key industries we serve remain weak  and we haven t seen sustained signs of improvement  Continuing economic weakness in China and Brazil  as well as uncertainty in the Eurozone and over Greece  haven t helped confidence  Prices for commodities like coal  iron ore  and oil are not signaling an improvement in the short term  

As Jim Cramer explains 

 The only conference call you will ever need  is Caterpillar  it is my gospel  my go to call on which many of my decisions are based    I trust Caterpillar s long term vision    it is a superb evaluator of what s happening in each of the countries it sells in and gives you the most thorough description of each economy  


The message is pretty clear 
Extreme Bearish Sentiment In A Bullish Market
I discussed earlier this week that many of the internal measures of the market were clearly deteriorating even though the market itself remained within a bullish trend and close to recent highs 
However  while the market itself remains  bullish  the sentiment of investors  both individual and professional  has not  The chart below shows the composite index of bullish sentiment smoothed with a 4 month average  While bullish sentiment is decidedly  not bullish  currently  this is not necessarily a  bullish  sign  As noted by the blue vertical dashed lines  declines in bullish sentiment from previous extremes have been normally seen just before the onset of a bigger correction 

Combined with the deterioration in underlying momentum  breadth  and trend  the suggestion is that  risk  is elevated  As I stated previously 

 For investors  it is not the time to become complacent or dismissive of market action  While recent price declines have not violated or changed the current bullish trajectory of the market  it does not mean that such will not eventually become the case  

Economists Can t Explain Lack Of Productivity
There was a time when the U S  built stuff  Following WWII  the U S  was a manufacturing powerhouse that built virtually everything the world needed to rebuild itself  After all  the majority of the major global manufacturing centers of the world from Japan to Russia were devastated by the conflict 
Today  however  in the demand by consumers for ever cheaper prices of goods and services  much of the manufacturing has been outsourced to countries with lower costs  In other words  the U S  has been exporting inflation and importing deflation by reducing the cost of products and services consumed by Americans 
While outsourcing has reduced costs  it only partially explains the decline in productivity  The biggest culprit in the decline of productivity has been the rapid acceleration of labor saving technologies  Technological advances in automation  drones  robots  software and hardware have allowed people to do more with less  But wait  that is an increase in productivity  right  Correct 
The problem is that the rise in these technological advances ultimately displace workers  In other words  if one person can now do the work of two or three  then there is in effect less productivity because you have reduced the demand for labor  This goes a long way in explaining the inexorable rise in individuals sitting outside the labor force 

Furthermore  the structural shift in employment from manufacturing to service has also reduced the demand for labor  Service related jobs do not have the same economic multiplier effect that manufacturing related jobs do 
The WSJ recently discussed the perplexing issue surrounding the rise in technology and the fall in productivity 

 U S  productivity  meanwhile  has hit the skids  From 1948 to 1973  it grew at an annual average of 2 8   The rate through the 1980s slowed to half that  even as computers spread through the economy  driving everything from welding robots in auto plants to bank ATMs 
From 1995 to 2004  it finally looked like the digital age was paying off  Productivity growth rates closed in on post World War II highs of near 3   Then average gains fell to 2  from 2005 to 2009  since 2010  they have dipped below 1  
Ms  Yellen  in a speech in May  said that over time  sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising incomes  


Innovation in technology reduces the need for labor  More individuals are sitting outside the labor force increase the demand for available jobs  Increased competition for available jobs suppresses wage growth  It is a virtual spiral that continues to apply downward pressure on an economy based nearly 70  on consumption 
Importantly  what small increases there have been in unit labor costs have primarily come at the expense of higher benefit and healthcare costs rather than an increase in wages  As discussed previously  for roughly 80  of the working labor force  wages have declined over the last five years 
Janet Yellen is right that wages will have a hard time increasing without a pick up in productivity  The issue is that innovation IS the problem  not the solution  That is unless we begin to include the productivity of robots

doubled its workforce to 300 over the past five years to keep up with a booming organic food market  Now it is struggling to hire not just skilled mechanics or electricians but even workers who handle the jars rolling down its conveyer belts  Chelten CEO Steve Dabrow says factory work is becoming a harder sell with unemployment down at a seven year low of 5 3 percent   You re not sitting down  you re standing on your feet all day  you re not taking breaks  and bottles are flying down the line   he said   The Bridgeport  New Jersey  company  which hired 60 people just last year  is not bidding up wages much for anyone save those with very specialist skills because  for now at least  it still manages to fill the vacancies  It has made some strategic capital investments  such as in a more automated new plant in Las Vegas in 2013  but has more recently focused on expanding by taking on additional workers  Like other U S  manufacturers for whom the 2007 2009 recession is fast fading  this company s story of brisk hiring  limited wage hikes  and some capital investment helps illustrate why the otherwise mostly rosy U S  labor market is marred by low wage growth and sinking productivity   Interviews with several heads of small and midsize companies  together with results from employer surveys and data on labor costs  indicate that while companies are prepared to hire more workers  they do not feel the need to raise wages significantly or have the confidence in the economy to make big capital investments  This is good for the job numbers but it is restraining productivity and economic growth   Dabrow and managers at other U S  manufacturing companies say they often need to bring on workers who lack the experience or dedication of those hired in 2009  when U S  unemployment peaked at 10 percent  That means a lot of on the job training and staff turnover that may keep U S  productivity  or output per worker hour  from rebounding quickly from its first back to back quarterly drop since 2006   Graphics       SHY ABOUT SPENDING How soon and how strongly wages and productivity rebound will influence Americans  standard of living  and have a big effect on the inflation rate and economic growth  As a result  it will help the Fed determine whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years in September or later  Fed officials are assuming there will be a rebound in productivity through innovation or investment in labor saving technology like robotics  and that this will boost economic growth to around 2 5 percent next year  They also don t expect the jobless rate to fall much further through the end of this year  But if productivity remains weak it could push the inflation rate higher and lead to a more aggressive policy tightening in the months and years to come   Overall productivity has been disappointing   Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren told Reuters in a recent interview  Manufacturing  where productivity fell by 1 percent in the first quarter compared with 3 1 percent economy wide  should be at the forefront of the expected investment driven bounce  But in a closely watched proxy for investment  shipments from American factories of civilian capital goods other than airplanes rose only 0 6 percent in June from a year earlier  suggesting businesses are still shy about spending on anything beyond hiring  While many industrial giants like  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  have been squeezed by the strong dollar and weak overseas markets  triggering job cuts  smaller U S  firms are in better shape  With less overseas exposure and accounting for 60 percent of job gains since the recession  they are planning to spend and hire more  according to a June survey by the National Federation of Independent Business  For example  Gray Construction CEO Stephen Gray hired 67 people over the past six months to bring the workforce of his Lexington  Kentucky based company up to 375  But he said wage increases were reserved only for the highly skilled workers  who made up about a third of new hires  The company designs  engineers and manages building of factories for the likes of Toyota Motor Corp and Caterpillar  and Gray sees a  green light  for manufacturing until at least 2018 thanks to resilient U S  consumption and  despite recent weakness  productivity that still tops that of

as it was in 2007  and little above the  7 25 an hour federal minimum wage  A measure of employment costs  which also includes health and pension insurance  also stalled in the second quarter  though the weakness was not expected to last  according to economists and policymakers  Tepid wage growth helps explain the productivity slump  says Mark Zandi  chief economist at Moody s Analytics   It s been cheaper for companies to expand by hiring people rather than investing   he said  But once wages start rising  investment and productivity should pick up  he added  D Addario  which makes guitar strings and other musical instrument accessories  reflects the sober views that many manufacturers  have about the economy  The strong dollar forced it to cut prices in its export markets in Europe  Brazil and Australia  Rather than scale back  the Farmingdale  New York based company decided to cut imports of materials to save on shipping costs and to ramp up in house local production  its president John D Addario III said  Faced with growing staff turnover  the company has chosen to lure new workers by stressing the benefits it offers rather than raising wages that start at  9 75 an hour   Some executives simply doubt the world s largest economy can do much better than the 2 3 percent annualized growth it recorded in the second quarter  For the 350 employees of Millerbernd

CAT,2015-08-09,"Forget about a recession  Right now  we re in a full blown global depression  At least  we are if heavy machinery sales are any indication 
I ll explain   
As you can see in this week s chart  the world s largest equipment maker  Caterpillar Inc   NYSE  NYSE CAT   has endured a 31 month stretch of negative sales growth  Compare that to  only  19 months of negative growth during the 2008 financial crisis 
The pullback suggests a lack of new construction   a bad sign for overall economic sentiment  And it isn t just happening here in the States  A 50  drop in Latin American sales coincides with the ongoing collapse of several emerging markets 
It s an eerily familiar story 
During the Great Depression  U S  GDP fell around 30   prompting a halt in construction and mining projects  Industrial production was cut in half  More than 2 million construction jobs vanished  And let s not forget oil prices  In the spring of 1933  the price of heavy crude fell from  0 87 to  0 44 per barrel   or  14 59 to  7 88 in today s prices 
The forces affecting Caterpillar now  Slowing global GDP growth    lulls in mining operations    layoffs due to oil and gas rig closures    and a more than 50  drop in oil prices 
But before you panic  there are some differences 
For example  unemployment rates within the U S  are low   only 5 3   During the height of the Great Depression  unemployment was 25  
Currently in the U S   life expectancy is longer    quality of education and standards of living are higher    working hours per week have decreased    the list goes on and on  So  while Caterpillar may have fallen on hard times  the rest of the country is doing just fine

CAT,2015-08-27,"By Meredith Davis  Reuters    Heavy machinery manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  said it plans a new round of layoffs to cut costs as declining revenues from global mining and construction activities erodes its bottom line  The Peoria  Illinois based company said it notified workers earlier this week it will reduce staff in its customer services support division by cutting 475 jobs  The move comes after the company previously announced about 270 layoffs for Illinois employees   The restructuring is a result of a consolidation of several divisions combined with current business conditions   spokeswoman Lisa Miller said in a written statement   Caterpillar has let go about 4 800 employees over the past year and has cut 20 000 full time employees worldwide since 2012  more than 10 percent of its global workforce   The most recent layoffs will primarily affect employees at facilities around central Illinois  including Peoria and Morton  but will also include some global positions  Miller said   The positions were responsible for supporting after market parts and service and handling customer and dealer support  Miller said  The layoffs are expected to take effect on various dates and some may not be effective for several months  The impacted workers are office personnel and are not union represented employees   In July  the company reported a drop in quarterly profit due to an expected decline in construction revenue on reduced residential building activity in China and Brazil  soft sales related to oil and gas construction in the United States and the strong U S  dollar undercutting the value of sales in Europe

Commentary Buyers managed to stage follow through buying   Incredibly  the S P 500  SPY  is now ABOVE where it closed on Friday and so is UP for the week  Such is the power of a bounce from oversold conditions 

The S P 500  SPY  has gained a whopping 6 2  as its bounce from oversold conditions gets underway

This chart is Exhibit A of why sellers and bears should NEVER chase a market down when it is oversold  such trading is a recipe for whiplash or major losses  Anyone who sold into  is experiencing seller s regret right now  So the pressure turns to the sellers to decide whether to cover and or jump back into the market before  it gets away   Note well  I am NOT saying the market has found its ultimate bottom  Instead  I am speaking from the standpoint of properly managing risks relative to potential gains 
T2108 is still oversold at a close of 15 9   T2108 lags the S P 500 given it has not yet recovered to Friday s close  At the current pace  T2108 could easily exit oversold conditions by Friday s close  Friday should represent an interesting battle between short term traders who want to lock in profits before the uncertainty of the weekend versus bears and sellers who might rush to cover buy fearing that  world peace  over the weekend could send the market gapping up on Monday  At 5 days and running in the oversold period    So  time SHOULD indeed be running out for the oversold period 
Even more importantly  the volatility index  the VIX  hit its next milestone on the downside  The VIX closed below the low of the last major surge  it now sits below the intraday high from 2012 

The volatility index  the VIX  has now lost half its value from the intraday high just three days ago 

This milestone gives the green light to less aggressive traders investors to do some buying  However  the current setup is a great reminder of why I prefer the more aggressive strategy  Being aggressive can deliver better risk reward setups  By buying on volatility spikes to new highs  I very quickly nailed an extremely high profit opportunity on this upswing  Traders and investors buying here face the very real risk of a natural pullback  The S P 500 is up 6 2  in just two days   even a 3  pullback over a few days would be quite normal 
This pullback risk increases for traders investors who follow the  conservative  strategy of waiting until the oversold period ends to do some buying  Granted  my early analysis of drawdowns for different strategies showed that the less aggressive strategies effectively limited big drawdowns  This cap on losses comes at the  cost  of more limited upside as well 
I am going to call Friday a  toss up  day  so no individual stock charts  I will reload chart this weekend  There are many good ones   Here is a quick summary of the trades I did  added to Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  put options as a SMALL hedge  locked in more profits on ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  call options  sold AAPL call options for a nice profit  sold NFLX call options for an even better profit  and restarted a  strangle  on iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  which features out of the money put and call options  I have discussed the strategy on EEM in several earlier posts  I have yet to capture gains on both sides of the trade  but I have consistently been able to log large enough gains on one side  mainly the put side   to more than pay for the losing side  I fully expect more major moves ahead for EEM 
The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  made its own important milestone  it closed above its 200DMA  This technically makes it a screaming buy  IBB is one of my biggest misses during the panic earlier this week  I did buy a call option last Friday  but it will likely expire tomorrow  August 28th  worthless   When I finalaly get my short term timing right on IBB  it will be huge   

The healing for iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  has arrived in the form of a solid close above the 200DMA upward trendline 
Finally  I want to demonstrate why it is important to follow currency markets during times of stress like this one 

Anyway  check out the very tight correlation between AUD JPY and the S P 500  I included an overlay  blue  of EUR USD for comparison  While the euro is behaving inversely to the S P 500  it is not as tightly related as AUD JPY  The euro s inverse relationship will only last as long as traders are closing out carry trades  I have to believe they are almost finished at this point 
The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  topped out ahead of the S P 500   it was only a matter of time before the index topped as well  The subsequent plunge was supported by the sudden drop in AUD JPY Daily T2108 vs the S P 500

Commentary The upcoming and much anticipated U S  jobs report could completely alter the technical landscape  so I am keeping this T2108 Update short and sweet   I know   finally   
T2108 closed at 16 7  for a 10th straight day in oversold territory  Of 66 oversold periods since 1986  only 11  17   have lasted longer 

Given this stretch of time  it is only natural that T2108 continues to make moves to breakout and end the oversold period  Today  T2108 traded as high as 19 99  which is  01 percentage point away rom the oversold threshold   I just cannot make this stuff up T2108 knocks on the exit gate of a historic oversold period
T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200 day moving averages  DMAs   also rose right to an important exit gate  a higher high that could have started an uptrend from recent lows T2107 ALMOST punches out a higher high that could have confirmed the choppy rise from recent lows 
At least the volatility index  the VIX  followed through on the topping action I pointed out in  The volatility index  the VIX  is now notably losing momentum as two topping patterns have received confirmation 
Note that the VIX remains elevated  so traders should continue to expect choppy markets  I am still expecting the VIX to remain elevated  say above 20  going into the Federal Reserve s rate decision on September 17 
Finally  the United States Oil Fund  USO  made another attempt to break from resistance defined by the downward sloping 50DMA  Another decline in its volatility measure  the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index  OVX   increases the odds that the breakout will happen soon  My question  are higher oil prices good or bad for a fragile global economy  The United States Oil Fund  USO  attempts to break out from its downtrend now defined by the 50DMA
Given elevated volatility and lots of hand wringing over what the Fed will do this month  I expect a major battle of interpretations in the wake of the U S  jobs report no matter what the numbers say  I fully expect Friday s post jobs trading to represent a microcosm of the larger day to day chop of this oversold period  With a long weekend ahead  those with short term profits will likely look to lock those in  Those who continue to fear what the future holds will likely look to bail at an opportune time to stay  safe  over the extended time away from the market

Commentary
One of the many urban legends on Wall Street involves trading after the U S  Labor Day holiday  Supposedly  traders and major investors take the summer off  commonly defined as the period between Memorial Day in late May and Labor Day in early September  During this period  liquidity is poor and the market gyrates aimlessly and unprofitably  Once the big guys  the  serious money   return after Labor Day  we get a true feel for the market s inclinations  I last  on this trade way back in 2007 on my old site  so it is due for a SERIOUS update  Here are the most relevant conclusions from that time 
The performance of the S P 500 for the year up to Labor Day is very highly correlated with the year over year performance of the index  In other words  if the S P 500 is positive for the year up to Labor Day  then we are almost guaranteed to have an up year overall  This correlation is far more important than the daily trade the day following Labor Day 
The relationship of the one day post Labor Day gains to other time periods of the year has been remarkably consistent throughout 44 year sample 
The market tends to perform better over time than the single day trade on the day following Labor Day  Of course  the longer the time frame  the more likely performance will exceed that of any given day 
In other words  I did discover enough evidence to indicate that Labor Day is some kind of important marker  If point  1 holds  2015 will end as a rare post crisis down year  The current breakdown in the S P 500  via the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   seems severe enough to at least prevent the index from notching a new all time high this year 

A close up of the S P 500 s severe breakdown
The S P 500 ended trading Friday with a loss of 1 5  in the wake of the U S  jobs report for August  I do not think it definitively resolved the debate over the timing of the Fed s lift off for rates  Regardless  for anyone who actually took a break from the financial markets over the summer  in this day and age of full and ubiquitous connectivity  I am highly doubtful any serious manager of money takes summers completely off   s he either will return to the desk on Tuesday morning in a panic ready to sell or will jump up in excitement at all the  bargains  that abound  This stylized characterization of market participants could define the battle lines of the week as the countdown to what I will now call  Fedaggedon   Fed   Armageddon   a play on the now often used Armageddon apocalypse meme attached to the dramas of the modern age  officially counts down through its most anxious moments 
The jobs news sure did not do anything for the current oversold period  T2108 declined back to 14 3  and extended the oversold period to 11 days  If the oversold period does not end this week  T2108 will enter VERY rarefied territory  Given the extended angst over the Fed s decision next week Fedaggedon I am now fully braced for the prospect of the oversold period lasting until the Fed issues its judgement 

The majority of oversold periods last one or two days
Volatility ended the week right on the edge of the  danger zone   If the oversold period languishes on  I fully expect volatility to get fresh life  I will continue to favor fading volatility during this oversold period  ESPECIALLY ahead of the Fed meeting 

The volatility index  the VIX  has cooled off significantly from the flash crash  but has not yet decisively dropped from the  danger zone   I define this zone as starting from the low of the last day where volatility experienced a significant surge 
Here are my trading highlights from Friday  another  slow  day given T2108 trading rules did not trigger  sold last round of Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  puts at a modest profit and watched an earlier batch expire worthless   I will continue to look for opportunities to fade CAT as a small hedge against longs  a limit order to buy a small number ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  call options triggered  bought shares in Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X ETF  NYSE ERY  as a 2 for 1 hedge on market longs AND a bet that oil will weaken going into the Fed meeting  I am saving bets against oil for later in case oil surprises me and trades higher this week   and doubled down on a current short term bet against volatility with put options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY

The scandal unfolding at Volkswagen  XETRA VOWG  Group around its pollution control systems may be the largest case of its kind in the U S   but it s far from the first  Environmental regulators in recent decades have launched more than a dozen cases against automakers  accusing them of tweaking or outfitting diesel engines to outsmart pollution tests meant to improve air quality  The result is thousands of recalled or upgraded vehicles    and millions of tons of toxic air particles spewing into the air 
Volkswagen was one of the first car companies to pay penalties for using pollution  defeat devices  after the 1970 Clean Air Act took root  In 1973  the automaker  based in what was then West Germany  told the Environmental Protection Agency that it sold around 25 000 vehicles equipped with devices that overrode the cars  emissions control systems  Volkswagen settled with the EPA and the U S  Justice Department in 1974  agreeing to pay  120 000 in penalties    or  644 000 in today s dollars    and update future models of its cars 
The four decade old penalty pales in comparison to what Volkswagen is facing today  The company admitted Tuesday that 11 million of its diesel powered cars were programmed to cheat EPA emissions tests by faking levels of the pollutants they produce  If each car is found to violate the Clean Air Act  Volkswagen could face penalties of  18 billion  EPA officials said  That s about six times the largest existing Clean Air Act penalty  Hyundai and Kia in November agreed to pay a combined  300 million as part of a settlement for overstating vehicle fuel economy standards on 1 2 million cars 
Volkswagen Group CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned Wednesday amid the cheating debacle  accepting responsibility for the  irregularities  found in the diesel engines   I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group   he said in a statement 

The history of charges and settlements involving defeat devices points to a recurring problem facing clean air agencies and the car companies they regulate  Auto safety experts say they re worried such devices could become more common as regulators tighten rules for tailpipe emissions and the computers in vehicles grow more sophisticated 
 The modern automobile is now many multiple computers on wheels  If you can use computer programs to generate your defeat device  they re much harder to detect   said Clarence Ditlow  executive director of the Center for Auto Safety  a Washington lobbying group 
Overriding emissions control systems can improve speed and smooth handling in cars  The trade off is an uptick in emissions of nitrogen oxide  carbon monoxide and particulate matter  which contribute to ozone pollution  soot and dust  Air pollution can cause serious lung  and heart related illnesses  including asthma  bronchitis and heart attacks  About 44 percent of the U S  population  or 138 5 million people  live in areas where pollution levels are often too dangerous to breathe  the American Lung Association reported this year 
 It s a violation that hits at the heart of public health   said Rena Steinzor  an environmental law expert and professor at the University of Maryland s law school   In some attenuated and slow way  it actually kills people  
The EPA said Volkswagen used defeat devices in four cylinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars from model years 2009 and 2015  which may have emitted as much as 40 times the legal limit of pollutants when they were on the road  Volkswagen officials said they are cooperating with the EPA investigation  The Justice Department also is investigating the company for possible criminal violations 
The latest Volkswagen scandal involved manipulating the vehicles  software  so that cars would filter pollution when subject to testing  but not run emissions controls when on the road  In 1973  the process was much simpler  In certain vehicles  Volkswagen used temperature sensing switches that activated the engine s emissions controls when it reached between 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit    the standard temperature for test conditions    but shut down when engine temperature hit above or below that range  according to a July 1973 letter signed by William Ruckelshaus  then the EPA administrator 

Around the same time  Chrysler agreed to recall and correct pollution control systems on 826 000 cars and light trucks after the EPA learned of similar temperature sensing devices in the vehicles  radiators  EPA officials said  virtually all  the company s cars emitted nitrogen oxide at levels  considerably above the federal emission standard   according to a 1974 news report  The recall cost Chrysler around  4 1 million  or  20 million today when adjusted for inflation 
By the 1990s  devices to sidestep emissions control systems were getting smarter  according to EPA complaints 
General Motors Co  NYSE GM   in 1991 designed an engine control computer chip and installed it in 500 000 Cadillacs  The device was meant to reduce problems with engines stalling  but it also nearly tripled the output of carbon monoxide when the cars  heating and cooling systems were running  officials said in 1995  The EPA and Justice Department settled with GM that year for  45 million 
The largest case landed three years later  when the EPA reached a  1 billion settlement with seven diesel truck manufacturers    including  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT    Mack Trucks Inc  and Volvo Truck Corp     for installing equipment that defeated emissions controls  At the time in 1998  it was the largest U S  civil penalty for violating environmental law  the EPA said 
 The diesel engine industry has illegally poured millions of tons of pollution into the air   Janet Reno  then the U S  attorney general  said in a 1998 statement   These companies needlessly cost themselves millions of extra dollars by not complying with the law in the first place  Today s settlement shows that an ounce of compliance is worth a pound of penalties  
That same year  the EPA settled smaller cases with American Honda Motor Co  and Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  Honda was found to have disabled the misfire monitoring device on 1 6 million cars  depriving emission control inspectors of pollution data  and settled with EPA for  267 million  With Ford  officials found that 60 000 Econoline vans allowed for excessive pollution at highway speeds  resulting in a  7 8 million settlement 
Ditlow  the auto safety expert  said he believes automakers could continue to install defeat devices    even in the wake of Volkswagen s scandal    unless federal officials take criminal action against Volkswagen executives 
 The single best way to change corporate behavior is to send the responsible executives to jail   he said   Volkswagen is the ultimate test for whether regulators are going to hold auto companies responsible  ",International Business Times,0.123,0.799,0.078,-0.9958
CAT,2015-09-24,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  business investment fell slightly in August  excluding spending on aircraft and defense equipment  but new home sales rose  suggesting that global economic headwinds were doing little to impede U S  growth 
The U S  economy is on track to grow 1 4 percent in the third quarter  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow forecast model showed on Thursday 
The Commerce Department said capital goods orders excluding military wares and aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  dropped 0 2 percent last month  a slightly bigger fall than analysts polled by Reuters had expected 
However  August s decline followed a gain in July that was the largest in over a year and which had boosted optimism that many American companies were unfazed by weak overseas markets 
The recent trend in orders gives a good signal for economic growth in the third quarter after business investment on equipment fell in the April June period 
 Investment in equipment appears to be recovering   said Paul Ashworth  an economist for Capital Economics 
Durable goods orders overall fell 2 0 percent in August  in line with forecasts  but held back by a sharp decline in orders for civilian aircraft  Excluding transportation  orders were little changed 
Some business sectors are being hit by falling commodity prices though  with  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  saying it might close or consolidate more than 20 plants around the world across its three large businesses   construction  resources  and energy and transportation 
Caterpillar Inc cut its 2015 revenue forecast and said it could cut up to 10 000 jobs through 2018  on Thursday joining a list of big U S  industrial companies grappling with the shock waves from the mining and energy downturn 
U S  stock prices were lower in afternoon trading on Thursday  weighed down by a 6 0 percent fall in the shares of Caterpillar  the world s biggest mining and construction equipment maker   N 
Other economic data on Thursday showed that robust job growth over the last year has helped the country s housing market  which took a big hit in the 2007 09 recession 
A separate report from the U S  Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 3 000 to a seasonally adjusted 267 000 for the week ended Sept  19  Analysts had expected new claims to rise more 
The four week moving average of jobless claims fell by 750 to 271 750  which was close to its lowest level since 2000 and suggests the job market continues to strengthen 
The trend in jobless claims continues to give bullish signs on the health of the U S  labor market  which is critical for the Federal Reserve s plans to lift interest rates as soon as this year 
Other U S  economic data on Thursday showed new home sales in August surged 5 7 percent to an annual pace of 552 000 or the highest level since 2008  The gain was much larger than analysts had expected and came on the back of a strong revision in the pace of sales during July 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week that the Fed declined to raise interest rates in September in part because of concerns that weakness in China s economy could slow global economic growth  but there is little sign of an appreciable U S  slowdown yet

CAT,2015-09-24,"Investing com   Asian shares were mixed on Friday and mostly lower after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that an interest rate hike this year is still very much on the cards 
The Hang Seng index was down 0 17   while the Shanghai Composite added 0 86  ad the S P ASX 200 eased 0 47   The Nikkei 225 was down 0 06  
Yellen said she anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise short term interest rates by the end of the year 
In prepared remarks for a speech at the University of Massachussetts Amherst  Yellen emphasized that most of her colleagues will likely support raising the target range for the Federal Funds Rate at some point this year  Yellen s stance represents a stark contrast from her position last week when the FOMC only disclosed that 13 of 17 of its members were in favor of raising rates this year  Yellen had not personally associated herself with a rate hike since July 
Following the FOMC s July meeting  China rattled global markets by devaluing the yuan in an effort to stimulate its flagging economy  Earlier this week  a preliminary reading of China s factory activity in September slumped to its lowest level in more than six years

For near term growth prospects  the government repeated its warning about sluggish growth in Asian emerging market economies caused by the recent Chinese slowdown 
In its monthly report for September  the government continued to say the domestic economy is on a  moderate recovery  trend but noted it has some soft spots  consumer spending is sluggish  exports are weak and business sentiment is flat 
In an unprecedented move  the government declined to say officially in its report whether it is downgrading its view 
But Yutaka Murayama  director of macro economic analysis at the Cabinet Office  told reporters the overall judgment is  weaker than last month  and  closer to a downgrade   He said he would not deny it is a  de facto downgrade  
 The slowness in some areas we noted in the report refers to the disappointing pace of improvement in the positive economic growth mechanism as seen in consumption and business investment   Murayama said  But he added that the expression  slowness  is less negative than the term  weakness  used last year to describe the slump caused by the April 2014 sales tax hike

CAT,2015-09-25,"European markets are set to open higher this morning after facing an extremely volatile week  The turbulence in the market was as high as it could be and the reason behind this was the same old global growth concerns  Throughout this week  there wasn t any particular sector under which investors could find shelter  but surely the stocks which are green on the red day are the most attractive ones to buy  The Dax index has kissed the lows which we experienced during the last month  as investors are still not comfortable in holding riskier assets  The upward trend line remains the focus and the key support level of 9300 has a significant importance amid investors 
This morning s optimism among investors is mainly due to the last night s speech by Janet Yellen  She maintained the same dovish stance  Investors are certainly cheering the news that she hasn t picked up a particular set date to raise the interest rate  but she did balance her dovish tone by adding that the rate hike is still a possibility later this year 
If the U S  is hiking the rates on the basis that its economy is solid and the Fed are confident in their approach  then surely raising the interest rate should be a good news  But  the fact is that the U S  manufacturing sector is showing some serious sign of cracks and this worries the most  For instance  companies are not feeling to beef up their balance sheet with more funds to stimulate the growth  but rather they are already cutting the jobs to protect their dividends  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  is a primary example of this  The firm is protecting its balance sheet from further dents and wants to keep its investors happy by maintaining its dividend  but given the growth  climate  they have no other option but to reduce their cost by cutting jobs 
There is nothing new in this that the U S  Federal reserve will be increasing the rates when most of the major central banks around the world will still be maintaining their positions to cut the interest rates further to stimulate the economy  but just how much impact will this have on the mighty dollar  no one can surely say and this is another factor for the fed to take under consideration before they do actually raise the interest rates  Inflation is one of the major pillars of the Fed policy  and given that the inflation expectations are at nearly over six years low  it makes the fed position even more challenging 
The economic docket still has some firecracker left for this week  We have the final reading for the U S  Q2 GDP and the forecast is for 3 7   a number which may lift the investor appetite for risk  But it is important to understand that what matters the most is the present condition of the economy if you want to gauge the future prospects and the Q2 GDP may not add that much of positive sentiment to the investor s risk equation

CAT,2015-09-26,"  I expect that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on inflation wane  provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete the return to maximum employment and long run inflation expectations remain well anchored  Most FOMC participants  including myself  currently anticipate that achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year  followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter  But if the economy surprises us  our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change     Chair Janet Yellen in     September 24  2015  at the Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture  University of Massachusetts  Amherst  Amherst  Massachusetts

Let there be no doubt  the Federal Reserve WANTS to start hiking rates before 2015 ends  The quote above should clarify her position on timing as well as the Fed s general bias to start hiking rates  These words were necessary because the Fed got the wrong market outcome from its September meeting 
The market s  to the rate inaction of the September Fed meeting pushed the odds of the first rate hike out all the way   The Fed must now tease  cajole  and even exhort the market into bringing expectations back to 2015  To this end  I am expecting follow up speeches and utterances from Fed members to better align with Yellen s approach 
The calculus for the timing of the first rate hike  and likely for subsequent rate hikes  is relatively simple 
The Fed does not want to surprise financial markets given the fragility of global macroeconomic conditions  A surprise has the strong potential for generating undesirable instability 
The Fed will hike exactly when the market expects it to hike 
The Fed must convince markets to price in odds for a hike when the Fed wants to hike in order to avoid  1 
Everything the Fed has done this year is consistent with this calculus  The Fed went into its September meeting with a market unprepared for a hike based on the 30 Day Fed Fund futures prices  The Fed HAD to point to China and global economic conditions as reasons to further delay a first rate hike because the market had already assumed these conditions made a September hike extremely unlikely 
Going into the September meeting  I marveled at the persistence of the pundits and economists who preferred to ignore market reality and stick to their own personal beliefs and assessments of what the Fed will do  I suspect these same people will continue to miss the intertwined dynamic between the Fed and the market as we go into the first rate hike  This disconnect spells opportunity  The opportunity in the immediate wake of the September meeting was to fade commodity and related  risk on  plays that rallied for a short spell 
So far  Yellen s efforts have already started to pay off just barely  The market has brought in the odds for the first hike back to January  2016  50 50  

The market now assigns 50  odds to a first rate hike at the January  2016 meeting

Valuations Dive Again Due To China Commodities Worries
ValuEngine tracks more than 7000 US equities  ADRs  and foreign stock which trade on US exchanges as well as  1000 Canadian equities  When EPS estimates are available for a given equity  our model calculates a level of mispricing or valuation percentage for that equity based on earnings estimates and what the stock should be worth if the market were totally rational and efficient  an academic exercise to be sure  but one which allows for useful comparisons between equities  sectors  and industries  Using our Valuation Model  we can currently assign a VE valuation calculation to more than 2800 stocks in our US Universe 
We combine all of the equities with a valuation calculation to track market valuation figures and use them as a metric for making calls about the overall state of the market  Two factors can lower these figures   a market pullback  or a significant rise in EPS estimates  Vice versa  a significant rally or reduction in EPS can raise the figure  Whenever we see overvaluation levels in excess of 65  for the overall universe and or 27  for the overvalued by 20  or more categories  we issue a valuation warning 
We now calculate that less than a third of the stocks we can assign a valuation are overvalued  31 7   and just 9 89  of those stocks are overvalued by 20  or more  These figures continue to fluctuate  and of late they are stuck below the 40  we consider to be  normal  
We did our last valuation study on August 18th  and since then we have seen a market slide and lots of volatility with the S P dropping from 2100 down to the 1800 2000 range  This pull back was initially driven by the Chinese sell off and currency devaluation  Since then  we have found shock waves from that drop and related events impacting equity pricing across the globe 
We saw one day with levels this low near the end of August  but prior to that  you would have to go back to mid November 2012  to find overvaluation levels below 30   At that time  the S P 500 was at 1353  So  from our perspective  with the market now at 1883 or so as of this writing  stocks are  cheap  and oversold  But the market is always right  so what we think does not trump that trend 
In addition  we now have the recent FOMC decision to leave short term rates unchanged to consider  Fed officials noted that turmoil in China and other emerging markets may have a negative spillover effect for the underlying US economy  Indeed  as we have noted lately  news from companies such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  indicates a global slow down  Anything dealing with global commodities and construction can play a role 
And  to throw in random events  seemingly unrelated  you had the bone headed greed of a pharrma CEO and the shady practices of an auto giant causing turmoil in bio tech and the auto industry and more selling 
But  as always  we note a stronger US economy  with the labor situation improving by the day  some upward wage pressures  continued recovery for housing  a strong rental market  decent auto sales  but probably NOT for VW  OTC VLKPY  moving forward    etc  US equities remain standing as the last bastion of decent yield for scared investors the world over 
What we fear more now is some sort of additional austerity measures from misguided right wing politicians in Washington DC  Or  a Fed that raises rates not in relation to its twin mandate  control inflation and ensure full employment  but as some sort of sop to some bankers  who want a rate increase for their own needs  or to  send a message  that rates can be raised merely because the economy is strong enough to absorb an increase 
This is not what the Fed is supposed to be about  And hitting the brakes right now  in the face of the Chinese issues and other emerging market concerns vis a vis commodities and such  makes no sense  We believe the market slide will be temporary  driven by events over seas  not any sort of underlying weakness in the US economy  But  we live in an ever more interdependent world  One cannot ignore events overseas  But  one also should realize that our models see a buying opportunity here  That does not mean things cannot decline further  just that from their perspective equities are far cheaper than they were over much of the past three years

CAT,2015-10-22,"Investing com   Global construction equipment manufacturer  Caterpillar   N CAT  saw shares fall in pre market trade on Thursday after reporting weaker than expected third quarter earnings 
Caterpillar said earnings per share was 75 cents in the three months ended September 30  below expectations for earnings of 77 cents per share 
Including restructuring costs  profit per share was 62 cents  a decrease from  1 63 per share in the third quarter of 2014 
The company s third quarter revenue totaled  11 0 billion  missing forecasts for revenue of  11 3 billion and down 19 1  from sales of  13 5 billion in the third quarter of 2014 
 The environment remains extremely challenging for most of the key industries we serve  with sales and revenues down 19 percent from the third quarter last year   said Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman     
The 2015 outlook for sales and revenues is about  48 billion  unchanged from the outlook that was included with the September 24 announcement of new restructuring actions  The outlook for profit per share is about  3 70  or  4 60 excluding restructuring costs 
Sales and revenues for 2016 are expected to be about 5  below 2015  The preliminary outlook reflects weak economic growth in the United States and Europe with U S  construction activity impacted by low infrastructure investment and continued headwinds from oil and gas

CAT,2015-10-23,"The vast majority of U S  stocks began to form a broad  rolling top back in November 2014  Historic price volatility has marked the months since then  as the world s major central bankers have intervened with verbal or monetary support whenever market prices threatened an uncomfortable decline  Slowing economic fundamentals  however  limited subsequent rallies to the area of prior trading ranges  The S P 500 peaked in May at 2134  In mid August  prices broke support dramatically with the widely watched Dow Jones Industrials plummeting by more than 2200 points in just four trading sessions  taking prices back to the levels of May 2013  More frenetic volatility characterized the remainder of the quarter  with the S P 500 shedding 6 4  over the full three month period and registering a 5 3  loss for the year to date 
Notwithstanding still abundant central bank stimulus  most world markets have been weaker than those in the U S  Even after the rally that opened the fourth quarter  the vast majority of world markets remain down for the year and virtually all are trading beneath their 200 day moving averages  It was striking to note at quarter end that the MSCI All Country World Index  excluding the U S   was at the same level as in March 2000  despite the powerful market rally since 2009  Longstanding Mission clients may well remember our counsel as we entered the new century that we were likely entering a long weak cycle that could last for two decades  It remains highly likely that the U S  and the rest of the world will ultimately see stock prices below their March 2000 levels before this long weak cycle ends 
In my September 8 blog  Worldwide Bear Market  Probably   I outlined numerous reasons why it is probable that a significant bear market has begun  Fundamental as well as technical conditions continue to point to the same conclusion 
The domestic and world economies are weak and weakening  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund have both recently lowered their U S  and global economic forecasts  The IMF believes there to be a 50  chance of global growth declining below 3  next year    equivalent to a global recession   Citigroup s research team raised the odds of such a global recession to 55   Former Treasury Secretary and ex presidential economic advisor Larry Summers describes the danger facing the global economy as more severe than at any time since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008  He makes his case for no near term rate rise by stating that many industrialized economies are barely running above stall speed and can ill afford a negative global shock  He sees monetary policymakers lacking the tools to respond if a recession were to unfold 
The weak macro picture is compounded by erosion at the micro level as well  Third quarter corporate earnings are expected to decline year over year  and early reporting companies are offering weak forward guidance  Goldman Sachs  N GS  recently warned that deterioration of balance sheet health is  increasingly alarming  and will only worsen if earnings growth continues to stall amid a global economic slowdown  According to Bloomberg  corporations have loaded up on debt  In the aggregate they owe more interest than ever before  with interest coverage at its lowest since 2009  Major corporations such as Hewlett Packard  N HPQ   Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   Caterpillar  N CAT  and Halliburton  N HAL  have all recently announced intentions to lay off many thousands of employees  Such announcements are likely to multiply 
Since the end of the 1990s  I have pointed to excessive debt as the primary threat to the domestic and world economies  The debt problem is so severe that seven years of unprecedented central bank stimulus has failed to promote growth even approximating the historic norm  Growth of real per capita U S  GDP is less than half the normal growth over the past two centuries  To promote even that meager result  the Fed has built a balance sheet debt mountain more than four times what it was just seven years ago  Following the Fed s lead  other central bankers have similarly attempted to boost their economies on the back of more debt  In the last two decades  overall worldwide debt has grown from  40 trillion in 1995 to  200 trillion last year  while global GDP grew by a far more modest  45 trillion over the same years  Worldwide debt now far exceeds the 2007 crisis level  As became clear in the 1920s and 1930s  when all major economies face severe debt overhangs  no single country can serve as the world s engine of growth  It s an environment that spawned destructive currency wars in the 1930s  and we are seeing the early signs of such beggar thy neighbor policies today  History demonstrates clearly that there is no easy escape from extreme debt levels 
All debt  of course  is not created equal  In a zero interest rate environment  desperate investors hunt far and wide for yield  In recent years  vast amounts of relatively free borrowed money found its way into emerging economies  When money is essentially free  massive misallocations are likely with serious mispricing of risk assets  Emerging markets have experienced huge asset inflation despite commodity disinflation  With the prospect of rising U S  interest rates making those investments more expensive  hundreds of billions of dollars have been fleeing those emerging economies in recent months  Very likely  banks have lent trillions that will never be repaid  Defaulted loans obviously penalize both debtors and creditors  and widespread defaults can spiral into a worldwide crisis 
Further complicating life for investors is the second factor that contributed greatly to both of this century s stock market crashes   extreme overvaluation  TV s talking heads continually refer to current valuation levels as  fair  or  not too bad   While valuations are not as extreme as those of the dot com mania at the turn of the century  any honest evaluation of a broad array of the most commonly used measures of value shows stocks to be selling at or above the levels at the 2007 market peak and all other market highs throughout U S  history but for the 2000 fantasy level from which prices were more than cut in half over the next two and a half years  The valuation work of such renowned market historians as Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller  John Hussman and Jeremy Grantham point to probable annualized equity returns over the next 10 to 12 years ranging from negative to positive by very low single digits  Intermittent serious declines are highly probable 
Despite seriously deteriorating economic and corporate conditions  stocks have rallied off the September 29 price lows  In fact  the deteriorating conditions  both here and throughout most of the world  seem to have emboldened stock traders  European and Japanese central bankers remain committed to Quantitative Easing  Negative economic and market conditions appear to have the Federal Reserve afraid to raise short term interest rates even to a minimal 0 25   The IMF and others are counseling the Fed to delay any rate rise at least until 2016  some warning of panic in emerging markets with any rate increase  Cherishing the fuel of free money  traders have taken the perverse position that bad news is good news  Some of the recent rally s strongest days have accompanied the worst economic announcements  Traders apparently value the medicine more than they fear the disease  While there is no way to know how long such a condition can prevail  we can maintain with certainty that it cannot continue indefinitely  Markets are left vulnerable to severe declines even panics like the 1100 Dow point decline on August 24  The most profound danger is that investors lose confidence in central bankers remaining willing and able to keep market prices elevated  The 50  and 57  stock market declines in the earlier years of this century both unfolded despite aggressive attempts by the Fed to support the economy and markets  The Fed doesn t always win  and we remain firmly convinced that it s just a matter of time before investor confidence in the Fed wanes again  For now  however  traders appear ready to celebrate the prospect of more free money  no matter how severe the underlying conditions necessitating such rescue efforts 
Nevertheless  the potential for a more significant near term market decline has increased  In the U S   the quality of market rallies over the last several quarters has weakened  Fewer stocks are rising and  at quarter end  more than half of all U S  stocks were down more than 20  from their recent highs  Only 37  of common stocks are trading above their individual 200 day moving averages  Trading volume is increasingly concentrated in declining stocks  and the internal characteristics of the current rally are far weaker than those in 2010 and 2011 that both eventually led to new price highs  It looks far less likely that the current rally will see prices move back to earlier highs 
Traditional investment alternatives are similarly not very attractive  Thanks to Fed policy  risk free returns remain near zero  Investment quality fixed income securities continue to trade near historic low yields  At current levels  a mere 50 basis point rise in rates would create a negative full year return on a 10 year U S  Treasury note 
With debt levels as elevated as they are both here and abroad severe accidents can happen  Maintaining a portfolio with a traditional asset allocation is a bet that serious accidents will not happen  despite conditions that have historically penalized portfolios  Mission has long believed that a more flexible  strategically allocated portfolio will better protect and grow assets in such a highly uncertain environment ",Thomas J.

Caterpillar Inc  N CAT   last week reduced its profit forecast  citing weak demand for its heavy equipment  and 3M Co   N MMM   whose products range from kitchen sponges to adhesives used in automobiles  said it would lay off 1 500 employees  or 1 7  of its total  as sales growth sagged for a wide range of wares 
The weakness is overshadowing pockets of growth in sectors such as aerospace and technology 
Profit and revenue are falling in tandem for the first time in six years  with a third of S P 500 companies reporting so far  Analysts expect the index s companies to book a 2 8  decline in per share earnings from last year s third quarter  according to Thomson Reuters

CAT,2015-11-04,"Stocks soar as sales and earnings slow 
You tell me   how long can that last 
S P 500 companies continue to report third quarter earnings  And it looks as though sales and earnings are set to decline 
While sales have declined the past two quarters  we haven t seen both sales and earnings decline since the third quarter of 2009 
Can t have that  In today s economy  slowdowns aren t an option  If a problem arises  central banks just whack it with more stimulus 
So as signs of more stimulus emerge in China and Europe   sure enough  stocks continue to rally  Bad news continues to be good news for the market on crack

That s from Daniel Florness  the CFO of industrial distributor Fastenal Company  O FAST   Meanwhile  businesses from Caterpillar  N CAT  to Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  keep lowering estimates 
Here s that chart 

The worst results continue to come from the energy  manufacturing and basic materials sectors  The explanation has been that since China is slowing  commodities are suffering  which hurts emerging countries too  And the rising dollar and falling oil prices are hurting U S  exporters 
So the energy sector is expected to see sales drop by a third and profits by nearly two thirds  versus the third quarter last year 
That s at oil near  50 
What if it hits my target of  10 to  20 
We also saw the jobs data come in weaker than expected in August and September

Private sector jobs have gone from highs of near one million on a three month change in late 2014  to 0 4 million in September 
Said another way  from 320 000 jobs a month to just 135 000 
Some of the private sector decline has been masked in the broader jobs numbers  While the private sector has been cutting back  government jobs went up from near zero to 90 000  Government  always there to lend a helping hand 
Things are not okay  Central banks do not have the situation under control 
We ve been warning about the overbuilding and collapse of China  falling commodity prices  and slowing emerging countries  for years  It s finally getting serious 
Most analysts think the U S  economy is OK outside of these dollar and global slowdown factors 
But here s a few thing they don t see coming  happening this next year 
They don t see the slowdown of the affluent sector  wherein the top 20  control over 50  of income and spending  This group peaks at age 54   that s this year   and they hold almost all of the bubbled up financial assets like stocks  That s where QE has had its impact   not on Homer Simpson 
Analysts also don t see that car sales  which have been strong up to this point  will lead the downturn in 2016 as they also peak with that affluent sector at age 54 
Then there s the continued slowdown in China   the world s second largest economy  That country will begin a hard landing at some point in the next year  Its stock bubble has been the first to begin crashing   and it is crashing  No doubt about it  Its economy and real estate can t be far behind 
Finally  there s Mother Germany   Europe s economic powerhouse   who has the worst demographic trends in the world through 2022  Like China  they ll begin to slow much more in the next year  And the fact that it has to take care of one million plus refugees doesn t help 
I promise you   the slowing we are beginning to see  this third quarter especially  is just the beginning of a much larger trend  One that I believe will see its worst between early 2016 and 2017 
And it s one thing for stocks to go up when earnings are just slowing  But when they re declining  That s another case  ladies

More People   More Infrastructure
Infrastructure includes roads  bridges and tunnels  oil and gas projects  pipelines  cable networks  radio masts and satellites  airports and seaports  power plants  railways  subways  and water supply and treatment facilities 
As people have moved from rural areas to cities  the pressures on infrastructure have greatly intensified  In 1980  39  of the world s population lived in cities 
Now  more than half live in major cities  and this figure is expected to rise to 67  by 2050  according to a United Nations forecast 
To further put the pace of this growth into perspective  in 1979 there were only three cities in the world with a population over 10 million  In 2015  there are 23 cities with such populations  18 of which are in emerging markets 
Asia is already home to seven of the world s 10 largest megacities 
Amazingly  China has over 100 cities with a population exceeding one million  and every week  one million people are either born in or migrate to cities around the world  
Growth Poised to Explode
Along with this urbanization comes stronger economic growth and expanded international trade 
This means that unless these countries build more airports  roads  subways  power plants  railways  seaports  and pipelines  they will literally choke on their growth 
Morgan Stanley predicts that  22 trillion will be spent on these projects over the next decade  This includes communications infrastructure  such as mobile telecommunications and cable providers 
Here are some more interesting facts that highlight the global infrastructure challenge and investment opportunity 

Mexico City s population now exceeds 20 million 


Only 5  of Brazil s roads are paved 


China is planning to build 97 new regional airports by 2020 


35  of Indian households don t have access to electricity 


About 50  of Jakarta s 10 million citizens don t have access to running water 


South Africa is the world s fourth fastest mobile phone market in the world 


About 83   of the world s population has access to clean water and just 58  have flushing toilets 


The Royal Bank of Scotland  L RBS  estimates  1 trillion a year will be spent by emerging markets through 2030 


The OECD expects the number of vehicles in emerging markets to double or even triple by 2030 

Follow the Sovereign Wealth Funds
The growing need for infrastructure and the steady investment returns it delivers have made it a favorite among sovereign wealth funds 
Sovereign wealth funds  with  7 trillion in assets  are putting roughly 25  of their investments in infrastructure projects around the world 
Because these huge projects are usually partnerships with host governments and often come with sovereign guarantees  these giant funds perceive that emerging country political and legal risks are significantly lower 
Infrastructure spending is also a favorite way to boost growth and generate jobs 
And with debt levels in many countries  including China  already high  everyone is looking for private and multilateral bank funding  The Wall Street Journal reports that about  45 billion worth of major Chinese construction projects are facing delays due to lack of funding 
The Asian Development Bank  ADB  in Manila allocates at least  10 billion each year to infrastructure  The soon to be launched China led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank  AIIB  will begin lending next year with  50 billion in capital and 57 founding members 
Even so  the World Bank estimates that there will be at least a  1 trillion  per year gap in infrastructure funding

CAT,2015-11-24,"There is no denying we are moving into the eye of the storm  with the market having merged into one giant consensus trade  That trade is of course long USD  short commodities and US treasuries  at least shorter term maturities  
Perhaps the biggest divergence has been in the S P 500 and ASX 200  which up until today has ground higher  while the traditional leading indicators   such as the US yield curve  credit spreads and the Baltic Dry Index   push lower to worrying levels  Being long developed market equities continues to work though  and at least for now  and one just has to look at the MSCI World Index CRB Commodity Index ratio  Here  the ratio has increased 26  this year to stand at 9 2861x and is effectively at the highest levels since 1999  This must speak volumes on investing in commodities as an asset class 
Looking at positioning   a key input for short term trading along with price action  trend  sentiment  volatility  market internals and correlation  we can see a fairly definitive stance from speculative funds  According to the weekly Commitment of Traders  CoT  report  where money managers have to report weekly futures positions to the CFTC   the market has a net short position in brent oil of  141 000 contracts  the most since October 2014  and copper  29 000 contracts  Despite the net position in gold being long 34 000 contracts  this has fallen staggeringly since October and is the least net long since April 
In FX markets  according to data reported to the CFTC in the weekly CoT report  speculative funds hold an aggregate position of  46 billion  which is not far off the record highs seen in January  Net short holdings in EUR USD  at  164 000 contracts  and AUD USD   66 464 contracts  are looking especially stretched  The current net USD positioning is similar to IG s client holdings  where 72  of all open positions are net long the USD index 
If we think about risk to reward  we know the world is balanced in one direction and one just has to look at the technicals which compliment the positioning  LME copper held a 9 day RSI of eight in Asian trade  as far as I can see this oscillator has never been lower   nickel at 10  and zinc at 21  This is clearly a reflection of the aggressive rate of change behind the price movement  but they also represent grossly over sold conditions  Perhaps this is a reason why we are seeing some buying coming into the commodity complex today  although the same can t be said in the Australian resource sector  where buying activity is very limited 
There is no doubt the falls in commodities have been heavily traded by momentum based funds  CTA s  and conditions for these players have been almost perfect  There simply haven t been any buyers and commodity futures have been easy to push lower  Whether it s the USD index hitting 100 or the Fed s preferred trade weighted USD moving to a new 12 year high  this has hurt commodity prices  With EUR USD falling aggressively  there has been a perception that the EUR weakness has had positive ramifications on European exports  This will in turn hurt China s export volumes as the imported goods have to come from somewhere and global corporates have been achieving significant purchasing power as opposed to European goods  There is a bet against old China  industrial   while domestic traders  if they are buying Chinese markets  are buying  new China   internet  media or on line retailing for example   Then there is a supply demand argument  with names like Chanelco cutting surcharges and Caterpillar  N CAT  consistently providing a discerning outlook 
The question is  Has this view gone too far 
Would there be ramifications from a disgruntled China if the Chinese yuan comprised a very small weight  below 8   within the Special Drawing Right  SDR  basket  A longer term devaluation of the RMB is expected by the market  but traders are expecting a slow drift lower and not aggressive action  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  board meeting is on 30 November 
What if the market shows disappointment should the European Central Bank cut the deposit rate by a mere 10 basis points to  30 basis points on 3 December  Just look at the German two year bond  euribor or three month libor    traders want to see a negative rate closer to  40 basis point  Will we see a  sell the rumour  buy the fact  scenario play out in EUR USD 
What if OPEC cut production in the 4 December meeting at a time when traders are significantly short brent and WTI  What would a change in energy trends mean for headline inflation expectations when it is likely to start creeping higher in the coming months because of base effects 
What if Janet Yellen s speech to the Economic Club  Washington  does not suggest an urgency to hike the funds rate in December  This is a low probability  but the market will be super sensitive 
What if the upcoming US payrolls report on 4 December comes out at the low end of estimates  consensus is 198 000 jobs but ranging from 267 000 to 130 000 jobs   A really low number will see traders look to hedge and unwind positions if heavily exposed to the big consensus trade  as detailed above   The Fed would be loath to hike in December if the implied probability is below 50  and we could feasibly see the probability below 50  on a weak payrolls report 
To summarise  the world is caught in giant consensus trade and judging by the VIX index or even one month implied volatility in EUR USD  traders are expecting the playbook to go exactly to plan  I am not saying this has to change  but we need to be aware of the risks as we enter a period where the whole investment landscape can change if the market script is not followed to the tee ",IG,0.083,0.864,0.053,-0.9817

CAT,2015-12-16,"By Hnin Yadana Zaw HPAKANT  Myanmar  Reuters    Using heavy earth excavators and explosives  miners have been tearing into Myanmar s northern hills in recent months  in a rush to excavate more jade from the world s richest deposits of the gemstone before a new government takes office next year  Acres of forest have been felled  leaving behind craters  barren cliffs and a web of dirt tracks in the once picturesque Kachin hills as the Chinese firms that dominate the jade business step up mining and aggressively seek new concessions  They are anticipating the multi billion dollar industry could change once Aung San Suu Kyi s election winning National League for Democracy  NLD  party takes office with a promise of clean governance  those in the trade say  The NLD has said it will bring in rules and competition and crack down on rampant smuggling that deprives the government of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue  but skeptics doubt it will be able to do much in the remote  rebel infested region  Nay Win Tun  a flamboyant lawmaker and heavyweight in the jade trade with close links to the Myanmar military  says the Chinese have been flooding the trade with cash and equipment  ramping up production and taking over local miners   Right now  the market is being ruined by China   he said in a rare interview at one of his mines near Hpakant  dressed in an orange shirt  sunglasses and a cowboy hat  and surrounded by a uniformed entourage   Chinese companies tried to do a joint venture with my company   added Nay Win Tun  As he spoke  one of his attendants stooped down and tied his shoe laces   I didn t accept because they re asking for a share of profit that s too much   About 600 jade mining firms operate on 20 000 acres around the town of Hpakant  but activity is dominated by about 10 firms  among them mostly Chinese led ventures  according to Ye Htut  the deputy head of Myanmar Gems Enterprise  a department of the Ministry of Mines   We are worried about the political changes in the coming months   said Eik Yin  a site manager for Triple One Company  a China Myanmar joint venture in Hpakant  But he declined to comment whether this was leading to ramped up production   Because of the stepped up extractions  thousands of ethnic villagers are being forced off their land  Scavengers  or  handpickers  who in their thousands scour mountains of loose earth and rubble for nuggets of jade  are sometimes buried alive  including 114 killed in a landslide last month  Many of the scavengers are addicted to narcotics  EARTHMOVERS Aung Ko Oo  director of the locally owned Thukha Yadana mining company  said mainland Chinese firms had stepped up activity since the start of the year   Mostly they came in by joint venture with local  ethnic  Chinese companies   he said   Our firms have already sold two six acres sites to the Chinese  We need money   Myanmar miners say they cannot stand up to Chinese tycoons who buy influence and invest in modern heavy machinery like  Caterpillar   N CAT  and Komatsu  T 6301  earth excavators  Processions of giant trucks  with eight foot high wheels  are a common sight in the area and all belong to Chinese firms  These firms have successfully cornered the market  selling directly to visiting Chinese buyers they are already familiar with  according to traders who spoke to Reuters   A Myanmar Gems Enterprise official said Chinese firms had co opted local army commanders to secure mining concessions on their behalf  knowing they were too powerful for the local government to refuse them   The military officers already have deals with the Chinese companies to transfer the sites to them   said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity   They don t change the name of ownership sometimes  No one dares to touch  these  sites   Military officials were not immediately available for comment  and Zaw Htay  a senior official in the president s office  declined comment  Much of the jade is being smuggled into China each year  locals say  Jade is a status symbol in China widely believed to bring fortune  wealth and longevity  According to official data  China   the world s biggest jade market   imported only about  540 million of Myanmar jade in the first nine months of this year  Global Witness  a non governmental organization  estimated the value of Myanmar s jade production at  31 billion in 2014   China s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was unaware of any allegations of Chinese companies  involvement in jade smuggling  but added the country was opposed to such illegal activities  A regional police official in Hpakant said hundreds of trucks were concealed in the Kachin jungles  a few of which operated each night to transport undeclared jade rocks from Hpakant toward the China border   At night  there are nine or 10 trucks moving   the officer said  speaking on condition of anonymity   Since it s an army dominated area  the Chinese work together with the army to move trucks to Hpakant   In its election manifesto  the NLD led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi pledged closer scrutiny of investments when it replaces the current government early next year  But given the military s political power and vast network of business and influence  it may be impossible to police the jade industry   Even this government can

CAT,2015-12-24,"I want to zero in on the one asset class that affects every other one  I m talking about the U S  dollar 
Now you might think the dollar s going to crash  That makes sense  The value of all paper currencies continues to be destroyed by central banks who are trying to reduce their mountains of debt  In the U S   the Federal Reserve has piled on more than  4 trillion in quantitative easing since 2008 
But unlike other paper currencies  the dollar is in a unique position and is much more likely to get stronger 
In fact  the dollar s been getting stronger and stronger since 2014 
And if the dollar moves up through its next resistance level  it would rock financial markets 
Let me show you how to get this right  Because everything depends on what happens to the dollar 
The U S  Dollar Affects Every Other Asset
The U S  dollar is the oxygen of the global economy  Everyone takes it for granted  but it determines the value of every financial instrument in the world   stocks  bonds  commodities  real estate  art  collectibles  you name it 
So let s talk about the dollar s direction  up     the forces pushing it    the consequences for investors    and what key support level to watch on the dollar index 
When the value of the dollar changes significantly against other currencies  it causes the value of these assets to change as well  And that is exactly what started to happen in June 2014  The value of the dollar is driven by monetary policy  which is set by central banks around the world  Central banks set policies that affect their interest rates and the value of their currencies 
For example  if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates directly  by lowering the Federal Funds rate  or indirectly  through QE   it lowers the value of the dollar because investors holding dollars will earn a lower interest rate on their dollars  In contrast  if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates  directly or indirectly   it raises the value of the dollar  The same applies to other central banks   if they take actions to raise or lower the interest rate paid on their currencies  the value of those currencies respond accordingly 
Sometimes different central banks act together to lower interest rates and sometimes they don t  Right now we are in a period in which the Federal Reserve and other major central banks in Europe  Japan  and China are not coordinating their actions  which has enormous consequences for the dollar  And in turn  what happens to the value of the dollar has enormous consequences for other financial assets 
Let s take a look at how that s been playing out   and what s next 
The Dollar s Been in  Rally Mode  Since 2014
The US Dollar Index  DXY  is an index that measures the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies  The composition of the index is euro  57 8    yen  13 6    British pound  11 9    Canadian dollar  9 1    Swedish krona  4 2    and Swiss franc  3 6    As you can see  70  of the index is tied to just two currencies   the Euro and the Yen 
The Dollar Index  DXY  broke out of a long term trading range and started moving up sharply in mid 2014 until it broke a long term trend line at 95 in December 2014  It has spent most of the subsequent period trading above this key level  signaling that it could trade much higher in the coming months 

Source  Bloomberg
 The reason for this sharp rally in the dollar index was that the Federal Reserve was widely expected to end its QE program in October 2014  Investors began anticipating this a few months before that happened  At the same time  investors began expecting the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan  which are responsible for setting interest rates on the euro and the yen  respectively  to move in the opposite direction  The European and Japanese economies were struggling and needed stimulus 
And sure enough  on October 31  2014  the Bank of Japan along with Japan s largest pension fund announced a massive QE program that included not only massive purchases of Japanese Government Bonds  the equivalent of our Treasuries  but also stocks and ETFs  This was another step in what is known as Abenomics  an economic stimulus program adopted by the government of Prime Minister Shinzu Abe to try to end Japan s decades long period of deflation and slow growth  Abenomics had already moved the value of the yen from 85 to over about 107 and this announcement moved it much lower to the 120 range  remember  if more Yen are needed to equal a dollar  the yen is weaker  not stronger  
This was followed in January 2015 by the ECB s first QE program  The euro  which had already started to weaken   from the  1 40 range in early 2014 to  1 21 on December 31  2014   plunged on this news to as low as  1 05 during the first quarter of 2015  It has since settled at either side of  1 10  with some technical spikes higher  
So what next 
All eyes are now on the Fed  A hike in the Federal Funds rate from 0  to 0 25  is long overdue and would likely push the dollar higher against the euro and the yen as well as other currencies in the DXY  Recent market turbulence has sowed doubts regarding whether the Fed has the courage to raise rates by even such a small amount  But even if the Fed doesn t move  the ECB and Bank of Japan are committed to further weakening their currencies  That means further dollar strength can be expected 
And if the Fed doesn t move in the near term  it is still almost certain to move before the end of the year  most likely in December  barring a total market meltdown  Super Crash  before then 
What a Strong Dollar Means for You
The consequences of a strong dollar are important for investors  Here s what you need to know 
First  oil and other commodities are traded in dollars  A strong dollar will make it difficult for oil prices to rally and could push them down further from current levels  I will be discussing commodities in future Sure Money emails to you  but for the moment readers should not be counting on any imminent recovery in commodity prices in large part because the dollar is likely to remain strong  You cannot be betting on a strong dollar and higher oil at the same time   those positions are inconsistent with each other  The same is true for a strong dollar and other commodity prices including copper  aluminum  and other metals 
Second  a strong dollar is deflationary  it makes it difficult for U S  companies that sell products abroad to increase prices since their goods are made more expensive by the strong dollar  This means that corporate profits will remain under pressure  which in turn will pressure stock prices  Earnings growth at S P 500 companies has dropped to zero after years of strong growth  meaning that companies are going to have to resort to cost cutting or financial engineering like stock buybacks to push up their stock prices  Overall  a strong dollar should be a headwind for stock prices and we are already starting to see the effects of this  If you are invested in companies like Caterpillar Inc   NYSE N CAT  and Qualcomm Incorporated  O QCOM  that have significant foreign sales  you should reduce your exposure now 
Third  emerging markets are already suffering at the hands of a strong dollar and will continue to suffer  Emerging market countries and companies borrowed enormous amounts of money denominated in dollars  Now those debts are worth more and are going to be harder to repay  Readers can buy the ProShares Short MSCI Emerging Markets  N EUM  to profit from continued weakness in emerging markets  This ETF rises when emerging markets stocks weaken 
Fourth  readers don t have to sit around and do nothing  You can profit from the dollar rally by investing in dollars and selling short euros and yen  The most direct way you can do this is through three ETFs 
You can buy PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish  N UUP   which closely tracks the exposures in the DXY  This ETF rises when the dollar rises 
You can buy the Euro by buying ProShares Short Euro  N EUFX   This ETF rises when the euro falls 
And you can sell short the Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  N FXY   Your short position will rise in value as the Yen weakens 
Here s What to Watch in the Dollar s Next Move
Keep an eye on the DXY  You can track it here
The euro is still trading at over  1 10 and the yen is still trading at 118  These two currencies  which comprise 70  of the DXY  are likely to weaken significantly further  The euro is likely to move much closer to  1 00 and the yen to 145  and further moves lower than those are also in the cards 
This is the key   
Those levels would move the DXY through its next resistance level of 98 and unleash another bout of dollar strength that will rock financial markets ",Michael Lewitt,0.055,0.808,0.137,0.9993

CAT,2016-01-21,"For those of you on the East coast  looking for something fun to do with your weekend between shoveling turns  I thought this might be a good time to introduce our  personal CPI calculator  
Sounds exciting  right 
It is an old idea  one of the reasons that people don t like the Consumer Price Index is that no one is an  average  consumer  Everyone consumes more or less than the  typical  amounts  moreover  everyone notices or cares more about some costs than they do for others  It turns out that for most people  the CPI is a decent description of their consumption  at least close enough to use the CPI as a reference but that answer varies with the person 
Moreover  CPI turns out to be a very poor measure for a corporate entity  which cares much more about some costs than others  Caterpillar  N CAT  cares a lot about grain prices  energy prices  and most importantly tractor prices  but they don t care much about education   This is one reason that corporate entities don t issue inflation linked bonds it isn t really a hedge for them  Which is why I have tried for years to get inflation subindices quoted and traded  so that issuers could issue bonds linked to their particular exposures  and investors could construct the precise exposure they wanted  But I digress  
The BLS makes available many different subindices  and the weights used to construct the index from these subindices  Last year  the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta published on their macroblog an article about what they call  myCPI   They constructed a whole mess of individualized market baskets  and  they will direct you to a place you can get one of these market baskets emailed to you automatically every month  Which is pretty good  and starting to be what I think we need 
But what I wanted was something like   which has been available from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany for years  I want to chart my own CPI  and be able to see how varying the weights of different consumption would result in different comparative inflation rates  The German FSO was very helpful and even offered their code  but in the end we re created it ourselves but tried to preserve some of the look and feel of the German site  which is itself similar to the French site  and there are others  but not for US inflation  
Here is the link to Enduring s     I think it is fairly self explanatory and you will find it addicting to play around with the sliders and see how different weights would affect the effective price inflation you experience  You can also look at particular subindices  through the  products  button  Some of these are directly BLS series  but normalized to Jan 1999 100   and some are collections of subindices that I did to make the list manageable 
I think you ll find it interesting  If you do  let me know ",Michael Ashton,0.018,0.868,0.114,0.9932

Caterpillar said adjusted earnings per share was 74 cents in the three months ended December 31  above expectations for adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share and compared with  1 35 per share in the year ago period 
Including restructuring costs  the company lost 15 cents per share  down from a profit of  1 23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 
The company s fourth quarter revenue totaled  11 03 billion  just below forecasts for revenue of  11 42 billion and down 22 5  from sales of  14 2 billion in the same period a year earlier 
 Cost management  restructuring actions and operational execution are helping the company while sales and revenues remain under pressure from weak commodity prices and slowing economic growth in developing countries   said Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Oberhelman     
The outlook for 2016 sales and revenues does not anticipate improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices   Sales and revenues are expected to be in a range of  40 to  44 billion a mid point of  42 billion 
The mid point of the range reflects a decline of about  3 5 billion from last October s preliminary outlook for 2016 sales and revenues and a year over year decline of about 10   largely a result of continued declines in commodity prices and economic weakness in developing countries

Caterpillar is expected to underwhelm in 2016 as slumping commodities market  slowing demand in China and currency headwinds persist

Today  Thursday  January 28th  Caterpillar is scheduled to report Q4 2015 earnings before the markets open  The manufacturer is poised to continue its free fall with a third straight quarter of negative growth 
Caterpillar is a prime example of how tough it can be to grow during a cyclical downturn  On the heels of their last earnings report  Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to a sell under the expectation that a new commodity deflation cycle will cripple Caterpillar  This quarter  the Estimize community calls for EPS of  0 73 and revenue of  11 346 billion  slightly higher the Wall Street consensus  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY contraction in EPS and revenue of 45  and 19    respectively

Since oil has dropped below  30 per barrel  sales of industry related equipment have declined  Even at much higher prices  oil and gas exploration would cut back on drilling activity  Moreover  prices of precious and industrial metals have slipped lately  delaying any hope for recovery 
Along with commodities  Caterpillar faces challenges as economic turmoil in China and other emerging markets persists  A pullback in higher growth markets could hurt Caterpillar s key business even further  On top of this  currency headwinds from a strong U S  dollar have weighed down company revenues 
To deal with the recent turmoil  Caterpillar is undergoing significant restructuring and cost cutting initiatives which  in the short term  will put pressure on margins  Unfortunately  Caterpillar should continue its downward spiral until the state of oil  commodities and the global economy picks up ",Estimize,0.083,0.831,0.087,0.4019

CAT,2016-02-22,"China has been weak for some time  and the main reason for its current weakness boils down to its loss of a major source of growth   cheap manufacturing labor 
It was this advantage   coupled with enormous amounts of new capital   that drove double digit economic growth for almost a decade 
But while China s wages are increasing at a 10  annual clip  Vietnam  Indonesia  and the Philippines  among others  have substantially lower wage costs  So it s no surprise that capital is now flowing to these countries instead of China 
In fact  the surprising truth is that in 2014 and 2015  there was more foreign direct investment in all of Southeast Asia than in China  This was a startling indicator that many have missed 
Another theme many have overlooked is that the much talked about  Pacific Century  isn t just about Asia  It also includes the other side of the Pacific Rim   Canada  the U S   and Latin America 
This is why all these countries are included in the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal that is stuck right now in the gridlock between Congress and the presidential campaign 
Meanwhile  another pro growth  pro market grouping in Latin America has also recently been launched   the Pacific Alliance  Chile  Colombia  and Peru have joined together with Mexico to form this Pacific Alliance trading block 
The contrast between the Pacific Alliance countries and the others in the region is clear  Over the past five years  these countries have had a 3 6  lower inflation rate than the average for Latin America  They also had a 1 5  higher growth rate and invested 2 5  more of their GDP 
And Mexico  with lower manufacturing labor rates than China  has an opportunity to be the next global manufacturing platform   especially if it pursues the right market reforms 
America  Mexico  and China
With China losing its manufacturing mojo  America will gain in several ways 
There s already a revival in high end manufacturing and this  on shoring  trend will gain strength 
American firms will be shifting manufacturing from China to Mexico 
Some like Trump will call foul  but this trend is a step in the right direction for American workers 
Why 
About 40  of the goods assembled in Mexico are made in America  while only 4  of stuff assembled in China is U S  made 
Ironically  even Chinese companies  such as Chinese automaker Geely  OTC GELYY   are moving production to Mexico  And it s reasonable to consider adjusting NAFTA to prevent these goods from coming into America duty free 
Also keep in mind that a stronger Mexican economy is much better for America than a stronger Chinese economy 
American companies export three times more to Mexico than to China  In fact  Taiwan sells even more to China than America does 
An easy way to play the stronger manufacturing and economic growth trend in Mexico is through the iShares MSCI Capped Mexico ETF  N EWW  
Grupo Simec SAB de CV  N SIM  is also an interesting option to consider since it makes the steel and iron that go into new factories and warehouses 
And don t forget American manufacturing companies  After all  U S manufacturing workers have productivity rates five times that of China  and America is the largest exporter of advanced manufactured goods in the world 
The United States is particularly strong in machinery  chemicals  and transportation equipment  which together make up nearly half of total exports 
The strong dollar  up 27  over the last couple of years over other major currencies  has been quite a headwind for manufacturing exporters and any reversal could send shares of companies   such as Caterpillar Inc  N CAT    upward

Commentary In the last T2108 Update I described a synchronous failure of market leaders  These same leaders followed up with an attempted rally that fizzled across the board with all closing the day flat  The S P 500 could not hold flat and instead lost 1 1  

The S P 500 closes down for the first time in March 
The volatility index  the VIX  gained for the third straight day  I had previously expected a rendezvous with the old 15 35 pivot  Instead  the VIX may have another rally to go before sinking that low again 

The volatility index is trying to sustain a rebound from recent lows 
T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   fell along with the market  It closed at 80 6   This is only the fourth loss since the February 11 low at oversold conditions  The decline in T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  fell for only the third day since February 11th s low  The decline from 35 7  to 32 2  was significant and confirms the market s first notable setback in this bounce from oversold conditions 
I am keeping the trading call at  cautiously bullish   Recall that I am not flipping bearish until the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   falls below and follows through its selling below its 50DMA AND after T2108 has fallen from overbought conditions  If T2107 shows significant weakness  I could pull the trigger on bearishness a little earlier 
Speculative stocks were hit particularly hard  These are stocks that have enjoyed out sized gains in this rally  membership has been dominated by commodity related stocks  For example  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  CLF  plunged 20 7  and fell back under its 200DMA 

Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF  plunges and erases two days of heady gains tied to a record surge in iron ore prices 
Even Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  sank under its 200DMA 

Does a false 200DMA breakout signal the beginning of the end for the strong rally in Caterpillar  CAT  
United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X  is on the verge of confirming resistance at its 200DMA 

The rally in U S  Steel  X  stops dead in its tracks at 200DMA resistance 
These are just examples of what a sinking T2107 meant for the market today  They confirm today as a notable day of setbacks for this rally 
The sharp move in iron ore particularly concerns me  These kinds of moves are typically a rally s last gasp as buyers finally exhaust themselves in one last panicked buying spree  Sure enough  the immediate aftermath of Monday s sharp spike has created major reversals like in CLF 
When I wrote     I did not cover the insane gain in iron ore from Monday  Its price surged 20  in a move that had to include a lot of short covering  This conclusion was echoed by traders and analysts  Even industrial mining giants cast doubts on the sustainability of the move as quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald in     The mechanics of the move were also discussed in an aptly titled Bloomberg article      Business Insider Australia provided some context in  CHART  The overnight surge in iron ore nearly doubled the previous record gain  

Monster run up in iron ore may have some precedence in last year s pull forward in steel production 


Iron ore s one day gain even surpassed last July s sudden burst higher 

Apparently  shorts are also running from their bets against oil  In  Specter of  20 Oil Recedes as Speculators Flee Bearish Bets   Bloomberg notes  hedge funds unwound bearish bets at the fastest pace in 10 months Speculators  short positions in WTI fell by 25 639 contracts of futures and options combined to 150 718  the biggest decline since April 21  CFTC data show  Longs  or bets on rising prices  fell by 753  The exodus of bearish bets resulted in a 24 886 contract jump in the net long position  
I am more worried about iron ore than oil for now because of iron ore s heavy dependence on China s economy 
Speaking of speculative stocks  I have not posted a chart of iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  in a long while  Biotech stocks have benefited little from the current rally as IBB has largely churned in a tight range since the initial bounce from the February 11 lows  Today  IBB fell 3 6  

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  is struggling mightily to resume making progress

Now  there s basically nothing that can hurt anyone  Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT  warned last week  It was down four dollars pre market  and finished up over a dollar  Nothing can hurt anyone it seems  It s all about emotion  It is what it is  It s all about the fed  It s all about low rates and lots of stimulus from the global central bankers  That s all anything is about  The bulls love fed protection  so again  everything is good news  No end on the horizon on that level as far as I can tell  It ll end someday  but no sign whatsoever at this point  That can drive a bear nuts  I actually feel sorry for them  They have to feel so whipped  They get all the news they would need under normal circumstances  yet they still can t get any love  Hug a bear  if you see one  Send them your condolences  There s nothing more you can do for the poor souls  So today was yet another day of defying logic and anything else you can think of  The bulls win  but there will have to be some selling soon  I think 
The short term  sixty minute charts are flashing some small negative divergences  Will they matter  They should  They don t have to  It can be worked off laterally  but we shall see tomorrow  Those divergences are fairly immediate ones  thus  we should get some selling now  but again  in this market who knows  Sixty minute divergences are not bearish bigger picture  but they can bring a small amount of pain in the immediate future  There s some support at the 2044 gap breakout  and again at 2020  Can we  dare I say  sell 1 2   Oh no  not 1 2   Well  maybe we can  and we should  but we shall see  Another gap up wouldn t shock me  but if we do  we ll get even more overbought and create and even bigger negative divergence  But that shouldn t stop the bulls from trying anyway 
Even though the bull bear spread is only about 20 22   it s as if it s 45  as the bulls are as frothy as they could ever hope to be  Tomorrow is important  In the real world we should be ready to sell a bit  If we go lateral and work off the divergence  we ll go higher still as the week moves along  2080 is big resistance  You learn a lot about the future by watching how the markets pulls back its oscillators  along with price once negative divergences exist  The next day or two will tell us a great deal  For now  we play this market for what it is and what it is is bullish  The bears have to prove it s not  Simple as that ",Jack Steiman,0.094,0.823,0.083,-0.7221

Commentary The latest Fed play that I described in the last T2108 Update worked out pretty well  The market once again reacted with post Fed soothing after   ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY  gapped up  and I sold  a bit too soon granted   However  that trading action is already old news  Since that small gap up  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   has logged two weak closes in a row  The index is starting to look like it is building a slippery slope with the past 7 trading days or so forming a small downtrend through the 20 day moving average  DMA  
The S P 500  SPY  is showing a slight negative bias although support lingers directly below from the 50 and 200 day moving averages  DMAs 
T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at 73 8  as it tenuously holds onto overbought status  Monday was day  29 of the overbought period  and the S P 500 is starting to lag expected performance  The S P 500 is up 3 2  for the overbought period  If the overbought period ended on Monday  projections suggest around a 4 5  gain  To align with historical performance  the S P 500 will either need to end right away  or resume in earnest its extended overbought rally 
S P 500 Performance By T2108 Duration Above the 70  Threshold
While T2108 is slipping  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  remains strong  At 45 4   T2107 has managed marginal gains the past two days and is still just below recent highs  So while some of the fastest moving stocks are losing altitude  the longer term underpinnings of the stock market remain strong for now 
The volatility index  the CBOE Volatility Index  perked up again with an increase of 5 9  and its highest close since March 15th  by a hair   I will not get concerned until unless the VIX shows the potential to pull away from the pivot by closing above the last intraday high 

The VIX is bouncing around the 15 35 pivot but with a very slight upward bias 
Of course  an increase in the VIX ahead of earnings should not cause too much surprise 
AUD JPY jumped on the day and essentially nullified any alarm I might have otherwise felt from the gains on the VIX 

The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen experiences a day of reprieve from its current 50 and 200DMA breakdown 

Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  is still milling around in what looks like consolidation above its 200DMA  This position keeps CAT in a bullish 200DMA breakout  I find it hard to get bearish with CAT trading so calmly 

Caterpillar  CAT  is maintaining its 200DMA breakout 

Overall  my trading call remains at neutral given T2108 has the potential to make a bearish drop out of overbought conditions at any moment  Recall that such a bearish change in market character has to be confirmed by a notable drop in T2107 as well 
I am following several interesting charts for profitable trades and or useful signals earnings not withstanding  These charts are a telling mix of bullish and bearish signals 
The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  immediately put to test my bullish call to buy its breakout with confidence  Since sell offs often end after the third day  Today will be a critical test of the breakout in several ways  Note that IBB closed right at the bottom of the channel formed by the upper Bollinger Bands  BB   Selling volume has steadily declined   a bullish sign that the selling may be coming to an imminent end 

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  has almost reversed its breakout with three straight days of selling 


Facebook  NASDAQ FB  faces a big test of 50DMA support  Heavy volume on the selling suggests support will not last much longer

CAT,2016-04-19,"Life is getting increasingly difficult for income investors 
Largely because dividend payments are becoming less secure 
First quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are expected to come in below last year s levels for the sixth successive quarter  with energy and financial stocks showing the biggest declines 
And auditors have issued more  going concern  warnings for their S P 500 clients than at any time since the Great Recession began in 2008 
A company s auditor generally issues a going concern warning when the company has already suspended any dividends it was paying 
For example  a going concern was recently issued for Linn Energy LLC  NASDAQ LINE   an aggressive oil  and gas producing master limited partnership  MLP  that thought it had cracked the problem of fluctuating oil and gas prices by hedging in the futures markets  That is  until prices went down and stayed down  at which point the futures market hedges ran out 
Linn was then exposed as an overleveraged company producing oil and gas at a running loss 
Any  who owned Linn before 2014 as a stable MLP with a history of dividend increases have been very unlucky in terms of both income and capital 
Most Than Just MLPs Are in Trouble
There are a number of companies beyond MLPs that pay dividends in excess of earnings  relying on depreciation to provide adequate cash flow  These companies are especially vulnerable in an earnings downturn 
For example  CenturyLink Inc  NYSE CTL   a telecom company with large fixed assets tied up in landline services  paid a dividend of  2 16 per share on  1 58 of earnings per share  EPS  last year 
When a company does that for enough years  it s sure to run out of money when earnings have even just a mild downturn 
Frontier Communications Corp  NASDAQ FTR  is in the same business  The company doesn t seem concerned with making a profit at all  attempting to grow by buying portfolios of fixed line customers that nobody else wants 
Frontier cut its dividend in 2013  and appears likely to do so again  The stock price has been on a steady downward trend since I owned it in 2010 at about double its present level 
Some companies rely on a mature business to generate cash flows for dividends  but this doesn t last forever 
For example  Vector Group Ltd  NYSE VGR  is primarily in the cigarette business  and relies on the fact that it doesn t need to invest much in this mature business  So the company pays out dividends that far exceed its earnings 
With negative tangible net worth and negative cash flow after dividend payments  its dividends can t be considered a reliable source of income 
Beware the Buyback
As well as the cash flow drain of dividends themselves  some companies further imperil their dividends by undertaking massive stock buyback programs 
Such programs do nothing for retail investors  who don t usually get direct buyback offers   and serve mostly to avoid the dilution of earnings that would otherwise happen through management stock option grants 
Take a look at Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   which offers a nice 4 1  yield on its stock  This yield is modestly covered by the last four quarters  earnings 
However  the company placed the dividend in danger through  2 billion of stock buybacks in 2015  which exceeded the dividend and soaked up most of the company s depreciation allowance  This resulted in a net drain of  900 million in cash 
The 4 traders website forecasts that Caterpillar s earnings will be down marginally in 2016  still leaving the dividend covered  but raising the question of where this year s stock buyback will come from 
In an environment of squeezed earnings  Caterpillar s dividend is clearly endangered   and it s the stock buyback program that s causing the problem 
Finally  Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM   the precious metals miner  is one company whose dividend was listed as  endangered  by Kiplinger in December  But its operating environment has improved so much that an increase is more likely than a cut at this point 
The company s yield is currently only 0 3   but while both energy and precious metals mining dividends were slashed during the resources downturn  there may be some upside in the precious metals sector among those few companies like Newmont that still pay dividends 
How to Protect Yourself
For dividend security in what is promising to be a difficult year  look for a stable business model  modest vulnerability to a downturn  ample dividend cover  and a track record of taking the dividend very seriously without wasting cash on buyback operations 
Vectren Corporation  NYSE VVC  is a regulated electric and gas utility with one million customers in Indiana and Ohio  It pays a dividend of  0 40 quarterly  about 1 5 times covered by earnings  with a track record of increasing its dividend for over 50 years 
Best of all  it doesn t do stock buybacks  it s likely that regulators don t allow it to   Its yield is currently only 3 2   but it allows you to sleep at night 
Modern finance and the economy can make it more difficult to find solid income plays  but they can certainly be found  albeit mostly at high prices ",Wall Street Daily,0.068,0.822,0.111,0.9909

CAT,2016-05-08,"In August last year  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  announced that it was moving manufacturing jobs back to America from Mexico  The truck and equipment company had entered what is called the  vocational truck  business back in 2011 in a partnership with Navistar 
Using its facility in Escobedo  Nuevo Leon  Navistar assembled these vocational units for Caterpillar under Caterpillar s brand  Last year s announcement about Texas was Cat figuring it had established enough presence in the market to take the next step and manufacture its own product 
They had invested in expanding an existing facility in Victoria  Texas  and in that August press statement indicated that the first production runs would take place at some point in the first half of 2016  The promotional material suggested that it was a very serious effort  From the company s promotional material 

We didn t mess around when we set out to develop our new line of vocational trucks  We spent hundreds of hours on the road asking customers to describe the ideal truck  Our design team rode alongside drivers and gathered input on everything from specs and comfort to visibility and performance 

On February 26  Caterpillar delivered the news not that production had begun  but rather that it would never make any  vocational trucks  in Victoria or anywhere else  The company decided it was best to get out before  

We have not yet started truck production in Victoria  This decision allows us to exit this business before the transition occurs 

It was yet another anecdote that  something  has changed between last summer and the start of this year  This was not a big market for the company given its global reach in construction and mining  but obviously going back to 2011 they found some kind of opportunity worth pursuing and then ramping up last summer 
Ramin Younessi  Caterpillar s Vice President in the Industrial Power Systems Division  was rather blunt about it  saying   we determined there was not a sufficient market opportunity to justify the investment  
The trucking industry as a whole has fallen under tremendous strain this year  which really does justify Caterpillar s decision  It is not only railroads that are suffering under the ongoing contraction or manufacturing recession  trucking might even be harder hit  The Wall Street Journal reported only a week  that orders for Class 8 rigs were down 43  year over year in February 
At the time  the industry and insiders seemed somewhat on the fence as to whether such horrible numbers were a temporary problem as economists in the media claimed  or whether it was the start of a major  systemic adjustment 

Still  analysts see risks of a continued downturn  particularly if truck orders don t bounce back next month  March   when buying typically begins to climb ahead of the peak late summer shipping season 

The Journal reports again this week that truck demand never did bounce back and has  

Orders for large trucks fell for the fourth consecutive month in April  and are likely to stay low through the summer as trucking demand continues to be weak  according to research group FTR 
Last month  trucking fleets ordered just 13 500 Class 8 trucks  the big rigs used on long haul routes  down 16  from March and 39  from a year earlier  It was the fewest net orders in any April since 2009  FTR said 

The reason for the huge dropoff in demanded capacity growth is the current and large dropoff in freight volumes as the quantity of goods being moved around has declined  The Journal reports that one estimate for fleet availability  dry vans  was down 28  in April from a year earlier  meaning that trucking companies are idling huge portions of their fleets 
With such spare capacity  obviously  there isn t much call for new vehicles beyond scheduled replacements  That might be  however  the next step  as any real recession usually hits hard enough where firms start forgoing needed capital maintenance in addition to large reductions in ordered capacity 
 
There is as yet no indication that I can find which suggests the trucking industry is close to that far into what looks increasingly like a serious  systemic adjustment  This may just be the beginning  and again not some  transitory  weakness that the employment market  as suggested by   will easily work through given enough time 
That is the relevance of Caterpillar s decision in February  as taking time  effort  and money into that new business line and then deciding instead not to bother indicates something other than a bump in the economic road  In other words  as bad as last year might have been  this year seems intent on finding out what that  something  really was or is 
I believe this is yet another reason why  as   transportation  and retailer  stocks have yet to recover from January February s liquidations  These truck stories and pieces of data may all yet still be anecdotes and partial pictures  but they are adding up to already seriously elevated risk of something more than the mainstream views on the economy allow as possible 
Today s employment report  meaningless and irrelevant as it truly is  will not help  as it was  with lower oil prices  about the only hope left for escaping economically undamaged  Since we are already discussing serious setbacks in trucking and transportation  obviously those low oil prices never counted for anything ","Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",0.076,0.865,0.058,-0.9305

where the latest job report for April showed factories added 4 000 positions and other measures suggest the sector has stopped contracting  That comes after a three month stretch of job cuts   including March  the worst single month for job losses since the recession   that wiped out all of last year s modest gains  Manufacturing s job problem undercuts hopeful forecasts that U S  companies would bring significant numbers of jobs back from overseas  That s simply not happening to a degree sufficient to offset the continuing exodus of work and suggest deeper problems roiling factory floors   The fallout is most visible on the U S  campaign trail  where Donald Trump has ridden the wave of anger about losing jobs to become the presumptive nominee for Republican party  But interviews with more than a dozen company executives and analysts across the U S  heartland show the plight of manufacturing is more than a campaign slogan   People are hanging on by their fingernails

chief economist at Markit  told Reuters the job cuts are driven by a mix of  disappointing order books  and a cloudier political outlook    Companies are becoming more reluctant to expand and more cost conscious  so that cutback in hiring is a reflection of that   said Williamson  By his estimate  U S  factories are now cutting an average of 10 000 jobs a month  and he sees that continuing  It

CAT,2016-05-09,"By David Randall  Svea Herbst Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne NEW YORK  Reuters    Hedge fund manager David Einhorn has built a reputation on his ability to crater a company s stock   His prescient short calls such as Allied Capital and Lehman Brothers had been announced in previous years at the annual Sohn Investment Conference in New York  And so  as he took the took the stage at the event after the U S  stock market closed on May 4  audience members were eagerly anticipating what would come next   In a 15 minute presentation  he laid out why industrial company  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  should trade at half its current value  The next day  the stock opened lower  but was down just 1 percent  After a decade in which hedge fund assets nearly doubled  there are several signs that the golden era for the  2 9 trillion industry may be on the wane  draining the influence of fund managers who once considered themselves masters of the universe  Once able to command hefty fees by routinely beating the Street  hedge funds are now facing a storm of unsatisfied clients who are demanding either steep discounts or withdrawing their funds entirely  leaving some in the industry wondering whether the pain is just beginning  The same day that Einhorn spoke in New York  the chief investment officer for the California State Teachers Retirement System called the typical hedge fund fee model  broken   A few weeks earlier  the New York City Employee s Retirement Fund announced that it was pulling out of hedges completely  Einhorn is a prime example of the industry s troubles  Last year  his Greenlight Capital lost 20 percent  marking the fund s first down year since the 2007 09 financial crisis and only its second ever annual loss since its inception in 1996   Greenlight investors have expressed their disappointment by pulling money  helping shrink assets to roughly  9 billion  down some  3 billion from only eight months ago  Einhorn  who declined to comment for this story  acknowledged the tough new environment when he wrote to investors in January  we have never had a year where so little went right   and pledged the firm would  concentrate on trying to make better returns   FEES FALL AS FUNDS MULTIPLY In part  the industry is a victim of its own popularity   With an estimated 10 046 global hedge funds and funds of hedge funds according to Hedge Fund Research Inc  HFR    near the record high in 2014   investors and analysts say that many managers are chasing the same ideas  driving spreads downward and lowering potential returns  At the same time  extraordinarily low global interest rates are keeping a lid on returns from arbitrage strategies that attempt to exploit differences between global economic policies  for example  Daniel Loeb  who runs  17 5 billion Third Point  said pointedly in a recent letter to investors  as most investors have been caught offsides at some or multiple points over the past eight months  the impulse to do little is understandable    Last year the average hedge fund lost slightly more than 1 percent  according to HFR  but with billionaire stars like Larry Robbins  the founder of Glenview Capital Management  and William Ackman  the founder of Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management  nursing double digit losses   So far this year the average manager   across all strategies   is again down nearly 1 percent  while the broader U S  stock market is up  albeit slightly  As a result  hedge funds are under increasing pressure to lower their typical fee structure  which charges 2 percent of assets invested plus 20 percent of gains  or face investors pulling assets in favor of other illiquid investments ranging from private equity to real estate  or even low cost market index funds  Incentive fees   the amount of investment gains that a hedge fund manager can take of client gains   fell by an average of 5 3 percent between the end of 2011 and year end 2015  according to HFR  and some wealth advisors say they expect it to fall further   When you have too much capital chasing the same ideas and deals  it s going to narrow the return   said Darell Krasnoff  senior managing director at Bel Air Investment Advisors  who has halved his allocation to hedge funds over the last five years and moved money into commercial real estate instead    There s not that many people who can justify 2 and 20  percent  out there   he said   LACK OF TALENT   Overall  investors pulled  15 1 billion out of hedge funds in the first three months of this year  according to data tracker HFR  marking the first quarters of consecutive outflows since the financial crisis  To be sure  institutional investors such as pensions and endowments have few safe places to put their billions of dollars with stocks at relatively expensive levels and many bonds yielding little to nothing  And recent surveys of large investors showed that many plan to increase their allocation to hedge funds   The average allocation among U S  public pension funds to hedge funds is up slightly this year  to 9 2 percent of assets from 9 percent the year before  Yet public criticism has grown more common  even from within the financial industry  A day before Einhorn s speech  commercial insurer AIG Inc  N AIG  blamed poor hedge fund performance for its lousy quarterly earnings results and said it would be pulling  4 1 billion it has invested in the industry  The day before that  billionaire investor Steven Cohen  who now manages  11 billion for so called family office Point72  told an audience at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles that the days of funds routinely generating 30 percent annual returns were over

CAT,2016-05-09,"This year was supposed to be fairly predictable  much more so than in 2015  but something happened on the way to the forum  which has sent analysts back to their respective crystal balls to make a major mid course correction after only four months  Our wonderfully unpredictable Fed seems to be at the root of the hysteria  but any intransigence on their part is only tied to the global economy  which has only been lackluster of late  Common sense and fundamental analysis seem to have no place in this  new normal  type of world that has overtaken us 
Divergence of central banking policies is still at the top of the list  but newly transpiring inverse correlations and what some analysts are calling  an inexplicable divergence between the performance of the stock market and market fundamentals  are causing concerns that heretofore had been mildly ignored  Was ignorance bliss  If two speeding locomotives are headed towards one another on a single track  is it time to get off the train  In just three months  the U S  dollar index plunged 3 4   ostensibly because the Fed had backed off four rate changes in favor of two for 2016  A full recovery was the plan for the second quarter  but  low and behold  the USD plummeted another 4  in the month of April alone  Something smells  and the odor will not leave the room 
When 2016 commenced  the prevailing forecasts touted a  simple triad  of drivers   Fed normalization  China  and commodity prices  primarily oil  Europe was but a footnote  a curveball that would be dealt with when and if it occurred  As a bit of a surprise  GDP growth in Europe for the first quarter was 0 6   one tenth of a percent better than the United States for the same period  but regional economists are already stepping back from this good tiding and swearing that slower times are ahead  Oil has bounced back around  45 a barrel  but no one is taking it seriously  and China shows signs of stability  though nothing that exciting  Based on these events  no one now believes the Fed will hike rates again until 2017  What  Come again 
Why has there been such a sudden shift in the general consensus 
It is quite surprising to observe how suddenly analysts have turned on the proverbial dime  as if fear and uncertainty had a death grip on their respective jugular veins  During the formative days of Chaos Theory development  the most overused metaphor had to do with a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil  only to create downstream a tornado in Texas  The idea was that  in certain systems like the weather for example  a small change in initial conditions could geometrically morph into a major driver of change 
There is a heightened frenzy among analysts today to ferret out the guilty financial butterfly in our midst  before the dreaded  Butterfly Effect  takes hold of our global markets  The feeling is definitely that the vast majority of us all has missed some key link or linchpin that  when found  will save us all from destruction  Pessimists are already circulating videos that forecast a horrific collapse in stock valuations  but you can be spared the pain if only you would sign up for their newsletter for a small fee  No one is predicting a recession in a presidential election year  but 2017 is still suspect 
The simple truth is that not that much has changed  Yes  the Fed may raise interest rates  if it makes sense on a global basis to do so  Yes  China s growth is slowing  but not precipitously  as in  hard landing   Yes  commodities are making a gradual comeback  but nothing that will light the fires of inflation that central bankers are hoping for  and  Yes  Europe is Europe  After so many years in constant crisis mode  forgive us if we do not jump when Mario Draghi cries   Wolf   Like previous worries   Brexit  fears will also come and go  when the British electorate wakes up to reality and votes  No  
What has not changed and has not gone away is the fear of what awaits us in the form of consequences for central banking missteps over the past decade  A host of global banking experts have constrained market forces for far too long  In this case  the elephant in the room has flapped his ears  and the effect could be monumental  What have these bankers wrought  The primary mission of any central bank is to maintain stable prices by monitoring capital flows  regulating currency impacts  and preventing the appearance of asset  bubbles   The following chart illustrates an   asset bubble  that has been in the making for quite some time  all due to monetary accommodation of late 

At first glance  the correlation depicted above is both apparent and counter intuitive  The  Adjusted Monetary Base  is the sum of the money supply plus banking reserves stockpiled at the Fed  Prior to the financial crisis of 2008  this data point grew in lockstep with the economy  as one would expect  After the crisis  various programs designed to pump more liquidity into the banking system created a steep ramp up in the monetary base  In 2008  banking reserves stood at barely  2 billion  but today they equate to an astronomical figure of  2 4 trillion 
These funds were supposed to encourage banks to invest in higher risk assets  namely small to medium sized business loans  in order to fuel a broader based recovery  The funds  however  have been parked at the Fed  while the economy went wanting  The monetary base did reach a plateau in 2014  when the Fed discontinued its QE program of buying bonds in the open market  and subsequently  the stock market plateaued  as well  and began its gradual descent right on cue  The only volatility over the past year or so was due to market angst over impending rate hikes 
Why is there such a tight correlation  How can banking reserves at the Fed find their way into the stock market  Without more investigation into to games that banks can play with repo agreements and other financial derivatives  the answers to these questions will remain unanswered and the grist of conspiracy theorists  The bottom line conclusion of one analyst is that   The bottom line is that the fundamentals don t seem to matter  and they haven t mattered for a very long time  Instead  I think that there is a more powerful force at work  which is dictating the short  to intermediate term moves in the broad market  and bringing new meaning to the phrase   don t fight the Fed   
What other insights can be discerned from this apparent correlation 
We have to assume for the moment that Ms  Yellen and her other banking buddies at the Fed are well aware of this confusing correlation  If they do move forward with more rate hikes  the direct result would be a tightening of the money supply  which  according to this chart  would imply a further deterioration in stock valuations  something the Fed would rather avoid  If the gradual economic recovery is to continue  then the Fed would like to see more business investment and consumer spending  not the opposite  which is the normal response when the stock market tanks 
Regardless of what many conservatives might espouse  the Fed also wants a weaker dollar  if only to aid a recovery in export related businesses  where some 12 million jobs are at stake  The Trade Weighted USD index has surged over 20  since 2014  Exports  as a percentage of GDP  have been hit hard  as illustrated below 

In this case  the correlation observed is intuitive and unmistakable  It is no surprise  In fact  many analysts had predicted that the dollar would weaken after interest rate normalization commenced  Markets always tend to overshoot the mark  a basis for many winning strategies in the trading arena  and in this instance  the greenback had appreciated very well  with momentum no less  before any rate hikes had achieved liftoff  The USD needs to weaken  as it is doing  It should not come as a surprise to anyone 
Gold has also gone on a tear in 2016  rising nearly 25  in just four months  Many analysts view this correction as expected  a time honored reverse correlation with the dollar  Despite the Bank of Japan s efforts to the contrary  the yen continues to strengthen  as well  another sign of capital shifting allegiances towards a base currency for carry trade strategies  The euro and pound are also improving  due in part to better economic data and to recent surveys that suggest that a  Brexit  may not be in the cards  The euro is perhaps as high as it will go  European economists  bothered by the lagging demand from China  reduced GDP growth forecasts for both 2016 and 2017 
And what about China  Recent PMI data was not encouraging  although the declines were nearly microscopic  The good news is that feedback from various corporate CEOs that run companies with large operations in the Middle Kingdom has been positive  Many are seeing a gradual improvement in their respective order books  and firms  like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and others  are observing broad based improvements across the region  No one is expecting gigantic growth spurts  as in the past  The transition from a previous emphasis on manufacturing to a service based economy is real and ongoing in China 
Concluding Remarks
Yes  financial markets are in a period of transition at the moment  The Fed is scaling back its interest rate normalization process  The dollar  as a result  will continue its ranging behavior  Capital will shift  causing abrupt swings in the foreign exchange market  There is  however  no fear in the streets  as some profess  The  VIX  index  also known as a barometer of fear motivations  presently sits around a value of 15  its normal support level  The great collapse of everything financial is not imminent  but it will remain a topic for discussion in several investor newsletters 
So what is the problem  Everyone keeps expecting the global economic engine to kick into a higher gear  but it just keeps sputtering along  Economists opine that   U S  activity remains surprisingly weak   The analysts over at Citigroup describe the peril in another way   Policy space to respond to a potential downturn remains limited almost everywhere  With the efficacy of monetary easing waning and some central banks close to the effective lower bounds of their interest rates  any additional accommodation could hinge on cooperation between lawmakers in advanced economies  many of which already have elevated debt to GDP ratios  
Central bankers got us into this mess  and their exit strategy will be long and drawn out  Expect volatility to increase  and with it  trading opportunities

Well I called Monday higher and while the SPX and the Nasdaq both indeed did end higher  the Dow did not  therefore that counts as a miss  though with just a 35 point loss  the damage was limited  In any event we now move on to Tuesday 
The technicals
The Dow  The Dow was dragged down on Monday by a poor showing in Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   That left us with a fat red spinning top as a dark cloud cover  But the indicators are still only just barely off oversold and the stochastic has just completed a bullish stochastic crossover  With this sort of opposition  I m not calling this chart tonight 
The VIX  At least I got this one right when I wrote  this chart looks ready for more downside on Monday  because the VIX fell another one percent Monday as the indicators dropped off overbought and the stochastic confirmed a bearish crossover  That leaves this chart continuing to look negative 
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 1 26 AM EDT with ES up 0 19   On Monday ES put in a small gain on a little green spinning top  That left the indicators all mixed up with RSI and the stochastic rising but momentum  money flow and OBV falling  But the new overnight seems to be disconfirming the spinning top  with a move higher 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot rises from 2045 92 to 2054 08  That leaves ES still above its new pivot so this indicator continues bullish 
Dollar index  Last night I wrote  there are no bearish signs on this chart tonight  and indeed there weren t as on Monday the dollar rose another quarter percent on a fat little gap up green spinning top  The indicators are all rising towards overbought but not there yet so it s too soon to call a move lower here 
Euro  And I was also right when I wrote  there s still more selling in store here on Monday  as the euro continued lower this time to 1 13955 on a red spinning top  Indicators continue their march lwoer towards oversold but are sitll not there yet and the stochastic is still nowhere near curving around for a bullish crossover  And with the new overnight continuing lower still it s premature to call a move higher yet 
Transportation  The trans were stuck in neutral on Monday with a small doji star stuck on top of Friday s action that took a stab at the 200 day MA but was ultimately repulsed  But the indicators while rising remain oversold and the stochastic has just completed a bullish crossover so there still seems to be room to run here 

The forces at work last night are still in play tonight so I m going to give this another trry  After all both the SPX and the Nasdaq moved higher Monday and I see no reason why they should reverse course now so I m going for the positive side again and calling Tuesday higher

CAT,2016-06-02,"We are almost half way through 2016 and I have to say  it has been an interesting year so far  I m sure you would agree 
In my opinion  the major theme isn t the Chinese economic slowdown and potential for more RMB devaluation  even though a lot of folks would argue for it  I also believe it isn t the Federal Reserve s next interest rate hike  which just about everyone is obsessed with  especially the financial media  
Nor is it the US election and the potential Trump vs Clinton battle  European readers might advocate for  Brexit  
Personally  I believe it s something the financial media hasn t started to focus on yet  The US stock market which has dramatically outperformed other assets over the last few years is not  the only game in town  anymore  Global macro investors  like me   are finally starting to gain in performance by holding assets other than the S P 500  and it s about time

And finally  one of my favourite trades for 2016  potential for strong upside in the  due to expected La Nina 

Year to date  my normal portfolio has managed to achieve 8  gain  with the month of May being my first down month  there is also a more aggressive version  but that s a story for another day   So far  I have matched the Treasury Long Bond performance  iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT    while outperforming US Equities and publicly listed Real Estate Trusts 
This return was achieved by holding a diversified portfolio spread across global assets such as  equities  bonds  real estate  precious metals  commodities and cash  relative currency positions   Moreover  if we measure apples to apples and observe the 12 month returns  similar to the first chart   my fund is up 9 4  with standard deviation risk of 7 6   I am happy to say that we have outperformed the S P 500 by some 800 basis points and more importantly with only 46  of the S P s volatility 
Let me now switch gears from investing toward the global economy  where there is a growing evidence that not all is well 

In a recent Bloomberg article  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  warned policy makers that   the global economy is slipping into a self fulfilling  low growth trap    Recent OECD LEIs  seen in the chart above  have been sending a warning signal that growth is now below trend and slowing in all major regions  From the Bloomberg article 

According to the Paris based group  which advises its 34 member countries  too much of the burden of lifting growth has been left to central banks  After pushing interest rates below zero and pumping money into their economies through asset purchases  they are starting to see diminishing returns and their actions could even generate financial market volatility  
 Overall a rather mediocre  a rather dismal outlook   the OECD secretary general  Angel Gurria  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Paris before the outlook was released   Trade is growing at 2 to 3 percent  it should be growing at 7  


Global trade  which is so critical for healthy economic activity  definitely remains very slow according to recent South Korean export numbers  Regular readers already know that I closely track this data point  which I believe is a great barometer of the overall global economy  note  South Korean major exports include semiconductors  petrochemicals  machinery  automobiles  ships  steel  LCD and wireless communication devices   while major trading partners include China  25 percent of total exports   ASEAN  14 percent   the United States  10 percent  and the European Union  9 percent   

When I saw a huge drop in South Korean exports to China in the month of May  I was personally scratching my head and wondering if it was a data mistake  The truth is  global trade figures are not improving despite the fact that central banks continue to goose up financial markets with more and more monetary easing 
In Q1 of 2016  G20 trade figures   Furthermore  as my good friend in Hong Kong recently noted   between LA and HK fell dramatically in 2015 and first half of 2016 
Moreover  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  sales to Asia have been posting  since December 2012  Obviously  a fall in global trade is closely correlated to the ongoing slowdown in manufacturing 
For the month of May  a JP Morgan Global PMI report stated that 

The global manufacturing sector maintained its lethargic start to 2016  Rates of expansion in production and new orders also eased to a near stagnation  while the pace of contraction in new export business was one of the steepest during the past three years  The muted performance of manufacturing was also reflected in the labour market  as staffing levels fell for the fourth straight month 


Breaking it down by region  the JP Morgan report had a narrative skewed towards anaemic growth in North America and Europe  with a continued slowdown in Asia and South America  chart above  

Although the US PMI remained above the 50 0 no change mark  its rate of expansion eased to its lowest since the  Markit  survey began in October 2009  The euro area PMI slid to a three month low in May  but nonetheless remained above the global average for the fifteenth month running  The two largest Asian manufacturing economies   China and Japan   both contracted in May  The downturn in Russia eased closer to stabilisation  The Brazil PMI sank to its weakest level in over seven years  placing it at the bottom of the global rankings  



It is just as important to note that not all of Asia is struggling  I ve been living in Vietnam for the last 6 months and Saigon is a boom town  The county s growth rate  manufacturing sector and export volumes remain one of the bright spots in the region 
It seems that we are experiencing a slow but steady relocation of factories from China to Vietnam  The TPP deal   if it passes   should create further benefits for this rising economy 
The same cannot be said about the United States   from Richmond to Philly showed a huge reversal in manufacturing sentiment  The rebound from Q1 was short lived and more disappointments could be on the way  especially with so many uncertainties on the horizon  including the Fed s next rate hike and the looming US election featuring undesirable candidates 

The Philly Fed General Activity Index is another indicator which makes it to my personal favourites list  In mid February  just as risk assets were bottoming out  I wrote 

  the current  Philly Fed  conditions closely resembles the slowdown of the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis and my best guess is that the US economy is not in a recession just yet  However  I would like to add that without any notable recovery from here onward  we could very well be on the cusp of one  

The three month moving average has jumped back above the zero line and the US economy still continues to muddle through  for now   However  the numbers are skewed towards only one positive monthly reading  during which both the ECB and BoJ were adding more stimulus while the Federal Reserve turned dovish and delayed the rate hike 
In general  recession risks continue to linger for the world s largest economy 

In June  the US expansion turns 84 months old  which is right on a seven year mark   This is now the fourth longest expansion since World War II  Average expansions generally last about 62 months with a median of 58 months 
Common sense would tell us that the longer the expansion runs  the closer we are to the next downturn  However  we don t live in a common sense kind of a world anymore 
My belief is that Federal Reserve  and other central banking buddies  have made it their outright mandate  above inflation and employment data  to keep this expansion going for as long as possible  Eventually  markets will refuse to play the  easing  game and a financial shock could easily fabricate another meaningful slowdown in global economy 
With debt levels higher than they were in 2007  we should be asking ourselves if the next downturn might be worse than the one in 2008 ",Tiho Brkan,0.073,0.809,0.118,0.9967

5 Stocks to Combat Brexit Fears

Fresh polls on Brexit showed that support for Britain remaining within the European Union was gaining strength  Several market watchers believe that this is an outcome of the death of the Jo Cox and sentiment arising from the incident  Others cited advertisements from Brexit proponent Nigel Farage as the reason for a swing in favor of the  remain  campaign 

However  the EU and U S  companies with significant investments in Europe are bracing themselves for the impact of a possible Brexit  Adding stocks of U S  companies which conduct most  if not all of their business  within the country looks like a prudent option at this point 

Threat to the EU s Stability

Despite the optimism arising from fresh polls  EU officials have planned to conduct a series of emergency meetings in a situation where Britain decides to leave the economic bloc  The intention of these meetings is to mitigate the fear of a ripple effect on relatively weaker economies  Polls conducted earlier had shown that the  leave  side held an edge  read     

Among the members who are at high risk is Ireland  with close economic links with both Britain and Portugal  Meanwhile  Germany s foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeier has said that the EU must work to prevent the disintegration of the economic bloc in the event of a Brexit  Such a move could cause irreparable harm to the economic bloc and spark off other such events 

Companies Investing in Europe at Risk

Meanwhile  the entire world and several U S  companies in particular are watching events in Britain with bated breath  The reason for this is simple  In 2015  the U S  had exported goods worth  56 billion to Britain  However  that figure seems insignificant to the  588 billion invested by U S  companies across several sectors within that country 

On the other hand  Britain provides employment to nearly a million workers within the U S  and has invested half a trillion dollars in the economy  In the case of Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   the company has 16 plants and 9 000 employees within the United Kingdom  Most of the goods produced here are exported to Europe and other countries across the world  But that state of affairs would cease to exist in case Britain decides to exit the E U 

U S  Remains the Best Bet

Despite recent weaknesses  the U S  economy continues to remain in relatively better shape compared to other countries  Last Thursday  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  said the U S  was staging one of the best comebacks among all developed nations  According to a report released by the OECD  production has exceeded its highest level before the crisis by 10   Additionally  the labor market is in good health largely due to strong levels of private sector employment 

This may seem difficult to believe at first glance  but most market watchers are expecting a strong rebound  However  OECD data shows that the U S  remains ahead of all other developed nations by a wide margin  Compared to the first quarter of 2008  the U S  economy has displayed growth of 10 85  till the same period this year  In comparison  the Eurozone has grown by 0 64  and Japan by 0 06  

Our Choices

Optimism has increased about the chances that Britain may opt to remain within the E U  But the events related to this referendum have proved that the economic bloc may have turned brittle  particularly after the migrant crisis 

This is why it is important to invest not just in U S  companies  but in those who conduct most of their operations within the country  At the same time  it is important to pick winning stocks 

This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

CAT,2016-07-27,"Here are five big league reasons to evaluate your current asset mix 
1  Credit Fundamentals Are Deteriorating
What do you remember about the financial crisis in 2008  Perhaps you think about a term like  subprime mortgage   Or maybe you recall the way home values and stock prices collapsed  Either way  most would agree that households and businesses with too much access to credit borrowed beyond their means 
Is it happening again in 2016  The Fitch Fundamentals Index  FFI  tracks changes in credit fundamentals across ten key areas of the U S  economy  The FFI recently notched its lowest level since the 3rd quarter of 2009 
In truth  the current reading is less troublesome than the trend over time  Many of the subcomponents for the index are getting worse every quarter  Corporate defaults  Awful  Credit default swaps  Perilous  Meanwhile  global growth concerns have been pressuring company forecasts for how much they might spend on land  buildings as well as equipment in the foreseeable future 

2  Margin Debt Is Sinking
The New York Stock Exchange recently acknowledged that margin debt declined for the second consecutive month in June  It is now sitting near the levels of the recent January February stock swoon 
Again  the individual data point may be far less relevant than the longer term trend  Historically speaking  investors borrow money to leverage their success with stocks  The activity helps propel U S  benchmarks to new highs  When margin debt peaks and then begins reversing itself  though  severe stock declines have followed 
Margin debt reversal accompanied stock price disintegration in 2000 s  New Economy   The turnaround for buying stocks in margin accounts escorted price destruction in the 10 07 3 09 bear  So far  real S P 500 growth has managed to hold up since margin debt peaked a little more than a year ago  Nevertheless  benchmark progress has been insubstantial since margin debt peaked 

3  Valuations Are Divorcing From Rationality
According to Goldman Sachs  the S P 500 s forward price to earnings  P E  ratio has surged 75  in just under five years  Specifically  since September of 2011  Forward P Es have moved from 10 to 18 
What may be particularly telling here is that the expansion cycle for prices relative to profits is the third largest over the last 40 years  The others  Forward P Es rocketed 111  from 1984 1987 before the infamous Black Monday crash  They soared 115  from 1994 1999 prior to the bursting of the dot com bubble 
In actuality  the median constituent of the S P 500 has a Forward P E of 18 4   a multiple that rests in the 99th percentile of historical valuation levels  What s more  data at the S P Dow Jones  anticipates June 2017 GAAP earnings of  115 58  At 2167 on the S P 500  the Forward P E is an astronomical 18 75 and the Current P E on present earnings estimates of  88 53 is a ludicrous 24 5   Note  Collective earnings for the S P 500 rang in at nearly identical levels on 3 31 2012 at  88 54  


4  Demand For Perceived Safer Havens Is Still Beating Riskier Stocks
One might surmise that if the new all time records for the Dow Jones Industrials and S P 500 actually had teeth  demand for perceived safety would wane  On the contrary  In spite of the reality that precious metals do not offer a dividend or interest payment  investors still seem to want gold via the SPDR Gold Trust ETF  NYSE GLD   Regardless of the price volatility on low yielding 20 plus year Treasuries  the collective investment community still covets exchange traded trackers like iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT  
There s more  Since the start of the year  investors have been clamoring for more and more exposure to utility stocks via funds like SPDR Select Utilities  NYSE XLU    Riskier  high beta sectors like energy  financials and technology in PowerShares S P 500 High Beta Portfolio  NYSE SPHB   Not as much 
Granted  every asset class on the planet may have seen a significant bounce off of the February stock lows  And we can all thank the world s central banks  e g   Federal Reserve  Bank of Japan  Bank of England  European Central Bank  etc   for creating the monetary credits that find their way into market based securities  On the flip side  when  risk off defensive areas  are matching or surpassing the performance of  risk on  cyclical segments  it is rarely a bullish sign for the latter 

5  Global Recessionary Pressures Are Not Fading
Over the last two years   the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund  NYSE VTI  has gained roughly 8   Vanguard All World excluding the U S   NYSE VEU   The exchange traded fund registered  16  
It is true that the European Central Bank  ECB  and the Bank of Japan  BOJ  stepped up to the plate with more  stimulus  at the start of 2016  On the other hand  the U S  Federal Reserve backed off its pledge to raise rates four times in 2016  Yet is it really the case that the long term downtrend in overseas equities has been stopped in its tracks  Probably not  Is the U S  going to remain an island that only needs to rely on its  service economy   I doubt it 
Often overlooked in the debate between the importance of services relative to manufacturing is the reality that manufacturing still accounts for as much as half of the S P 500 s profits  So when manufacturing dynamos like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  experience 43 consecutive months of year over year declines in sales  or when quarterly sales for S P 500 constituents fall for six consecutive quarters  you ought to wonder if central bank accommodation  i e   manipulation  can keep the U S  stock train moving forward indefinitely

CAT,2016-07-28,"After failing to increase its dividend in June like it has in past years and continuing to report double digit declines in sales and earnings this week  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  has many dividend investors wondering about the safety of its current payout 
Caterpillar s revenue has declined from  66 billion in 2012 to a projected  40 billion in 2016  The company s retail sales have now fallen for more than 40 consecutive months 
None of this is new news from when I wrote  last fall  However  the macro situation does not appear to be getting any better 
In fact  billionaire hedge fund manager   He expects the company s stock to be more than cut in half over the next two years as the commodity supercycle continues to come to an end 
Despite the doom and gloom  the market reacted favorable to Caterpillar s  on Tuesday  July 26 
Caterpillar s stock has surged more than 7  since Monday despite reporting a 16  drop in revenue and a 22  decline in adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter 
Most likely  investors are happy that Caterpillar s outlook didn t get materially worse   perhaps the current downturn in commodity markets is nearing a bottom and not as bad as Einhorn believes 
Regardless  most of Caterpillar s key end markets are still feeling pain  Falling oil prices  depressed mining markets  and oversupplied construction equipment are all hurting volumes and pricing 
As a result  management slightly lowered Caterpillar s full year guidance 
Last quarter  management expected sales between  40 billion and  42 billion for 2016 
Today  Caterpillar sees sales coming in closer to  40 billion  Management cited additional uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote  unrest in Turkey  the U S  election  the recent retreat in crude oil prices  and several other factors 
Earnings per share are expected to come in at  2 75 in 2016 and  3 55 if Caterpillar s  700 million of restructuring costs are excluded 
As revenue continues to drop  Caterpillar is making every move it can to preserve profits  The company expects to take out over  2 billion in costs this year with its restructuring actions 
Combining office functions  laying people off  taking out manufacturing floor space  and reducing material costs are the primary drivers that will help Caterpillar increase its cost reductions from  1 1 billion year to date to more than  2 billion by the end of the year 
On the earnings call  management emphasized that maintaining Caterpillar s  credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities  
However  having lived through the financial crisis  we all know that sometimes there is only so much a company can do to protect its dividend 
This is particularly true for cyclical businesses with high financial leverage  Caterpillar is a meaningful position in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks and Conservative Retirees dividend portfolios  so I am keeping a particularly close eye on its dividend safety 
My goal is to never own a company that cuts its dividend  and the three portfolios in our monthly dividend newsletter have so far been successful with a combined 64 dividend increases and zero dividend cuts since their inception 
I believe there are a number of warning signs given by companies before they cut their dividends 
High payout ratios  stretched balance sheets  deterioration sales and earnings growth  weak free cash flow generation  and high business model volatility are a number of key indicators 
By closely studying a firm s  and business quality  investors can  
Let s take a closer look at where Caterpillar is today to evaluate the safety of its dividend 
Dividend Safety Analysis  Caterpillar
We analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Caterpillar s dividend and fundamental data charts can all be seen by  
Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  A score of 50 is average  75 or higher is considered excellent  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Caterpillar s Dividend Safety Score is 35  which indicates that the company s dividend payment is less secure than the average dividend paying stock in the market but is not at extremely risky levels  yet  
Most companies that cut their dividends have Dividend Safety Scores below 25 prior to announcing their dividend cut 
For example  Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   BHP Billiton  LON BLT   and Potash all scored below 20 for Dividend Safety before their dividend reductions were announced 
Let s take a closer look at the drivers behind Caterpillar s sub par Dividend Safety Score 
Caterpillar currently pays annual dividends of  3 08 per share  which is close to twice the amount of dividends it paid in 2008 of  1 56 per share 
The company s management team targets trough earnings per share between  2 50 and  3 50 
If Caterpillar s earnings guidance for 2016 is accurate   3 55 per share   its profits would sit at the high end of management s targeted trough earnings range 
At that level  Caterpillar s dividend payout ratio would be approximately 88    a risky level for most businesses  especially a cyclical company such as Cat 
When a company pays out most or all of its cash flow as a dividend  it is potentially jeopardizing its future 
Funds for reinvestment opportunities can be reduced  competitive advantages can be eroded  and the company could run into a cash crunch if its access to debt and equity markets is cut off 
The latter reason is why many firms reduced their dividend payouts during the financial crisis when credit markets froze and cash became an invaluable commodity to have 
However  some companies with high payout ratios and a strong commitment to paying uninterrupted dividends possess strengths which help them continue paying dividends through hard times 
Select companies can choose to use cash on hand and or take on debt to temporarily bridge any cash flow deficits caused by their dividend payments during periods of depressed business conditions 
Caterpillar is one of these businesses if push comes to shove 
Caterpillar paid out approximately  1 8 billion in dividends last fiscal year  While the company s cash flow could continue declining over the next year or two  pushing its payout ratio over 100   Caterpillar is fortunate to have nearly  6 8 billion in cash on hand 
Put another way  Caterpillar could use only its cash on hand to pay its current dividend for nearly four years before it would run out of money  assuming it did not need to make any debt repayments and continued generating positive free cash flow over that time  
The company s business model and strong cost controls also enable it to continue generating free cash flow in virtually every economic environment  which reduces its need to dip deeper into cash reserves or tap debt markets during times of distress 
As seen below  Caterpillar recorded positive free cash flow of  2 82 per share in fiscal year 2008 and continued to generate excellent cash flow the last few years despite weakness across its key end markets Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Should the company need to raise cash  it shouldn t have many problems either  Moody s  to negative in April 2016 but continues to give the company an investment grade rating 
Furthermore  Caterpillar s Machinery  Energy   Transportation business has a debt to capital ratio of 39   which sits somewhat below my preferred threshold of 50  
The company does finance a lot of its equipment to end customers  which could get it into serious trouble if these businesses cannot make their payments 
However  Cat Financial s portfolio continues performing very well  Past dues were 2 93  during the second quarter of 2016  which is slightly lower than the 2 97  rate recorded in the second quarter of 2015 and lower than historical averages 
Caterpillar also maintains three credit facilities with  2 75 billion available  The majority of its credit availability expires in 2018 and 2020  providing the company with a nice backstop through at least the next several years 
Equally important  the company s management team has been extremely committed to the dividend for over 80 years 
Caterpillar has paid a quarterly dividend  and increased its dividend for 22 consecutive years  In three years  the company will likely join the Dividend Aristocrats list  barring another major shock to the global economy 
Simply put  the company s management is very determined to continue paying dividends and will seemingly pull every lever possible before making a cut 
As long as current macro conditions stabilize and Caterpillar s cost reduction activities do not hurt its competitiveness  I believe the dividend should be safe 
However  if David Einhorn s short thesis plays out and commodities move lower for longer  Caterpillar could find itself in a situation down the road where its dividend could legitimately be at risk 
For now  I view this as a low probability event but will keep my eye on macro developments  Caterpillar s management team is obviously feeling cautious as well  choosing to forego the usual dividend increase in June 
Closing Thoughts on Caterpillar s Dividend
I believe Caterpillar s dividend is safe for at least the next year or two if current macro conditions do not improve or even experience a moderate decline 
However  the company s margin of safety is admittedly low if commodity markets take another leg down  which is certainly a possibility  sales plunged nearly 40  in 2009 to  32 4 billion  
I wouldn t mind rotating into a blue chip dividend stock with a safer  faster growing dividend payment   especially if Caterpillar s stock continues to rally higher 
However  there is not a great sense of urgency today given Caterpillar s operational strength  continued free cash flow generation  and generally healthy credit position ",Brian Bollinger,0.073,0.777,0.15,0.9991
CAT,2016-07-28,"The Q2 earnings season continues to show some modest improvement from the growth pace that we have become accustomed to seeing in other recent reporting cycles  Growth still remains problematic  with Q2 on track to be the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S P 500  But it isn t as bad as many of us feared ahead of the start of this earnings season  A number of bellwethers have disappointed with their results  but there have been plenty of positive surprises from others as well  In other words  for every Ford  F   Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   and Coke  KO  that disappointed this earnings season there has been a General Motors  NYSE GM   a United Technology  UTX   and a Pepsi  PEP  that did better than expected  This improvement in the earnings picture  howsoever modest  will likely add to confidence in second half expectations

Looking at Q2 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 278 S P 500 members that have reported results with estimates from the still to come 222 index members  earnings are expected to be down  3 4  from the same period last year on  0 4  lower revenues  This would be the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the index  Energy continues to be the big drag on the aggregate growth picture  with total earnings for the sector expected to be down  79 2  on  26  lower revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total earnings for the rest of the index would be modestly in the positive  up  0 1   
Estimates for the current period  2016 Q3  have started coming down  with total earnings for the index currently expected to be down  1 5  from the same period last year  which is a decline from flat growth estimates at the start of July  Keep in mind  however  that the pace and magnitude of negative revisions to Q3 estimates is tracking below what we would typically see in the comparable periods of other recent reporting cycles  This decelerating trend in Q3 earnings estimates is part of the aforementioned modest improvement in the overall earnings picture ",Zacks Investment Research,0.071,0.768,0.161,0.994

CAT,2016-08-25,"WASHINGTON  Aug 25  Reuters    New orders for U S manufactured capital goods rose for a second straight month in July as demand for machinery and a range of other products
picked up  offering a tentative sign that a business spending downturn was starting to ease 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy forbusiness spending plans  increased 1 6 percent last month  That was the largest gain since January and followed an upwardly revised 0 5 percent rise in June  These so called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have gained 0 4 percent in June  That was the first back to back increase since January 2015 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising only 0 3 percent last month  Business spending has contracted since the fourth quarter of 2015  in part as companies slashed capital spending budgets in response to lower oil prices  The increase in core capital goods orders comes as oil and gas drilling activity has been rising in recent months  Still  business investment is likely to be tepid in the third quarter amid uncertainty over the global economy after Britain s decision to leave the European Union and ahead of the U S  presidential election  economists say 
Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar   N CAT  last month lowered its 2016 forecast  citing sluggish demand in mining and other industries  Weak business spending contributed to holding down economic growth to 1 0 percent in the first half of 2016  Shipments of core capital goods  which are used to calculate

CAT,2016-11-23,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for U S  manufactured capital goods rebounded in October  driven by rising demand for machinery and a range of other equipment  the latest indication of an acceleration in economic growth early in the fourth quarter   The brightening economic outlook received a further boost from other data on Wednesday showing a jump in consumer sentiment this month following the election of Donald Trump as the next president  Consumers embraced the business mogul s victory  which they viewed as positive for their personal finances and the economy s prospects   While the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose from a 43 year low last week  the trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a tightening labor market  The data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its December meeting and minutes of the bank s November policy meeting showed rate setters appeared confident that a rise would come  relatively soon    Everything seems to be moving in the right direction in the economy   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland  Pennsylvania   The weak links are recovering and the strengths are staying strong  The Fed is not going to continue doing nothing   The Commerce Department said non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  rose 0 4 percent after declining 1 4 percent in September  These so called core capital goods orders have now increased in four of the last five months  Shipments of core capital goods rose 0 2 percent last month after a 0 4 percent gain in September  Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement  A 12 percent surge in demand for transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods  items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more  which jumped 4 8 percent last month  That was the biggest rise in a year and followed a 0 4 percent increase in September  Even as the economy has regained momentum after stumbling in late 2015 and early 2016  business spending remained weak as companies struggled with the impact of a strong dollar and lower oil prices on profits  Business spending on equipment has declined for four straight quarters  weighing heavily on manufacturing  which accounts for 12 percent of the U S  economy   With core capital goods orders steadily increasing in tandem with rising gas and oil well drilling activity  there is cautious optimism that business investment on equipment will rebound in the fourth quarter   But gains are likely to be modest amid renewed strength in the dollar  The greenback s rally had appeared to run out of steam for much of the year  Still  the rise in both core capital goods orders and shipments mirrored data on industrial production and surveys in showing a nascent recovery in manufacturing   Activity in the manufacturing sector is getting a little better  but is still far from robust  The recent strengthening in the dollar does pose a renewed risk to growth in the industrial sector   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   In a separate report  the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose 8 2 points from the pre election reading to 93 8  That put the index 6 6 points above the October reading  UMich said the post election surge in optimism was widespread  with gains recorded among all income and age subgroups and across all regions of the country  BULLISH ECONOMIC SIGNALS The reports joined bullish data on housing starts  home and retail sales  as well as firming inflation in painting an upbeat picture of the economy at the start of the fourth quarter  The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 3 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  The economy grew at a 2 9 percent pace in the July September period  The data suggest Trump will inherit a strong economy from the Obama administration   Trump is the first president looking back to the early 90s to inherit an economy that is at full employment   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York   The irony is he became president by playing on many voters fears that the economy was rigged against them    Against the backdrop of the improving economy  the Fed is likely to hike interest rates at its Dec  13 14 policy meeting  The U S  central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade   The dollar rose against a basket of currencies to a more than 13 year peak  while U S  stocks were little changed with the Dow near a record high  Prices for U S  government debt fell  with two year note yields hitting 6 1 2 year highs   In another report on Thursday  the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 18 000 to a seasonally adjusted 251 000 for the week ended Nov  19  Claims have now been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a healthy labor market  for 90 straight weeks  That is the longest run since 1970  when the labor market was much smaller  The four week moving average of claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  fell 2 000 to 251 000 last week  Labor market strength is bolstering domestic demand  which in turn is feeding through to the manufacturing sector

be a real infrastructure bill that grows the paychecks of American workers    If Congress balks at writing a big check  there is talk of a mix of alternatives  One could involve new corporate income tax revenue from bringing foreign profits into the country  Others could be an infrastructure revolving fund  raising the gasoline tax or a new surface freight fee  experts said  These could help

CAT,2016-12-20,"Once again  the election results demonstrate that  It s the economy  stupid   Stock investors are certainly giving the president elect not only the benefit of the doubt but a big tailwind for his economic program  as the market capitalization of the S P 500 has increased by  1 0 trillion since election day to a record high  In fact  the votes of confidence since that day have been overwhelmingly positive  suggesting that Trump may have unleashed some animal spirits that might very well boost economic growth  Consider the following 
 1  Financial Stocks  Leading the way among the S P 500 sectors has been the Financials sector  In the past  leadership by this sector tended to be bullish for the overall market  REITs were removed from this sector on September 19  so it hasn t been weighed down by their relative weakness  Instead  the sector has soared as the yield curve has steepened and credit spreads have narrowed  Financial stocks have also been buoyed by the prospect of less government regulation 
Here is the S P 500 sector performance derby since the election through Friday of last week  Financials  17 2    Telecom Services  10 8   Energy  10 3   Industrials  7 7   Materials  7 0   S P 500  5 5   Consumer Discretionary  5 3   Health Care  2 0   IT  2 0   Real Estate  0 5   Consumer Staples   0 9   and Utilities   1 2    See   
 2  Credit Markets  In my meetings with our accounts in Toronto and Chicago last week  I opined that November 8 might have marked the end of the New Normal  or secular stagnation  and comeback of the Old Normal  That s certainly reflected in the 10 year US Treasury bond yield  which jumped to 2 60  on Friday  up from 1 88  on election day 
So far  the credit markets aren t signaling that the backup in bond yields might cause a recession  On the contrary  the yield curve has steepened by 42bps since the election  based on the spread between the 10 year US Treasury bond and the federal funds rate  The yield curve spread is one of the 10 components of the index of leading indicators  and it usually turns negative before a recession  It had been narrowing prior to the election  but has turned more positive since then 
Another upbeat signal from the credit markets is that the spread between corporate bond yields and the 10 year Treasury yield continues to narrow after peaking during February  The spread widened significantly during the second half of 2014 and during 2015 on fears that the plunge in oil prices might trigger a financial contagion  Instead  it caused a recession that was contained within the energy sector  which has been recovering since early this year along with the price of oil  Most encouraging is that the corporate high yield credit spread has narrowed from a peak of 844bps on February 11 to 363bps last Wednesday  the lowest reading since October 6  2014 
 3  Business Surveys  Among the most spectacular votes of confidence for a  New Morning  scenario for the US economy are December s business surveys for the Fed s Philadelphia and New York districts  The average of their two composite indexes jumped from 4 6 during October to 15 3 this month  the highest reading since November 2014 
The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index jumped from 94 9 during October to 98 4 last month  the biggest one month increase since April 2009  The NAHB Housing Market Index rose this month to the highest reading since July 2005 thanks to a sharp increase in traffic of prospective home buyers  This is happening either despite the jump in mortgage rates or because of it as potential buyers scramble to purchase before rates go still higher 
 4  Consumer Sentiment  As we noted last week  the Consumer Sentiment Index has increased from a 14 month low of 87 2 during October to 98 0 during the first half of December  At the end of the month  the final number will be reported in addition to the readings for December s Consumer Confidence Index  November s results for the latter showed that confidence was especially strong among survey respondents who are under 35 years old  If Trump can make young adults happier  maybe we will see an increase in household formation  marriages  babies and home buying 
 5  Still Ahead  There are still plenty of post election surveys ahead  including those of the other three Fed districts that will be reporting their December business surveys  Business Roundtable conducts a survey of corporate CEOs  The quarterly index that is compiled from the survey is a leading indicator for capital spending 
The Q4 survey was taken between October 26 and November 16  However  CEOs remained cautious  as their Economic Outlook Index didn t change much from Q3   America s business leaders are encouraged by President elect Trump s pledge to boost economic growth   said Doug Oberhelman  chairman and CEO of Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   and chairman of Business Roundtable   We will work with the incoming Administration and Congress to enact pro growth policies such as modernizing the U S  tax system  adopting a smarter approach to regulation  investing in infrastructure and focusing on the education and training people need to thrive in the 21st century economy  
He added   It s telling that for the fifth year in a row CEOs name regulation as their greatest cost pressure  We are encouraged by the promise of a renewed focus to usher in a smarter regulatory environment that promotes job creation and economic growth and also protects safety  health and the environment  
Our sources among our institutional accounts tell us that many CEOs are becoming increasingly exuberant about the prospects for Trump s policies  That should show up in the Q1 reading of Business Roundtable s CEO survey and in better capital spending next year 
 6  Commodities And Currencies  Remarkable votes of confidence since election day are also visible in the CRB raw industrials spot price index and the JP Morgan trade weighted dollar  The former is up 3 3   while the latter is up 4 7  since the election  The nearby futures price of copper is up 7 7  over this same period  In the past  a strong dollar tended to depress commodity prices 
So far  Donald s Trumpland seems a bit like Alice s Wonderland  In any event  financial and survey indicators suggest that while Clinton s supporters may continue to mourn  it may well be a new morning for the economy ",Ed Yardeni,0.045,0.778,0.177,0.9994
CAT,2016-12-26,"Without question  2016 was the year of the big surprise  Or to be more accurate  surprises 
The biggest surprises were the Brexit decision in late June  when despite all expectations to the contrary the UK electorate voted to leave the EU  sending markets into a tailspin for a few days while pushing sterling lower  Then  just when markets appeared to have regained their footing  the US electorate provided the next  possibly even bigger curveball the unexpected election of Donald Trump as 45th President of the United States 
Perhaps not a bombshell by the time it occurred  but nevertheless surprising in light of how long it took to play out  the Fed finally raised interest rates at the end of 2016  only the second time it hiked since 2006  after indicating at the end of 2015 that four hikes would probably occur in 2016 
It was an eventful year for markets from the outset  On January 4  the sharp selloff of the Shanghai Composite continued the meltdown that began in mid 2015  It was driven by fears of a slowdown of China s economy and additional yuan devaluation  Though government intervention stanched the bloodletting  it s been a roller coaster ride for Chinese markets throughout 2016 
February brought an additional shocker  crude oil prices hit their lowest level since May 2003  26 21bbl  Mid month the Dow was down 10  on the year 
Both the commodity and the benchmark index have recovered nicely  Currently crude is priced at around  53 00  while the Dow  having already reached a number of all time highs over the course of the year  now sits just a hair below its next record the hallmark 20 000 level 
Gold  which many assumed would be a major beneficiary of such risk events as Brexit  as investors and traders went in search of safe havens immediately after election results were announced  hit its 2016 high during July   1 364  Many predicted a new bull market for the Precious Metals complex  but the baby bull faltered and as of this writing appears to have died  at least for now  Gold is currently trading at around  1 130  its lowest level in 11 months 
There were some serious surprises in FX markets as well  The U S  dollar looked to be weakening as 2016 commenced  with the US Dollar Index hitting its 2016 low of 92 62 on May 2  But as events during the second half of the year played out  king dollar reasserted its strength  the DXY is currently hovering around 103 00  a level not seen since December 2002 
The GBP and EUR didn t fare nearly as well  The pound is currently trading at 1 2277 vs the USD  not far from a 31 year low of 1 2020 touched in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote  The euro is hovering at a 13 year low of  1 0456 though analysts predict there s USD parity in its near future  possibly followed by a fall below that benchmark 
As we await the inauguration of the US s next president  and markets continue to benefit  albeit perhaps less and less forcefully  from the Trump Bump  we asked 10 of our most popular contributors to tell us how they see markets performing as 2017 begins  
This installment covers Commodities and Currencies  Part 2  offers author calls on Stocks  Bonds and Inflation 

Ellen R  Wald  Ph D   Oil Price Will Stabilize  Shale Producers  Energy Investments To Revive
The price of oil should finally stabilize in 2017  OPEC  coming off its productive meeting at the end of November  is once again saying the right things and working towards cooperation to limit production and raise prices 
The OPEC production cuts may never be implemented fully and likely will not last for too long  and further hurdles remain to bringing the full range of non OPEC producers on board  but the movement is now clearly in the direction of combined production limits 
The impact on Tehran of the soon to be inaugurated Trump administration should also be favorable for oil prices  with the possibility of renewed sanctions and the certainty of added unease for foreign firms considering investments in Iran  The messages coming out of OPEC and Russia alone  will create price spikes  while the actions should set a floor price of at least  55 
The Aramco IPO coming either in late 2017 or in 2018 will be a success  Aramco is too well run and controls resources that are far too valuable for it to not succeed  However  investors will need to understand that the company will still be run by the Saudis and investors will only be along for the ride 
Renewed Life for Some Shale Producers
In the U S   higher oil prices will bring renewed life to some shale producers  Changes in government policy  brought by a new and friendly Republican administration  will open opportunities for a myriad of energy related investments and businesses 
Drilling on Federal land and offshore  especially along the Southeastern coastline  will be easier for small and large producers alike  Energy infrastructure projects  including pipelines  will see renewed possibilities as well  However  railroads as a transportation for oil will suffer if pipelines become preferred once again 
As was the case last year  a safe prediction is that 

 with continued low crude oil prices  below the 2014 highs of  112bbl   decreased global passion for climate change  and  a Republican administration in the White House  investors should be wary of renewable and clean technology in the long term  

Even when oil prices stabilize  it will be a while before they reach the high double digits that precipitated such economic interest in alternative energies 
Moreover  the global mood is turning against climate change fear  President elect Trump has stated multiple times that he supports  all  forms of energy  but investors should expect that any changes in the U S  tax code will hurt alternative energy and electric car startups  The Department of Energy will likely alter or lessen its venture capital like behavior as well  providing less Federal assistance to alternative energy businesses 
Global and US Refinery Upgrades
For more risky opportunities  consider refining projects in both India and the U S  While India is not likely to become the next China for energy consumption purposes  India is now the third largest energy consumer and will be particularly in need of enhanced refining capacity 
American refineries are also in need of an upgrade  particularly to handle the volume and type of shale oil produced  Before the U S  is able to increase its refining capacity  however  look for U S  oil exports to pick up in 2017 

Matthew Ashley  GBP  EUR  AUD Likely Under Fire In 2017
In the coming year  the markets are likely to be dominated by geopolitical forces and stifled GDP growth which will have a myriad of consequences  Among the currencies likely to be most exposed to these forces will be the GBP  EUR  and AUD  As a result  the bears out there could be cruising for a year of sizable downside potential 
Starting with the GBP  the inescapable fallout of Brexit will still be felt next year  especially as the UK government navigates its disentanglement from the Eurozone  As a result of this  the policy responses from the Teresa May led government will be in the headlights and news regarding the negotiations around Brexit and the role of the UK going forward could be as influential as Interest rates or even GDP results 
Moreover  given the current lean towards a  Hard Brexit  the outlook is looking fairly grim for the UK and  by extension  the GBP  The cost of a hard Brexit is forecasted at around  66bn per annum for the UK Treasury and could reduce long term GDP growth in the UK by up to 9 5  
EU Challenges Could Keep EUR Depressed
Looking across the channel  the EUR could be in for a no easier time than its UK counterpart  Whilst the effects of Brexit will be somewhat more muted on the continent  the EU faces challenges from within which could keep the EUR depressed in the coming year 
Specifically  the growing fears over the rise of Front National  in the wake of the apparent global swing towards hard right populist leadership  will be central to the EUR s health moving forward  This is due to Ms  Le Pen s commitment to following the UK s lead and exiting France from the EU  the result of which would likely be catastrophic for the Union 
Consequently  assuming we have learned our lesson from both the Brexit and Donald Trump  the market should be giving the EUR a wide birth as long as Ms  Le Pen has a shot at seizing power 
Australian Mining Boom No Longer Able to Prop Up Economy 
Finally  the antipodes will also be feeling the heat as the threat of recession looms over the Australian economy  Only recently having posted a contractionary quarterly GDP result of  0 5   speculation is already rife that the nation s mining boom is no longer able to prop up the economy 
Such fears are hardly surprising  especially given dwindling CAPEX and investment over the last 12 consecutive quarters  As a result of the impending downturn  expectations of stimulative interest rate cuts in the New Year will be surging which will likely put the Aussie dollar under some significant pressure  What s more  the effect of these cuts will spill over to the country s Pacific neighbour  New Zealand  and force them to follow suit and devalue the NZD in the process 

Taki Tsaklanos  Copper  Crude  Gold  Additional Assets  Watch This Market Risk Barometer
Our proprietary market barometer looks at all leading markets  and gives a sense of intermarket dynamics  The point in this is that markets do not move in a vacuum  they move in relation to each other 
Right now  risk assets are in a bullish mode  stocks  yields  copper and crude are all in a long term uptrend  On the other hand  gold and the Japanese yen  both fear assets  are in a long term downtrend 
The market barometer reflects the state of markets at a given point in time  To get a sense of what the future will bring  we look at our leading indicator  20 year Treasury yields  The chart below makes the point that 20 year yields introduce a new phase in markets  risk on vs risk off  exactly at times when extreme high or low fear levels coincide with peaks and bottoms on its long term chart  see red and green circles on the chart  

Right after the Brexit vote  20 year yields bottomed  For many it was a time of maximum fear  That was a turning point for risk  Since then  risk assets started outperforming fear assets  Stock markets broke to all time highs  copper and crude rallied  while gold sold off 
Risk on Through First Part of 2017
With our leading indicator suggesting risk is on  we expect this trend to continue into the first part of 2017  As of the summer  our expectation is that stock markets will start correcting  potentially very sharply  Bonds will become attractive at that point  in line with our former bond market outlook  while commodities will certainly not be attractive 
When it comes to gold  it is too hard to make a prediction  If gold continues to behave as a fear asset  we expect gold to head into a long term uptrend  The challenge with gold is that it has two faces  On the one hand  it is a fear asset  On the other hand  it is an inflation deflation driven asset  Gold s prospects always need to be assessed in the context of what other markets are doing 
Initially  our remains bearish  We will need to re evaluate towards the summer of 2017  and make a new call based on inter market dynamics 

Matthew Weller  U S  Dollar Poised For Strong Year  Euro To Below USD Parity
Undoubtedly  2016 will forever be remembered as the year of the  populist ballot box revolt   From Brexit to Trump to Italy s constitutional referendum  the masses made their distaste with the status quo establishment heard through the ballot box  regardless of the consequences 
The reverberations from these decisions will no doubt be felt for years and decades to come  but the biggest takeaway for 2017 may be that  political risk  is still on the rise  especially in Europe 
The coming year will bring a presidential election in France  where the far right National Front party has been gaining ground of late  as well as national elections in Germany and the Netherlands  These represent three of the largest and most important economies in Europe  and depending on how these votes go  political uncertainty could throw the region back into recession in 2017 
Meanwhile  the US economy and dollar are poised for a strong year  President elect Trump will be eager to improve his approval rating and follow through on campaign promises by unleashing a massive wave of fiscal stimulus  tax cuts and infrastructure spending   The long awaited government contribution to GDP will juice economic growth and inflation in the short term  finally allowing the Federal Reserve to  normalize  interest rates at a more aggressive rates 
While the long term ramifications of such a strategy remain to be seen  the expected economic divergence between Europe and the US should finally drive EUR USD below parity  1 00   three years after strategists first started calling for such a move 

Anna Coulling  Surging Dollar  Oil To Test  62  Euro Project Uncertainty  Gold Could Shine Again
There is a Benjamin Graham quote that is often misquoted in which he was supposed to have declared that in the short term the market is a  voting machine   but long term it is a  weighing machine   But what he actually wrote in 1934 in his book Security Analysis was this 

   the market is not a weighing machine    Rather we should say the market is a voting machine  whereon countless individuals register choices which are partly the product of reason and partly the product of emotion    Hence the prices of common stocks are not carefully thought out computations  but the resultant of a welter of human reactions       

That s a particularly apposite quote in the aftermath of the US Presidential election  as traders and investors now face major shifts in both monetary and fiscal policy  not only in the US but in all the major economies  And our mantra for 2017 should be  expect the unexpected   something many financial experts  commentators and pollsters singularly failed to do in 2016 
US Markets Continue to Defy Expectations
Thus far it has been US equity markets that have continued to defy commentators and analysts with November s volatility simply viewed as an opportunity to push the benchmark indices into new high ground  Indeed the lack of any meaningful correction in equity markets has been the concern of many in 2016  particularly when the average number of days before a 20  correction is usually 635 days 
The present market is overdue by more than three times this average  But the key here is not whether the indices will continue this record breaking run  but which sectors are likely to flourish in the new monetary and fiscal environment 
President elect Trump has already outlined some of his priorities  namely major infrastructure spending  which has already resulted in stocks such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  moving sharply higher  Other sectors to watch will be health care and pharmaceuticals  particularly if there is a major restructuring or abandonment of Obamacare 
Underpinning this shift will be a normalization of interest rates  and a consequent rise in inflation  two factors that have always favoured the financial sector and gold 
US Dollar Impact
For the US dollar the Trump win was the catalyst for the breakaway from the long consolidation phase on the DXY  with the break of the March 2015 high of 101 38 taking the index to 102 12 in the days following the election  From a technical perspective the upside levels to watch on the DXY are 102 82 of August 1998 and 106 52 of June 1989 
Any break through these levels would clear the way for a re test of the 2001 and 2002 highs of 121 29 and 120 80 respectively  The prospect of a surge in the USD in 2017 has many implications  not least for emerging markets where the prospect of having to service more than 3 trillion in dollar denominated debt has the potential to destabilize the entire global economy 
The impact of a surging dollar in the currency markets  in particular against the euro  will also coincide with the single currency once again facing further threats to its very existence as well as the prospect of moving to parity  and lower still  If we start with the technical picture  the key price region for 2017 is 1 0450 to 1 0500  an area that was tested on several occasions in 2016 
Nevertheless this has so far held firm  and has been providing a strong platform of support since 2015  However if a move to parity is almost certain  with the potential to move down to the 0 9450  a price region last seen in mid 2002 
Fundamental and Political Pressures on Euro
From a fundamental and political perspective the pressures on the euro are many and varied  First  we have the ongoing bailout drama in Greece which has continued to fester in the background  but still has the potential to erupt at any time causing the single currency and the markets further volatility and uncertainty 
To this we must now add the situation in Italy where a banking crisis in which bad loans at Italy s third largest lender  Monte dei Paschi di Siena  MI BMPS   a bank founded in the 15th century  is threatening to spill over and contaminate the wider European banking system  In addition the political landscape in Italy is far from stable following November s referendum  and any failure to establish a new Government will inevitably lead to fresh elections in which eurosceptic parties are projected to gain a significant share of the votes 
These parties have made no secret of the fact that  if granted the opportunity  they will call for a referendum on Italy s continuing participation in the euro project  However  this will not be a replay of Brexit  as most Italians are still in favour of the eurozone 
Elections Across Eurozone Could Bring Further Euro Angst
If Italy does manage to avoid an election  elections in Holland  France and Germany in March  May and October respectively  all have the potential to cause the euro  and eurozone further angst  and even call into question its very existence  The Dutch election will be interesting as it will be the first opportunity to gauge the extent to which eurosceptic rhetoric translates into votes and power  However  it is the French election in May which is potentially the most explosive given France s role as a founder member of the what was originally known as the Common Market 
For France  next year will be a test of whether Marine Le Pen s National Front  FN  party can take power and offer the French a referendum on membership of the EU  However  unlike the UK France has a written constitution that binds it to the European Union and which theoretically precludes it from any easy exit 
The key here will be the level of support for the National Front  and whether this will be sufficient to instigate any constitutional changes to offer the French electorate this choice  And unlike previous euro crisis  this would indeed herald the demise of the euro project in its current iteration  In short  2017 could be the year that decides Europe s and the euro s fate 
Oil  Cocktail of Politics  Posturing and Play Acting
For oil  2017 will be another cocktail of politics  posturing and play acting  On the one hand we have OPEC balancing the demands of its member states  controlling supply from non members whilst simultaneously involved in a price war with the alternative suppliers 
This is a novel experience for OPEC who are now the  jam in the sandwich  and under pressure from all sides  Tighten supply too much  and prices are likely to rise further  thereby encouraging the alternative suppliers 
A loosening of supply will see prices fall  but increase pressure from members and non member alike with the prospect of tentative agreements now in place with Russia and other producers fracturing  From a technical perspective the recent agreements have seen oil prices spike higher  and up to test the highs of 2016 in the  55 50 per barrel price region 
This is now a key level of potential resistance  and with volumes now building on both the weekly and monthly charts and with a sustained congestion phase now underpinning the price action we could see oil prices continue higher to test the  62 per barrel area early in 2017  Longer term we may even see a return to the  72 00 per barrel region of 2015 
Gold May Finally Shine Again
And finally to gold  which in the light of increasing interest rates  inflation  banking crisis and existential threat to the euro may finally shine once again  However  from a technical perspective the precious metal still looks bearish on the monthly chart  The key levels now in play are those at  1120 per ounce  and if this is taken out potential support awaits at  1050 per ounce 
If this is breached  then a move below  1000 per ounce looks increasingly likely  To the upside  strong resistance has been building over the past two years in the  1360 region  With volumes rising in a falling market on the monthly time frame this level looks unlikely to be tested 
In summary  whilst 2017 promises to deliver fresh levels uncertainty and volatility it will also offer plenty of trading opportunities provided we understand the continuing interplay between politics and economics

CAT,2017-01-30,"And speaking of the US presidential election  which everyone continues to do for many different reasons  one of the stocks I tipped at the time was Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   not least as one which was likely to benefit whoever won the race to the White House  In either case  such a stock was likely to be a winner as both candidates had pledged increased infrastructure capital spending 
Prior to the election the stock had been trading at  82 31  as shown on the weekly chart  At the time I suggested that provided the  89 dollar resistance area was breached  then the stock should continue higher with some momentum  which seems to have been the case  Following last week s injection of momentum for US stocks  Caterpillar closed the week just shy of three figures at  98 9 

Prior to last week s move  the stock price had been in congestion following the explosive move higher following the US election result  with the stock oscillating around the VPOC at the  94 per share level  It was Wednesday s price action which finally provided the momentum  with a gapped up open  which was duly supported with further buying on Thursday  Friday then closed on a solid up candle and strong volume 
With the strong technical platform now in place below  we should see the stock break above  100 per share  and firmly higher in due course with the potential to take out the late 2014 high of  107 12 per share 
From a fundamental perspective  the move higher was largely as a result of the quarterly earnings which topped expectations on Wall Street  with reported earnings at 83 cents per share  and matching results from the same period last year  with revenues falling from  11 03 billion to  9 57 billion  Whilst the figures may have been below par  the outlook from the company was seen as positive  with mining sales picking up in China and the US economy creating a pull through in several of the business sectors ",Anna Coulling,0.01,0.881,0.108,0.985

CAT,2017-03-02,By Timothy Mclaughlin CHICAGO  Reuters    Federal law enforcement officials conducting a criminal probe of heavy machinery manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  searched three of its facilities on Thursday  prompting a sharp sell off in the company s stock  A spokeswoman for the U S  Attorney Office for the Central District of Illinois  Sharon Paul  confirmed that federal law enforcement officials conducted searches at locations in Peoria  East Peoria and Morton  Illinois  but did not say why agents raided the three facilities  Caterpillar  in a statement issued on Thursday afternoon  said it believed the search was part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation related to profits earned by a Swiss parts subsidiary  Caterpillar SARL  or CSARL   It said that  while the warrant is broadly drafted  we believe the execution of this search warrant is regarding  among other things  export filings that relate to the CSARL matter first disclosed in Caterpillar s Form 10 K filed on February 17  2015  and updated in Caterpillar s most recent Form 10 K filed with the SEC on February 15  2017   Agencies involved in the search included the IRS  Criminal Investigation Division  the U S  Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security s Office of Export Enforcement  and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  s Office of Inspector General  Paul said  Officials at the agencies could not be reached for comment  Caterpillar shares fell 4 3 percent to close at  94 36 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as low as  92 84   IRS SEEKS  2 BLN  CATERPILLAR CONTESTS  The apparent escalation of the government s tax dispute with Caterpillar comes as the Trump administration and leaders in Congress have said they want to launch a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code  lowering rates and designing the system to encourage companies to keep jobs and profits within the United States   Caterpillar has also had a prominent place in the Trump administration s effort to promote U S  manufacturing  The company s outgoing chief executive  Douglas Oberhelman  met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week  Caterpillar is fighting an Internal Revenue Service demand that the company pay  2 billion in taxes and penalties for profits assigned to its Swiss parts distribution subsidiary  according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  That subsidiary was also the subject of a 2014 Senate committee report that concluded Caterpillar shifted billions in profits abroad and had  2 4 billion in taxes deferred or avoided from 2012   As a result of those licensing and servicing agreements   over the next thirteen years from 2000 to 2012  Caterpillar shifted to CSARL in Switzerland taxable income from its non U S  parts sales totaling more than  8 billion  and deferred or  avoided paying U S  taxes totaling about  2 4 billion   the report said   It said the arrangement resulted in Caterpillar paying an effective tax rate of only 4 percent to 6 percent  Caterpillar  in its 2016 annual report  said it is  vigorously contesting  the IRS demand   We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines   it stated  The Senate committee report also criticized Caterpillar s accountants  PwC  saying that the firm s roles as auditor and tax consultant represented a conflict of interest  PwC on Thursday said it had no comment   In testimony before the Senate in 2014  PwC partner Thomas Quinn said the firm believed that its  tax advice and Caterpillar s tax positions were correct under applicable tax laws  In sum  PwC s provision of tax services to Caterpillar as our audit client was entirely appropriate   Caterpillar also disclosed in its annual report that it had received grand jury subpoenas from the U S  District Court for the Central District of Illinois seeking documents and information related to the movement of cash among U S  and non U S  subsidiaries  and the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc  and non U S  Caterpillar subsidiaries  including Caterpillar SARL  Caterpillar said it is cooperating with the investigation and did not believe it would have a material impact on its finances  PARTS BUSINESS  TAXES The facility in Morton  according to the company s website  is responsible for receiving and shipping replacement parts to parts facilities and Caterpillar dealers worldwide   Caterpillar reported sales fell 18 percent in 2016 to  38 5 billion and since late 2015 it has shrunk its workforce by more than 16 000 employees and consolidated or closed 30 facilities  Caterpillar cut 12 300 jobs in 2016  including 7 700 in the United States   It said it was considering closing two more major production facilities  including one in Aurora  Illinois  and also announced it was moving its corporate headquarters from Peoria to Chicago this year  Last week in Missouri  U S  Vice President Mike Pence toured Fabick CAT  a family owned company that is one of the largest U S  distributors of Caterpillar equipment   You are the strength in the American economy  and you re going to lead an American comeback   he told workers there   Pence said the Trump administration wants to simplify the U S  tax code   I ll guarantee there isn t anyone here who can make sense of America s tax code  including me  There s an old joke that says the tax code is about 10 times the size of the Bible but with none of the good news   he said   Our country s tax system these days penalizes success  It makes it far too hard for hardworking people and small businesses to achieve the American Dream  ,Reuters,0.05,0.857,0.093,0.9923

Silver   what was expected did indeed happen and silver corrected down to regain correlation with gold 
Oil   declined sharply and reached the lowest level in 3 weeks and the strong USD is pulling commodities down and rising US inventories and production are also weighting on oil  Another aspect is the fact that Russia has kept production unchanged from its January levels and as such is far from complying to the agreement to cut production  This in turn obviously casts doubts on the longer term viability of the agreement  However  Russia not implementing its part of the deal should not come as a surprise based on previous agreements

CAT,2017-03-10,"At the start of March short sellers in Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  stock such as Jim Chanos of Kynilos Associates  a group noted by their particularly thick skin  were found licking their wounds  Chanos shorted the stock in 2012 in part on the thesis that China  a big market for Caterpillar s heavy equipment purchases  would fall into troubled times  That negative catalyst didn t happen  The stock moved higher to  110 in 2014 and then bottomed at  59 87 nearly one year ago  but even then Chanos didn t take profits  Since then the stock steadily climbed in a reasonably consistent price uptrend channel and significantly outperforming the broader stock market  Chanos told CNBC he was still short this past October  and he was alone  as short interest was climbing with the stock price  hitting a historical high of  3 9 billion in late November  calculations from financial analytics firm S3 Partners 
At the end of 2016  the  2 5 billion in total short bets against the stock were feeling pain after the stock had gained 35  on the year  Additionally  the analytics form notes 

CAT short interest averaged  3 245 million over the last 14 months and generated a 32  net of financing mark to market loss 

And

Short sellers may be loath to jump back into the name as their perseverance in holding onto their short positions from 2016 to 2017 resulted in losses totaling just over  1 billion 

But then came Tuesday  March 7 and the FBI  in an unusual move against a major multi national corporation  accused Peoria  Illinois based Caterpillar of Federal tax and accounting fraud  the New York Times first reported 
When the investigation was announced  the stock price trend quickly changed  In an instant  the fate of the short sellers had reversed  making  43 million in less than a week  S3 noted  While that might seem a tidy sum  it is relative to losing nearly  1 billion over the course of the previous year  Short interest averaged  3 245 million over the last 14 months and generated a 32  net of financing mark to market loss 
And the short sellers should be prepared for more losses  Plans are already in the works to rain on their parade  But S3  in a report titled  Tax Fraud Allegations Not Enough to Bring Back Caterpillar Short Sellers   tends to agree 

Investigation of major multi national by FBI is  rare 
The Federal probe  characterized by the New York Times as  rare   is scrutinizing Caterpillar s tax and accounting standards with a focus on one of the firm s Swiss subsidiaries  It still remains clear if authorities plan on charging the component of the elite Dow Jones Industrial Average 
The report  which has not been made public but was reviewed by the New York Times  focuses on strategies used to avoid paying billions in taxes  Multi national corporations have come under increased scrutiny over various schemes to reduce their US tax liability  with many declaring off shore corporate headquarters in offices containing no more than a skeleton crew 
Jefferies analysts Stephen Volkmann  Chirag Patel and Alan Tadian explain the technical nuance 

Based on CAT s 10 K filings for the tax years 2007 to 2012  and including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005   the IRS has determined that certain parts transactions that were conducted through Caterpillar SARL  CSARL  came under question in respect to the  substance over form  or  assignment of income  judicial doctrines  More directly  the IRS has asserted that parts profits that should have been booked in the US were booked in a Swiss subsidiary  In respect to this time period the IRS has proposed an increase in back taxes and penalties totaling approximately  2bn  which CAT continues to contest  CAT notes in their filings that it has continued to use the same accounting treatment for periods since 2012  which may suggest that today s information gathering is focused on tax years subsequent to 2012   although neither the company nor any government entity has provided this detail  We would note that CAT has disclosed this issue for the last two years  so it should not be new to investors 


Get ready for an onslaught of bullish news  as charges against Caterpillar could take years to sort out
Shorts might do well to prepare for a bullish onslaught of news  Evercore ISI Industrials and Machinery research team of David Raso  Oliver Liao and Jeff Morrison  fresh off discussions at an industry trade show  note that positive news is likely to be on the horizon  Caterpillar could raise guidance amid a generally positive market environment 

Accelerating revenues is what will drive CAT stock  short term price cost not allowing even more of a blowout in EPS is  seeing the trees  missing the forest   saw same thing in starting last cycle when early 2000s rising steel prices early in cycle squeezed margins a bit when volumes first started ramping but stock continued to work as investors correctly surmised price cost would improve as volumes ramped further  delivery lead times started to stretch and the pendulum of power increasingly swung from the customer to the dealer and eventually back to CAT  That pendulum of power has now just begun to swing away from the customer and toward the dealer CAT 

From Jefferies standpoint  the IRS probe is likely to take years to resolve  and should not change investors  views of CAT s earnings power over the next couple years   Jefferies thinks the worldwide economic recovery and Trump stimulus already priced into the stock might have led to high valuations  which is in part why they have a hold on the stock 
S3  for their part  note a positive macro economic environment that could benefit long holders of the stock such as Joel Greenblatt s Gotham Capital 

The potential increase of worldwide agricultural  construction  energy and mining demand has buoyed the stock prices of industry leaders Caterpillar  John Deere  DE US   Komatsu  6301 JP   Agco Corp  AGCO US  and CNH Industrial  CNHI US  
We have not seen a spike in CAT s short selling today in response to the U S  s tax fraud allegations  but if the Trump stimulus plan is delayed significantly and commodity prices slump we may see short sellers come back and try to recoup some of their 2016 2107 losses 

On a technical level  the Federal probe news has taken the stock to the bottom range of its one year uptrend channel  an assumed mechanical point of support  Shorts might do well to watch this level   and market reaction to anticipated positive news  There is a long history of making incorrect exposure bets on this stock ",ValueWalk,0.059,0.848,0.094,0.9926

Commentary The timetable for a May end to this period of extremely low volatility looks like it is right on schedule 

This historical Trump tweet is a handy reminder that times and circumstances can change in an instant  Bombing Syria does not make sense until it does  Similarly for the stock market  geo political dangers and economic risks do not matter until they do  I daresay last week s events brought us incrementally closer to a moment when the market will suddenly care  For now  the sellers STILL lack the firepower and follow through even as buyers and bulls fail to to reignite lost momentum 

The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   rallied right to its downtrend before the Fed minutes brought the index right back down toward a subtle test of 50DMA support 
The most salient feature of this chart of the S P 500  SPY  is the triangle or wedge pattern developing between the uptrending 50DMA and the downtrend from the all time high  I redrew the line from previous posts to more closely match the closes instead of the highs of the day  This change brings Wednesday s trading around the release of the Fed minutes into high relief 
This change also demonstrates that the market s response to the U S  bombing of Syria barely registered a blip  The downtrend in the 20DMA now runs almost exactly parallel to the downtrend from the all time high  As long as the index closes above its 50DMA  my bullish call  albeit cautious  stays golden  The bullish call gets confirmation with a breakout above the downtrend 
My trading plan for a close below 50DMA support is a bit more involved  My previous plan was to stay cautiously bullish and look for a true oversold reading to trigger an aggressive bullish positioning    I noted how   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  had achieved  oversold enough  status  The bounce from  oversold enough  is still active given AT40 has not yet hit overbought status 
So  if the S P 500 takes a tumble from here  AT40 will likely very quickly fall back to the low 30s  I will be very hesitant to flip bearish at that point  As a compromise deference to the current short term downtrend and increased market risks  I plan to switch to a neutral status if 50DMA support gives way for the S P 500  Such a trading call will mean that I will abstain from making additional bullish trades until an oversold reading  I will also be extremely selective in making bearish trades   like reaching for put options on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  
AT40 and volatility
Speaking of AT40  my favorite technical indicator twisted wildly in the wind last week  AT40 closed the month of March at 49 8   got as low as 39 7  after the Fed minutes  rallied vigorously on Thursday in a move that was almost another bullish divergence  the S P 500 barely managed to close flat on that day   and then closed the week at 46 9  
Most importantly  AT40 failed to hold the previous high from mid March  So while sellers lack follow through firepower  buyers are acting like they may be getting a bit exhausted 
The wild swings in AT40 translated into upward pressure  albeit subtle  on the volatility index  the VIX  Volatility ended March at 12 4  On Monday  the VIX briefly broke through its so far tough to crack 200DMA  The VIX has failed to close above this trendline since the election 
Yet  the pressure is building and hinting to anyone watching of an incrementally more dangerous market  Ahead of the Fed minutes on Wednesday  the market got quite comfortable with volatility tumbling on Tuesday to 11 8 and then as low as 10 9 right before the minutes  That move MAY have been the final flush of complacency as volatility closed the week at 12 9  If my read is correct  this period of extremely low volatility will come to an end on schedule 

The upward pressure on the volatility index  the VIX  continues to build as its 50DMA starts to turn upward for the first time since September 
Given the apparent changes afoot  going forward  I plan to make sure to have call AND put options in play on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   In fact  I think trading volatility using AT40 may produce better results than trading the S P 500 
The impact of April s release of Fed minutes
The Fed minutes typically have little impact on market trading  Since these minutes seemed to change the tenor a bit  I decided to look a little more closely at the headline explanations for the market s poor reaction 

The release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve s last meeting caused immediate and sustained angst
As a reminder  the Federal reserve hiked its interest rate at its last meeting  So I am little surprised that the chatter from Fed members shaded toward the hawkish side  I was a bit bemused to read headlines blaming the market s angst on talk of shrinking the size of the Fed balance sheet and discussions about the high valuations in the stock market 
First of all  nothing the Fed said about shrinking the balance sheet was new  The Fed wants to be very careful in shrinking the size and it clearly stands ready to grow the balance sheet at a moment s notice if the need arises  I compare and contrast quotes about the balance sheet between these minutes and  
Jan Feb meeting  emphasis mine 

  it was noted that the downward pressure on longer term interest rates exerted by the Federal Reserve s asset holdings was expected to diminish in the years ahead in light of an anticipated gradual reduction in the size and duration of the Federal Reserve s balance sheet  

The Fed has spoken consistently about the need to shrink the size and duration of its balance sheet  The concept is not new and is certainly a key component of the Fed s interest in normalizing monetary policy as much as is practical  I expect the Fed to re examine its approach to the balance sheet at LEAST each time it hikes interest rates from here on out   Note there seems to be no mention of the balance sheet at the December  2016 meeting which also featured a rate hike  
I include my editorial in square brackets amid the quotes 
March 14 15  2017

 Many participants emphasized that reducing the size of the balance sheet should be conducted in a passive and predictable manner  Some participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate for the Committee to restart reinvestments if the economy encountered significant adverse shocks that required a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate    The Fed is clearly reticent about shrinking the balance sheet as it reassures itself and the market that it is willing and able to grow the size of the balance sheet in immediate response to any economic need  
 When the time comes to implement a change to reinvestment policy  participants generally preferred to phase out or cease reinvestments of both Treasury securities and agency MBS  Policymakers also discussed the potential benefits and costs of approaches that would either phase out or cease all at once reinvestments of principal from these securities    The Fed has not made a decision on how to reduce the balance sheet  It is collectively and actively debating the pros and cons  
  Nearly all participants agreed that the Committee s intentions regarding reinvestment policy should be communicated to the public well in advance of an actual change  It was noted that the Committee would continue its deliberations on reinvestment policy during upcoming meetings and would release additional information as it becomes available  In that context  several participants indicated that  when the Committee announces its plans for a change to its reinvestment policy  it would be desirable to also provide more information to the public about the Committee s expectations for the size and composition of the Federal Reserve s assets and liabilities in the longer run    Relax  Mr  Market  The Fed fully intends to make this balance sheet exercise as painless and transparent as possible  We can of course debate how effective the Fed will be in this exercise  

The Fed reserved its strongest language for its characterization of valuations in financial markets 

 Broad equity price indexes rose further  leaving some standard measures of valuations above historical norms 
Broad U S  equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period  and some measures of valuations  such as price to earnings ratios  rose further above historical norms  A standard measure of the equity risk premium edged lower  declining into the lower quartile of its historical distribution of the previous three decades  Stock prices rose across most industries  and equity prices for financial firms outperformed broader indexes 
Some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures  It was observed that prices of other risk assets  such as emerging market stocks  high yield corporate bonds  and commercial real estate  had also risen significantly in recent months  In contrast  prices of farmland reportedly had edged lower  in part because low commodity prices continued to weigh on farm income  Still  farmland valuations were said to remain quite high as gauged by standard benchmarks such as rent to price ratios  

The Fed went a lot further than its observation in the December meeting  At that time  the Fed did not judge the market s attempt to price in its optimism for the future   Broad U S  equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period  apparently boosted by investors  expectations of stronger earnings growth and improved risk sentiment  with much of the rally coming after the U S  elections  
This time  the Fed issued a relatively harsh judgement  Yet  we have seen this story before  The market can get twisted for a bit over the Fed s disapproval  but it eventually shrugs its shoulder and scoffs at the Fed s failure to understand how this time is different 
Through all the presumed angst over the Fed s posturing and the other events of the week  the market stayed keenly focused on a June rate hike  Almost since the March rate hike  the 30 day Fed Fund Futures have priced in June as the likely timing for the next rate hike  The odds for a second rate hike coming in December have been even more stable  assuming the Fed hikes 25 basis points at a time  
To understand the context of the charts  recall March 15th was the announcement of the last rate hike  April 5th was the release of the minutes from that meeting  and April 7th was the combination of the lukewarm jobs report for March and the aftermath of the U S  bombing of a Syrian airfield 

The odds for the next rate hike occurring in June have gone from 48 5  to 70 9  

The odds for two rate hikes by December have gone from 56 2  to 58 8  
I am most intrigued by the steady march upward of the odds for the next rate hike  June looks like a lock  At this point it will take some particularly bad news for the Fed to disappoint these rate expectations 
From my vantage point  the market s many moving parts are getting noisier and no longer rubbing each other in a frictionless manner  The stock market is incrementally more dangerous  I have purposely used a relative measure to accommodate the starting point of any given market participant  I cannot imagine how anyone left last week without increasing their risk monitors at least a LITTLE bit 
Elsewhere in financial markets 
As the volatility index pressures upward  my key indicator of sentiment in the currency market flirted with very critical support  The Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  JPY  traded exactly to 200DMA support on the heels of the Syrian bombing before rebounding going into U S  trading on Friday 
Trading going into this week should be a very good tell  AUD JPY is suffering from a definitive and heavy downtrend that makes 200DMA support appear likely to break  AUD JPY has not traded below its 200DMA since the U S  Presidential election  In a coming post  I am going to take a long overdue look at the Australian economy which now seems to be teetering a bit 

The Australian dollar hovered above critical support at its 200DMA uptrend against the Japanese yen 
Russian stocks suffered a blow on Friday  The VanEck Vectors Russia  NYSE RSX  gapped down 3 2   This latest close below its 50DMA is likely signaling a top for RSX 

The honeymoon for VanEck Vectors Russia ETF  RSX  has likely come to an end as RSX gapped down below its 50DMA and failed at resistance from the Dec Feb consolidation 
Speaking of Trump Trades  somehow I completely missed the comeback of the Mexican peso  The peso suffered mightily upon Trump s election as the market bet on a weaker Mexican economy form the impact of a border wall and doom for the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   USD MXN hit its peak right around Trump s inauguration 
The currency pair has been all downhill ever since  Note that the U S  dollar index currently trades right around where it did at Trump s inauguration so the slide in USD MXN almost all peso   For properly interpreting what happened around the election for USD MXN  note that the chart is measured on Eastern time with the day starting at midnight  

It s as if Trump was never elected President  the Mexican peso sits comfortably where it was the day before the U S  Presidential election 

The U S  dollar index confirmed the 200DMA uptrend by breaking out above its 50DMA again 
The Mexican peso joins a small  but growing list of trades which have completely reversed their impacts from the election  I have documented them as I come across them  One important player that has not quite reversed its post election impact is the SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  
Interestingly  the recent rebound in the U S  dollar has not sent gold lower  However  GLD has now three times failed to conquer resistance at its 200DMA  A breakout should be VERY bullish for GLD and should finish the reversal of its post election loss 

The SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  continues to struggle with 200DMA resistance  On Friday  GLD actually gapped ABOVE 200DMA resistance only to fade well below 
Turkey sits in the middle of what looks like ground zero for the next major conflict in the Middle East  I am surprised that the Turkish lira did not weaken significantly after the U S  bombing of Syria  Could the lira be the next currency to rally against the odds with currency traders flocking for carry  How much worse can the news get for Turkey  

Is it time for the Turkish lira  USD TRY  act contrary and rally in the face of an accumulation of bad news

The French election considered out of the way  EUR traders  attention shifts to the European Central Bank  ECB   The ECB will meet on Thursday and will likely keep the policy unchanged  Yet  the market is calling for a more hawkish accompanying statement from President Mario Draghi  He is expected to give more details about the Quantitative Easing  QE  exit plans at the June meeting  six months earlier than previously anticipated  In this respect  Draghi is expected to adopt his language at the communiqu  as early as this week

U S  stocks rally into the U S   big announcement  on tax reforms
All eyes are on the White House today  which is due to make the  big announcement  on Donald Trump s major tax reforms 
The U S  stocks are on the rise  as Trump prepares to unveil significant tax cuts on corporate and personal income  We already know that he plans to dampen the corporate tax rate to 15  from 35   the top income tax rate to 15  from 39 6   and propose 10  increase on offshore earnings 
Solid U S  corporate earnings gave an additional boost to stock investors on Tuesday 
As a result  Wall Street rolling index is testing the  21 000 level on the upside  The all time high   21 162  could be bettered within this week  if investors are satisfied with the White House announcement  If not  we could see a renewed downside correction toward  20 740  50 day moving average  and  20 293  minor 23 6  retracement on Trump reflation rally  
The Dow is called 24 points firmer at  21 020 at the U S  open 
Likewise  the S P 500 neared the all time high of  2 400 on Tuesday  Solid earnings from Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD  helped further boosting the appetite before the White House announcement 
In summary  money moves from U S  bonds to the equities  lifting the U S  bond yields higher  The U S  10 Year yields are up to 2 33  
What could go wrong  An announcement highlighting the tax cuts without mentioning how to finance the multi billion dollar deficit it would add to the government s budget  could dampen the mood  Therefore  it is worth mentioning that the downside risks on the stock markets prevail due to an eventual lack of details  as it has often been the case over the first 100 days of Trump s presidency 
Some colour out of Japan
The risk on was on Japanese traders  plate on Wednesday  Nikkei   1 10   and Topix   1 20   gained in Tokyo  as the USD JPY advanced to 111 51  Improved risk appetite and higher U S  yields could encourage a further rise in the USD JPY  The next critical resistance is eyed at 112 13  major 38 2  retracement on December   April decline   if surpassed  should signal a mid term bullish reversal and bring the 115 00 mark back on the radar 
The Bank of Japan  BoJ  is expected to maintain the status quo at Thursday s monetary policy meeting  The BoJ should also deliver a dovish accompanying statement  based on Governor Kuroda s comments that the BoJ will remain easy until the 2  inflation target is reached  Due on Friday  the March inflation ex fresh food may have steadied at 0 2  year on year  comfortably far from the BoJ s policy target

Turkey gives verdict
The Central Bank of Turkey  CBT  will announce its rate decision today and is expected to maintain the status quo 
Rising inflationary pressures should prevent the CBT from shifting toward more unorthodox strategy  although the critical constitutional referendum is behind 
The USD TRY tested the 3 60 level in Istanbul on the back of a broad based USD demand  We could see a minor relief purchases if the CBT remains on hold  as expected 
In case of a dovish surprise  the fears and suspicions vis   vis the credibility of the CBT would trigger an aggressive sell off  in which case the USD TRY could advance to 2 70 2 75 by the end of the week 
If not  the USD TRY should continue oscillating within the downtrend range toward the 3 55  2017 support   then to the 3 50 level ",Ipek Ozkardeskaya,0.047,0.866,0.088,0.9905

The global equity rally that took off on relief after France s first round presidential election as investors either convinced themselves that centrist Macron s victory is a forgone conclusion  or that May 7  the date of the second  decisive round  seems like an eternity away continues on some actual business growth  To be fair  what s driving stock indices higher now is the lingering hope of US tax reform  with Trump set to announce his tax plan today  limiting the upper corporate rate to 15  
In addition  as discussed yesterday  continued yen weakness will boost equities  which are enjoying their longest winning streak of the year 
The MSCI All Country World Index with  700 billion now infused achieved another record high  of 456 60  and is holding its ground currently  trading at 456 23  only 37 points below  This follows strong global earnings across the board  such as by Germany s Daimler  DE DAIGn  and Aluminum Corp  of China  NYSE ACH  as well as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD   However  there is true global participation  as even emerging market equities advanced to a near two year high 

The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is currently trading at 982 65  only two points below its high  as traders are hanging on to this asset which is the highest it has been since June 26  2015 
As far as safe havens go  while the yen has extended its declines  gold is holding on 
However  despite the high optimism in the media  European equities while still mostly maintaining gains are fluctuating between small declines and remaining flat  This  despite the fact that even their local currencies have declined  While the falling yen is boosting Japanese equities and Australia s equities are rising proportionally even though its currency declined  that s not enough for Europe 
Here are the facts 
Australia s ASX 200 is up 0 70   to 5912 036  while the AUD is down 0 60   at 0 7494 
Japan s TOPIX opened with a rising gap of 1 2   as buyers chased up the price to find willing sellers  it s now trading at the top of its range at 1537 41 in a sign of strength  The yen is down 0 25  at 111 32 
However  even though the euro is down 0 28   at 1 0900  the Euro Stoxx 50 is down 508 points  at 3578 08  the DAX and CAC are churning  Despite the fact that the pound is down 0 15   at 1 2820  the FTSE 100 is flat 
US stock futures are mostly flat as well  as the S P is down 0 07   at 2 383 25  while the NASDAQ and the Dow are up  0 02   at 5 549 50 and 0 2   at 20 949 00  respectively 
Equities
Yesterday  both McDonald s and Caterpillar destroyed expectations  Both stocks surged after their reports 
McDonald s reported an EPS of  1 47 vs  1 33  with revenues of  5 68 billion vs  5 53 billion  as expected by Thompson Reuters  Domestic same store sales growth advanced 1 7 percent versus an expected decline of 0 8 percent 

The fast food restaurant chain s shares opened with a 2 91  gap  clearly  everyone wanted a bite  Altogether  shares gained 5 56  on the day  closing at 141 70 after reaching a high of 141 99  Both the close and the intraday high are records  This marked the 7th consecutive record close for the stock  Price was supported by wide participation with a volume of 10 894M
Caterpillar reported and adjusted EPS of  1 28  making Wall Street s expectations of   62 seem embarrassingly off  on revenue of  9 8 billion vs expectations of  9 4 billion  This achievement occurred thanks to old fashioned cost cutting  The construction and mining equipment manufacturer even raised its guidance for full year earnings and revenue  earnings to  3 75 EPS  up from just  2 90 EPS  revenue to up to  41 billion  from just  38 billion 
Its shares leaped at the open with a gap of 5 36   as investors bulldozed their way toward willing sellers  shares started the day at  102 88 and closed at 104 42  with a 7 58  gain  close to the intraday high of  104 89  as the bulls held on  This is the highest since November 2014  when it was ironically gapping down  within a falling trend which slipped all the way to  56 26  on January 20  2016 
Commodities
Yesterday  WTI oil s consecutive 6 day decline  and all around 8 day decline of 8 44 percent  finally came to an end  Crude advanced 0 69  on the day  Currently it s churning in place 

The question is whether it s doing so in effort not to fall  or whether it s revving up for a push higher 
It s interesting to note that today s churning is taking place on top of the 200 day moving average  which has been its ally and supporter since April  as it proved itself in May  November and March  However  for much of March it hung on to it from below  The 200 day moving average can be a powerful ally 
Bonds
Yields on 10 year maturities for the US  Germany and France  all fell one basis point  The Treasury note fell to 2 32 percent following a five day straight advance 
For the French sovereign bond  the decline to 0 89 percent comes after an advance of 7 basis points yesterday ",Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,0.022,0.867,0.111,0.9969

CAT,2017-04-26,"It s a good time to hold equity and credit and it seems a dark cloud in the form of the French elections has swiftly departed from the investment landscape  combining effectively with headlines on Trump tax reform and in turn providing fresh impetus to chase returns 
Implied volatility in so many markets has been absolutely crushed and when combined with better earnings and positively trending markets we have traders  notably the systematic crowd  who have to be in the market 
Throw in a fear of missing out  FOMO   as so many benchmarks by which money managers compare portfolio returns to move higher and you have a fairly bullish set up  Shorts are closing and standing aside as these are simply not the conditions to be expressing a bearish view   it feels unnatural to buy at these levels  but these markets are being driven  to a large extent  by systems  computers and algorithms and buying high and selling higher seems the right way to trade 
The MSCI world index has broken to new highs  where we can see the NASDAQ 100 and Composite moving up through blue sky territory  The S P 500 closed above the 5 April high of 2378 and looks destined  in my opinion  to also break to new all time highs in the short term  Importantly  the market internals are not yet at levels one can consider to be euphoric  with 60  of S P 500 companies above their 50 day moving average and 75  above the shorter 20 day moving average  14  of companies have an RSI greater than 70 and 16  closed at a 52 week high 
I will be watching these internals for signs that too much good will is being baked into the cake  but for now  that time is not upon us 
The Dow has also closed 1 1  higher  curtsey of some big moves from Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD   with Caterpillar coming out with some cracking numbers and this would be a conviction buy if adopting an analyst hat  Most importantly the daily chart looks like a thing of pure beauty and pullbacks will be bought by money managers 
Perhaps one of the key issues which is getting much focus is the move in the USD index  which has broken the May 2016 uptrend and is trading at the lowest levels since November  A break of the 200 day moving average at 9 911 has also been noted as this could affect the systematic  algorithmic  fraction of the trading community 
Interesting  this move lower in the USD has come at a time when the interest rate markets have increased their probability of a June hike  from the Federal Reserve  to 64   It seems mostly EUR driven though  with EUR USD also trading through its 200 day moving average and it almost seems a fate au complete that we see  1 1000 coming into play here 

Long EUR AUD has been a great trade and I would be a willing buyer into a 1 4450 and see the December highs coming into play soon enough  That being said tomorrow s European Central Bank  ECB  meeting does pose a real risk 
AUD USD has struggled to find any traction of late and traded in a range of  0 7572 to  0 7521 overnight  Clearly  todays Aussie Q1 CPI  print  at 11 30 aest  poses a risk to any AUD exposures  but if we look at the options market  and the at the money daily  straddle   we can see the market expects a modest 35 point move today 
It hardly screams of a market that expects the Q1 CPI print to be a game changer for future RBA moves  However  with the quarterly trimmed mean inflation print expected to come in at 0 5   any number at 0 2   or below  or 0 8   or above  could cause a strong reaction in AUD USD and therefore buying the  straddle  would be a good trade 
In terms of the Asian equity open and despite a rebound of sorts yesterday one should keep an eye on Chinese markets given the pick up in concerns around tighter liquidity and regulation  The CSI 300  is threatening key support at 3380 and a closing break here and short positions on this index seem logical 
Our call on the ASX 200 sits at 5920  with SPI futures up 0 8  from Mondays ASX cash market close and traders should keep an eye here on whether SPI futures can break the 13 April high of 5940  Naturally  if this development materialises in the near term will push the ASX 200 cash market to new highs and once again we start talking about sexy 6000 
Drilling down  banks should be at the heart of the gains today  with energy and select materials doing well  I say  select  as BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP  was downgraded to  sell  at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   although BHP s American Depository Receipt  ADR  has closed up 0 6  and doesn t necessarily seem to be following its UK listing  which closed down 0 7  
A 1  gain in US crude should assist here  although we have seen selling coming into the barrel after the API survey saw a 900 000 and 4 4 million build in oil and gas  respectively as part of the weekly inventory report 
On the bulks side  a 0 7  fall in spot iron ore  shouldn t derail too greatly from confidence when Dalian iron and rebar rebar futures have gained 1 9  and 1 3  respectively ",IG,0.045,0.839,0.116,0.9968

EUR USD
The euro hit fresh five month highs against the dollar on Tuesday after a rally triggered by the first round results of the French presidential election 
EUR USD was up 0 56  to 1 0929 by 10 45 ET  the highest level since November 11 after centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron won the first round of French presidential elections over the weekend 
For this week investors attention is shifted towards  Thursday s European Central Bank policy meeting  Friday s euro zone inflation data and preliminary estimates of first quarter growth from the U S

Last month s jobs report was a real disappointment  We were expecting the economy to add about 185 000 jobs in March  but it turned out to be only 98 000  Now it s time for the April jobs report  and everyone is wondering if last month s number was as  transitory  as the Fed said Q1 GDP was  The market is again expecting about 180 000 for tomorrow s report 
On Thursday  the S P was up 0 06  to 2389 5 and the NASDAQ increased 0 05  to 6075 3  The Dow slipped 0 03  to 20 951 5 
From these numbers  you wouldn t even know that the House actually passed a heath care overhaul bill designed to repeal and replace parts of Obamacare  The failure of the first attempt called into question the President s ability to pass his promised pro growth agenda  So will the market now feel better about the odds for tax reform  There s a long way to go before this bill becomes law as it now moves to the Senate  which may be why there wasn t much of a reaction today  There s no need for the market to get its hopes up  again  just yet 
The portfolios had a lot of double digit winners today  as Reitmeister Trading Alert  Zacks Counterstrike and Surprise Trader each sold parts of positions for big returns  They all bought today as well Today s Portfolio Highlights Reitmeister Trading Alert  It never hurts to trim some profits especially if they are BIG profits  Steve sold some shares of MKS Instruments  MKSI  on Thursday for an impressive gain of 72 8   The portfolio still has a 6 5  allocation in this semiconductor equipment and testing company  But that wasn t all  The editor also capitalized on three nonsensical selloffs that followed strong quarterly reports 
  Kulicke   Soffa  KLIC    The portfolio added a 6 5  allocation in this chip equipment firm  This Zacks Rank  1 has a Zacks VGM Score of A and is part of a space in the top 1  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
  Nucor  NYSE NUE    The portfolio added more shares of this steel company  bringing the allocation up to 6  
  ACCO Brands  ACCO    The editor was also happy to add more shares of this office products company  bringing the allocation up to 7 6   ACCO has been enjoying serious earnings momentum over the past 18 months 
It was a busy day for RTA  so make sure to read the full commentary for all the specifics on these moves Zacks Counterstrike  Jeremy felt so confident about Square  NYSE SQ  that he doubled the portfolio s position last month  It paid off yesterday when the financial and marketing services company reported a strong quarter  So today the editor brought it back to the original allocation by selling half of the shares and generating a nice return of practically 14  
Meanwhile  shares of Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  jumped to  106 following its solid quarterly report  which included an earnings surprise that more than doubled expectations and a raised guidance for fiscal 2017  However  it has since slipped back to double digits  Jeremy decided that now was a great time to buy a 14  allocation before this construction and mining equipment giant shoots higher again  Some price targets are as high as  115 for CAT  The full write up has more Surprise Trader  Delphi Automotive  DLPH  has been in the portfolio for less than a week  and Eric already decided to sell half of the position to secure a nice 10 4  profit  Just yesterday  the company reported a solid quarter with better than expected earnings and sales 
And as announced on Wednesday  the portfolio also picked up a 12 5  allocation in building products manufacturer Louisiana Pacific  LPX   The company reports tomorrow and has an Earnings ESP that s currently 10  higher than the consensus  The full year ESP is about 6 8  higher  This Zacks Rank  1 has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by double digits in three of the last four quarters and is part of a space in the top 10  of the Zacks Industry Rank  Learn more in the full write up Options Trader   The market is expecting 180 000 new private sector jobs to have been created  Every report is important  but the market is counting on a solid showing tomorrow given last month s weaker than expected 98 000 jobs  Ideally  it would be nice to beat the current consensus and get last month s numbers upwardly revised   Yesterday s comments from the Fed  which characterized the slower growth we saw in the first quarter as transitory  allayed people s fears over some spotty numbers  And that also helped explain away the employment report  But another weak showing will be harder to dismiss as irrelevant      Kevin Matras

CAT,2017-05-08,"AT40   54 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   59 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   10 6  volatility index Short term Trading Call  bullish
Commentary Two hallmarks of this current stock market have been the 1  consistent weakness of sellers and 2  the persistent ability of the S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   to overcome bearish divergence in the technicals as represented by AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading over their respective 40DMAs 
In the wake of   the S P 500  SPY  notched a fresh  marginal  all time high  As I have noted before  I am gratified to see a market that actually rallies on good news  I grew weary of the post recovery  easy money routine of celebrating bad news in anticipation of more goodies from the Fed 
The S P 500  SPY  broke out from 8 days of churn to print a new all time high 
The NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ    managed to eek out a new all time closing high 
Both the S P 500 and the NASDAQ  QQQ   look ready for a fresh rally to their respective upper Bollinger Bands   BB   Once there  I am guessing the Nazz will have enough momentum to keep climbing the upper BB just as it did in the last burst higher  This action also greatly reduces the odds of a 50DMA retest for the S P 500 that I had expected to come this month 
The volatility index is mired in a region of extremely low volatility  Whenever the VIX wakes up again  and it will of course   the move could should be particularly violent since complacency is getting so thoroughly entrenched in this market  I am continuing to buy calls and puts on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  with 2 week expirations in an attempt to be positioned for that next big move  The puts are necessary because there is still room on the political front for policy moves to produce a sudden resurgence of optimism and expectation 
The volatility index  CBOE Volatility Index  is officially asleep 
Going into Friday s mini breakouts  I became more concerned with a potential bearish divergence  While the major indices were idling away on Thursday  both AT40 and AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  dropped steeply  AT40 dropped as low as 46 5  before closing at 50 4   AT200 traded as low as 54 8  before closing at 56 3   a new 6 month low  Both the close and the intraday low were last seen the day after the U S  Presidential election  In almost any other market  I would claim that the indices are living on borrowed time if the rest of the stock market does not catch up  Now  I need a lot more proof before getting convinced that sellers have at least an inkling of firepower 
The regular cast of characters are weighing down AT40 and AT200  the financials  small caps  and mid caps  This week  the specter of another collapse in commodities loomed over the market 
I recently pointed to the renewed troubles in iron ore  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF  is once again the poster boy of iron ore collapse  Note how perfectly CLF failed to break through its historic  at that time  2009 intraday low  CLF has now joined the crowded company of equities that have lost all their post election gains 

Cliffs Natural Resources  CLF  has lost a whopping 50  from its recent high and failed test of major resistance  With post election gains evaporated is it time for a major relief rally 
I took this opportunity to close out my long standing short on BHP Billiton Ltd  NYSE BHP   I have not reactivated  in a long time  I will be looking for the next opportunity to start over and hope to write a long overdue review of the iron ore sector 
BHP also has significant oil assets  which made it an attractive hedge play against RIO   Yet  somehow all year  I failed to note the persistent downtrend in the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE  since its peak in December  On Thursday  XLE closed at a 9 month low 
The Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE  is one of those rare sectors that has had a ROUGH 2017 

The weekly chart suggests that the breathtaking recovery from the collapse in oil has ended for the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLE  
Even with Friday s 1 6  jump  XLE is down 10 6  for the year  This sector alone likely explains why and how the NASDAQ has so readily sprinted ahead of the S P 500  The strong downtrend in XLE helps further explain the persistent bearish divergences from earlier in the year  I also now suspect that the general malaise in commodities is was a major force in sending silver spiraling downward 
The weight of the sell off in commodities finally caught up with Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   CAT failed to follow through on its major post earnings gap up  Suddenly  the stock is in danger of reversing all its post earnings gains and even returning to its pre earnings consolidation range 
The party in CAT came to a quick end  A complete post earnings reversal is now in play 
I locked in profits on CAT puts on Thursday s swoon  again  not confident the sellers can maintain this pressure  The profits were not enough to cover the cost of my call options  I am looking to re establish a hedged trade soon 
On the good side  I got post earnings boosts from Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH  and El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc  NASDAQ LOCO   CTSH rocketed 4 1  higher on Friday in the wake of a very strong earnings report  Even with CTSH trading well above its upper BB  I am holding on as I think this latest earnings report validated  

Cognizant Technology  CTSH  hit a new 18 month high thanks to a post earnings boost 
LOCO came into focus for me in mid February in  Another Chicken Run for Restaurant Brands With El Pollo Loco Rumors   When Restaurant Brands  QSR  took out my other chicken play Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen  PLKI   see  QSR Picks Popeyes And Leaves El Pollo Loco As the Last Chicken Standing    I decided to wait out LOCO and look to buy more in a play on its long standing trade range  Per my strategy  I bought more shares when LOCO swooned toward the lower end of the range  I was pleasantly surprised to see LOCO rally from there  culminating in a 11 2  pop on Friday in the wake of a positive response to the company s latest earnings  With the stock trading at the top of the range  I decided to take my profits on the entire position instead of just the last position I added  I am now looking to buy the next LOCO dip  Hopefully it comes before another potential suitor comes a callin  

Buyout or not  El Pollo Loco  LOCO  has been offering the patient plenty of profitable opportunities in its up and downs through an extended trading range

Commentary
The definition of nut job  also spelled nutjob     a mentally unbalanced person  a crazy person  
When  that President Donald Trump labelled fired FBI Director Comey a  nut job    on the on line version of the Merriam Webster dictionary 

While the 173 750  increase is very likely the result of starting from an extremely small base  it occurred to me that the use and interest in this term present a perfect monicker for the times and this stock market  On Wednesday  May 17th  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   broke down below its 50DMA and lost 1 8  as the stock market all at once decided to care about the political headlines  The losses essentially ended there as sellers once again proved unable to follow through on their advantage  In two days  the index traded above Wednesday s gapped open and closed above its 50DMA 
In parallel  the volatility index  the VIX  imploded  On Wednesday  the VIX soared 46 4  and tied August 21  2015 for the 6th highest one day change on the VIX  since 1990   No matter the starting point  such a rapid move is a likely sign of  flash panic   The 17 9  loss on Friday to a 12 0 close placed the VIX right back in the middle of the area of congestion that prevailed before the French Fly although the VIX is still above the extremely low levels that immediately followed the French Fly 

The S P 500  SPY  quickly recovered from its 50DMA breakdown and for a brief moment even made progress on closing Wednesday s Trump inspired gap down 


The volatility index  the VIX  once again met its match at the all important 15 35 pivot 
When I sold my put options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  on Thursday  I thought my small profit was a good win  UVXY went on to lose another 14 4  as a result of Friday s VIX implosion  I also failed to re establish a hedged call put option play  I am primed to do so on Monday morning 
A casual observer could be excused for looking at this seesaw and concluding a bunch of nut jobs are behind the curtain spinning the dials and emotions of the market  The trading action makes little sense from a  rational  sense  but it tracks with sentiment and technicals  In other words  the harder one tries to make sense of this kind of nut job action  the less sense it may make  So  as usual  I start with the technicals  and in particular my favorite technical indicator AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs  
On Wednesday  I noted the following about AT40 

 I am not bearish because AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  closed at 36 5   In a strong bull run  the low 30s is  close enough  to the oversold threshold of 20   So there is little upside here in flipping to a bearish stance  

It turned out there was ZERO upside to flipping bearish 
AT40 was the only thing keeping me from flipping bearish given the S P 500 s major 50DMA breakdown  AT40 closed on Friday at 42 8   Like the S P 500  AT40 for a brief moment made progress cutting into its gap down from Wednesday  Although the S P 500 managed to close above 50DMA resistance  I am not flipping back to bullish until buyers re demonstrate their muscle by completly reversing Wednesday s loss   not to mention I hate churning my trading call  Even then  I will have to go back to cautiously bullish because I strongly suspect that the next challenge of overbought conditions will signal a time to get bearish and fade the market  Still  one step at a time  I will cross that bridge once the market gets there 
AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  delivered a faint sign of better things to come for buyers  At one point AT200 managed to completely reverse Wednesday s loss before fading back to just above Wednesday s open  Note that AT200 remains in breakdown territory 

AT200  T2107  mounted a spirited comeback  after finishing a complete reversal of its post election gain  AT200 briefly reversed all of Wednesday s loss  Note that it is still below the low characterized trading before Wednesday s breakdown 
The last two days of buying saved the the Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  from a very bearish breakdown from a looming head and shoulders  H S  top  I continue to monitor these developments like a hawk 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLF  continues to teeter on the edge of a major bearish breakdown  topping action  
The nut job action in the stock market failed to impress currency traders  After a 1 day respite  the U S  dollar index  DXY0  continued to follow through on its major 200DMA breakdown  The world at large is slowly but surely stepping away 

The U S  dollar index  DXY0  fell sharply to close out a very bearish week for the currency 
The biggest display of nut job action was in Brazil  A full scale panic brings out the nut job in all of us  On Thursday  I wrote    as a case study in how I prefer to trade in the middle of a panic  The market delivered for me one more time as iShares MSCI Brazil Capped  NYSE EWZ  pulled off a large gap up and closed with a 6 8  gain  I sold into this rally and locked in my profits  EWZ now has the formidable task of regaining 200DMA support 

The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF  EWZ  made a bid for a rapid post panic recovery with a gap up and 6 8  rally  The 200DMA looms as overhead resistance 
One fascinating point of resilience was home builders  The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  dipped to 50DMA support on Wednesday and rebounded the next day  ITB actually closed the week at a new  marginal  10 year high 

The iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB  has mostly churned for 2 months but is staying near or at 10 year highs 
Given the week s events I decided to re establish a small hedge in Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   CAT fell with the market on Wednesday  but  more importantly  the next day the stock almost finished closing its post earnings gap up after a lukewarm sales report  The bounceback Friday erased the loss from Wednesday  so technically CAT is back in a bullish place  Yet  if trouble returns to the market  I see CAT as being particularly vulnerable given its tie to the global economy and Trump s plans for infrastructure spending 

Caterpillar  CAT  has failed to maintain post earnings momentum and even lost all its gains after reporting lukewarm retail data 
An  ugly stick  award goes to The Childrens Place Retail Stores  NASDAQ PLCE   After reporting earnings  PLCE gapped up a whopping 11 8   hurtled over its 50DMA  and almost hit a new intraday high  The gap turned quickly into crap as PLCE ended the day with a small loss  On Friday  PLCE followed up with more crap and a 4 8  loss  I daresay a test of  uptrending  200DMA support is in play now  Moreover  strong fades from major milestones are typically majorly bearish events 

Children s Place  PLCE  printed a post earnings gap and crap that may have just signaled a major top for the stock 
Merriam Webster maintains a  trending now  section that shows the most looked up words  For each word  MW writes a short article to explain why the term is topical or salient  While Trump turmoil dominates the news  I was still surprised that ALL top 5 words are related to these political headlines  People really are paying close attention   enough attention to even seek out the meaning of the words getting flung around

CAT,2017-05-23,"In today s investment world  it can be easy to get lost in the  next big thing   Everyone wants to find the next startup that s going to return 200  in two years  That s just human nature  and it totally makes sense  But smart investors know that sometimes the best buying opportunities come from the tried and true classics  and that s exactly what we have right now with Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT   
Founded in 1925  this construction equipment manufacturer has grown to become one of America s most iconic brands  Investors know the company well thanks to its long history of delivering solid dividends  and now after a strong first quarter the stock has some fresh momentum 
In fact  Caterpillar s most recent quarter was the first in 10 quarters that saw year over year improvement on the top and bottom lines  What s more  the company has set off on a cost cutting mission that should continue to improve earnings  even as low end user demand slumps 
Check out some of the keys to Caterpillar s strength right now 
As we know  the Zacks Rank is inherently linked to earnings estimate revisions  so it s logical to see a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  paired with strong revision activity  Ever since the company raised its own guidance after its earnings report  analysts have been scrambling to adjust their estimates upwards 
Investors will also note that Caterpillar falls into the Top 25  of the Zacks Industry Rank  It s our belief that your best stocks tend to come from the best industries  so this is a positive indicator  As you can see in our   the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining group has gained more than 10 5  year to date 
Of course  income focused investors are sure to be pleased by the company s 3  dividend yield  This certainly isn t the biggest dividend you ll see on the market  but it s always nice to have income producing stocks like this in your portfolio  especially when a company gets to a point where growth is more difficult 
But even in the growth department  we see some encouraging signs from Caterpillar  As mentioned  the company is cutting costs  and we re seeing this initiative have a serious effect on earnings  Indeed  our current full year Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for EPS growth of nearly 20   Current estimates also call for annual sales growth of 4 35  this year and 6 27  next year  which is not bad for a 92 year old company 
Shares of CAT are now hovering around their 52 week high  and it will be interesting to see if and when the stock breaks into a new range  There s been plenty of speculation about a new infrastructure deal coming out of this administration  so look for any news on that front to help the effort  If that gets delayed  continued earnings strength should keep boosting the stock too  We expect Caterpillar to report again on July 25

CAT,2017-06-13,"By Laurence Frost PARIS  Reuters    Renault Nissan alliance bankers have drawn up plans designed to channel millions of euros in additional  undisclosed bonuses to Chairman Carlos Ghosn and other managers via a specially created service company  according to documents seen by Reuters  Under the preliminary proposal   Renault   PA RENA   Nissan  T 7201  and Mitsubishi  T 7211  would pay the Dutch registered company a share of new synergies from their carmaking alliance  set to top 5 5 billion euros   6 2 billion  next year  The funds would be passed on as cash and stock bonuses to  encourage executives to pursue synergy opportunities   according to a presentation by Ardea Partners  an investment banking firm advising Ghosn on closer alliance integration  Renault Nissan spokeswoman Catherine Loubier said   This article is not based on any information provided by the alliance or its member companies  and no such decisions have been made   Loubier declined to comment further or respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the proposal and the relationship with Ardea Partners  which also declined to comment  Brazilian born Ghosn  63  is in open conflict with the French state  Renault s biggest shareholder  whose opposition to his CEO pay package was instrumental to its symbolic rejection in a non binding vote at last year s shareholder meeting  His combined 15 6 million euros in Renault Nissan pay amounted to the third biggest haul among French CAC 40 company bosses  In response  Renault cut Ghosn s variable pay component by 20 percent and clarified bonus criteria  Shareholders will have their say again at the 2017 general meeting on Thursday  in a vote that has now become binding under French law  Renault shares fell more than 3 percent after this report was published and were down 2 7 percent at 83 69 euros as of 1453 GMT  Nissan had earlier closed 0 2 percent lower in Tokyo  Ghosn  who is also chairman of Renault  Nissan  Mitsubishi Motors and the Renault Nissan BV alliance management organisation  said in February the government s near 20 percent Renault stake was blocking a full tie up  The alliance bonus plan would seek to encourage Renault and its 44 percent owned partner Nissan to operate more like a merged company without the need for actual ownership changes  It would create a new pool of executive pay   on top of existing bonus plans at the allied carmakers and Mitsubishi  in which Nissan took a controlling 34 percent stake last year  If implemented  the plan would likely draw criticism from some investors already concerned about compensation  governance issues and an ongoing French criminal probe into allegations of systematic Renault diesel emissions fraud  The company has denied any wrongdoing  NO DISCLOSURE Under the proposal seen by Reuters  the carmakers would pay in 8 percent of each annual increase in synergies achieved  In a hypothetical year where new projects with Mitsubishi saved 1 billion euros  80 million would be added to the bonus pot  One third of total awards would be reserved for the six top alliance roles   the chairman and CEO at each carmaker   of which four are currently occupied by Ghosn  The new Dutch private limited company  or BV  would be wholly owned by an independent foundation  the presentation states   avoiding related party issues  that would require compensation to be disclosed to the manufacturers  shareholders  It would also escape French payroll taxes   The amounts paid through the service contracts would be disclosed each year in the respective accounts of the  alliance  members   although the amounts paid to each participant would not have to be legally disclosed   it says  The incentive plan has Ghosn s backing  according to an accompanying memo dating from early June   The scheme is still being worked out in detail   it says  Renault and Nissan are due to update mid term plans and integration goals later this year  London based Ardea Partners was founded last year by Christopher Cole  a former Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  banker who is close to Ghosn  as a private investment banking firm providing  strategic and financial advice to CEOs  founders and boards of directors of leading global enterprises facing complex challenges   In 2013  Cole and his Goldman teams worked on a full Renault Nissan deal study piloted by Ghosn and a group of alliance managers  known internally as Project  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   It recommended a merger  but Ghosn instead unveiled a purely operational integration push early the following year   It s an Ardea Partners wide policy to never speak to the press   Managing Director Robert Falzon said when contacted for this story   Our chairman is very focused on this   SUCCESSION The plan to reward cooperation may indicate that Ghosn sees little chance of a merger to cement the alliance he built and has run for 12 years  as he moves to hand over some powers  In April  Ghosn stepped aside as Nissan CEO  though he continues to oversee operations as chairman  Renault Nissan is recruiting a new second in command  with several alliance managers in contention  Reuters reported on June 7  Senior Toyota  T 7203  executive Didier Leroy is also being considered  sources said this week  Furthermore  the bonus plan would increase pay for the chairman roles from which Ghosn is expected to continue directing alliance strategy for years  whether or not his Renault CEO contract is renewed in 2018   It makes perfect sense   said one senior Paris investment banker when told about the proposal   The question is whether he can manage the storm this is going to create   Pressure on Ghosn over pay had been easing ahead of Thursday s shareholder meeting  following the Renault pay concessions and his exit from the Nissan CEO role  ISS  an influential shareholder adviser that opposed Ghosn s pay last year  is urging clients to back his package  which may be enough to overcome the usual government opposition

CAT,2017-06-22,Actuant Corporation s  ATU  third quarter fiscal 2017  ended May 31  2017  earnings and revenues marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  both top  and bottom line results of the company lagged the respective year ago tallies  primarily due to the challenging conditions prevailing in the global energy market Earnings and RevenuesAdjusted earnings in the quarter  eliminating the quarterly restructuring charges and one time income tax gain of 5 cents  came in at 32 cents per share  a penny higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate   However  the bottom line figure fell short of the year ago tally of 40 cents per share  The company even noted that the quarterly earnings result missed its previously projected guidance range of 38 43 cents per share  Unfavorable segment sales mix and poor energy maintenance activity mainly weighed over the bottom line performance   Net sales in the reported quarter came in at  295 4 million  marginally higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  294 million  However  the top line came in lower than the year ago figure of  305 3 million  The year over year downside was due to adverse impacts of foreign currency translation  divestitures and acquisitions Core sales growth in the quarter was nearly flat year over year  as growth in core sales of the company s Industrial and Engineered Solutions  segment was offset by decline in core sales of the Energy segment Segmental DetailsIndustrial segment s sales during the quarter came in at  100 5 million  climbing 4 9  year over year  The upside was backed by sturdy industrial tool and concrete tensioning product s sales  Notably  businesses were fairly good across all major end markets Engineered Solutions segment s revenues were  111 4 million  up 2 9  year over year  The upside was stemmed by solid customer production rates in almost all the off highway markets  In addition  the Chinese heavy duty truck original equipment manufacturer s demand remained robust during the reported quarter Energy segment s sales came in at  83 5 million  dropping 17 6  year over year  Poor upstream offshore oil   gas demand  as well as lower sales accrued from the company s Hydratight business  dented the segment s sales in the quarter Costs and MarginsCost of goods sold in the fiscal third quarter declined 2 6  year over year to  192 6 million  Gross profit margin in the quarter came in at 34 8   contracting 40 basis points  bps  year over year Selling  administrative and engineering expenses were  70 1 million  nearly flat year over year  Adjusted operating profit margin was 9 4   down 100 bps year over year Balance Sheet and Cash FlowExisting the fiscal third quarter  Actuant had cash and cash equivalents worth  199 million  higher than  179 6 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2016  Long term debt totaled  539 3 million  down from  561 7 million recorded on Aug 31  2016 In the quarter under review  Actuant provided cash worth  37 4 million from operating activities  down 19  year over year  Capital expenditure came in at  8 2 million compared to  4 6 million registered in the year ago quarter OutlookActuant noted that the persistent industry downturn within its energy business has been more than offsetting the benefits accrued from the ongoing lean revitalization and sales effectiveness activities  However  the company intends to boost its long term cash flow and profitability by limiting activities within the upstream offshore market  It also anticipates to benefit from the ongoing portfolio management and restructuring efforts Based on the existing market conditions  Actuant currently anticipates to generate revenues within the  1 080  1 090 billion range in fiscal 2017  as against the prior

CAT,2017-06-29,"Thursday was the third straight session with the NASDAQ moving by more than 1   Unfortunately  the index has plunged two of those three times  It dropped by 1 61  on Tuesday and then recovered 1 43  on Wednesday  However  technology was under pressure again today  sending the NASDAQ lower by 1 44    and that was after a late day upmove  At its worst point in the session  the index was down more than 2   It finished at 6 144 4  The S P and Dow weren t spared today s drubbing  Both of the indices had their worst single day decline of the month  The S P was off by 0 86  to 2419 7 and the Dow dropped by 0 78  to 21 287   So why were we down so much today  There wasn t much in the way of a material event that would drive the sellers to take action today  Instead  this looks a lot more like end of quarter profit taking and lightening the load on some of the stocks that have run a lot in the quarter  see TSLA    said Brian Bolan  who is editor of Stocks Under  10 and is also filling in for Steve at RTA today  The only buy in the portfolios on Thursday came from Zacks Counterstrike  which added a position to capitalize on the biotech breakout while also selling two other names for profits  Learn more about these moves in the highlights section below  along with some other analysis from the editors  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Zacks Counterstrike  With yet another sharp pullback in the NASDAQ  Jeremy has an opportunity to participate in the biotech breakout at a good price  On Thursday  he bought a 7  allocation in Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bull 3X ETF  LABU   which had been spiking higher and likely will again  Meanwhile  the editor also sold Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and a quarter of Craft Brew Alliance  BREW  for gains of 6 9  and 6   respectively  The full commentary has more on today s action  TAZR Trader   Well that was some fun rotation on Thursday  But sell Tech to buy Banks  Of course it makes some sense to rotate money from this year s outperformer to the underperformer    But since today is quarter end  my sense is that fund managers would rather  dress the windows  with the quarter s winners  especially if they are on sale  More importantly  we want to think about what they will do headed into earnings season   To do that  we simply think about why Tech has led and if anything has changed  The answers are  Earnings  and  No   This sell off is a perfect time to get better exposure to your favorite earnings power houses on the innovation frontier   And the charts say the turn is close at hand  Starting with the S P 500  good support will be found around 2 400  As for the Nasdaq Composite  big buyers should surface near the May lows at 6 000 and the April 24 gap from 5 920      Kevin Cook Momentum Trader   While we may be overweighting our NASDAQ coverage lately  it s for good reason  It s been the main focus of the market over the last couple of weeks  Today the NASDAQ Composite retested the lows and breached them  However  there s still a silver lining here  Even though intraday the NASDAQ breached the lows  it didn t stay down there  In fact  it closed several points off the lows and  more importantly  above 6 107   The index is spot on the 50 day moving average right now  The last time it got this close was mid April  Then it caught a healthy bid and rallied up to new highs  I m sure sometime overnight or tomorrow morning they ll try to jam it down again  If it finds a bid  watch out for a rip your face off rally  If it fails  then the next stop is the May swing low just under 6 000      Dave Bartosiak

WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S consumer confidence jumped to a near 16 year high in July amid optimism over the labor market while house prices maintained their upward trend in May  which could boost consumer spending after recent sluggishness 
The reports on Tuesday underscored the economy s strong fundamentals  expected to keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates for a third time this year 
 This brightens the outlook for the economy as we enter the second half of the year   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   We expect Fed officials will continue with their gradual pace of rate hikes secure in the knowledge that a confident consumer means that more spending is on the way  
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index surged to 121 1 this month  the second highest reading since 2000  from 117 3 in June  The rise in confidence came despite the healthcare impasse in Washington  The index hit a 16 year high of 124 9 in March 
The survey s so called labor market differential  derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful  was the strongest since 2001  This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department s employment report and is consistent with continued reduction in labor market slack 
 That matches up well over time with actual labor market conditions and is a component of the Fed s labor market conditions index   said Ted Wieseman  an economist at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in New York   The latest gain indicates the unemployment rate is still falling to new lows  
The labor market is near full employment  with the jobless rate at 4 4 percent  But the tightening labor market has struggled to generate strong wage growth  a frustration for both households and policymakers 
LESS UPBEAT ON INCOME
The Conference Board survey showed consumers were less upbeat about their income prospects this month  The percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in their income fell slightly to 20 0 percent from 20 9 percent in June 
The share of those expecting a decrease rose to 10 0 percent from 9 3 percent last month  Tepid wage growth has hurt retail sales  which fell in June for a second straight month 
With consumers tightening their purse strings  inflation growth has slowed significantly  leading economists to dial back their expectations for an interest rate hike to December 
Fed officials were scheduled to start a two day policy meeting later on Tuesday  The U S  central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at the end of that meeting on Wednesday 
Despite the upbeat data  the dollar fell to a 13 month low against a basket of currencies as investors awaited the statement that will accompany the Fed s interest rate decision 
The S P 500  SPX  hit a record high  also buoyed by a sets of strong earnings from  Caterpillar   N CAT  and McDonald s  N MCD  
Retail sales could get a lift from rising house prices  which are boosting household wealth  A second report on Tuesday showed the S P CoreLogic Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5 7 percent in May on a year over year basis after increasing 5 8 percent in April 
An acute shortage of homes on the market and strong demand are pushing up house prices  In another report the Federal Housing Finance Agency  FHFA  said its house price index jumped a seasonally adjusted 6 9 percent in May from a year ago 
That followed a 6 8 percent gain in April  The FHFA s index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

CAT,2017-09-18,"Caterpillar s   NYSE CAT   machines are arguably the most recognizable in the industry and can be easily spotted from highway construction projects to massive industrial mining sites  Omnipresent and wide ranging in their utility  the company s manufacturing tools  as well as a massive restructuring initiative  have helped send shares of Caterpillar soaring over the last year 
The company s hot streak seems poised to continue  as Wall Street s faith in Caterpillar has only grown  On Monday  Caterpillar stock hit yet another new all time high after the company received a notable upgrade 
UBS Financial Services raised its Caterpillar rating from  Neutral  to  Buy   The firm cited positive findings from its survey of future spending plans of 50 mining companies as a big reason for the new  Buy  rating  UBS found that 60  of firms expect to spend more next year on new mining equipment 
 Our UBS Evidence Lab Macro analysis suggests a re acceleration of US private construction activity  and our UBS Evidence Lab survey indicates that mining capex should continue to improve in 2018   UBS analyst  in a note to clients 
The analyst also upped his Caterpillar price target to  140 a share from  116 per share  which marks a 15  upside from Friday s close  Fisher also raised his 2018 Caterpillar earnings per share estimate to  7 50 from  5 90 
With shares of Caterpillar hitting a brand new high on Monday  let s take a look at some of Caterpillar s fundamentals to see if investors have a reason to buy  despite its stock resting at the very top of a year long run 
Fundamental Outlook 
Caterpillar is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is categorized as a  Manufacturing   Construction and Mining  industry company  This industry sits in the top 2  of the 265 different industries tracked and ranked by Zacks 
The construction and mining equipment giant sports a  B  grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  Caterpillar s  C  for Value represents its lowest grade  but the company still scored an overall VGM score of  B  
Caterpillar boasts a projected full year EPS growth rate of 52 60   which is well above the industry average of just over 41   The company s return on equity  which sits at an impressive 18 52   is much higher than the Construction and Mining average of 7 40  
In terms of Momentum  Caterpillar s 52 week price change of 47 96  actually comes in well below the industry average of 71 17   Therefore  Caterpillar s strong 2017 run could climb higher in an industry that has experienced eye catching growth 
The company earned its  C  Value grade in part because Caterpillar s projected earnings yield matches the industry average of 4 33   Caterpillar s price to cash flow ratio of 12 62 also hovers right around the industry s 12 88 average 
Revenue Growth and Earnings Estimate Revisions
Caterpillar sales are projected to jump more than 15  this quarter to hit between  10 38 billion and  10 92 billion  The company s revenues are expected climb 11 07  overall this year and pop another 8 12  in 2018 
The most recent Zacks Consensus Estimate puts Caterpillar s current quarter EPS projection at  1 20  Our full year and 2018 estimates call for earnings of  5 20 a share and  6 54 a share  respectively 
As some readers might already know  the Zacks Rank is determined  in large part  by earnings estimate revisions  Therefore  Caterpillar s  1  Strong Buy  rank stems from a positive trend in this important indicator  
Caterpillar has received seven positive quarterly earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days  Within that same timeframe  Caterpillar s stock also earned seven upward revisions for its next quarter  as well as nine for this year and the following year 
Bottom Line
Zacks firmly believes that positive earnings estimate revisions are one of the best indications that a company s stock price is set to perform well in the future  It seems clear some analysts are convinced that  despite hitting a new all time high of  124 37 per share on Monday  Caterpillar s stock is poised to see further gains 
Caterpillar s projected gains could climb even higher if President Donald Trump s pro growth infrastructure agenda becomes a reality  But for now  Caterpillar s current metrics led to its Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  standing  and even if new top down infrastructure and growth initiatives aren t made  the Illinois based company seems to be a stock that investors might want to consider

CAT,2017-09-18,"Investing com    Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  shares touched a new record high on Monday  boosted by UBS s bullish take on the stock 
UBS analyst Steven Fisher upgraded the mining and farming equipment maker to Buy  after holding a Neutral rating on the stock for at least years  At the same time  the stock price target was raised to  140 from  116  As a reason for the upgrade  Fisher cited a growing cash position and signs suggesting the earnings upcycle will continue  
Fisher added that UBS s latest analysis of private non residential construction suggests a re acceleration in activity in the fourth quarter  with mid single digit percentage growth into 2018  Fischer expects Caterpillar will generate nearly  10 billion in cash flow between 2018 and 2020 after capital expenditures and dividends which can be returned to shareholders

CAT,2017-10-02,"This article reviews a big market shift that is just starting  and how to profit from it  Tax reform and shifting monetary policies are slowing recent winners  e g  large growth stocks and technology  and propelling some attractive mean reversion opportunities  In particular  we like small cap  value  and US stocks right now  In September  all three Blue Harbinger strategies extended their long term track records of outperforming the S P 500 
Tectonic Market Shift 
In September we saw the beginning of a tectonic market shift  and we believe it will continue to create attractive investment opportunities going forward  Specifically  we saw dramatic mean reversion as small caps  iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM   and energy  XLE  NYSE XLE    USO  NYSE USO   bucked their year to date relative trends and moved markedly higher  see table below for details   We believe this is the direct result of US policies including tax reform  the unwinding of quantitative easing  and the expectation for higher interest rates 
We expect the multi year rally in large cap growth iShares Russell 1000 Growth  NYSE IWF   and technology stocks  Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK   to slow  and so should this year s rally in international stocks as the US dollar continues its new trend towards strength  Going forward  we expect US small cap and value stocks to outperform  We particularly like the iShares Russell 2000 Value  NYSE IWN  for its low cost efficient exposure to small cap US value stocks 
All three of our Blue Harbinger portfolios performed very well in September  see performance below   especially benefiting from the start of this market shift  and we expect all three of them to continue performing extremely well going forward 
Asset Class and Style Performance 
For your reference  the following table shows empirically the asset class and style performance we have described above  this data is as of September month end  

Blue Harbinger Performance 
And here is a look at the performance of all three Blue Harbinger strategies through the end of September  all three delivered very strong returns in September  and all three continue their long term track records of significantly beating the S P 500  

Small Cap Stocks are particularly attractive now 
Our performance in September was helped by our intentional overweight to small cap stocks  and we continue to like our specific small cap holdings going forward  For more color  here is a month by month look at small cap performance this year  September was a great month for small cap  but it still has a long way to go  

Noteworthy  small cap stocks have less non US exposure  they generally don t have the same international exposure as large caps   and we expect this to be a strong positive going forward as US policies result in a stronger US dollar  more on this later   For perspective  the following chart shows recent US dollar performance  note the strong end to September  

Further  small caps have a very long term track record of performing better than large caps over market cycles  more on this later   and considering their underperformance so far this year  even after their great September  we expect small caps to do very well going forward  Now is an extremely attractive time to own small cap stocks  in our view 
Value Stocks are also particularly attractive now   
Similar to small caps  value stocks also have a long history of outperforming the overall market across market cycles  which makes now a particularly attractive time to own value stocks  For perspective  here is a look at the long term performance of small cap and value stocks versus large cap and growth stocks  note  small cap value dominates over the long term  

And more recently 

This suggests to us that the large cap growth and aggressive growth technology stocks that have been dominated the market  see our performance table near the beginning of this article  are set to take a backseat to small cap and value stocks going forward 
US Stocks will do very well going forward   
Based on US policies  both monetary and tax reform   we expect US stocks to perform very well going forward relative to international stocks  Specifically  a less dovish fed  as quantitative easing rolls off  and interest rates rise  will help strengthen the US dollar  As will the lower corporate tax rates being pushed by the White House  For example  the following recent quotes from Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan help put the attractiveness of US stocks into perspective 

In case you missed it 
This week we contributed to another article on a Dash of Insight titled    In our view  patience is important as a long term investor because impatience can lead to too much trading  too much expensive transaction costs  commissions  bid ask spreads  exchange fees  bad execution prices  short term tax consequences  and mistakes overall  But at the same time  too much patience can become complacency  Rather than being complacent  we recently took big profits   110   by selling our Caterpillar shares  NYSE CAT  after holding them since January 2016  You can read our rationale for this trade here   
Conclusion 
Overall  we see some very attractive investment opportunities based on the tectonic market shifts that are just now beginning as a result of changing monetary and tax policies  as well as some good old fashioned  mean reversion    For example  we like small cap  value  and US stocks  for the reasons described in this article  such as well managed  low cost  passive ETFs like the iShares Small Cap Value ETF  IWN

CAT,2017-10-22,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Oct 23  2017   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Schlumberger  McDonald s  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and DuPont  NYSE DWDP  To see more earnings analysis  visit  3 Takeaways from Q3 Earnings SeasonWe are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season now  with more than 700 companies on deck to release results this week  including 180 S P 500 members  With results from 87 S P 500 members already out  as of Friday  October 20th  we will have crossed the halfway mark by the end of this week The results thus far provide a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings  which will most likely get strengthened and reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle  Here are the three positives that we can glean either from the results that have come out already or can reasonably be expected to transpire in the coming days First  there is clear momentum on the revenue front  with growth notably accelerating from other recent periods  Total revenues for the 87 S P 500 members that have reported results already are up  7 3  from the same period last year  which compares to  4 4  top line growth for the same group of companies in the preceding quarter and still lower average growth rates in the prior periods Second  the above average proportion of positive surprises that we saw in the preceding period has continued this earnings season as well  We typically don t give positive surprises a lot of weight in evaluating or assessing an earnings season since we all know that management teams are experts in managing expectations  Even then  the trend emerging in the Q3 earnings season is noteworthy for two reasons  First  estimates for the quarter had not fallen by as much as had historically been the case  Second  the proportion of positive revenue surprises  a much harder variable to manipulate relative to earnings  is only a shade below the preceding quarter s record level Third  the revisions trend for the December quarter is shaping up to be unusually favorable  The pattern over the last few years has been that as the quarterly earnings reporting season gets underway  estimates for the following quarter start coming down  Over the last few quarters  estimates would not fall by as much as was historically the case  but they were nevertheless coming down The unusual thing about the Q4 estimates is that they have actually gone up a bit over the last couple of weeks  This will most likely change as more companies report Q3 results and manage the market s expectations for the December quarter  but it is nevertheless an unusually positive development Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  October 20  2017 We now have Q3 results from 87 S P 500 members that combined account for 24 7  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up  9 4  from the same period last year on  7 3  higher revenues  with 71 3  beating EPS estimates and 70 1  beating revenue estimates The earnings and revenue growth pace is accelerating from what we had been seeing in the recent past

improved end user demand  favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization  The improvement in end user demand was noted across all regions and most end markets  The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease during the prior year quarter  In Machinery Energy   Transportation  Caterpillar witnessed a 31  rise in Asia Pacific driven by increase in

quarter 2017 due to higher production volumes  Notably  it was near flat in the prior year quarter  Increases in steel prices drove higher material costs Period costs were higher primarily due to higher short term incentive compensation expense Adjusted operating profit improved 76  year over year to  2 09 billion  Higher sales volume  favorable price realization and lower variable manufacturing costs  were offset by higher period costs  Caterpillar  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segment ResultsMachinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales increased 26 6  year

massive 312  jump from the year ago quarter  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit improved 31  to  750 million due to higher sales volume and lower variable manufacturing costs  partially offset by higher period costs The Resource Industries reported operating profit of  226 million in the quarter compared with the  366 million loss incurred in the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and lower variable manufacturing costs  Construction Industries  profit soared 171  to  884 million due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume  that were

2017  Caterpillar s backlog was at  15 4 billion  up from  14 8 billion at second quarter end  The  600 million sequential increase was driven by a  500 million increase in backlog in Construction

CAT,2017-10-23,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Caterpillaris seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CAT in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  1 24 per share for CAT  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CAT  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  1 27  heading into earnings season Caterpillar  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that CAT has a Zacks Rank  2  BUY  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Caterpillar  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,Zacks Investment Research,0.004,0.813,0.183,0.9964
CAT,2017-10-23,"Milacron Holdings Corp    NYSE MCRN   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 results on Oct 26  before the opening bell Last quarter  Milacron surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 2   The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  witnessing an average positive earnings surprise of 10 3  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Milacron Holdings Corp  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Factors to ConsiderMilacron recorded orders of  335 million in second quarter 2017  About 40  of the orders were shipped within the second quarter and 35  were scheduled  in the third quarter  During the second quarter conference call  the company stated that it has filled about 70  of backlog for Q3  Based on the current order rates  Milacron remains confident for Q3 s performance According to our latest consensus estimates  Milacron is expected to post net sales of  166 million for the third quarter in its Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies  APPT  segment  reflecting a year over year decline of 1 8   Further  our consensus estimates indicate that net sales of Melt Delivery and Control Systems will reach  105 million in the quarter and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Technologies is pegged at  29 6 million However  pricing pressure remains a headwind in the APPT segment due to the combination of the competition  low growth environment in North America  as well as broader commodity deflationary headwinds  The environment remains somewhat sluggish for equipment spending  and consequently  a significant improvement is not expected anytime soon In addition  the company is facing competition in its equipment business in North America  along with a choppy industrial environment  Milacron also witnessed  8 million foreign currency headwind in the top line in the first half of 2017  The company believes foreign currency impact will likely hurt its performance in the quarter to be reported Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Milacron will likely beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Milacron has an Earning ESP of  2 38   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 43 cents per share comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter Zacks Rank  Milacron carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Share Price PerformanceMilacron has underperformed the  over the past year  The company s shares gained around 21 9  compared with 54 0  growth recorded by the industry

CAT,2017-10-24," Bloomberg     As  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   goes  so goes the world economy 
Long seen as a bellwether for global growth thanks to its exposure to multiple industries  Caterpillar s earnings announcement on Tuesday reinforced the view that the international economic expansion is the most synchronized since the start of the decade 
 We ve got pretty good economic growth all over the world   David Solomon  president of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS    told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday   The expectation for growth was not as strong as growth has actually come in  
The Deerfield  Illinois based company projected 2017 sales of  44 billion  marking a third straight increase in annual revenue forecasts  But what stood out was the breadth of demand for its products 
Sales surged 27 percent in North America as the U S  oil and gas industry cranked up  while China s growing construction market helped sales in the Asia Pacific region balloon 31 percent  Dealers  replenishing of inventories boosted sales in Europe  Africa and the Middle East by 22 percent and  stabilizing economic conditions  in Latin America lifted sales by 24 percent 
 There s almost always a fairly tight correspondence between growth in the economy at large and in the manufacturing subset   said David Hensley  director of global economics at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   in New York   We re looking at  in GDP terms  some of the best growth of the entire expansion in recent quarters  
All told  Caterpillar reinforced the International Monetary Fund s move earlier this month to raise its forecasts for global growth this year and next  as three quarters of the world is now expanding 
That s good news at a time when the Federal Reserve and other central banks are starting to pull back on emergency monetary stimulus yet don t want to choke demand 
Weaker Dollar
A weakening dollar and increased momentum in global markets have led U S  manufacturing to a strong earnings season so far with some of the industry s largest players showing greater revenue and improved outlooks 
3M Co  s third quarter earnings on Tuesday beat the highest analyst estimate  and the company increased its projected profit for the year  United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX   also raised its profit forecast amid strength in demand for jet engines 
Orders for business equipment in the U S  have also been increasing in recent months  which probably helped boost third quarter growth  The Commerce Department will release September figures on Wednesday for capital goods orders  and Friday will bring gross domestic product for the July September period 
Even during a period when hurricanes hurt American businesses and consumer activity in the South  the world s largest economy probably expanded at a 2 5 percent annual pace last quarter  according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg  Some economists have been raising their forecasts for third quarter growth in recent days 
In Europe  factories are humming as well  A gauge for manufacturing rose this month to the highest level in more than six years  IHS Markit said on Tuesday ",Bloomberg,0.061,0.789,0.15,0.9927

CAT,2017-10-24,"It s was all quiet on the Western Front in European and US trade and a pause after what has been such a strong run for global equity and credit markets 
Whether the gains can continue this week is obviously yet to be seen  but I remain a bull  but of the view that these markets are tired  fatigued and need new information to fuel the beast  So much cash has come off the sidelines  with one US investment bank recently disclosing that their institutional clients have never held a lower cash balance in the bank s account  which suggests both active discretionary and systematic funds are all in on this rally  The idea of reflation and the well documented goldilocks backdrop for equity appreciation and risk taking is now mature  with investors having reacted to good economic growth  75  of countries enjoy above trend GDP   robust earnings growth  fairly low inflation and predictably central bank policy  which is helping keep implied and realised volatility low 
Can we see a pickup from the overnight lull this week with 40  of the S P 500 set to report Q3 numbers  with the market having already seen 82  of the 97 companies who have reported  beating earnings expectations  At the same time Donald Trump looks set to announce his appointment as chair and vice chair of the Federal Reserve anytime  which as we heard overnight is  very  very close   while we are also due to get a vote this Thursday in the US House on the Senate s 2018 budget resolution  which lays the groundwork for tax cuts and fiscal stimulus and this is widely expected to pass  Locally  we also have to deal with Aussie Q3 CPI on Wednesday  Thursday s ECB meeting and the start of the Aussie banks FY earnings  So despite a lack of any real movement in markets overnight  we know there are landmines and event risk to work through and this creates opportunity for short term traders 
Looking at market moves by way of a guide for Asia  we can see the S P 500 closing  0 4   with traders fading the opening high of 2578  on total volumes 8  above the 30 day average  Despite this small loss at an index level  all sectors bar utilities fell on the session  with 63  of stocks lower  In terms of earnings  the focus in the session ahead falls on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   where Caterpillar has been one of my favourite stocks for some time and remains a poster child of trend and momentum  Whether they can live up to the lofty expectations for Q3 sales and earnings is yet to be seen  while they will also need to justify full year consensus expectations of  43 1 billion in sales and  5 215 EPS  CAT s views on all things emerging markets  notably China are always of interest 
We can also see very modest buying in US fixed income across the curve  however  despite this we have seen the USD index gain 0 3   with the gains most pronounced against the EUR and Scandinavian currencies  There will be much focus this week on the USD index and whether we can see a break of the 94 area  which as we can see on the daily chart seems so important  as break would certainly raise the prospect of good upside  where a stronger USD  which if backed by a break of 2 40  in the US 10 year treasury could impact sentiment in broader financial markets  Given the EUR commands a 57 6  weight in this basket of currencies  traded against the USD   one suspects a dovish ECB  well  relative to expectations  could also drive EUR USD lower and the USD index through 94 00  It certainly feels as though the market will go into the ECB meeting eyeing a revised monthly run rate for ECB bond buying to E30 billion  while extending the program by nine months 

AUD USD continues to see no clear cut trend and price action is fairly messy at present  We have seen a move into  0 7796 at one point  but the buyers are stepping in to defend the figure  There is little to drive the pair in the session ahead  with the focus on tomorrows Q3 inflation print  USD JPY is perhaps a bigger issue for Asia today  as the pair has found good selling activity  with the pair around 80 pips lower than yesterday s high of  114 10  and this should weigh on the Nikkei 225 on open and potentially end the incredible run of 15 straight gains 
It s also been a subdued ride in commodity land too  with Brent and WTI crude closing  0 7  and  0 1  respectively  Copper has gained 60 basis points  while in the bulks we have seen spot iron ore close  0 7  at  62 00  with Dalian iron ore  steel and coking coal futures trading  0 1    1 2   and  1 3  respectively  Gold has been well traded  with many noting a spike in activity just before 03 00 aest  with the price jumping from  1275 to  1283 and nearly 19 000 contracts traded in a five minute period  So it s quite a messy affair in commodity land and hard to see too much love for Aussie miners today  but I would expect BHP  by way of a proxy  to open down modestly 
Aggregating all the news we can see Aussie SPI futures closing lower by five points  so we should see the ASX 200 open around 5890  There seems little inspiration from the overnight leads to buy the market here  but we live in strange times and the downside  if it does eventuate  will be driven by profit taking above all and I would not be overly surprised to see the index fall from 5890 on open  although I don t expect a collapse  It will be interesting to see how other Asian markets fare  as moves in the Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng could affect S P 500 futures to an extent  which could manifest on sentiment in Australia  It promises to be an interesting session  at least for the ultra short term focused traders out there anyhow ",IG,0.051,0.812,0.137,0.9983

CAT,2017-10-24,"US Earnings Key on Tuesday
A rare negative session on Monday in US equity markets could be quickly reversed on Tuesday  with futures pointing to a more positive open on Wall Street 
While there is always the potential for market pullbacks or even corrections  I don t think we can read too much into Monday s declines  especially given the long and gradual rally that preceded it and the size of the losses registered  I think what we saw Monday was simply some profit taking and now we ll see just how bullish investors are at the moment by how quickly and aggressively the dips are seized on  Index futures suggest we won t have to wait very long at all 
As will remain the case for much of the week  the main driver for equity market sentiment will be company earnings today with 42 S P 500 companies scheduled to report on the third quarter  This includes the likes of Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   3M Company  NYSE MMM   United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   all of which are also components of the Dow and three of which will report before the open  which could drive sentiment early in the session  We ll also get flash services and manufacturing PMI surveys from the US shortly after the open which could help guide sentiment 
EUR Edges Higher on Strong PMI Data
The eurozone recovery is gathering momentum according to surveys released this morning  with employment being a particular highlight from the manufacturing and services PMI reports  While the services PMI eased slightly from last month to 54 9   which still indicates a strong growth outlook   the manufacturing survey was extremely encouraging and was driven by strong export demand 

EUR Gains Appear Capped Ahead of ECB Decision
While a stronger euro may represent a potential headwind for manufacturing going forward  the ECB is managing the transition very carefully and has repeatedly acted to prevent a damaging appreciation  The ECB is due to meet on Thursday  after which an update should lay out plans for bond buying beyond the end of this year when the current program will expire  While a reduction appears all but guaranteed  the manner of the scaling down of QE is still apparently being decided on  with an initial  30 billion reduction until next September the most heavily speculation option 
The ECB will likely avoid to committing to anything beyond September   making this tapering process different to that carried out by the Federal Reserve   instead giving the impression that the decision will be made closer to the time  even if the process has already largely been agreed on  With this in mind  it s hard to envisage a scenario in which the ECB intentionally delivers above what markets are expecting  which could weigh on the euro driven by either profit taking or the usual dovish accompanying commentary

The yen is once again trading under a little pressure on Tuesday  having recovered late in the session on Monday to end a little higher on the day  Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that the result was broadly priced in  as was the continuation of monetary easing regardless of the super majority 
It s also possible that  having fallen so far over the last couple of months  it sell off has become overextended in the near term and a natural correction is on the cards  Maybe the election result has triggered such a move  The inability of the dollar  pound and euro to break yesterday s high may be evidence of this ",Craig Erlam,0.036,0.863,0.101,0.9867

CAT,2017-10-25,"The backdrop for the Asia market open is somewhat favourable for equity appreciation  but I stand by my call yesterday that these markets are absolutely knackered and a pullback of 2 3  would be healthy  Whether it comes is another thing though 
We had every opportunity yesterday to roll over and head lower on open and I had seen elevated risks this would play out  However  after opening and trading into 5885  in the ASX 200   we saw the bulls coming out to play and buying into material stocks  which ultimately put in five points into the index by the close of play  The Nikkei 225 put on an even more impressive display  with the market opening on its low  closing on its highs and gaining for a 16th straight day  It seems that the bears just have absolutely no say and investors do not want to take profits despite the recent run  and this tells you all you need to know about sentiment  implied volatility and portfolio risk management 
Today s leads are a great overview of everything we have seen in recent times though  Solid economic data  US flash PMI s easily beat expectations   strong earnings  predominantly from Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   and 3M Company  NYSE MMM   further speculation around Trump s pick for the Fed chair role and a decent level of noise around US tax reform  Certainly  most of the news flow seems to have focused on Trump s ailing relationship with Senator Corker  but there is also focus on the broader Republican Party struggling to form a consensus view on what has been labelled the  Big 4  in tax reform   rates  brackets  deductions  and deficits 
The market is still eyeing Thursday s House vote on the Senate s Budget Resolution  where some feel this could set up an important vote on tax reform before Thanksgiving  One to watch 
US fixed income has been interesting to watch and trade as yields have risen across the curve  but it s the US 10 year treasury which has so many talking given this benchmark has pushed up three basis points  bp  and is now sitting at 2 41    the highest close since May  This looks like such a key technical level and if yields continue to move higher here  especially when the 10 year  real   or inflation adjusted  yield now sits at the highest level since 17 July  this has to be seen as a USD positive  although the USD has not found any major traction here  with traders really reluctant to be too exposed to EUR moves ahead of Thursdays ECB meet  As mentioned Trump s pick on the future Fed chair has been in focus and while it is just the opinion of Senator Scott  when Trump asked the Senate overnight to signal who they supported as Fed chair  by raising hands   the result was seemingly in favour of John Taylor  This has given further wind to the selling in bond markets and helped push the likes of USD JPY a touch higher 
Aussie SPI futures have closed nine points higher  following moves in the S P 500 and we are calling the ASX 200 to open at 5918  If we look into the sector moves in the S P 500  by way of a guide   we can see US financials continue to push higher  the Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  ETF is a trend followers dream here   energy and material names have seen modest gains of 0 3  and 0 6  respectively and industrials have put on 0 5   so the sectors we need to work have done so  I am surprised by energy though given we have seen Brent and US crude close up 1 7  and 1 1  respectively on talk that OPEC may extend its quota program until the end of 2018 while starting the discussion of how to strategically taper this program at some stage in the future 
There will be some prepositioning into ANZ ahead of their earnings numbers tomorrow  due 08 00 aest   so it will be interesting to watch price action in this name  BHP should open around 0 2  higher  with some of the pure plays seeing more pronounced gains if we judge the 3  gain in Vale s US listing  Spot iron ore closed  0 7   copper  0 4   while in the Dalian futures exchange we can see iron ore  steel  and coking coal futures having a mixed performance closing  0 1    0 1  and  0 9  respectively 
The focus locally though has to be on the Aussie Q3 CPI at 11 30 aest  which will be a rates and AUD play and unlikely to promote a move in the ASX 200  Traders are giving this some breathing room though and the options market is priced for no more than a 40 point move today  so they don t see this as a volatility event  We know the speculative market is still long AUD s  so this may play into the trade  but the moves we have seen in AUD USD through 78c obviously suggest this elevate net position is being reduced  One suspects this has been largely helped by the fact that the yield premium to hold Aussie bond over US treasury s has declined quite sharply of late  notably the yield differential between the Aussie 10 year treasury over the US 10 year treasury has come in from 61bp on 5 September to now sit at 36bp 

A quarterly  trimmed mean  inflation print of 0 3   consensus of 0 5   or below then should take this yield spread even lower and cause the AUD USD to test the 6 October lows of  0 7733  while a move above 0 7  should support the pair and cause a 20 30 pips rally or so  Recall  the market is pricing a 42  chance of a hike by June  with the first full hike priced by November 2018  So while there are a number of  one off  factors in the inflation print  which is why economists and the Reserve Bank prefer to use the trimmed mean print  we need to work out how this print affects the RBA s thinking 
AUD NZD is also on the radar  with the pair at the highest levels since April 2016  although this is more about NZD weakness ",IG,0.039,0.824,0.137,0.9987

CAT,2017-10-25,"Market Summary
Asian markets got off to a slow start Tuesday as investors were put off somewhat by the weak lead in from Wall Street overnight  While most markets remained tepid throughout the day  the Nikkei soon gained strength and moved higher to extend its historic winning streak to a sixteenth consecutive session  The gains of 0 50  for the Nikkei came even as the Yen strengthened against the U S  dollar  normally a cue for Japanese equities to retreat  While markets across most of the rest of the region were nearly flat at the close  Hong Kong s Hang Seng erased early gains to finish the day solidly lower  The Hong Kong market  which has been one of the best performings this year globally  has seen a pullback over the past week as investors worry about new banking and property regulations from mainland China 
European markets were mixed on a country specific basis  but lower as measured by the broadest European equity indices  Trade was somewhat muted as investors continue to struggle with the Catalan independence issue  There is some caution entering markets this week as investors await the Thursday monetary policy meeting of the European Central Bank  where they are expected to announce a cut in their bond buying program  The FTSE in London edged slightly higher for the day  as caution has entered sentiment for British investors as well  It was the third day in a row where the FTSE closed with a change of less than 0 1   as investors grapple with mixed messages regarding the Brexit negotiations  On one hand  there have been reports of a stalemate that could keep talks from entering the second phase of negotiations  which would cover important trade agreements  On the other hand  Prime Minister Theresa May has remained upbeat  signaling that there is a  degree of confidence  that talks will make progress before the December European Union summit 
In the U S  markets moved broadly higher  with corporate earnings once more setting the stage for gains after 3M and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  blew analyst expectations out of the water  Investors have questioned the high valuations of U S  equities  but the strength of earnings continues attempting to put these questions to rest  The Dow ended the session at a new record high on the back of strength from 3M and Caterpillar  which were up by 5 9  and 5  respectively  The S P500 and Nasdaq also gained  but finished the day roughly 0 5  from record closing levels  Heavy earnings reporting continues through the end of the week  and should continue supporting gains as approximately 75  of companies reporting so far have beaten estimates

Crude Oil 
Crude is becoming increasingly interesting as the U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude reached a six month high on Tuesday  while Brent crude  the global benchmark  was at a nearly one month high  OPEC has re iterated its promise to help balance global supplies  which is bullish for crude  and the current geopolitical tensions in Iraq and Iran have kept concerns over supply disruptions high  In addition  it appears that global demand is staging a recovery  and if this continues we could see crude trading significantly higher in the coming weeks 
Cryptocurrencies  
Those who have been holding the smaller altcoins and waiting for them to recover were rewarded on Tuesday as Bitcoin  the top cryptocurrency fell by more than 6  after the Bitcoin Gold fork  but other altcoins made significant gains  Traders were shying away from Bitcoin after the fork as there remain many questions about the viability of Bitcoin Gold  and many exchanges and wallets are not supporting this fork  Other coins  which have suffered as Bitcoin gained in the past few weeks  saw prices soaring  with NEO adding nearly 13   and Ripple gaining 7 5   Ether advanced nearly 5   while DASH saw a more modest gain of 2 1  ",AvaTrade,0.089,0.759,0.153,0.9905

Headquartered in Deerfield  IL  Caterpillar is the world s largest heavy machinery maker and seen as a bellwether for global economic activity The company has benefitted a lot from improving global growth and a weak dollar since it derives more than half its sales from international markets Impressive Results Caterpillar reported another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share surging 129  year over year  Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 by 60   Revenues improved 24 6  year over year to  11 4 billion in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 6 billion Better than expected performance resulted from strong demand for its construction equipment as well as cost control efforts  Sales increased across all regions  with largest increase in North America  while China sales remained strong The management also raised its revenue and earnings guidance for the year Rising Earnings Estimates Analysts have raised their estimates for the company after excellent earnings  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current and the next fiscal year have increased to  6 40 per share and  7 63 per share from  5 26 and  6 74  before the results The company has been beating estimates consistently over the past few quarters  The average positive surprise for the past four quarters is 53 1   Headquartered in New York City  Avon Products is the world s largest direct seller with more than 6 million active independent sales representatives  Avon products  which are available in over 70 countries  include color cosmetics  skincare  fragrance  fashion and home products  under brand names like Avon Color  ANEW  Skin So Soft and Advance Techniques Disappointing Results The company reported weak results for its third quarter  Adjusted earnings from continuing operations came it at 3 cents per share in the third quarter  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents  This was the fifth straight quarter of miss for the company Total revenue was up 1  year over year and also slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The management expects full year results to be weaker than the guidance provided earlier  With mixed results in Q3 and some positive trends  we expect to see modest improvement continue in Q4  However  it will not be enough to overcome the slow start to 2017  and thus we expect annual results to come in below our 2017 guidance  The stock plunged almost 10  following the release and is now down about 66  this year Falling EstimatesAs a result of worsening outlook for the company  analysts have been cutting their estimates  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next year are now at a loss of   0 02  per share and earnings of  0 18 per share  down from  0 09 and  0 27 per share  before the results

we suggest that investors pay close attention to our proven stock picking system  which stresses the importance of earnings estimate revisions in finding winning stocks  But we also understand that lower priced stocks often make attractive investments  and we will always cover stocks that are making newsworthy moves  big or small With that said  stocks that are currently trading under  10 per share can often be particularly enticing to many retail investors  as they present the chance to scoop up large positions akin to what intuitional investors and Wall Street big wigs do with S P 500 giants However  stocks trading under  10 are subject to substantial swings  which can often happen in one trading session  This means that these  10 or less stocks are some of the biggest movers on

CAT,2017-11-17," Bloomberg     The lead negotiators for the three Nafta countries joined the latest round of talks as the U S  Chamber of Commerce warned that an American pullout would hit hardest some key swing states that President Donald Trump took on his road to power 
The three chief negotiators    John Melle for the U S   Kenneth Smith Ramos for Mexico and Steve Verheul for Canada    were scheduled to take part starting Friday in Mexico City during the fifth round of talks on a new North American Free Trade Agreement  Junior officials spent the past two days laying the groundwork for the round  which is scheduled to wrap up Nov  21 
U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts  Chrystia Freeland and Ildefonso Guajardo  will not attend this round  an approach that officials hope will dial down the political rhetoric and allow bureaucrats to move the ball forward on issues where the nations have common ground 
Still  Trump and his trade deputies haven t backed down from the threat to withdraw the U S  from the 23 year old accord  which governs more than  1 trillion in annual trade and has shaped the supply chains of companies from General Motors Co  NYSE GM   to  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said this week the talks are  on a very short time fuse  as a general election in Mexico and Congressional elections in the U S  approach next year 
Nafta States
Several of the blue collar states key to Trump s victory  including Michigan  Ohio  Pennsylvania  Wisconsin and Indiana  would be hit hardest if the U S  walks away from the deal  the U S  Chamber of Commerce said Friday in an analysis  Other big losers would include North Dakota  Texas  Missouri  Iowa  Arizona  Nebraska and North Carolina  said the group  the largest business organization in the U S 
With 65 percent of its exports heading to Mexico and Canada  Michigan could suffer from the most with about 366 000 jobs at risk if Nafta collapses  the chamber s Senior Vice President for International Policy John Murphy said in a blog post 
Other estimates of Nafta s demise haven t been as dire  Moody s Analytics projects that withdrawal would hurt all three economies  with Mexico the most vulnerable  But none of the three would slip into recession  according to Moody s forecasts 
See how U S  grocery prices would take a hit from an end to Nafta 
Negotiators are set to pay highest attention to rules of regional content  including for cars  as well as financial services in this round  according to an agenda obtained by Bloomberg 
Contentious Proposals
One of the most contentious U S  proposals focuses on the so called rules of origin for cars  which govern how much of a vehicle must be produced in North America to trade without tariffs  The Trump administration called for increasing the regional content requirement to 85 percent from 62 5 percent  and added a 50 percent minimum for U S  content 
Another contentious U S  proposal is adding a sunset clause  which would automatically terminate the pact after five years unless the parties agree to extend it  Ahead of this round  Mexico backed a five year review of the deal without a withdrawal clause 
Canada is open to discussing the Mexican proposal and to the idea of some kind of periodic re examination  but considers a full sunset clause as proposed by the U S  to be a non starter  according to a Canadian government official speaking on condition of anonymity ",Bloomberg,0.063,0.896,0.041,-0.9213
CAT,2017-11-21," Bloomberg     Mexico is proposing to limit access to government contracts for U S  firms in a sign that America s Nafta partners are willing to strike back against what they see as the hardline proposals by the Trump administration 
Mexican negotiators are seeking to cap the value of procurement tenders awarded to American companies to the same amount that Mexican firms get in the U S  Since American firms do more procurement business in Mexico than vice versa  it would mean less business for U S  companies  said a person familiar with discussions  who spoke on condition of anonymity 
The counter proposal underscores the deep differences that exist on major issues at the talks  The U S  had earlier proposed curbing Mexico s and Canada s access to its government projects  A fifth round of Nafta talks ends Tuesday in Mexico City 
It s an omen that negotiations may be entering a tit for tat phase  throwing into doubt the ability of the three countries to seal a quick deal  U S  business groups have warned that America s trade partners may retaliate against the Trump administration s aggressive position on everything from regional content rules for cars to dispute settlement 
The U S  is frustrated with the reluctance of Canada and Mexico to present counter proposals on key issues such as so called rules of origin  which could make or break a deal  Mexico and Canada continue to portray the U S  demands as unworkable  and are holding out hope the Trump administration will bow to pressure from U S  lawmakers and corporations to keep core elements of the deal alive 
Technocratic Calm
There has been an air of technocratic calm to the talks this week in Mexico City as bureaucrats plug away at less explosive issues  Trade chiefs from the three countries aren t attending this round  which has dialed down rhetoric on the ground  but also left a political void for overcoming some of the sticking points  The sprint for a U S  tax overhaul this year has overtaken the agenda in Washington  diverting some attention from Nafta 
Yet there s still no clear path to a deal on a successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement  which governs more than  1 trillion in trade and underpins the supply chains of companies from General Motors Co  NYSE GM   to  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the deal if the U S  doesn t get what it wants  and American officials want to get an agreement by next March  before a general election in Mexico and congressional midterm elections in the U S  inject even more politics 
 None of the big divisive issues have seen forward motion  They really need to be much further along than this  and I m concerned that this negotiation is on the verge of stalling out   said former Republican Congressman Philip English  now a senior government relations adviser at law firm Arent Fox in Washington  The deadlock raises the probability that Trump will follow through on his threat to pull out of the deal  English said 
Unique Thinking
The fifth round of talks has largely avoided the most divisive U S  proposals on dairy  automotive content  dispute panels  government procurement  and a sunset clause  Negotiators plan to meet next month in the U S   before convening again in Canada in late January 
Negotiators also spent much of their time in the fifth round on rules of origin  which govern how much of a product must be produced in North America to trade without tariffs  though discussions on that centered on mundane details such as paperwork requirements 
The White House has proposed major changes to Nafta s auto requirements  introducing a stipulation that 50 percent of parts or vehicles be U S  made  and increasing the minimum amount of regional content needed to 85 percent from 62 5 percent 
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said last week that Mexican negotiators planned to ask the U S  for a more detailed explanation of the autos proposal and the reasons for it  but didn t yet plan to present a counteroffer  A person familiar with discussions said Mexico views the U S  position as completely unworkable 
Canada was expected to respond to the U S  auto proposal this round by detailing why it thinks implementing the plans would harm the sector  without formally proposing a counteroffer  one Canadian official said 
 The U S  has put some extremely unique proposals on the table and many of those are and will remain problematic for Canada and Mexico   said Robert Holleyman  who was a deputy U S  Trade Representative in the Obama administration   We have a long way to go before we re able to say there are insurmountable barriers  although it s very choppy waters  ",Bloomberg,0.058,0.899,0.043,-0.9072

CAT,2018-01-02,After a banner year for equities in 2017  with major bourses notching all time highs  investors now mull over what 2018 might unfold  Many market pundits believe that this will be another solid year for U S  stocks   Benchmarks have already kicked off the New Year on a high note  with the tech heavy Nasdaq closing above 7 000 for the first time Investors are betting that lowering of corporate tax and solid economic growth will lead to strong earnings growth  Record end of year holiday sales  in the meanwhile  have given traditional retailers and department store chains a shot in the arm as Americans remain optimistic about their financial wealth Given such bullish trends  investing in big brand stocks seems prudent  They are well established and financially stable enough to cash in on this uptrend  But  there are significant headwinds confronting this year as well  We shouldn t forget that such bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs may soon come crashing down  Valuation measures such as price earnings ratios are raising caution  In the wake of adverse events as well  one can fall back on these stocks  After all  they have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investor attention even when the equity market is choppy Winners From the Republican Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U S  tax code in 30 years  The headline grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21   Also  the tax cut will be implemented next year instead of being delayed until 2019  Republicans also repealed the 20  corporate alternative minimum tax  Meanwhile  any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35  A one time low tax rate on foreign profits will help multinationals  including large tech majors  bring funds held overseas back to the United States  Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks  dividend payments and M A activities Banks also face a high tax burden  which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down  As per KBW estimates  major banks will enjoy a 20  or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20  The tax bill  in the meanwhile  will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle class Americans  This in turn will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods  eventually helping retailers Retail Stages a Solid ComebackRetailers also witnessed plenty of green in the holiday season  Total retail sales jumped 4 9  compared with the same period last year  This turned out to be the highest year over year rise since 2011  according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report released on Dec 26   The strong economy was a contributing factor but a pretty low unemployment rate encouraged investors to spend even more this holiday season  Moreover  consumers continue to

American Stocks to Buy in 2018After a banner year for equities in 2017  with major bourses notching all time highs  investors now mull over what 2018 might unfold  Many market pundits believe that this will be another solid year for U S  stocks   Benchmarks have already kicked off the New Year on a high note  with the tech heavy Nasdaq closing above 7 000 for the first time Investors are betting that lowering of corporate tax and solid economic growth will lead to strong earnings growth  Record end of year holiday sales  in the meanwhile  have given traditional retailers and department store chains a shot in the arm as Americans remain optimistic about their financial wealth Given such bullish trends  investing in big brand stocks seems prudent  They are well established and financially stable enough to cash in on this uptrend  But  there are significant headwinds confronting this year as well  We shouldn t forget that such bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs may soon come crashing down  Valuation measures such as price earnings ratios are raising caution  In the wake of adverse events as well  one can fall back on these stocks  After all  they have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investor attention even when the equity market is choppy Winners From the Republican Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U S  tax code in 30 years  The headline grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21   Also  the tax cut will be implemented next year instead of being delayed until 2019  Republicans also repealed the 20  corporate alternative minimum tax  Meanwhile  any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35  A one time low tax rate on foreign profits will help multinationals  including large tech majors  bring funds held overseas back to the United States  Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks  dividend payments and M A activities  Banks also face a high tax burden  which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down  As per KBW estimates  major banks will enjoy a 20  or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20  The tax bill  in the meanwhile  will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle class Americans  This in turn will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods  eventually helping retailers Retail Stages a Solid ComebackRetailers also witnessed plenty of green in the holiday season  Total retail sales jumped 4 9  compared with the same period last year  This turned out to be the highest year over year rise since 2011  according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report released on Dec 26   The strong economy was a contributing factor but a pretty low unemployment rate encouraged investors to spend even more this holiday season  Moreover  consumers continue to feel confident about spending this year and beyond  As per the Conference Board  consumer confidence continues to hover near the 17 year high scaled last November Pricey Stock MarketTwo third of the money managers  in the meanwhile  finds the U S  stock market s recent record run unsettling  The gains in the current nine year old bull market are nearly 300  This is the second strongest bull run

CAT,2018-01-05,"AT40   65 7  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   63 2  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   9 2  was as low as 8 9 Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   burst higher yet again and spent most of Thursday at or above its upper Bollinger Band  BB   Technically  the index is getting stretched  Combine that move with a volatility index  the VIX  which barely closed above its all time low for the second day in a row  and conditions are ripe for a pause and a pullback for the stock market 

A shot straight up so far in 2018 for the S P 500  SPY  

The volatility index  the VIX  is once again scraping at all time lows  Note how little time the index typically spends at these low levels 
Given the short amount of time the VIX typically spends at these low levels  I promptly bought a fresh tranche of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   Per the trading strategy  I plan to sell these calls at the first large spike in volatility  The volatility faders still dominate trading and have been quite effective at grinding volatility back into extremely low levels 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   is still struggling to gain momentum and challenge the overbought threshold at 70   Thus  the S P 500 is once again outstretching the field  The inability of buyers to expand breadth on the stock market s latest march higher is a classic AT40 sign of buyer exhaustion for the general stock market  The longer AT40 spends churning below 70   the less likely it will break into overbought territory before it pulls back  Of course  recall that AT40 can decline for quite some time before the major indices  aka the biggest stocks  decide to follow suit 
The raging bull market has turned the anticipation of pullbacks into a quaint exercise in nostalgia  I am not even changing the short term trading call and expect the next dip to be quite buyable even if all that awaits around the corner is a pause and another shallow pullback  The coming earnings season is the most likely catalyst for the next pause pullback 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  CAT is still one of my favorite individual stocks for flagging market sentiment  The stock has experienced a near relentless rally since last summer interrupted by the briefest of pauses and shallowest of dips  I have long since stopped using CAT put options to hedge my bullish positions  This week  I decided to take a swing with a call option as CAT took a pause at the bottom of its uptrending Bollinger Band  BB  channel  Thursday s 1 4  gain seems to validate that move  I am targeting more all time highs and an eventual trip to at least  162 50 before the next pause

CAT,2018-01-09,Market pundits have set their eyes on Corporate America as it is gearing up to report Q4 earnings results later this week  While the broader market is expected to face a period of consolidation  bank majors may feel the heat due to adjustments in values of deferred tax assets and liabilities and charges taken against earnings for repatriation The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors  with technology  Industrial products and materials contributing the maximum  Thus  investing in fundamentally solid stocks from these sectors is a well thought out strategy as these are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season  Here  we should bear in mind that better than expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price Market Consolidation on the AnvilOf late  all major bourses have been hitting a series of record highs  with the S P 500 crossing the coveted 2 700 mark for the first time this year  But  this uptrend may follow a fresh period of consolidation in the fourth quarter earnings season And why not  In each of the first three quarters of 2017  the S P 500 climbed around 5  heading into the earnings season  As the earnings seasons proceeded and companies started beating estimates  the market consolidated  Thus  a similar sort of market consolidation is expected this reporting cycle  After all  the index had already posted gains of 6 1  during the fourth quarter  which marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for the broader index S P 500 s Pre Earnings Price Performance Source  Tax Overhaul Effects   Banks First On the DocketThe Q4 earnings results are expected to be quite disorderly  especially that of big banks  Lowering of the federal corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  will now force banking behemoths to re measure the value of their deferred tax assets and liabilities  Moreover  one time charges for repatriating overseas earnings need to be considered  Total Q4 earnings of major banks are expected to be down 6  from the same period last year on 5 3  higher revenues However  consumers are feeling pretty good about themselves  with their confidence index remaining at historically high levels  Their finances have improved based on household debt service payments  as a percentage of disposable income  This in turn reduces the loan default risks  which may bode well for banks  Further  it gives consumers provision to take more debt Needless to say  financial stocks have had a solid run over the last few months  buoyed by optimism surrounding the rise in interest rates  For the finance sector as a whole  total Q4 earnings results are expected to be up 3 1  from the same period last year  read more    Potential Gainers of Q4The energy sector  in particular  is expected to record the strongest growth in the fourth quarter  Total earnings for the sector are expected to grow a whopping 176 3  on 23 7  higher revenues  The sector is benefitting from an uptick in oil and gas output to a revolution in the power mix to rise of electric vehicle  President Trump also continues to roll back regulations to boost oil production and save the coal industry Earnings at the technology sector are set to grow 14  on 8 5  higher revenues from the same period last year  Substantial growth in cloud computing  the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are cited to be some of the reasons that have boosted the sector in recent times A steady rally among semiconductors also supported the broader tech sector at the beginning of this year  while the PHLX Semiconductor index gained nearly 40  last year  These makers of computer chips utilized in everything from smartphones to self driving cars  in fact  recently got a boost from a survey by the Semiconductor Industry Association  The report showed that worldwide chip sales climbed 21 5  last November from a year earlier  read more    Industrials sector  in the meanwhile  is expected to rise double digits  Increase in sales from housing demand post hurricanes and a general uptick in the economy boosted manufacturing activities  High profits are expected from the materials segment as well  Overall Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 8 8  from the same period last year on 6 9  higher revenues  This would follow 6 7  earnings growth recorded in

CAT,2018-01-11,"This week  I discuss Caterpillar  CAT   and Chevron  CVX  both of which have solid catalysts for growth going through 2018  and pay a nice annual dividend  
Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   posted Q3 earnings results in late October where they easily beat both the top and bottom line expectations for the third consecutive quarter   The company followed up the impressive earnings results with even better monthly retail sales data for both October and November where it saw sales increases in all segments  
In October  machinery retail sales saw growth in all geographies  Asia  46   Latin America  24   EAME  19   and North America  7    Overall  the segment was up  19    In the Resource Industries segment retail sales were up  19  overall with gains in EAME  65   Asia Pacific  5   and Latin America  4    In the Construction segment retails sales grew by  20  overall with Asia Pacific up  58   Latin American  35   North America  10   EAME  7    Lastly in the Energy   Transportation division retail sales grew the most overall  23  with Transport retail up  51   Industrial  31   Petroleum  27   and Power generation  3    This news caused estimates for the next 2 quarters and 2 years to be positively revised 
Then in November  management reported that the sales growth got even better during the month   Machinery retail was up  26   Energy   Transportation up another  23   Resource Industry  35   and Construction improved another  25    Further  sales improved in each region  for each segment as well   This news caused analysts to once again increase earnings estimates for the next 2 quarters and 2 years  
Even with increasing commodity costs  the overall improvement in retail sales and total volume netted out the costs and are now viewed as a net positive for the company   Moreover  management recently commented that while they are working on some electrification of some aspects of its Resource Industry  they are more focused on improving fuel efficiency  customization  and built for purpose products   Further  the company commented they will be increasing research and development  R D  in the coming year  
Lastly  the company has high balances of cash that management is expected to use for dividend increases  and a potential share repurchase program   Currently  the company has a  1 87  annual dividend yield  
As you can see in the detailed estimates table below  these impressive sales numbers has caused analysts to positively upgrade earnings estimate several times over the past 90 days 

We are also awaiting President Trump s infrastructure plan which is supposed to be unveiled in the middle of this month   This is expected to be a strong domestic catalyst for Caterpillar over the next half decade   Further  recent reports showed economic growth in Europe and Asia  both areas where the company has a strong presence  
The company reports Q4 earnings on January 25th  before the market opens   There are very high expectations for CAT  but given the recent sales data  it should be a very solid report  
Chevron   NYSE CVX   has also beaten the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the past three consecutive quarters   But the big driver behind CVX s sustained upturn has been the price of oil   Oil recently broke  63 per barrel level for the first time in three and a half years   Further  recent news items have indicated that the price per barrel will continue to rise through 2018  
Early this week  the Energy Information Administration once again increased its price per barrel of oil expectations for 2018  after increasing its expectations December  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  up another  4 8   and Brent crude was lifted another  4 3    The EIA also anticipates that the U S  will now produce 10 27 million barrels per day in 2018  up from the 10 1 million expectation in December   This is the highest estimate for annual production since the EIA started tracking production in 1983  
Also  President Trump s recent tax plan included opening the ANWR Alaska area for exploration and drilling   This has a lot of potential for companies like Chevron  but the President didn t stop at Alaska  he also expanded offshore drilling to almost all U S  coastal waters  According to the report the Interior Department is proposing 47 auctions of drilling rights in the near future  
As you can see in the detailed estimate table below  all of this positive news has caused analysts to positively revise Q4 17  Q1 18  FY 17 and FY 18 earnings estimates several times over the past 90 days 

Also  there is a belief on the street that oil prices might reach  80 per barrel by the end of 2018 due to two major factors   First  the overall worldwide demand for oil continues to grow due to improving economic conditions across the globe   Second  the continuation of OPEC s production cut plan has constrained total supply while demand keeps increasing  
Chevron currently pays a solid annual dividend yield of  3 36

CAT,2018-01-11,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   recently wrapped up the purchase of Cooper Atkins  boosting its inorganic growth further  Cooper Atkins will strongly complement Emerson s global cold chain business  which includes the Cargo Solutions business and the ProAct Services portfolio for supermarkets 
Acquisition Spree
Emerson has been on an acquisition spree  of late  A month back  Emerson acquired Paradigm   a dominant provider of software solutions to the oil and gas industry   for  510 million  Paradigm will serve to deepen Emerson s foothold in the upstream oil and gas market  as the former adds a series of subsurface software tools to the latter s growing Automation Solutions portfolio 
Last October  Emerson bought GeoFields  Inc   a global supplier of software and implementation services for the oil and gas industry  to strengthen its foothold in pipeline solutions for the oil and gas industry We believe these buyouts will help the company create a solid core business model and drive profitable growth in the near term 
The company s actions have  it seems  met with shareholder approval  Emerson has outperformed the industry over the past six months  having appreciated an impressive 20 9  compared to the  s gain of 9 4  

Core Restructuring Actions
Emerson has been executing restructuring activities since 2015 to drive efficiency and growth  In fact  Emerson has slashed almost a third of the company s sales during its two year restructuring process 
As part of its strategic portfolio restructuring  Emerson agreed to divest its ClosetMaid business to Griffon Corporation  back in September last year  In fiscal 2016  the company sold three of its businesses   Network Power  Leroy Somer and Control Techniques   and generated  5 2 billion in proceeds  These restructuring actions will enable Emerson to capitalize on its growth platforms 
To maintain its scale of operations  the company has been making smaller  bolt on acquisitions  Importantly  Emerson completed a  3 15 billion acquisition of Pentair s valves and controls business in April  Integrating Pentair s Valves   Controls business will enable Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio and help it offer complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network  thereby elevating the company s brand value  Emerson expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive in fiscal 2018 and contribute meaningfully to operating cash flow 
Emerson maintains that it is on a constant lookout for small bolt on and strategic acquisitions to bolster its sales to up to  20 billion and cash flow back to more than  3 2 billion over a span of next five years  To that end  Emerson intends to spend between  500 million and  1 5 billion on bolt on acquisitions over the next couple of years  Last year s outlay for the same came to about  1 5 million 
Growth Drivers   Business Scenario
Solid order trends  successful multi year restructuring initiatives  and momentum in both its platforms will likely prove accretive for the company s sales  Emerson s process automation business has finally got over its recession  with orders being strong and organic revenues growing  After the sale of a major chunk of this segment to Nidec Corporation  Emerson now generates more than 60  of its revenues from this segment  Improving industry trends bode well for this segment s growth in the quarters to come 
The company has been enjoying broad based growth  driven by favorable trends in the energy related  hybrid and general industrial markets  as well as sturdy demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets  Emerson anticipates increasingly favorable global market conditions and encouraging trends in capital spending  which will likely drive underlying sales growth across both platforms in the coming quarters 
The ongoing recovery in oil and gas is likely to be the most significant profit driver for Emerson  In fact  it derives 50  of its total sales from the energy sector  With the addition of the Valves   Controls business  roughly 70  of sales in Automation Solutions will be generated directly from oil and gas customers  Emerson projects strong growth for this division  and as oil prices recover  the high level of exposure to energy end markets will likely boost the company s earnings  However  should oil prices reverse course  there is a substantial risk that large energy projects could be delayed or canceled  which would have a material impact on the company s operations 
Also  a strong U S  dollar  volatile industrial spending  and uncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company

CAT,2018-01-24,"While the gold mining industry reports energy as only 15 20  of its total production costs  the total amount consumed by the industry is much higher  The market underestimates the amount of energy consumed by the gold mining industry because of the way it is listed in their financial statements  Thus  it takes a great deal more energy to produce gold than the market realizes 
Due to the complex supply chain system that we depend upon  most of the energy that is consumed in the production of goods  services  materials  metals  and commodities is hidden from plain sight  For example  a gold mining company will list  Tire Costs  in their Financial and Sustainability Reports  However  even though a tire cost is listed as a material cost  the majority of a tire s production cost comes from burning energy  in all forms and in all stages 
For example  Barrick Gold consumed nearly 25 000 tons of tires in 2013 on its mining operations  According to the Rubber Manufacturing Association  it takes roughly 7 gallons of oil to produce a standard car tire  And from the article    stated the following 
One of the many unique aspects of the Cat 797 are its tires  More than 13 feet tall  weighing 11 860 pounds  each Michelin  PA MICP  or Bridgestone Corp   T 5108  59 80R63 XDR tire costs  42 500 and that s when you buy the full set of six required by each  5 5 million truck 
Contains nearly   enough to build two small cars and enough rubber to make 600 tires to put on them 
If the Rubber Manufacturing Association says it takes 7 gallons of oil to make one standard tire  and this article claims that the 13 feet tall tire used by the Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  797 haul truck contains enough rubber to make 600 tires  then it takes 4 200 gallons of oil to make one of these giant tires  If we take a more conservative estimation of a smaller mining truck tire  it would likely consume at least 2 000 gallons or oil  or nearly 50 barrels of oil 
Furthermore  Barrick consumed 25 000 tonnes or roughly 50 million pounds of tires in 2013  How many large mining tires did Barrick use in its mining operations in 2013  Well  if we use a more standard mining tire called the Bridgestone size 40 0057  that is 11 5 feet tall  it weighs 8 500 lbs  Thus  Barrick consumed nearly 6 000 of these tires in 2013  I am using 2013 data because Barrick stopped listing its tire usage in later sustainability reports  
Regardless  Barrick lists its tire costs as a material cost  However  if we take the time and dissect the entire  haul truck tire manufacturing and supply chain   we will see that energy was the overwhelming cost in manufacturing one of these large haul truck tires  Even though it takes 50  barrels of oil to make one of these large tires  this does not include the steel  other materials  the electricity and labor used in their production  We must remember  all the materials that were used in making a large haul truck tire was a result of a tremendous amount of energy all the way down the manufacturing and supply chain 
Goldcorp s Production Costs  Don t Report Full Amount Of Total Energy Consumption
Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   the fourth largest gold mining company in the world  published a breakdown of its production costs for 2018  According to their Jan 2018 Presentation  labor  including contractors  were the largest cost at 46   followed by consumables  15    energy  14    Maintenance parts  9    Site costs  5    Explosives  3    tires  2   and other additional costs  6   

Goldcorp stated their labor costs were 27  and contractors at 19  for a total of 46   Goldcorp also broke down its energy costs to 7  for fuel and 7  for power  electric generation costs   Even though energy is only 14  of Goldcorp s total production costs  the majority of the other items listed received their value from consuming energy down their entire manufacturing and supply chain system 
Let me give you another example  Goldcorp consumed nearly 500 000 metric tons  mt  of lime in 2016  According to the U S  EPA  energy was 31  of the material cost to produce lime 

Moreover  lime producers spend 3 4 times more on materials than they do on labor  If we take the time and examine all the additional materials consumed in the production of lime  we would find out that ENERGY is the major cost in their mining  production  and transportation to the lime production plant  So  even the lime producers underestimate the total energy consumption in producing lime because they list it in their  material cost  
If we look at Goldcorp s production cost breakdown chart above  the consumables  maintenance parts  site costs  explosives  tires and other costs received their value or market price from the burning of energy in all forms and in all stages along the way   Unfortunately  we don t see that because the energy is not considered because it shows up as a finished product  good or material at the gold mine 
Lastly  while labor accounts for 46  of the production cost for Goldcorp  without energy  there wouldn t be workers  Let me explain  A haul truck driver makes a lot of money because the job is very stressful and takes a certain amount of skilled labor  However  all the haul truck driver is doing  is steering and controlling all the LEVERAGED ENERGY contained in that transportation system 
Not only did it take a lot of energy and capital to produce that haul truck  the amount of diesel the haul truck burns is quite high  The Caterpillar 797F gets about 0 3 miles per gallon  Thus  all the haul truck driver is really doing is controlling how energy is being burned  Without the massive haul truck and its ability to move 200 400 tons of ore at a time  manual human labor would take quite a long time to move that much ore the old fashion way 
So  most of the labor today used in the gold mining industry is to control and manipulate trucks  machines and processing systems that do most of the work by consuming a tremendous amount of energy  While humans could be replaced by machines or more automatization  the energy can t be replaced  A barrel of oil has the equivalent of approximately 10 000 20 000 human labor hours of work  depending on the wage

CAT,2018-02-06,"AT40   19 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    first oversold day after 19 percentage point plungeAT200   45 8  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   17 3  115 6  increase  The largest since at least 1990 Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish   oh so many caveats below
Commentary It was the JP Morgan bottom  On February 12  2016  almost two years ago  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  bounced out of oversold conditions  below 20    AT40 stayed out of oversold conditions for a near record 488 trading days  This period is called a  20  overperiod  because AT40 traded above 20   Over that time  the S P 500 gained 42   In price performance  this past 20  overperiod ranks  3 since at least 1986 where my data end  In duration  this period ranks as the second longest  This was a truly historic moment for the stock market 

S P 500 historical performance during the T2108 20  overperiod 
AT40 closed at 19 4  and is oversold   calls for buying right away because the typical oversold period only lasts 1 or 2 days  If the oversold period lasts longer  then the next wave of buying waits until the volatility index pulls back off a high  The conservative strategy calls for patiently waiting until the oversold period ends before buying  I see significant issues with both strategies given the unique nature of this sell off 


AT40  T2108  plunged from overbought to oversold in 9 days with the bulk of the loss in the last two days 

First  the market entered this oversold period with the volatility index already surging  In fact  the VIX hit an historic level and clocked a record 115 6  one day gain     The VIX has not traded this high  37 3  since the 38 1 intraday high on August 25  2015 
The VIX last closed higher on August 24  2015 when I wrote about how to profit from an EPIC oversold period in the wake of the flash crash that I later dubbed the  August Angst   So  if the sell off continues  I have no good bearing on how much higher the VIX could go  The VIX SHOULD be topping out right here  Even a pullback in the VIX amid such high level of panic may not provide a good indicator of the end of the stampede 

The volatility index  the VIX  zipped right through multiple important levels in the last two trading days 

Second  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   broke down below its 50 day moving average  The 4 1  loss took the index well below its lower Bollinger Band  BB  and instantly plunged the index into negative territory for the year  now down 0 9  year to date  Say goodbye to all that new retirement and passive investment money that flooded the market in January  Wall Street I am sure is grateful   The index was up 7 5  for the year at the all time high just over a week ago  Buying the market after the oversold period ends would likely face a quick test of stamina as the S P 500 plows into resistance from the 50DMA   very poor risk reward 

The S P 500  SPY  finished erasing its 2018 breakout and closed with a loss for the year 

The NASDAQ joined the S P 500 in obliterating 50DMA support 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  could not hold support at its 50DMA either 

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  followed through on its 50DMA breakdown the previous trading day  A quick test of 200DMA support appears in the works 
I am left with a strategic dilemma that requires more nuance than I like  but I find it necessary  The oversold conditions require that I keep the short term trading call at bullish  Given the market s precarious nature  I am cautiously bullish  That caution means I will not buy aggressively until unless the S P 500 tests its uptrending 200DMA  Such an event would be the first test since the times around the presidential election 
As the S P 500 approaches 50DMA resistance  I will switch to neutral and have a bias to SELL rallies  I will switch back to cautiously bullish if when the S P 500 closes above 50DMA resistance AND sports follow through buying  Until the market is solidly bullish again  the majority of my short term trades will focus on the indices  SPY  NYSE SDS  NYSE SSO  and QQQ  
If AT40 languishes in oversold territory  I may occasionally make SMALL bearish bets to offset existing bullish positions  Note that the longer AT40 stays oversold  the worse the S P 500 tends to perform 

The performance of the S P 500 for a given oversold duration  T2108 below 20   
My nuanced approach also comes from Monday s trading experience  I started the day bullish and found validation when the S P 500 bounced near my 2735 line in the sand that separated bullishness and bearishness  The switch in tone came mercifully swiftly  and I was not able to complete my shopping list 
Shortly after the index made a new low  I had to pause  I next waited to see whether the buyers would show up at 2 30pm Eastern  They did not  Instead  the selling intensified  and I moved to get officially bearish  I loaded up on call options for ProShares UltraShort S P500  SDS  and set a limit order for a double  Much to my delight AND shock  the order filled in 25 minutes 

This 15 minute chart shows how the S P 500 bounced from the open had me fooled  My bear bull line was 2735 
I next looked around and noticed the VIX was really going nuts  With my oversold trading plan in hand  I prepared orders to fade volatility anew  Shock and awe once again occurred as the short volatility products completely collapsed in the after hours  and long volatility continued to rally 
ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY  lost another 79  of its value  VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX ST ETN  NASDAQ XIV  lost 84  of its value  The iPath  S P 500 VIX ST Futures  ETN  NYSE VXX  gained 29  while ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  only gained 27   I am sure glad I stuck to options on these products  Still  this range of action makes little sense and suggests a serious technical breakdown in the way these products work  I am bracing for ripple effects into options pricing and then to stocks 
The market is teetering on some level of brokenness  I am resisting the urge to look for an explanation  a driver  a catalyst to deliver some logic to it all  I assume no one truly knows what is going on underneath the market s twisted covers  As a result  I feel better prepared for whatever is coming 
CHART REVIEWSiShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NASDAQ TLT 

On a day where broad based selling smashed stocks through critical technical levels  iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  delivered one of the more interesting charts for me  TLT managed to gain 0 9  as bond yields backed off a bit  Fear acted like a counter balance to the rates rising narrative that has dominated the headlines during this sell off  I added more TLT calls today  and I continue to like long TLT as a hedge against a more serious market malaise  Just imagine the Fed talking about that happy place of higher rates while panic is in the  Wall  streets 

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  held its ground on Monday  coincidentally right around its level at the close of 2015 

Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  Typically  CAT is a stock I use to hedge bullishness  This cycle  I decided to go long  I THOUGHT CAT confirmed its uptrending 50DMA as support when the market bounced early  The day ended in calamity  CAT lost 4 1  but was down as much as 9 3  at its low of the day  Clearly  I need to switch CAT back to its former role 

Caterpillar  CAT  essentially experienced a mini flash crash as it gave up 50DMA support  Are the skids now greased for a quick test of 200DMA support 
Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  Not stocks  but these currencies are important for understanding the context of market sentiment  Earlier in the day  AUD JPY dropped right through 200DMA support and confirmed the day s bearish vibes  I dutifully went short  but took profits when I noticed the tremendous surge in the VIX 
At the time of typing  the Australian dollar is trying to rebound back to where it stood just ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia s  RBA  latest pronouncement on monetary policy  I am looking to aggressively fade AUD JPY again and will be watching this sentiment indicator more closely than ever   Also at the time of typing  Japan s Nikkei index is down about 6   

The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  broke down below support but has not yet confirmed bearishness with a trade below November s low

CAT,2018-02-18,"As you would expect  the recent market correction in all major equity markets  and in particular for the US indices has broadly been reflected in the price action for individual stocks  This is not to say all boats rise and fall with the tide  but following such a dramatic and savage reversal  it is no surprise to see leading blue chip stocks reverse off their recent trends of which Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  is a good example  This is a stock I have mentioned several times before  and is one I suggested was likely to do well in the event of a Trump win  At the time the stock price was trading at the volume point of control in the  85 region  and since then the price has risen steadily to currently close this week at  156 29 on the monthly chart 
On this chart accumulation is clearly in evidence in January 2016 with a narrow spread down candle on high volume  with the upwards trend then developing  and further buying appearing in March 2017 as the stock paused before accelerating and moving firmly higher for the remainder of 2017  Note however  how the volume on the monthly chart is gently declining  and it is interesting to note the volume in December 2017 looks to be lightweight  given the wide spread up candle it is associated with 
It was no surprise therefore to see the January 2018 candle develop  which was the warning signal of a reversal ahead  with a deep wick to the upper body of the candle and high volume  a classic relationship  and interesting as a precursor to the dramatic correction that duly followed in early February  Since then  the stock has recovered with the deep wick to the lower body of the candle  and provided the principle indices continue to recover with the NQ emini leadining the way  we can expect to see stocks such as Caterpillar recover  and pick up the bullish trend once more ",Anna Coulling,0.044,0.866,0.09,0.9528

Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 77 by a margin of 22   After a string of dismal performances for four years  Caterpillar witnessed a turnaround through 2017 on the back of improving end markets and its relentless focus on cost control  The fourth quarter performance marked the company s fourth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth  Consequently  Caterpillar s shares advanced 1 88  in pre market trading  Overall for the year  the company delivered an impressive 101  year over year improvement in earnings  Driven by strong order rates  lean dealer inventories  increasing backlog and expectation of higher sales volume  the company has initiated fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance range of  8 25  9 25  which reflects a 27  year over year rise at the mid point reflecting higher sales volume across its three primary segments   Including one time items  Caterpillar reported a loss per share of  2 18 in the quarter compared with a loss per share of  2 00 in the prior year quarter  This includes several large adjustments for the impact of U S  tax reform  restructuring costs  mark to market losses for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans  state deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments  gain on sale of an equity investment in 2017 and a goodwill impairment charge in 2016  Revenues Improve Across All Regions   Markets Revenues improved 35  year over year to  12 9 billion in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 9 billion  The company witnessed higher sales volume owing to improved end user demand and favorable changes in dealer inventories  End user demand improved across all regions and most end markets  Higher Sales Drive Improved Profits In the reported quarter  cost of sales increased 18  year over year to  8 9 billion  Gross profit soared 97  to  4 billion  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 8  to  1 6 billion  Research and development  R D  expenses rose 11  year over year to  579 million  Adjusted profit before taxes were pegged at  1 7 billion  a substantial improvement from  0 6 billion in the prior year quarter  Higher sales volume  favorable price realization and lower variable manufacturing costs were offset by higher period costs  Variable manufacturing costs were lower in the quarter due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and lower warranty expense  Period costs were higher primarily due to higher short term incentive compensation expense  All Segments Deliver Growth Machinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales surged 37  year over year to  12 2 billion  Sales of Energy   Transportation gained 22   owing to higher sales across all applications  Sales at Resource Industries improved 53  due to higher sales volume for both equipment and aftermarket parts as well as favorable price realization  Construction Industries sales rose 47  driven by favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as well as higher end user demand for construction equipment  Sales increased across all regions with the North America and Asia Pacific leading the pack  The ME T segment reported an operating profit of  1 09 billion against the operating loss of  1 34 million in the year ago quarter  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit improved 38  to  881 million due to higher sales volume  partially offset by higher period costs  The Resource Industries reported operating profit of  209 million in the quarter versus  711 million loss incurred in the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and favorable price realization  Construction Industries  profit soared 151  to  838 million due to favorable price realization  higher sales volume and variable manufacturing efficiencies  However  unfavorable period costs and higher material costs  primarily for steel somewhat negated these gains  Financial Products  revenues went up 6  to  783 million  Financial Products  profit was  233 million in the quarter up from  149 million in the prior year quarter  The increase can be attributed to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an increase in net yield on average earning assets  Financial Position Caterpillar ended 2017 with cash and short term investments of  8 3 billion  up from  7 2 billion at 2016 end  The debt to capital ratio at ME T was 36 7  as of 2017 end  lower than 41  as of 2016 end  and within the company s target range of 30 45   Operating cash flow at ME T was at  5 5 billion in 2017 compared with  3 9 billion in the prior year  In the reported quarter  the company made a discretionary contribution to U S  pension plans of  1 billion and a payment for early debt retirement of  958 million  Robust Backlog At the end of 2017  Caterpillar s backlog was at  15 8 billion  up from  15 4 billion at third quarter end  The increase was mainly driven by higher backlog Resource Industries  Backlog at Construction Industries remained flat while the company witnessed a decline in backlog at the Energy   Transportation segment  On a year over year basis  order backlog improved by about  3 7 billion driven by improvement across both Construction and Resource Industries  Fiscal 2017 Results Trumps Guidance  Estimates Caterpillar s adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was  6 88 compared with  3 42 in fiscal 2016  Earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 47 as well as the company s guidance of  6 25  Including one time items  earnings were pegged at  1 26 for the year compared with loss per share of 11 cents in the prior fiscal  Revenues came in at  45 5 billion that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  44 2 billion and also improved 18  on a year over year basis  The company had guided revenues at  44 billion  Upbeat Guidance for 2018 Initiated Strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates  lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog bode well for an improved 2018 performance  Given these factors  along with positive economic indicators globally and many of the company s end markets  Caterpillar initiated adjusted earnings per share guidance range of  8 25  9 25 for fiscal 2018  All the segments are expected to log growth in the year How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then

CAT,2018-02-28,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 1  2018   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Total Q4 earnings for the 470 S P 500 members reported are up  14  from the same period last year on  8 5  higher revenues  with 77 2  beating EPS estimates and 76  beating revenue estimates  Best Earnings Season in YearsNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points      The standout features of the Q4 earnings season continue to be very strong revenue momentum  a preponderance of positive surprises and positive revisions to estimates for the current and coming quarters      Total Q4 earnings for the 470 S P 500 members that have reported results are up  14  from the same period last year on  8 5  higher revenues  with 77 2  beating EPS estimates and 76  beating revenue estimates      This is a materially better performance relative to what we have been seeing from the same group of companies in other recent periods      For Q4 as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  13 9  from the same period last year on  8 6  higher revenues  Earnings growth is expected to be positive for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit growth for the Energy  Technology  Aerospace  Construction  Industrial Products  Basic Materials  Business Services  Retail  Utilities  and Autos sectors      Q4 earnings growth for the Energy sector is the highest of all sectors  with total earnings for the sector up  157 2  from the same period last year on  23 8  higher revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total Q4 earnings for the rest of the S P 500 index would be up  11 7       Earnings growth is expected to be strong for the Technology sector  with total Q4 earnings for the sector expected to be up  23 6  on  11 1  higher revenues  Finance sector earnings are expected to be up  0 6  on  4  year over year growth in revenues      As expected  companies are announcing big one time charges related to the tax law change  which is making the gap between adjusted operating earnings and GAAP earnings the highest in recent years      For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q4 results from 80 5  of its members  with earnings up  18  on  9 1  higher revenues and the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises at 66 5  and 71 7   respectively  Please check page 29 through 37 of the full report for more details on the small cap index      Earnings estimates for the current period  2018 Q1  and following quarters have been going up in a notable way  with tax law changes as the most notable reason for the positive revisions  The positive revisions are broad based and not restricted to the Energy sector  with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors up since over the last few weeks      For full year 2017  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  7 7  on  4 8  higher revenues  which would follow  0 7  earnings growth on  3  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  20 4  in 2018 and  9 7  in 2019      The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using index 2018 P E of 18 8X and aggregate index close  as of February 28th  is  146 10  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  160 32 for 2019 and  122 40 for 2017   Q4 Scorecard  as of February 28th  2018 We now have Q4 results from 470 S P 500 members that combined account for 97 1  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 470 index members are up  14  from the same period last year on  8 5  higher revenues  with 77 2  beating EPS estimates and 76  beating revenue estimates The Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace for these 470 companies is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods  The proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises is similarly significantly above other recent periods for this group of index members Here are the four key trends emerging out of the Q4 earnings seasonFirst  there is clear momentum on the revenue front  with both the growth pace as well as the proportion of positive top line surprises tracking above historical periods Second  an above average proportion of companies are beating EPS and revenue estimates A high proportion of positive surprises is typically not a big deal given management teams  expertise in anchoring expectations at easy to beat levels  We typically see this show in lowered estimates ahead of the start of earnings seasons  But what makes this above average proportion of positive surprises notable is the fact that estimates for Q4 had held up very nicely ahead of this earnings season Third  the gap between adjusted operating earnings and GAAP earnings is extremely high The all around one time charges this earnings season pertain to the accounting impact of tax law changes  which we are stripping out of our  adjusted  earnings numbers for comparability reasons  The chart above shows that adjusted earnings have historically been 16 17  higher than GAAP earnings for the 470 index members that have reported results already  but they are a very high 28  in Q4 The issue is widespread and not restricted to one sector  For example  Citigroup   NYSE C   reported adjusted earnings of  3 38 billion while its GAAP earnings were a loss of  18 3 billion  Caterpillar s   NYSE C   adjusted earnings for the quarter of  1 29 billion compare to its GAAP loss of  1 3 billion  While adjusted earnings for the 470 S P 500 members are up  14  from the same period last year  while the same growth on a GAAP basis represents a decline of  9 2  There is no question that these are one time and non cash charges  But the wide gap between adjusted and GAAP earnings this earnings season is nevertheless an unflattering comment on the  quality  of the earnings performance

As I feared was likely  the S P 500 wasted no time in breaking its 50 day moving average  DMA  support 

The SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  slipped below its 50DMA with a 1 1  loss  It closed on top of the downtrending 20DMA 
The S P 500 lost 2 2  for the month  This February was only the second negative February after 2009  The only other loss was a marginal 0 4  two years ago  Moreover the index last experienced a monthly loss in March  2016  The monthly chart of SPY below shows the smooth  monthly  sailing for almost two years 

Did February just bring an end to what has been a relentless run up for almost two years in the S P 500 
While February s selling may seem and look like an anomaly  a longer historic view reminds me that this performance was not an anomaly  Below is a chart of a given year s January price change versus its February price change on the S P 500  The size of the bubble indicates the magnitude of the annual price change of the previous year  White bubbles are negative years  The dashed line is a trendline for the monthly price changes  January s price change was positive 5 6  

While January s price change was historically very strong  February s pullback following a strong January is quite normal on a longer term basis 
The tech laden indices  the NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ   fared a little better that the S P 500 with losses of 0 8  and 0 6  respectively  Both indices remain well above tests of their 50DMAs 
The volatility Index continued its bounce off the 15 35 pivot with a gain of 6 8  and a close at 19 9  The VIX is right back in  elevated  territory  20 and above   With the S P 500 cracking the 50DMA barrier  I switched my volatility trade strategy by speculating on call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   I set a target for a 50  gain  and  much to my surprise  my limit order filled in less than an hour  The bumrush of selling into the market close swept volatility higher  I am still holding my short iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN  NYSE VXX  as the longer term positioning 
The breaking of the 50DMA barrier also forced me to switch my trading call from bullish back to neutral  I hate the chop in the short term trading call  but the changes reflect the rapid dynamics in the market  As I noted in my last Above the 40 post  if AT40  T2108  were not so close to oversold  I would be outright bearish right now  My first target would be to short QQQ down to 50DMA support  and I still might do it as a hedge for other long positions 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  cratered from 31 2  to 25 4   My favorite technical indicator is essentially just one day of selling away to returning to oversold conditions for the third time in a month  I assume the switch will flip just as the NASDAQ and QQQ are testing their 50DMAs  I will be on edge at that point bracing for a fresh spike in volatility  and hopefully well positioned with new UVXY call options ahead of the move   
Still  one step at a time  New Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has a second day of testimony in front of Congress on Thursday  the responses during Q A are an important wildcard 
Next up is to see whether sellers really have retaken control of the market by showing follow through on the S P 500 s 50DMA breakdown 
CHART REVIEWS
U S  Dollar Index
Another important test of a 50DMA is happening  but this one is a test of resistance  The U S  dollar index has fought its way back from what now looks like a double bottom  the close inverse of EUR USD that I showed in the last post   While the dollar is a symptom of other forces  like higher interest rates  I think it is a looming reminder to the market that the previous weak dollar theses and trades are teetering all over again  As we saw in the last sell off  forced changes in trading strategies can generate extra volatility  So  once again  I am bracing myself 

The U S  dollar index is on the comeback trail  It will confirm a W bottom with a 50DMA breakout 
Caterpillar
Industrial  cyclical stocks like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  are particularly vulnerable to a strengthening dollar  CAT took a big hit with a 4 1  loss as it smashed through 50DMA support  I tried to add to my existing CAT put position once support crumbled  but I did not get the price I wanted  I will be looking to lock in profits on my hedge as my put expires on Friday 
Caterpillar plunged through its 50DMA support on high volume and a steep 1 day loss  Combined with the earlier sell off  this kind of damage can quickly exhaust buyers 
Australian dollar versus Japanese yen
Needless to say  the plunge in AUD JPY to a level unseen since June of last year confirmed for me the rapid increase in bearishness in financial markets  Rather than close out my existing short position  I expanded it  I am also focused on long yen trades across the board right now 
The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen  AUD JPY  flashed an even brighter warning sign  Now  the June lows need to hold

CAT,2018-03-02,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    The S P 500 ended another turbulent week on an upbeat note Friday  but major indexes posted their worst week of losses since early February as President Donald Trump s threat to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum rattled investors  The gains on Friday came as investors who had been spooked by the prospect of a global trade war backed off those concerns and noted a trade war was far from certain at this point  Trump on Thursday threatened a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum without exemptions for any countries  igniting a selloff in a market already on edge over rising U S  interest rates and bond yields  Trump struck a defiant tone on Friday  saying trade wars were  good  and easy to win   and U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  appearing on CNBC  said tariffs would have a  trivial effect    Phil Orlando  chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York  said Trump s announcement was made to call everyone s attention to the U S  trade deficit but investors decided that a full blown global trade was not going to happen    For a real estate guy like that  you pound the podium  you rattle some sabers  you get everybody s attention and then you negotiate back to some reasonable midpoint   The tariffs could dampen profits for everything from car makers to beer companies and result in higher prices for consumers  Shares of big U S  steel companies and manufacturers were under pressure on uncertainty over the effects of tariffs  Shares in  Caterpillar   N CAT   a buyer of raw materials and a big exporter of construction machinery products  were down 2 6 percent after falling 2 8 percent in the previous day s session  General Motors  N GM  was down 1 percent  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  fell 70 92 points  or 0 29 percent  to 24 538 06  the S P 500  SPX  gained 13 58 points  or 0 51 percent  to 2 691 25 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  added 77 31 points  or 1 08 percent  to 7 257 87  For the week  the S P 500 dropped 2 percent  while the Dow was down 3 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1 percent  Wall Street had posted gains in the previous two weeks as it recovered from its steep early February selloff  Those losses in early February pushed the S P 500 down more than 10 percent from a Jan  26 record high  confirming the market was in a correction  The tariffs are unlikely to significantly hurt Corporate America s overall earnings  according to stock market strategists  who were not immediately adjusting their profit estimates following Trump s announcement   The impact on total corporate earnings first would be driven by the impact on the economy   said Keith Parker  U S  equity strategist for UBS in New York  McDonald s  N MCD  dropped 4 8 percent after RBC lowered its price target on the stock and cut its 2018 earnings estimate  citing a disappointing early sales impact from McDonald s value menu  The stock was the biggest drag on the S P and the Dow   J C  Penney Co Inc  N JCP  shares fell 5 4 percent after the department store chain missed same store sales estimates  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1 69 to 1 ratio  on Nasdaq  a 2 99 to 1 ratio favored advancers  The S P 500 posted one new 52 week high and 25 new lows  the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 65 new lows

President Trump has been talking about taking unilateral trade actions since he was campaigning in 2016  The rhetoric heated up in the past year and took on even more solid form in recent weeks  For example  I benefited from recent trade war talk with a position in U S  Steel  NYSE X   So I was a bit surprised when the market reacted so negatively after Trump recently made the trade war even more real in recent tweets 
Then again  with European partners threatening retaliatory steps and Trump now responding in kind  I suppose the trade war tripwire has truly sprung into the market s increasingly fragile conscious  Moreover  Trump tweeted that a trade war is both  good  and  easy to win  for America  so the threshold for the U S  to enter into trade wars must be very low indeed 
The market s reaction to the trade war fury demonstrates a lack of consensus on the implications  The selling on Thursday was swift and was strong enough to force a gap down on Friday  Yet buyers stepped into the breach and forced a relatively strong rally to close an otherwise dismal week 
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gapped down and opened right at the previous day s intraday low  The subsequent buying was critical because the opening gap down forced the NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ  below their respective 50 day moving averages  DMAs   At the close  the tech laden indices were once again above their 50DMAs with solid gains of 1 1  and 0 9  respectively  The S P 500 closed with a gain of just 0 5  and failed to break its downtrending 20DMA 

The S P 500  SPY  gapped down but managed to gain 0 5  before stopping short at its downtrending 20DMA 

The NASDAQ managed a bullish comeback by surging from its 50DMA breakdown to finish the day with a 1 1  gain that almost reversed all the previous day s loss 

The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  mounted a less dramatic comeback from its 50DMA breakdown with a 0 9  gain 
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  made an even more dramatic comeback that produced a 1 6  gain on the day  IWM punched through its downtrending 20DMA but still closed below its 50DMA 
The dramatic market comeback had a dramatic impact on the volatility index  the VIX  The fear gauge was up as much as 16 7  at its peak  At the close  the VIX suffered a 12 8  loss  The VIX closed at its low and even below the previous day s intraday low  This was a significant implosion  but I am still eyeing an eventual drop below the 15 35 pivot 

The rally in the volatility index  VIX  stopped short of the 2012 intraday high before imploding 
At its low  AT40  T2108  traded right to the edge of oversold conditions  19 97  to be exact  before rebounding  You just can t make this stuff up  My favorite technical indicator ended the day at 27 1  

AT40  T2108  performed a picture perfect bounce off the oversold threshold 
 are opening up a wide array of trading opportunities on both the long and short side  The on going drip of challenging news is throwing previous trading and investing strategies for loops and motivating some over reactions and trigger finger responses  The heightened uncertainty generated by the potential for a trade war makes my neutral trading call appear even more appropriate 
On the bearish side  I will be looking to see whether buyers exhausted themselves with the extended intraday rally off the lows  My eyes will be on the tech stocks in this case  On the bullish side  the bounce off the oversold threshold could represent the latest tradable bottom  An S P 500 close above its 50DMA would confirm this bottom 
CHART REVIEWS
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  As planned  I locked in profits on my CAT put on Thursday  but I could have waited another day  With talk of trade war in the air  CAT continued its tumble  CAT gets the pleasure of a double whammy from a trade war through higher steel costs and potentially lower access to international markets  especially China  The stock lost another 2 6  and matched its February low  I daresay 200DMA support is in play for CAT here  Accordingly  I need to get right back into put options on CAT  Unless AT40 is in oversold conditions  I will get aggressively bearish on CAT if it closes lower which I think is very likely  I may even just sit on short shares 

Caterpillar  CAT  is on the edge of a very bearish confirmation of its 50DMA breakdown 
McDonalds  NYSE MCD  Could MCD become a trade war victim  Will residents of other countries boycott their local McDs to make a point about trade policy  If so  that scenario could explain MCD s 4 8  gap down and loss or at least explain the over reaction to  that lowered its price target from  190 to  170  still well above Thursday s close

DETROIT  Reuters    Higher U S  tariffs on imported steel will mean more jobs at some American steel mills but raise the risk of layoffs at others  industry executives said on Wednesday 
On the winning side of President Donald Trump s plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel are U S  steel mills with excess capacity that can be restarted  albeit with a significant delay  to meet increased demand  On the losing side are steel makers that rely on the import of specialty steel products not manufactured in the United States 
Bob Miller  chief executive officer of the U S  operations of Novolipetsk Steel PAO  MM NLMK   knows exactly how his business and workers will be affected   and it is not good news 
 This will absolutely lead to layoffs   Miller said  explaining that U S  producers do not make the steel slabs he needs to supply sheet steel to customers like  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  and automakers 
If Trump s steel tariffs are imposed without exemptions  Miller says Russia based Novolipetsk Steel will shelve plans to invest  600 million to add capacity at factories in Pennsylvania and Indiana and lay off hundreds of American steel workers  Within three to four months the company would have to cut 50 percent of the 1 200 steel workers it employs today because it would run out of raw materials  he said  adding that if customers refuse to accept higher prices  the company s U S   business case could disappear  
 Personally  I think my 1 200 U S  steel jobs are just as important as anyone else s 1 200 steel jobs   Miller said 
But at U S  Steel Corp  N X  the company is readying to ramp up operations in expectations that the tariffs will spur demand  U S  Steel on Wednesday said it would begin restarting one of two idled blast furnaces at its Granite City  Illinois  steel plant   a process that will take up to four months and could support 500 jobs 
The company is  actively reviewing the anticipated increased demand for steel produced in the United States   a U S  Steel spokeswoman said 
The two companies are emblematic of how the proposed tariff on steel has exposed division within the industry and highlighted the challenges of rebuilding capacity in a capital intensive sector 
U S  steel makers have said the domestic industry has 30 million tons of annual idled capacity and can ramp up to meet demand   which totaled around 107 million tons in 2017  36 million of which was imported 
Granite City and an AK Steel Holding Corp  N AKS  mill in Ashland  Kentucky  are the only two idle U S  plants sufficiently well maintained to be brought back any time soon  industry analysts said  Between them  they have 5 3 million tons of capacity available 
For many other mothballed mills   it is highly unlikely they would come back at all  because it would be too expensive to do so  said Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Lee McMillan   We would likely see higher prices because of capacity constraints  
U S  steel makers are expected to increase prices if tariffs are imposed 
Independent analyst Michelle Applebaum said the U S  steel industry should be able meet most demand  but even plants like Granite City and Ashland  which have been kept ready to restart  take four to six months to be ready for production 
 This doesn t happen overnight   she said 
This worries steel consumers like energy storage and transport company  Plains All American Pipeline   N PAA   where CEO Greg Armstrong said shortages could hamstring some pipeline projects 
 We buy not only pipe but valves and things that are not manufactured in the United States   Armstrong said   I don t think it s appropriate to put a tariff on something that you can t buy in the United States  
Steel suppliers like California Steel Industries Inc  UL CAST   which imports 1 5 million tons of steel slabs annually  argue that Trump s bid to save U S  steel jobs will cost them ",Reuters,0.067,0.825,0.108,0.9881
CAT,2018-03-13,Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   reported a surge of 33  in global retail sales for the three months ended February 2018  following a 34  rise noted in the past month  The company had last witnessed growth at these levels in 2011  This robust pace can be attributed to improvement across all regions as well as segments  Within Machines  Resource Industries and Construction Industries reported positive gains for the eighth and 13th consecutive months  respectively  Caterpillar Starts 2018 on a Strong Note In the first two months of 2018  Caterpillar s sales growth has averaged 33 5   In February  the company s performance was driven by a 41  increase in Asia Pacific sales  The region has been a consistent contributor for the company since it posted the first positive reading in August 2016  Latin America registered growth of 39  while Europe  Africa and Middle East   EAME   and North America sales both went up 30   The Resource Industries segment delivered an impressive 60  sales growth in February   its best performance so far  This was led by a surge of 62  and 60  in North America and Asia Pacific sales  respectively  EAME and Latin America reported growth of 58  and 57   respectively  Sales growth in the Construction Industries segment went up 27   Sales advanced 36  in Asia Pacific and 30  in Latin America  North America and EAME sales rose 25  and 20   respectively  Sales in the Energy   Transportation segment rose 21   Growth was led by sales to the Oil   Gas sector  which reported a 29  rise  Sales to the Power Generation sector advanced 19   In the Industrial sector  sales improved 12  and the transportation sector advanced 6   2017 was a Comeback Year Last year marked a turning point for Caterpillar  which had been bearing the brunt of a weak mining industry over the past few years  Retail sales growth entered the positive trajectory in March following an unprecedented stretch of declines for 51 months  Retail sales have shown significant improvement ever since  notching up an average of 10 3  in 2017  Caterpillar also reported year over year improvement in both top and bottom line in the first quarter of 2017   the first time in 10 quarters  owing to its incessant efforts to cut down costs and strength in the Asia Pacific region and the construction sector  This set the ball rolling for the company which delivered upbeat quarters for the rest of 2017 as most end markets began to improve  Consequently  in fiscal 2017  Caterpillar s adjusted earnings per share surged 101  year over year to  6 88 from  3 42 in fiscal 2016  This was a major turnaround for the company which had suffered a 36  drop in earnings in fiscal 2016  Also at fiscal 2017 end  Caterpillar s backlog was at  15 8 billion  up from  15 4 billion at third quarter 2017 end  mainly driven by higher backlog in Resource Industries   Caterpillar s share price has surged 65  over the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 62   What s in Store for Caterpillar in 2018  Strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates  lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog bode well  Backed by these factors  along with positive economic indicators globally and many of the company s end markets  Caterpillar guides earnings per share in the  8 25  9 25 range for fiscal 2018  a 27  year over year growth at the mid point  Reflecting the solid prospects  the Zacks Consensus estimates for earnings for 2018 and 2019 moved north 15  and 16   respectively   The Construction segment will benefit from continued improvement in North American residential  non residential and infrastructure markets  President Trump s plans of big spending in infrastructure would be a major catalyst  While anticipated seasonality of sales in China will slow down growth in the latter part of the year  most other APAC countries are expected to grow  which can be attributed to investments in infrastructure  We believe this year  the Resource Industries segment is poised to be a catalyst  Global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices is restoring miners  profitability and they are resuming capital spending  Further  the recently passed tax reform is likely to lead to higher spending for Caterpillar s customers  However  the recently imposed 25  tariff on steel imports and 10  tariff on aluminum imports remains an overhang on the industry given that it will inflate manufacturing costs  Machinery Stocks Poised for Growth Caterpillar s stellar run and solid prospects and upbeat view instils optimism in the broader machinery sector as the company has been dominating the global manufacturing industry for a long time  owing to its size and scope of operations   The company falls under the Zacks Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  The industry has surged 62  over the past year  way ahead of the S P 500 s growth of 21     It currently carries a Zacks  of 8   a testimony to the fact that the industry is in fine shape  The favorable rank places the industry in the top 3  of the 256 groups enlisted  Consequently  investing in machinery stocks makes perfect sense at this point  We have chosen few stocks based on the momentum strategy  which is based on the premise that once a trend is established  it is likely to continue  A top  cuts short the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers  It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success

CAT,2018-03-13,"On January 25  the world s largest construction equipment manufacturer  Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  reported earnings of  2 16 per share  overshooting by nearly a fifth the  1 79 consensus EPS  and beating the estimated 11 98 by almost a cool billion at  12 9  
The company s share price activity epitomizes the theme that has been dominating the market for a long time  the rise and fall of President Donald Trump s reflation trade  which was reignited by a historic tax overhaul when he signed the  Tax cuts and Jobs Act  into law on December 22 
While the 59th ranked company on the Fortune 500 list jumped nearly 3 percent on an intraday basis at that time  it closed with just a mediocre 0 6 percent advance  During the following session the price began to slide  At its worst  the stock shed more than a quarter of its value by early February and is currently almost 8 7 percent down 
What happened to the great earnings  What happened to the company s embodiment of the reflation trade  The answer may have much to do with the events of January 22nd  when President Donald Trump decided to impose as much as a 30 percent tariff on solar equipment imports 
What does solar equipment have to do with Caterpillar one might ask  The Trump decision was nothing new  rather an extension of the protectionist stance the president has taken since the very beginning of his campaign 
Despite the warning signs  investors chose to ignore the dark areas where a potential trade war might be hiding  and focus instead on the bright picture of his business agenda  a billion dollar infrastructure investment plan  a regulation rollback and the aforementioned tax cuts  The recent decision to impose tariffs on additional imports made it harder for investors to ignore than some theoretical  tough talk for his blue collar voter base  
Usually it takes markets some time to catch up with the full implication of fundamental drivers  For example  while it s true that the market sold off on fears of higher interest rates after yields reached a 4 year high  it took a few days for the selloff to actually occur 
Trade War Jitters Trump Stellar Earnings
So what spooked CAT investors even on the day of its great earnings report 
Investors don t buy or short a stock for its current price  but for its perceived value and future price  Perhaps that s why despite a wonderful earnings report  the price failed to overcome the January 16th all time high of  173 24  missing it by 14 cents  Caterpillar relies heavily on exports  Last year alone  CAT exported over  24 billion worth of equipment  representing more than half of its  45 billion sales  This underlies the company s particular vulnerability to a trade war 
Some readers may be skeptical of this connection and find it unlikely that investors would be this smart  But here s another interesting fact  The president announced his intention to enforce a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports on March 1  Why then was the price of CAT shares already declining more than 5 percent since February 27  or half the fall until March 2  a full two trading sessions before the announcement  Perhaps  informed money  knew something before the rest of us did 
Another insight regarding the reflation trade  it s likely over  The very theme that drove markets was that higher inflation would expand economic growth  which would include companies within the economy  However  when yields reached a 4 year high  at the first whiff of higher rates  investors sold off  After yields showed signs of easing  even when still above that 4 year high  investors convinced themselves that equity prices would still go higher 
However  after Fed Chair Powell paired growth with the potential for a greater than expected number of rate hikes and thus higher rates  investors ran for the hills  selling equities more aggressively  In other words  investors realized that the time to pay the  growth  pied piper  with interest  had arrived  and they refused to pay  The question is whether going forward investors will pay higher borrowing costs to keep acquiring equities 

Yesterday s drop wiped out nearly all of the previous day s value  Its red candle more than engulfed Friday s green candle  suggesting another  third decline  The first was after the solar equipment tariff and the second was on the metals tariff  even if it started before the actual announcement  Finally  yesterday s was on the very same metals tariff 
These swings have formed a Descending Triangle  and at this rate  prices would break out on the downside  completing the consolidation 
The steeper upper bound demonstrates that sellers  eagerness is growing  as they are willing to sell at ever lower prices  while the relatively flat lower bound suggests that demand is not meeting supply 
Note that yesterday s decline occurred after the intraday high reached a double resistance  in addition to that the triangle top  where supply has been kicking in  the 50dma  green  and more importantly the violated uptrend line since July 21  2017  suggesting that the uptrend  at least at this steepness  is coming into question  putting the next uptrend line  since March 2017  at  132 per the current angle in play 
Note also that the 50 dma realigned with the triangle top  while the 100 dma  blue  guards the triangle bottom and the 200 dma  red  supports the uptrend line since March 2017  These demonstrate the crucial pressure points in the supply demand balance 
The implied target of the triangle is  115  However  even if the  145 triangle bottom is breached  there is still the presumed demand waiting by the  135 uptrend line since March of last year  compounded by the 200 dma 
Trading Strategies   Short Position
Conservative traders would wait for a formal reversal  when the February 5th   142 85 trough is breached  forming a descending series of peaks and troughs  perhaps then followed by a 3 percent penetration of the uptrend line since March  2017 depending on their risk aversion 
Moderate traders might be content with a second lower trough  or at least a downside breakout of the bearish triangle  acting as a reversal pattern  currently at  144 
Aggressive traders may short now  relying on the multiple resistances of yesterday s reversal  the broken uptrend line since July 21  the 50 dma and  finally  the upper bound of a bearish pattern  the Descending Triangle ",Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,0.09,0.831,0.079,-0.8668

CAT,2018-04-13,"Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   has seen its stock price sink more than 11  over the last 12 weeks  The construction and mining equipment power s shares have tried to recover recently  but it might take strong first quarter financial results for CAT to get back on track amid the current market volatility   
Caterpillar posted pretty substantial top and bottom line beats in the fourth quarter  The company s adjusted earnings of  2 16 per share surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 77 per share by 22   CAT s Q4 revenues came in at  12 9 billion  well above our  11 9 billion estimate 
Despite these solid fourth quarter results  shares of Caterpillar closed Friday trading at  150 23 per share  far below the  169 37 per share they traded at directly following the release of Caterpillar s Q4 results in January 
This might signal that Caterpillar s recent downturn is based more on overall market trends than company specific worries  but many investors can t afford to take that risk during this recent bearish stretch  Therefore  they should look for stocks that are poised to perform well during first quarter earnings season in order to try to avoid any further turmoil 
With that said  let s check out Caterpillar s upcoming first quarter estimates to see what might be in store 
Outlook   Valuation
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Caterpillar s Q1 revenues to surge by 18 9  to reach  11 68 billion  Maybe more impressively for a company of its size  CAT s first quarter earnings are projected to skyrocket by 62 5  to hit  2 08 per share   
Meanwhile  Caterpillar has experienced mixed earnings estimate revision activity over the last 30 days  earning two upward revisions against one downward revision 
Investors should note that Caterpillar s Most Accurate Estimate is  2 12 per share  which is 4 cents above our current consensus estimate  This means that estimates have come in higher as we inch closer to Caterpillar s Q1 earnings 
CAT is also currently trading with a Forward P E of 15 81  which marks the slightest of discounts compared to the  Manufacturing   Construction and Mining  industry s average of 15 85 
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important factor that investors might want to consider ahead of Caterpillar s Q1 earnings report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices Caterpillar Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Investors can see that Caterpillar has posted a strong earnings surprise history over the last few years  including an average surprise of 51 6  in the trailing four quarters  It is also worth noting that Caterpillar s stock price has sunk immediately following the release of its quarterly earnings results multiple times  despite these beats   
Bottom Line 
With that said  past performance does not necessarily indicate future success or failure  and we will have a better idea of where the construction and mining equipment giant stands closer to its report date  which is scheduled for April 24 
However  investors should remember that Caterpillar is expected to see its top and bottom lines expand significantly in the first quarter  which is impressive for a company of its age and size

CAT,2018-04-24," Bloomberg     The 10 year Treasury yield finally reached 3 percent  a milestone that bond traders were eyeing for months to guide their next moves 
Then that pesky stock market got in the way 
After all the hoopla surrounding 10 year yields touching the highest in four years  they couldn t sustain their highest levels of the day  ending at 2 9995 percent  That s in part because of the dive in equities  driven both by losses in technology shares and by  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   effectively saying its first quarter profit will be as good as it gets in 2018 
It s the latest manifestation of the tug of war between stocks and bonds that s already been evident this year  In February  the specter of accelerating wage growth sent U S  yields to four year highs just below 3 percent  which played a role in the equities correction that followed  Last month  Treasuries finally rallied through key resistance levels amid turmoil around  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   and other tech companies 
So even though hitting 3 percent may point to higher yields in the world s biggest bond market  it s a reminder that they may not come as fast as the last few months 
 I tend to think yields are going to keep rising in general  but with the break of 3 percent I still don t think we are going to be at  say  3 5 percent right away   said John Briggs  head of strategy  Americas  at NatWest Markets  A 10 year yield of about 3 2 percent at year end is more reasonable  he said 
Rates Consensus
The consensus across Wall Street agrees  Rates are rising  but perhaps not in a hurry  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  estimates the 10 year yield will end 2018 at 3 15 percent  the same as the median forecast of 56 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg 
In some ways  the Treasury market still hasn t tested the true high water mark of the recent past  That would be 3 0516 percent  the peak from Jan  2  2014  For Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Asset Management  3 percent is just a passing point 
 We ve consistently been saying we expect 3 5 percent before 2 5 percent   Sheila Patel  chief executive officer of GSAM s international division  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television   If it s a measured reasonable pace  and if the reasoning is because of growth  it doesn t mean a debacle   
The 10 year yield flitted around 3 percent on Wednesday 
Deluge Week
For now  bond traders are dealing with a deluge of new debt  This week alone  the Treasury is issuing a combined  96 billion of two   five  and seven year notes  the largest slate of fixed rate coupon sales since 2014  In its  32 billion two year sale  the notes drew a yield of 2 498 percent  the highest since 2008 
The market is also assessing how quickly the Fed will raise rates  Policy makers  most recent forecasts are for two additional rate increases in 2018  Traders are pricing in even more than that 
 Other parts of the yield curve have broken out well before this move in 10 year yields   Briggs said   The Fed is more confident that it will keep raising rates and that inflation will move to target  The conversations are now that maybe the Fed doesn t do three but four hikes this year  and maybe three next year  
Fed officials have largely been sanguine about the stock markets  looking through the pickup in volatility relative to the past couple of years 
But it doesn t necessarily look like Treasuries will take equity losses in stride  too  So it s no foregone conclusion that the 10 year yield will rip through 3 percent

CAT,2018-04-25," Bloomberg     For all the saber rattling over the dreaded 3 percent Treasury yield  don t overplay the role of bonds as the proximate cause for bearish equity moves 
Sure  U S  stocks dropped 1 3 percent Tuesday  But look under the surface  and pain actually bypassed bond proxy stocks    dividend payers that investors typically dump for higher yielding debt 
Companies with the highest payouts returned 1 percent yesterday  the fourth best performing investing style out of the 160 U S  factors tracked by Bloomberg  Meanwhile  the market s highest fliers sank lower and investors shied away from more volatile shares    another indication of indiscriminate selling rather than a bond driven rotation in equity markets 
Possible catalysts for risk off trading range from a weak outlook for industry bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT    extended positioning  slowing growth momentum and short term inflationary pressures 
As such  3 percent or not  markets were primed to get spooked  according to Tim Emmott  executive director at Olivetree Financial Ltd  in London 
 The fact that high yielding  defensive utilities were the best performing sector in the U S  last night  in an environment where Treasury 10 year yields are backing up above 3 percent  would suggest that equity mindsets were defensively skewed in the U S    Emmott wrote in a note 
Another case in point  Value stocks  those with cheap book value to price ratios  gained 1 3 percent  the best out of all factors tracked by Bloomberg  As such  the declines don t reflect a cyclical rotation on rate risk  but principally angst over lofty prices  according to Evercore ISI s Dennis DeBusschere 
 The more obvious culprit is the very high starting equity valuations  the Fed tightening and strong earnings being discounted   DeBusschere wrote in a note   The story is multiple contraction in that context  not the 10 year hitting a magical number that forced a steep decline in stocks  
Positioning data also suggest a broad based easing in equity exposures  The most shorted stocks outperformed yesterday  dropping only 0 3 percent  while favored long positions adopted by hedge funds fell 1 8 percent  according to baskets compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  
Fast money investors typically increase short positions to offset losses in their long books  But Tuesday s price action suggests managers actually reduced short positions  taking profit across the board  Emmott said 
By the end of last week  data from  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Prime Services also show equity long short managers had the highest net exposure since at least 2010    suggesting hedge fund positions were overextended heading into the selloff ",Bloomberg,0.081,0.781,0.139,0.9775

The US dollar is slightly firmer against the Chinese yuan  With US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly headed to China shortly for trade talks  the trade tensions have eased on the margins  Meanwhile  the steady stream of announcement from Chinese officials continues  For the first time in three years  China has boosted the QDII  qualified domestic institutional investors  quota to the equivalent of  98 33 bln from  89 99 bln  Earlier this month  officials more than doubled the quota for two other programs for portfolio investment abroad 
The relaxation of limits on capital outflows suggests Chinese officials are not as worried as they were previously about the vicious cycle of capital outflows  weaker yuan  and weaker equities  Separately  Chinese data indicate that foreign investors boost their holdings of onshore bonds by CNY162 bln in Q1 and hold CNY1 4 trillion  In June  the MSCI Emerging Markets Index will include A shares for the first time  and bond benchmarks are gradually including mainland bonds 
While Italy s negotiations to form a new government took a new turn as the Five Star Movement has given up on the Northern League as a partner and is now in talks with the center left PD  The PD itself is split  A wing following Matteo Renzi  who resigned as Prime Minister when his constitutional reform lost  and resigned as head of the party after the election in early March  disavows the M5S  while the other wing is more pragmatic 
Japanese politics are also very much in the news  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe continues to suffer in the polls  and  going home with out a concession from the US did not help matters  However  it is the local scandals that continue to ensnare Abe  Today  Vice Finance Minister Junichi Fukuda resigned over sexual harassment allegations  In order to stem the hemorrhaging  and allow the government to return to its agenda  there has been some suggestion of a snap election for the lower house 
This seems to be an uncharacteristically dramatic move  In our reading of Japanese political tea leaves  while there may be alternatives of Abe in the wings  there does not seem to be an alternative to Abenomics  We have long seen Abenomics as traditional LDP policy  fiscal and monetary stimulus and a weaker yen bias  but on steroids  And as will likely be seen this week  the dissent from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at the BOJ will come from those who want to ease more rather than as previously from those of resist the aggressive and unorthodox easing

CAT,2018-04-25,"The discussion today is much about the 10yr Treas rate breaching above 3   Higher rates can have an impact on asset prices when compared to Cash Flow Yields as shown in the Dow Jones REIT  DJR  vs 10yr Treasury Rates chart  Higher rates lower asset prices  REITs have been over priced  by my analysis  for several years as global investors sought the US as a safe haven from the rise of autocrats  ISIS and terrorism  Even so  history indicates that as long as the T Bill 10yr Treas rate spread remains wider than 0 2   20bps basis points   then financial institutions keep lending and economic activity keeps expanding  Recent market pessimism contracted this spread to 1 01   the past 4days has witnessed this spread widening to 1 18

The Chemical Activity Barometer  CAB  and Temporary Help Svcs Indices are both higher and remain in decent uptrends  They are forecasting 12mos  of continued economic expansion  The CAB and Job Opening Indices provide a similar forecast 

The correlation between CAB and SP500 indicates that the CAB leads and the SP500 follows  Market prices are reflections of market psychology and have always lagged economic activity  Most investors tend to be Momentum Investors whose investment perception is driven by headlines  A good example of this is today s Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  earnings report   
Global economic indicators have been in strong uptrend since April 2016 and CAT has been releasing a rolling 3mo sales figure right along  This report was not a surprise  Just a surprise to those who invest with headlines which are after the fact 
So much for  Efficient Markets  

The Investment Thesis 
While the markets worry about rising rates  economic trends continue to signal 12mos  of economic expansion  What may prove a major surprise  are the policy changes currently in process  The new tax law  the recent reduction in government regulations  the potential loosening of Dodd Frank lending restrictions and the potential for reduction in threats to global Democracies could very well result in extending the current economic upcycle another 5yrs 
As long as the T Bill 10yr Treasury rate spread continues to be favorable  equity markets globally are likely to rise

CAT,2018-04-25,"Blowout Quarter
On Tuesday before the markets opened  Caterpillar    reported record Q1 sales and earnings and raised guidance for the rest of 2018 by almost 25    The stock immediately rallied nearly 5  to  161 10 in the pre market session as investors digested the seemingly flawless earnings release 
Revenues for the quarter were  12 9B  31  higher than Q1 2017 and handily beating the Zacks consensus estimate of  11 58B   Net earnings on a non adjusted basis were  2 74 share  blowing away the consensus estimate of  2 11 Share    Earnings adjusted for non recurring restructuring costs were even slightly higher still at  2 82 share  
The company was a beneficiary of 2018 U S  tax reform  estimating an effective rate of 24  for the quarter versus 32  in Q1 2017 
Caterpillar raised guidance for 2018 a whopping 2 dollars to a range of  9 75    10 25 share from the previous range of  7 75    8 25 share   They cited continuing strong demand in each of the core industries they sell equipment to with Mining  Oil and Gas  Construction and Infrastructure all experiencing boom times  Sales increased across all regions 
Even the parts of the release that were supposed to be cautionary were generic boilerplate about  economic conditions  and unpredictable Pension costs   Hardly anything to be worried about 
By the end of the trading day Caterpillar stock was closing at  144 44  down over 6  for the session 
Why 
The TV talking Heads mostly pointed to a single comment from Caterpillar s 10am conference call when CFO Brad Halverson said that Q1 earnings probably represented a  High Water Mark  for 2018  apparently suggesting that the quarter was so perfect  they were unlikely to beat it during any of the next three   Citing margin pressures due to higher materials costs  even the rosy sales outlook was unlikely to produce another blowout quarter 
Then there was the fact that the yield on 10 year treasury bonds traded above 3  this morning for the first time in over 4 years  making equity investors nervous about inflation fears and slowing growth 
Finally  there was a joint press conference between President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France in which they alluded to their private discussions about North Korea  Syria  and Iran  but said little of substance about any of those situations that the markets could embrace as progress 
Rationally  the  High Water  comment shouldn t have come as a surprise  at least to anyone who owns a calculator   Caterpillar raised full year guidance to a range of  9 75   10 25 while reporting  2 82 in Q1   If they hit even the high end at  10 25  subtracting the  2 82 they ve already reported  that leaves  7 43  Divide that by 3  since there are three quarters remaining  and the average is  2 48   Sure it s less than  2 82  but it s still higher than even the highest estimates prior to today s report 
The 3  level in ten year Treasuries is a psychologically important threshold  but is statistically arbitrary   Does anyone believe corporate profits will be appreciably lower at 3 05  than at 2 95    Even sophisticated traders and analysts can become fixated on round numbers and lose the forest for the trees 
Finally  the markets may have been disappointed to not get more comfort from the Trump   Macron conference  but the world is certainly no more uncertain today than it was yesterday   Unless the markets were pricing in complete resolution of all geopolitical risk  it s hardly justification for taking the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 600 points  as it was at one point this afternoon before recovering slightly  
So what s an investor to do on a day like today when nothing seems to make sense   Keep your head up   Understand the fundamental strengths and weakness of the companies you invest in and only let a change in those fundamentals change your mind   Pay as little attention as possible to herd selling  or herd buying for that matter    And scoop up companies like Caterpillar when they re beaten down undeservedly ",Zacks Investment Research,0.058,0.848,0.093,0.962
CAT,2018-04-25,"By Sujata Rao and Ritvik Carvalho LONDON  Reuters    World markets entered 2018 speculating that the most synchronized global economic expansion in a decade was about to overheat but growth has since proved underwhelming  While missile strikes and threats of a global trade war have hogged the headlines  it s an unexpected loss of economic momentum  particularly in Europe  that has frightened investors who played down political risks for years and stayed firmly focused on brisk economic growth and rising corporate profits  The recent surge in oil prices  adding inflation to the economic mix  may also weigh further on markets assessing whether a slowdown is afoot  or if the first quarter was merely a soft patch before the boom resumes   For the first time in 18 months  markets no longer have the protective shield of growth momentum   said Luca Paolini  chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management  who so far considers the soft economic data an air pocket  GRAPHIC Global economic growth     There is not enough evidence to say this is the beginning of the end  yet if you look at fundamentals  there is deterioration relative to last year  no question about that   Big multilateral forecasters remain broadly optimistic  The International Monetary Fund predicts robust 3 9 percent growth for 2018 and next year  though it too warned last week of risks from trade tensions or the waning impact of U S  tax cuts  Data this week showed euro zone business morale worsened further in April  while German authorities have cut growth forecasts after business confidence

at BlackRock  told clients equities would continue to do well but he predicted lower returns and higher volatility than in 2017  partly because there was  less room for growth to top expectations   REASONS TO BE CAUTIOUS So where  besides Europe s faltering Purchasing Managers  Indexes  PMIs   are concerns about growth evident  Perhaps most illustrative are government bonds in Western countries where yield curves  the gap between short  and long term interest rates  have inexorably narrowed all year   a fairly reliable indicator of growth pessimism  Some of the curve flattening has reversed slightly after the oil price jump increased inflation worries and lifted long term yields  But the gap between U S  2 year and 10 year yields remains almost 30 basis points below the highs hit this year    I don t think the curve is telling us anything different from other indicators   Pictet s Paolini said   It s telling you that over the next one to two years there is reason to be cautious    Shipping market bellwether  the Baltic Dry Freight Index  BADI   fell to eight month lows this month and while it has rebounded in recent days  it is still 20 percent off its December highs  Copper  another growth barometer  has come off four year highs hit late in 2017   Then there are indexes that estimate how much pessimism or optimism is priced into markets  based on how often data beat or miss forecasts  and by how much  Perhaps the most closely watched is Citi s Economic Surprise Index  which has slumped into the red after hitting 7 1 2 year highs at the end of 2017   GRAPHIC Economic

defensive sectors such as telecoms and utilities have modestly outperformed cyclicals such as technology stocks since mid March   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analysts said last week  Defensive stocks

adjustments after a long and severe Northern hemisphere winter  early Easter holidays and China s New Year  may also be to blame   Barclays   LON BARC   for instance  believes U S  growth did lose steam in the first quarter and has downgraded its forecasts  But it sees  residual seasonality  also playing a role   Even though the U S  government s Bureau of Economic Analysis has adjusted its methodology to account for seasonal factors  they still cause weak reported growth in the first quarter each year and buoyant activity later  Barclays said  In Europe too  analysts have blamed weak data on one offs such as the harsh winter  Easter vacations and high sick levels of sick leave due to flu   Finally  some such as Sebastian Raedler at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  don t see indicators  market levels and growth forecasts as out of kilter  Instead  purchasing manager indexes were over optimistic from late 2017  especially in the euro zone  he said   PMIs and GDP growth move very closely in line with each other  but suddenly this gap opened up between GDP running at 2 5 percent and PMIs implying 4 percent growth   Raedler said  According to Raedler  growth remains firm but the rate of change in growth looks less certain

CAT,2018-04-26,"Insane and Ridiculous
President Trump said the Iran Nuclear deal was insane and ridiculous  yet that does not necessarily mean that he is going to back out of it  That possibility helped break oil from near a 3 and a half year high that had rallied  in part  on threats by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani who warned of  severe consequences  if the Trump Administration  betrays the deal  
In a press conference with French Emmanuel Macron  Trump warned Iran that  If they restart their nuclear program  they will have bigger problems than they had before   Yet  at the same time the President seemed to wave an olive branch  despite calling it a terrible deal in deference to the French President who seemed to be suggesting that there was a way to save the deal  that President Trump did not dismiss out of hand  Macron proposed a three point plan to save and modify the Iran nuclear deal  and Mr  Trump said that France and the U S  could maybe close that deal quickly  But the President also said about the May 12 deadline to decide about whether to pull out of the deal  that no one knew what he would do  Isn t that the truth  Yet the possibility that the U S  will not pull out of the deal reduced the risk premium for oil causing a sell off along with a sudden spooked U S  stock market
What was also insane and ridiculous was the stock market s reaction to a 3  yield  The market that has been praying for an economy that was strong enough to raise rates now somehow fears that a 3  yield is not a good thing  which really is insane and ridiculous  Earnings from 3M and a weak outlook from Caterpillar hurt market sentiment  yet companies should adjust to a growing global economy 
That growing global economy is driving global oil demand  Asian oil demand is surging as trade data from Thomson Reuters Eikon shows seaborne imports of crude oil by Asia s main buyers will hit a record in April  importing more than 9 million barrels per day  bpd  of crude  U S  demand is also at records and we are seeing it impact supply  April gasoline demand is a U S  record and we saw some strong data from the API  While the API reported a  1 099 million barrel increase in overall crude supply  strong gas demand led to 2 724 million barrels drop in gas oil supply  Distillates also fell by 1 911 million barrels as demand is rising  and in the Cushing Oklahoma delivery hub supply fell by 930 000 barrels 
Shale oil is rising but even that can t catch up with rising demand  Bloomberg News Jessica Summers and Sheela Tobben reported that

The Permian shale play is all about setting records  Now  the region may even become the world s largest oil patch over the next decade  Output in the basin is forecast to reach 3 18 million barrels a day in May  according to the Energy Information Administration  That s the highest since the agency began compiling records in 2007  By 2023  the basin may produce 4 million barrels a day  according to the International Energy Agency  The Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia is currently the world s biggest oil field  with capacity of 5 8 million barrels a day  according to a 2017 EIA report 

This is all thanks to the size of the oil deposits  coupled with increased technology and efficiencies   The technology is the biggest driver   said Rob Thummel  managing director at Tortoise  which handles  16 billion in energy related assets  The basin in and of itself could end up being the largest oil field in the world  even bigger than Ghawar in Saudi Arabia ",Phil Flynn,0.129,0.784,0.087,-0.9765

10 year note  Currently net short 462 1k  up 90 4k Now what 
The 10 year Treasury rate  2 96  crossed three percent this week   the first time this has happened since January 2014  Early this month  these notes yielded 2 72 percent 
Signs of fatigue are showing up  with the week ending with a shooting star  The move to 3 04 percent Wednesday was fleeting  There is room for yields to continue lower  Non commercials are the most net short ever  and can get squeezed in the right circumstances for bond bulls 
In getting thus far  the 10 year managed to forge decent support at 2 94 percent  This materialized after yields broke this January out of resistance at 2 62 percent   now support  This likely gets tested 
While all this was going on  Tuesday saw Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  management saying first quarter earnings  will be the high water mark for the year   They are essentially saying this is as good as it gets 
In 1Q18  the US economy grew 2 3 percent  This preceded real GDP growth of 2 9 percent in 4Q17  and 3 2 percent and 3 1 percent before that  The ISM manufacturing index in March fell 1 5 points month over month  but February s 60 8 was the highest since 61 4 in May 2004  These are very good numbers  and do tend to revert back to the mean 
In this environment  lots of shops probably view the recent backup in yields as an opportunity to go long bonds 
30 year bond  Currently net long 18 3k  down 27k Major economic releases next week are as follows 
Personal income and outlays for March is scheduled for Monday  Core PCE  personal consumption expenditures  rose 1 6 percent in the 12 months to February  This is the Fed s favorite measure of consumer inflation  The last time it rose with a two handle was in April 2012 
FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and ends the next  This is the year s third meeting  and five more remain after this  In the March 20 21 meeting  the fed funds rate was raised by 25 basis points to a range of 150 to 175 basis points  The dot plot expects two more hikes this year  Next week s meeting is not one of them  as markets expect the Fed to stand pat 
Also Tuesday  April s ISM manufacturing index comes out 
Productivity  1Q18  preliminary   durable goods  March  revised  and the ISM non manufacturing index  April  are on tap for Thursday 
Non farm output per hour increased 1 1 percent y y in 4Q17  This was the slowest pace in four quarters  The last time productivity grew with a two handle was in 3Q10 
Preliminarily  March orders for non defense capital goods ex aircraft   proxy for business capex plans   rose seven percent y y to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  67 2 billion  Orders peaked at  70 3 billion in September 2014 
Services activity in March inched down seven tenths of a point m m to 58 8  January s 59 9 was the highest ever  data only goes back to January 2008  
Friday brings employment numbers for April  March produced 103 000 non farm jobs  for an average of 202 000 in the first three months this year 
Crude oil  Currently net long 759k  down 10k Spot West Texas Intermediate crude   68 10 barrel  continues to digest its recent gains  Resistance around last week s high of  69 55 goes back to September 2005  Near term  odds of breakout retest at  66 50 ish are rising  The week produced a long legged doji 
The EIA report for the week of April 20 showed that crude stocks  production and imports all rose   respectively up 2 2 million barrels to 429 7 million barrels  up 46 000 barrels day to 10 59 million b d  and up 539 000 b d to 8 47 mb d 
Gasoline stocks increased as well  up 840 000 barrels to 236 8 million barrels  Distillate stocks  however  fell 2 6 million barrels to 122 7 million barrels 
Refinery utilization dropped 1 6 percentage points to 90 8 percent 
E mini S P 500  Currently net long 211k  down 1 3k The 200 day was tested on Wednesday   again successfully  There was a similar test on February 9  This was followed late March early April during which the cash  2669 91  lingered around the average for 10 sessions before rallying 
In the end  it proved to be a  
In general  the more times a level is tested  the higher the odds it gives way sooner or later  For now  the bulls can breathe a sigh of relief  Last week  rally attempts were rejected at a falling trend line from January 26 when the S P 500 peaked at 2872 87  The same resistance will be tested around 2700 
Of late  flows have been positive  but nothing comparable to what was lost previously 
In the week to Wednesday  US based equity funds  including ETFs  took in  3 5 billion  This makes a three week total of  13 8 billion  courtesy of Lipper com   This was preceded by outflows of  35 6 billion over three weeks 
In the same week  SPY  SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   gained  196 million  Vanguard S P 500  NYSE VOO   Vanguard S P 500 ETF  74 million and ishares S P 500  NYSE IVV   iShares core S P 500 ETF   1 8 billion  courtesy of ETF com  
Euro  Currently net long 130 6k  down 20 9k There goes that support 
The cash   121 36  peaked at  125 37 on January 25  A falling trend line from the all time high of  160 20 in April 2008 lied around there  Since then  the euro has been making lower highs  even as buyers persistently showed up at  122 122 50 support  which cracked this week 
The risk facing the bulls is non commercials  massive net longs  The loss of this support adds pressure on them to lock in profit 
Near term  though  the currency can go test the broken support 
Gold  Currently net long 136 6k  down 26 4k One more week in which flows were positive but gold bugs were not able to put that to good use 
In the week through Wednesday  GLD  NYSE GLD   SPDR gold ETF  attracted  226 million and IAU  iShares gold trust   122 million  courtesy of ETF com   In the past six  inflows totaled  1 6 billion and  940 million  in that order 
The cash   1 323 40 ounce  opened the week with a loss of the 50 day  and continued lower  along with the now dropping daily lower Bollinger band  
Gold has been range bound between  1 360 70 on the up and  1 300 on the down for a while now  This time around  the lower bound has additional support  The 200 day   1 303 32  lies there  as does a rising trend line from December 2016 
The metal dropped to  1 315 80 intraday Friday before bids showed up 
Nasdaq 100 index  mini   Currently net short 24 7k  up 16 8k 
Another higher low on the cash  6656 35  this week  At one point Wednesday  the Nasdaq 100 was down 3 6 percent for the week  Kudos to the bulls for erasing just about all of that 
For continued traction  they have to jump over the hurdle of broken technicals  including a false breakout accompanied by an island reversal in March  The 50 day already provided resistance Friday 
At least in the week ended Wednesday  flows were not cooperating  with PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   PowerShares QQQ ETF  losing  1 9 billion  courtesy of ETF com  
Russell 2000 mini index  Currently net long 20 3k  up 4 5k The 50 day was defended this week  The cash  1556 24  continues to trade within a three month symmetrical triangle  the upper end of which came in the way last week  That trend line now extends to 1580s  This is the best case scenario  Should it come to pass  shorts in all likelihood would be all over the Russell 2000  Small caps act better versus large caps  but are stuck in a rut nevertheless 
In the week to Wednesday   1 billion moved out of iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM   iShares Russell 2000 ETF   while IJR  iShares core S P small cap ETF  took in  127 million  courtesy of ETF com  
US Dollar Index  Currently net short 1 8k  down 634 The euro  which dropped 1 4 percent this week  makes up 57 6 percent of the US dollar index  This likely contributed to the latter s 1 4 percent rally this week 
Importantly  the cash  91 34  broke out of a symmetrical triangle  Technicians are now probably eyeing 92 50  For that to happen  dollar bulls will first have to win over the 200 day  which the dollar index came within 0 15 of testing before reversing with a gravestone doji Friday 
Down below  there is now another layer of support  at 90 30 ish  This week s action preceded persisted defense of support at 88 89  which goes back to at least 2004 
Near term  odds favor breakout retest 
VIX  Currently net long 31 6k  down 46 3k It was one of those weeks in which both volatility bulls and bears could claim victory  Sort of  Support at 15 16 was once again tested  and held  At the same time  the 50 day held firm 
Some daily momentum indicators have turned lower from the median  In the very near term  this is an opportunity for the bears to push the cash  15 41  lower  The daily lower Bollinger band lies at 13 59  which is about where the 200 day rests

Last Week Recap
In my last edition of WTWA I predicted a renewed effort to find fresh fears  That was right on target  Many of the usual suspects did exactly as expected  moving out the timeline to dismiss current news to find more worrisome subjects 
I felt that the issues last week were especially important  and I appreciate the many readers who found the post to be helpful  Meanwhile  my meetings and travels involved conversations with many intelligent investors  Many of them are frightened by the increase in volatility  instead of embracing the opportunities presented  This fear is not grounded in any data  but the perception is quite real and affecting behavior 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the version  She includes a lot of valuable information in a single visual  The full post has even more charts and analysis  so check it out 

While the market was unchanged for the week  there was plenty of action along the way  Despite the attention grabbing move on Tuesday  the trading range was only about 2 8   I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Feel free to add items that I have missed  Please keep in mind that we are looking for current news  especially from the last week or so  WTWA is not about long term concerns like debt  These are important  of course  but not our weekly subject unless there has been some major change 
The Good
Housing data showed strength  Existing home sales of 5 6 million  SAAR  were in line with expectations  but new home sales recorded an annual rate of 694K in March  Home prices were also slightly stronger than expected  a 6 8  rate according to the Case Shiller index  Calculated Risk  and  

Consumer confidence registered another new high at 128 7  beating expectations of 126 1  This now covers a period after the stock market decline  David Templeton    concludes that the consumer is in decent shape  providing a foundation for continuing economic growth 

Michigan sentiment index also increased to 98 8 beating the March reading of 98 
Rail traffic improves again  Steven Hansen    explains the need to remove coal and grain from the analysis  Smoothing with a four week moving average leads to a gain of 2 8   He concludes   Intermodal transport growth remains strong year over year  
Initial jobless claims dropped to 209K  much lower than recent levels and the expectation of 230K    

Brexit less likely  Remember the market declines when Brexit was first announced  More reasonable possibilities are growing in likelihood     
Durable goods orders showed continuing strength  rising 2 6   after last month s upwardly revised 3 5   and beating expectations of a 1 9  gain 
Q1 GDP increased 2 3   beating expectations of about 2 1   While this is just the first estimate  and a decline from 2 9  in Q4  many cited the Q1 softness in recent years  We shall see  Most reports emphasize the headline number  and perhaps a few past comparisons   improves on this both with his commentary and his charts   shows the contribution of various components  extending over a full business cycle 
 
Corporate earnings reports have been great  High expectations have moved even higher  and the beat rates are the best in ten years      This leaves experts searching for explanations  because the response has been  lackluster       Check out his careful  data based analysis  I especially find the S P 500 PEG ratio of 0 81 to be very interesting  This seems to be a better gauge of market potential than all the typical perma bear indicators 

The Bad
Durable goods ex transportation showed no gain  in contrast to an expected 0 6  and a 0 9  gain in February 
The employment cost index increased 0 8   higher than the 0 7  expected as well as the 0 6  reading in Q4 
Incautious commentary can have an outsized effect  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  announced great earnings and raised its own 2018 forecast by 24   as Bloomberg reported in The CEO said  he isn t concerned about a peak in the growth cycle   In between the CFO stated on the conference call that the first quarter adjusted profit per share  will be the high watermark for the year   This led to a 10  swing in share prices  as well as an overall market decline 
A Narrow Rebound  The end of week rally helped most stocks  but especially the FANG names  More breadth would be encouraging

 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
While few expect the FOMC to increase rates at this meeting  attention will focus on the statement accompanying the decision  Many of this week s reports will be released after the Fed s Wednesday meeting  but we can expect them to be interpreted with Fed policy in mind  I expect pundits and financial writers to be asking 
Will strong economic data drive interest rates higher 
The question actually has several parts 
Will the data show strength 
What change might the Fed make  Most expect no rate change this week  but there is a growing chance of four rate hikes this year 
Would such a change affect the long end of the interest rate curve  The slope  doesn t think so  They also include several of my frequently made points about volatility and include several points about continuing economic strength 


 takes a balanced look 
Could the economic data increase anticipated inflation 
Would a move past the psychological 3  rate on the ten year note be significant  Some technicians and traders think so  but those using data have reached a very different conclusion  states the various viewpoints 


Scott Grannis sees no overall economic effect and little effect on the number of new home mortgages  it is rising demand for loans and a stronger economy which are bidding up the cost of borrowed money  The higher rates of the past year or two are not bad for growth because they are the natural result of stronger growth  Higher rates are only bad when they rise in real terms as a result of tighter monetary policy  but that s not the case today 

 cites 3  as an historically  attractive level for more cautious investors  
 does the math on the concept of bond  safety  
Let s say that you buy a 10 Year US Treasury Bond yielding 3  right now  Should you hold that bond to maturity you would indeed receive a 3  annual yield to maturity  However  let s say that in three years hence  interest rates continue to rise  such that the yield on a 7 year US Treasury would rise to 4   That is certainly plausible  Should that happen your bond with seven years remaining to maturity would now be valued at  I am rounding  94 cents on the dollar  You would have lost 6  on your bond  less three years of 3  coupons  resulting in a net gain of 3  in three years  time  If you factor in inflation  which is currently running at 2 5   you would have a real loss on your bond investment 


A jump in rates to just 4 5  would  in three years  time  value that bond at 91 cents on the dollar  The greater the rise in rates  the greater the bond loss  As you can see  you can lose money in bonds

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be John Rekenthaler s    attack on the overuse of  bubble  with special attention to a recent   He notes that the report treats the idea of over valuation as self evident  and a preface for analysis of global technology stocks 
Perhaps  but it certainly reflects the common perception in financial media  Rekenthaler writes 

I don t see a bubble certainly not with the overall U S  stock market  With a forward earnings yield of 6   earnings yield being the inverse of a P E ratio  earnings divided by price   at a time when 10 year Treasuries pay 3  and annual inflation hovers around 1  3   stocks are not dear when compared with the alternatives  At some point  of course  the economy will turn  those P E ratios will spike because earnings collapse  and stocks will get shellacked  But the same could have been written in 2012  and 2013  and so forth  Without further evidence  why believe this year is different 


And later 


Many bubbles are proclaimed  but few arrive  The word is not useful  rather than signal something extraordinary  it has come to mean  securities I don t like because they strike me as being too expensive

Analyst Bill Selesky at Argus Research reaffirms his BUY rating on Chevron with a price target of  130  He believes that Chevron  offers best in class production growth and the potential for strong free cash flow at a time when most peers are struggling to improve production and lower costs  The company has also recently completed several major capital projects  which should lead to reduced capital spending over the next several years  The company has a desirable mix of both long cycle projects  Wheatstone and Gorgon  and short cycle projects  Permian Basin  that should enable it to post strong earnings in a range of oil price environments  Chevron also pays a sizable dividend with a yield of about 4 5   In recent conference calls  management has emphasized that maintaining or increasing the dividend is the company s top priority  
Higher oil prices is good news for giant oil companies but it could mean more pain for consumers at the pump There is a knock on effect if the cost of energy becomes too costly  Companies that are hurt by the rising price of oil include American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   3M Company  NYSE MMM   United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS   and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   These companies have to absorb higher input costs  This is why increasing oil prices  especially if it happens too fast  can cause a shock to the economy and slow it down  Generally speaking higher oil prices is bad for the U S  economy because the oil sector is a much smaller segment of the economy than the other industries and consumers that use oil  Since the oil market has grown a lot over the past 4 years  the net effect of the price of oil has gotten smaller  But there is still uncertainty facing oil  Recently U S  president Donald Trump came out to   which could shake up geo political tensions 
Raghee Horner  a futures and currencies expert at Simpler Trading reassures investors that so far the price of oil isn t high enough to destabilize the economy  She says that panic will only kick in if oil tops  80 barrel  or about 18  higher than today  But by the time oil reaches that level  maybe the economy will have grown large enough to withstand it  Due to the cyclical nature of energy stocks it is good to have some in an  to counterbalance other types of stocks  Having the right balance is the best approach to face an uncertain future in the equity markets ",Modest Money,0.074,0.812,0.114,0.9781

CommentaryThe  Apple Temptation  of the stock market seems to be working  For starters  after a three week run with a cautiously bearish short term trading call  I have nudged the needle back to neutral  I perhaps overstayed the welcome a bit after the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   completed several more successful tests of support at its 200 day moving average  DMA   Still  I may prove a bit too early as the S P 500  SPY  broke out above its 50DMA for the first time since mid April  but the index has not yet punched above that mid April high 

The S P 500  SPY  made a bid to earn back its bullish momentum with this 50DMA breakout  The index still needs to make and hold a higher high 
Tech stocks are once again leading the charge  Both the NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  are right back in bullish territory with 50DMA breakouts last week and on Wednesday closes above the mid April high 


The NASDAQ gained 1 0  on its way to confirming last week s 50DMA breakout with a higher high 


The PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ  confirmed a 50DMA breakout just like the NASDAQ but trading volume is anemic and falling 
Even if the S P 500 gives in to the temptation of tech stocks with its own confirmed 50DMA breakout  I will likely keep the short term trading call at neutral  Not only do I hate churning the trading call  but also I now need to see how my favorite technical indicator behaves near or at the overbought threshold  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  closed at 60 3   AT40 could easily test the overbought threshold of 70  by early next week 
When AT40 fell away from the overbought threshold in mid April  my quick reaction enabled me to get  cautiously  bearish in time to make some good trades to the downside  AT40 needs to press through overbought conditions to solidify the case for enough buying power to sustain a bullish trading call 
Financials are also tempering bullish sentiment  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  gained a nice 1 5  on the day  but it failed to clear the April  intraday  high  Moreover  XLF is fresh off a 200DMA breakdown and barely punched above its 50DMA resistance  I WILL reload on call options if buyers follow through on XLF and confirm the 50DMA breakout 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  has already erased the damage from its recent 200DMA breakdown  Can it leave that history in the dust by confirming its 50DMA breakout 
The volatility index  the VIX  is pointing to bullish days ahead  recall that periods of extremely low volatility are bullish for the stock market   The downtrend from the March high continued with a close well below the 15 35 pivot  The VIX lost 8 8  on the day and returned exactly to its close below the massive 2 day run up that launched the stock market swoon in February 
The stock market has some catch up to do to align with a now rapid return of complacency in the market  I took this opportunity to essentially give up on my latest tranche of call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  and get back to accumulating a short on iPath S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Exp 30 Jan 2019  NYSE VXX  

The volatility index  the VIX  is rapidly falling toward extremely low levels again  11 and below  
Despite the upgrade in the trading call  I locked in my profits on my SPY shares into the breakout  I only held the shares through the mid April high in case I turned out to be wrong on my trading call  this was the large position I accumulated off the cycles through oversold conditions in February and March swoons   Now I am happy to recover that cash to deploy to other opportunities

CAT,2018-05-23,"By Timothy Aeppel and Rajesh Kumar Singh EAST PEORIA  Ill   Reuters    Orders for the mining machines and construction bulldozers made at this sprawling  Caterpillar  Inc   N CAT  factory in central Illinois have jumped  in general  three fold over the past year  But meeting that boom in demand at the world s largest heavy equipment manufacturer is a challenge  in part because of Caterpillar suppliers like Steve Kirsh  Years of watching Caterpillar and other big manufacturers cut inventories  close plants and axe workers in the last downturn has embedded caution in Kirsh s ambition to expand after the surge in orders  reflecting a more fundamental shift in how many industrial businesses view expansions  according to interviews with Caterpillar executives  more than a half dozen Caterpillar suppliers and U S  economic data   I just wasn t sure it was real   said Kirsh  speaking from a windowless office at the front of Kirsh Foundry Inc   in Beaver Dam  Wisconsin  which makes metal parts for Caterpillar and other customers  Even with a surplus in demand for its product  Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby told investors last month the company will not invest in factory capacity  Instead  it plans to spend more on new technologies  expanding its parts business and selling more rental and used equipment  The company s big East Peoria assembly plant runs just one shift and operates only four days a week  while its own parts making facilities are running three shifts  five days a week to provide it enough components to assemble  according to the company officials  Outside suppliers are similarly scrambling to catch up to the surge in orders  This has extended the lead time to deliver final products to dealers  For instance  it takes more than eight months to get one model of its large engines into a customer s hands  The Trump administration s efforts to rewrite trade relations with key partners  especially China  only add to the uncertainty  The latest move to step back from a confrontation with China is good news for many domestic producers  who worry that a trade war could quickly puncture the global expansion  going on nine years  which is feeding the U S  factory boom  manufacturing executives told Reuters  The result is a drag on the economic expansion that President Trump and Republicans hoped for coming off U S  corporate tax reform last year  The idea behind Trump s tax reform was that companies could pour more money into expansions  hire more workers and lift wages  There has been an upswing in plans for capital spending  but much of it is concentrated in the technology and energy sectors  Spending plans by industrial companies are up only slightly  For a graphic  click  For those companies that do want to expand  from car companies to railroads and engine makers  they often can t find the workers to expand fast enough  The contraction of their supply chain in the last downturn thrust many players big and small into a  just in time delivery  business model  creating order backlogs  which has led to soaring prices for raw materials in the recent upswing  For a graphic  click  TURNING THE SWITCH BACK ON The hesitation to expand Caterpillar s supply chain is rooted in the last bust  notable as the longest downturn in its history   worse than the Great Depression   from 2012 to 2016  when sales dropped more than 40 percent  Chastised by that slump  the Deerfield  Ill  based company embarked on a restructuring strategy that aims to squeeze more production from its factories and buy more of what it needs from outside suppliers on a just in time basis  Caterpillar has closed or restructured more than 25 factories and its full time workforce is smaller now than it was at the end of 2012  And cuts continue  Caterpillar plans to close two more facilities this year and is considering shuttering an engine plant  which would eliminate 880 jobs  Caterpillar executives said the new strategy is boosting profitability by allowing it to get the best use out of its existing factories  They blame the backlogs on its suppliers  inability to keep up with the surge in orders  Timing is part of the problem  Caterpillar and a host of other industrial companies all ramped up orders at the same time   That switch got turned on after being turned off for several years   all at the same time   said Amy Campbell  director of investor relations   Campbell  however  said the supply situation is improving  The central Illinois plant will go back to the normal five day shift beginning in June  Caterpillar s investors love this approach  since it helps deliver strong margins in the good times and minimizes pain in bad times  The company recently boosted profit projections for 2018 by about 25 percent  and in the latest quarter  every segment posted better results compared to a year ago  But its stock price took a hit when the company s CFO warned higher prices for raw materials like steel are going to start squeezing margins even as growth continues  Supply chain bottlenecks  meanwhile  are hitting companies across the industrial heartland   The Institute for Supply Management s index for order backlogs  one of the best U S  metrics for how quickly manufacturers are meeting demand  now stands at its highest level in 14 years  And many companies remain tight fisted  The Commerce Department recently reported that orders for capital goods  a key measure of business investment  fell in March  the third decline in four months  These numbers show that companies are holding back on spending  even as their order books swell   We re in a period of significant disruption where everyone is scrambling   but it s the way supply chains work today   said John Layden  a consultant in Indianapolis who helps companies design and manage supply networks  WHERE ARE THE WORKERS  Finding employees is another drag on the U S  manufacturing supply chain   When Kirsh decided to add people early last year at his foundry   which melts iron and forms it into the rough shapes that will be refined for Caterpillar and others   he could not find them  Wisconsin s jobless rate has hit an all time low of 2 8 percent   So Kirsh tried something new  hiring a Minnesota staffing company that specializes in parachuting industrial workers into factories that can t find them locally   He eventually got about 10 of these workers  who he calls  mercenaries   who helped get his backlog under control  One came from as far as away as Detroit  But it was a costly fix  Between paying the staffing company  hotels and a per diem for the workers  he estimates they cost about three times more than local labor  Industrial companies have always struggled with big swings in demand  but the problem of shortages emerges much quicker in today s super lean economy   In the past  manufacturers from Kirsh to Caterpillar often kept more goods on warehouse shelves  creating a built in buffer that could be absorbed as signals went out to suppliers that the latest upturn is going to continue  That gave more time for everyone to gear up  It is a luxury that does not exist anymore  said Joe Williams  president of privately held Wolfe and Swickard Machine Company Inc  in Indianapolis  which buys forged parts from Kirsh and over 20 other foundries that his 85 worker shop shapes and polishes into final machine parts  Early last year  Williams saw orders from Caterpillar surge 80 percent  a stunning increase that left him scrambling    When we get an order  we have to order from a foundry  which has to communicate with the people supplying them metal  so there s always a lag   he said   This time  however  it was particularly difficult  Some foundries simply refused his business because they were swamped with orders from other customers  Like Kirsh  Williams has had trouble hiring workers and said he still needs at least 15 more machinists  Caterpillar has told him to expect orders to go up another 20 percent this year  Stephen Volkmann  a machinery industry analyst at Jefferies  said Caterpillar was slow to ramp up production   which frustrated dealers clamoring for machines they could sell   But he said Caterpillar and its suppliers are smart to be cautious    They all know that  business  could be down again next year   he said  and so over expanding now  would be an expensive mistake    GRAPHIC  Capex upswing

CAT,2018-06-21,"If you need more evidence that the Fed screwed up during its latest FOMC meeting  take a look at the below chart 
This chart shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average  a stock index comprised of economically sensitive bell weathers such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   vs  the NASDAQ  a stock index that is heavily skewed towards Tech giants  

As you can see  for most of this year to date  these two indices have moved in a virtual lockstep  The NASDAQ began to outpace the DJIA in April when the Fed increased its QT program from  10 billion to  30 billion per month 
However  it wasn t until last week s FOMC that the divergence became extreme  As you can see in this second chart  the DJIA rolled over IMMEDIATELY after the Fed meeting and has taken a nosedive ever since  The NASDAQ  on the other hand  has gone straight up 

Put simply  the market is discounting that Fed policy is going to crush the economic expansion  leaving the only growth in the large Tech space 
If the Fed doesn t figure this out soon  we could very well see a market bloodbath hit ",Phoenix Capital Research,0.025,0.895,0.08,0.8728
CAT,2018-07-12,"Oil rebounds from its sharpest selloff in a year


Global equity recovery looses some steam in Europe after strong Asian rally


EM currencies remain under pressure from dollar strength and trade war risk


Key Events
Global stocks showed signs of a rebound on Thursday  following reports that US and Chinese officials may resume high level talks on trade issues  Investors have begun rotating out of safety trades including the dollar  which gave back just a small amount of yesterday s outsized gains  Treasury yields trimmed most of yesterday s drop as investors moved to riskier assets 
European shares  along with futures for the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100  are all flashing green  reversing Wednesday s sharp global selloff which saw WTI crude sliding the most in two years and US energy and material producer shares tumbling at least 2 percent pushing the S P 500 into its heaviest decline in two weeks 
Where are equities headed next  While pundits warn there are no winners in a trade war  US shares stand out as the outperformers  While Asian benchmarks  except for Australia s S P ASX 200  are in a downtrend and European indices are drifting  US majors remain in a clear uptrend 
We believe this will almost certainly create a virtuous cycle for US assets  prompting international investors to shed foreign holdings  sending them yet further down  even as these same investors ramp up their US exposures driving up returns on US markets 

The STOXX 600 opened 0 25 percent higher posting a more modest gain than Asian counterparts but was pressured lower in early trade  Media companies and car manufacturers outperformed  helping the pan European index move higher to about 0 4 up at the time of writing  Technically  yesterday s plunge extended the medium term downtrend within a falling channel since the May peak  while potentially developing a massive H S top since mid May 2017 
Earlier this morning  during the Asian session  Chinese shares made up for Wednesday s underperformance  The Shanghai Composite jumped 2 2 percent  wiping out yesterday s deep losses  adding another 0 35 percent in gains  setting up the mainland index for its highest close since June 29  Technically  today s vigorous rebound extended a turn around from the July 6 low  triggering the most reliable buy signals of the MACD and RSI in five months  after these indicators reached their lowest levels since February  at the end of the global January selloff 
Hong Kong s Hang Seng didn t perform as strongly as its mainland counterpart  It settled 0 60 percent into positive territory after fluctuating between a 0 3 percent loss and a 1 17 percent gain 
South Korea s KOSPI swung even more widely  between a 0 8 percent gain and a 0 1 percent loss  only to finish very near today s opening price  0 2 percent above yesterday s close 
Japan s TOPIX advanced 0 48 percent  losing steam from the initial 0 8 percent rally 

Australia s S P ASX 200 climbed 0 85 percent this morning  erasing yesterday s losses and sealing an additional 0 15 percent advance  Technically  as we ve been saying for a week  the Aussie benchmark has completed a bullish pennant pattern  Price moves on Friday generated the upside breakout  then extended gains on Monday  Tuesday and Wednesday trading completed a return move  with prices penetrating the pennant slightly but closing above it  Today  prices bounced off the support of the pattern 
Global Financial Affairs
On Wednesday  commodities took a hit  with oil s retreat pushing WTI toward  70 a barrel and metals and crop futures slipping lower 

WTI rebounded from a 4 65 percent plunge  its sharpest daily decline in almost 13 months  The selloff was spurred by oil production resuming in Libya as well as by the increased outlook for waning demand  as a global trade war could hinder economic growth  Technically  the July peak at  75 verified the integrity of the uptrend  and the 50 DMA supported the plunge  suggesting there is demand  at the right price 
In the US equity market  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  led US losses  weighting on the Dow Jones Industrial Average  On the other side of the Pacific  during yesterday s trade  emerging market shares fell the most since the end of June 
EM currencies also remain under pressure  dragged lower by two main drivers  the US China trade war narrative made them look even riskier  while the stronger dollar prompted investors to shift into US assets 

Speculators buying the dip helped the Turkish lira recover  after hitting a fresh record low when a local television channel reported that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sees both the exchange rate and interest rates dropping  Technically  yesterday s fall caused a USD TRY upside breakout to a symmetrical triangle  suggesting further declines are in the cards for the lira 
Up Ahead

CAT,2018-07-27," Bloomberg     For  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT    a bellwether of American industrial might  Donald Trump s trade war is threatening to halt what was shaping up as a record year for profits 
Analysts have been predicting net income could reach an all time high of  6 24 billion as expanding economies fuel robust demand for the manufacturer s signature yellow diggers  bulldozers and dump trucks  But the shares had their worst first half since the recession of 2009  and they ve been slow to rebound 
That s because Caterpillar gets more than half its sales outside the U S   and an escalating trade war is menacing global economic growth prospects  Tensions have been high as Trump warned he could expand import tariffs that have already led to retaliatory duties by China  Mexico  Canada and Europe  Rising metal prices that have dented industrial profits could ensnare Caterpillar s recovery 
 That s the biggest risk   said Larry De Maria  an analyst at William Blair   Co   The trade war absolutely could have an impact and spill over into the global economy  and could have an impact on the strong cycle Caterpillar has seen in their end markets generally  
Revenue at Deerfield  Illinois based Caterpillar is forecast to rise to  14 billion in the second quarter from  11 3 billion the same period a year earlier  based on the average of 13 analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg  Net income was expected to rise to  2 59 a share from  1 35  The company reports on Monday 
Caterpillar has given investors a series of better than expected results after a downturn in commodities pulled sales lower for four straight years through 2016  The company went from the second worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2015 to the second best last year 
That string of earnings and sale surprises may be in danger of being snapped with the trade war  The International Monetary Fund warned that the friction is threatening to derail a global upswing that s already losing momentum amid weaker growth in Europe and Japan  On Wednesday  General Motors Co  NYSE GM   cut its forecast for profit this year  in part because of surging prices for steel and aluminum after the U S  slapped tariffs on the metals 
High Watermark
Higher costs for the steel Caterpillar purchases to make equipment could show up three to six months after U S  tariffs are imposed on imports of the metal  Amy Campbell  director of investor relations  said in March after the U S  announced the tariffs 
In its first quarter earnings statement in April  Caterpillar lifted its 2018 profit projection amid a broadening recovery in mining and construction as well as fatter margins after years of cost cutting  But on the call that followed  the company said first quarter adjusted profit per share  will be the high watermark for the year  
 There s been a lot more tariff discussion and the issue is out there  so I think that they have to discuss that within the context the  high watermark  comment that scared people   William Blair s De Maria said  They ll also have to explain what they re seeing  in regard to global growth and how much tariffs may eventually impact global growth and how they manage those tariffs

 We have the mid year price increase announced and our teams will continue to look at all these variables moving forward   Interim Chief Financial Officer Joe Creed said in a telephone interview   We feel like that s what the market will bear  but we re always assessing it and looking at it  
Surging demand and a 25 percent American tariff on steel imports have combined to send the benchmark steel price in the U S  surging about 40 percent this year 
 The biggest piece of that cost inflation is likely steel  and we all know what happened there with the very first salvo of tariffs involving steel   Matt Arnold  an analyst at Edward Jones   Co   said by telephone   In the past  what we ve seen is that CAT is capable of passing costs through to its customer base  so it s not surprising to us that CAT is able to do it again  It has already likely provided that information to its customers that they re coming

However  over the past year or so  the S P has outperformed industrials  due in no small part to the overperformance of tech stocks  This is worrying analysts who fear a market correction will be necessary to return the correlation to traditional levels 
Before we jump to any conclusions  let s consider Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   which is one of the major holdings of the Industrial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLI   an  11 billion industrial themed ETF  In the past  Caterpillar has been a bellwether for future performance of the sector and the market overall 
Based in Deerfield  Illinois  Caterpillar is the world s largest maker of heavy equipment for mining  construction and energy companies  Last month it beat analysts  expectations  reporting a second quarter profit that was more than double that of the same quarter last year  And equipment sales were up 25  due to rising demand natural gas  oil and mining companies  as well as Chinese construction companies 
Since 2011  Caterpillar and the global economy as a whole have enjoyed a long run of escalating activity  This most recent earnings announcement brings renewed hope that robust global economic activity will continue through 2019 
It s also good news for Caterpillar s business model  Selling to more than 190 countries  the overseas markets account for half of its sales  Despite the looming tariffs that threaten to destabilize material costs  Caterpillar continues to book more orders and deliver higher profits 
The short term future is bright for Caterpillar  Although the stock is still roughly 30 points below its 52 week high  it s sitting on a backlog of  17 7 billion in orders  up  200 million from the first quarter  And company executives expect product prices to more than offset looming cost increases 
Hopefully  Caterpillar s performance is an indicator that industrials are catching back up to meet the market and return it to its traditional correlation with the sector  It s a better scenario than the market dramatically dropping to do the same ",Investment U,0.033,0.865,0.102,0.97
CAT,2018-09-24,"By Se Young Lee and Min Zhang BEIJING  Reuters    The United States and China imposed fresh tariffs on each other s goods on Monday as the world s biggest economies showed no signs of backing down from an increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to hit global economic growth  Soon after the new duties went into effect  China accused the United States of engaging in  trade bullyism  and said it was intimidating other countries to submit to its will  the official Xinhua news agency said  reiterating China s willingness to fight if necessary   But Beijing also said it was willing to restart trade negotiations with the United States if the talks are  based on mutual respect and equality   Xinhua said  citing a white paper on the dispute published by China s State Council   U S  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory tariffs by Beijing on  60 billion worth of U S  products took effect at midday Asian time  though the initial level of the duties was not as high as earlier feared  Stocks on Wall Street closed lower  Boeing  NYSE BA  Co  the biggest U S  exporter to China  dropped 1 1 percent and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  1 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange  Network equipment maker Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  also fell   One of the bigger risks with these tariffs going into effect is that the United States may be pushed out of the Chinese market  and it is a growing market   said Scott Brown  chief economist at Raymond James in St  Petersburg  Florida  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 181 45 points  or 0 68 percent  to 26 562 095  and the S P 500 finished 10 30 points lower  or 0 35 percent  to 2 919 37  but the Nasdaq Composite rose 6 29 points  or 0 08 percent  to 7 993 25   Moody s said on Monday additional U S  tariffs on Chinese imports are negative for various sectors in both countries and could spread beyond targeted sectors  adding that tariffs are credit negative for U S  furniture   home goods retailers  with more than half their imports coming from china last year   The United States will levy tariffs of 10 percent initially  rising to 25 percent at the end of 2018  Beijing has imposed rates of 5 percent to 10 percent and warned it would respond to any rise in U S  tariffs on Chinese products accordingly  The two sides had already slapped tariffs on  50 billion worth of each other s goods   For U S  consumers  the new duties could translate into higher prices for Chinese products ranging from vacuum cleaners to technology gear such as home modems and routers  while U S  goods targeted by Beijing include liquefied natural gas and certain types of aircraft   President Donald Trump is pressing China to reduce its huge bilateral trade surplus and make sweeping changes to its policies on trade  technology transfers and high tech industrial subsidies  Beijing has denied that U S  companies are forced to transfer technology and sees Washington s demands on rolling back its industrial policies as an attempt to contain China s economic rise  The U S  administration  has brazenly preached unilateralism  protectionism and economic hegemony  making false accusations against many countries and regions  particularly China  intimidating other countries through economic measures such as imposing tariffs   Xinhua quoted the State Council s white paper as saying   NO END IN SIGHT FOR TRADE WAR  Several rounds of Sino U S  trade talks in recent months have yielded no major breakthroughs  and attempts at arranging another meeting in coming weeks have fallen through  A senior White House official said last week the United States will continue to engage China  but added there was no date for further talks   China  which has accused Washington of being insincere in the negotiations  has decided not to send Vice Premier Liu He to Washington this week  the Wall Street Journal reported late last week   News of Beijing s decision to skip the talks pushed China s yuan currency down 0 3 percent on Monday in offshore trade  reinforcing investors  fears that both sides are digging in for a long fight  Mainland China markets were closed for a holiday   Economists warn that a protracted dispute will eventually stunt growth across the globe  Companies on both sides of the Pacific are already reporting disruptions to their operations and are reviewing investment plans   The trade tensions have also cast a pall over broader relations between Beijing and Washington  with the two sides butting heads on a growing number of issues  China summoned the U S  ambassador in Beijing and postponed military talks in protest against a U S  decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a missile system  Rob Carnell  ING s chief Asia economist  said in a note to clients that in the absence of any incentives Beijing would likely hold off on any further negotiations for now   It would look weak both to the U S  and at home   he said  adding that there is  sufficient stimulus in the pipeline  to limit the damage of the latest tariffs on China s economy   The U S  China trade war has no clear end in sight   China may also be waiting for U S  midterm congressional elections early next month for any hints of changes in Washington s policy stance  Carnell added   With generic polls favouring the Democrats  they may feel that the trade environment will be less hostile after November 6   The China Daily  Beijing s official English newspaper  paid for a four page advertising supplement on Sunday in the Des Moines Register   the largest newspaper in the politically important state of Iowa  The insert  which called the trade war the  fruit of a president s folly   highlighted the dispute s impact on a slew of U S  agricultural sectors  including soybean farmers  pecan nut growers and seafood exporters  Iowa s corn  soybean and hog sectors will lose between  1 68 billion and  2 2 billion in revenues because of the trade fights  according to a recent study by Iowa State University  The state is the top U S  producer of corn and pork  and a leading producer of soybeans  eggs and poultry  Trump earlier this month accused China of targeting rural voters who support his presidency by hitting agricultural goods  Beijing has repeatedly denied the charge   WASHINGTON READYING MORE MEASURES  Trump on Saturday reiterated a threat to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods should Beijing retaliate  suggesting that Washington may slap tariffs on virtually all imported Chinese goods if the administration does not get its way   China imports far less from the United States  making a dollar for dollar match on any new U S  tariffs impossible   Instead  it has warned of  qualitative  measures to retaliate  Though Beijing has not revealed what such steps might be  business executives and analysts say it could withhold exports of certain products to the United States or create more administrative red tape for American companies operating in China

CAT,2018-10-23,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh CHICAGO  Reuters     Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  tried on Tuesday to ease mounting concerns about China and global demand after it affirmed its 2018 profit estimate  a move that investors feared signaled a cap in earnings growth and sparked a sell off in its shares  The Deerfield  Illinois based company has boosted the full year profit outlook twice in the first two quarters of this year  That had built hopes of yet another upgrade  But the company retained its 2018 adjusted profit forecast of  11 00 to  12 00 per share  saying nothing material had changed since the last revision in July  The move came days after China reported the weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis  and the International Monetary Fund cut the global growth outlook for 2018 and 2019  The industrial bellwether  however  said it expected the Chinese market to remain healthy  leading to a 40 percent annual increase in industry sales for standard full size excavators this year   We are very comfortable with the outlook for China   Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in an interview   We still expect to have another good year in China   Bonfield said the world s second largest economy accounts for 10 15 percent of CAT s construction equipment sales and 5 10 percent of total company sales  In the latest quarter  nonresidential building and infrastructure activities in China powered a 19 percent jump in Caterpillar s construction equipment sales in the Asia Pacific region  Dealers in China posted one of the biggest inventory increases of Caterpillar products in the third quarter  the company said  A VICTIM OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS The bullish comments helped Caterpillar shares recover from the worst sell off since at least April  but the stock was still down 7 percent at  119 67 late Tuesday afternoon  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI   which includes Caterpillar  also pared early losses and was down 32 48 points   Most investors are working with the base case scenario of a recession sometime in either 2019 or 2020   said Rizk Maidi  an analyst at equity research firm Berenberg in London   People are just hunting for any data point to confirm that the earnings have peaked   Elizabeth Vermillion  an analyst at CFRA Research  said the company was also becoming a victim of high expectations after its profits topped Wall Street estimates in all of the last nine reporting periods  For the third quarter  adjusted profit per share came in at  2 86  up from  1 95  last year  Analysts on average had expected  2 85 a share  according to Refinitiv  OUTLOOK Caterpillar shares are down over 25 percent since late January as U S  China trade tensions intensified and raw material and freight costs soared for local manufacturers  Shares of other major industrials  including 3M Co  N MMM   are also in  bear market  territory  down 20 percent or more from their highs  CAT said most of its end markets are continuing to improve  helping it post higher sales across the three primary business segments  Maidi said Caterpillar s earnings still have room to grow as its revenues are 25 percent off their 2012 peak  On Tuesday  Bonfield asked investors to expect smaller profit increases   There does come a time when you grow at more normal levels   Bonfield said  Profit grew 47 percent in the third quarter  sharply lower than 99 percent and 120 percent jumps in the second and first quarter  respectively  Caterpillar also acknowledged an increase in manufacturing costs in the latest quarter due to elevated freight costs  and higher steel prices and import tariffs   It said tariffs would cost it about  40 million in the latest quarter  However  for the full year  it estimated the impact to be at the low end of the previous forecast of  100 million to  200 million

CAT,2018-10-23,"There has been more uncertainty regarding trade and economic growth these past few months  This week  investors might get an idea of whether this is translating into broader economic impacts when heavy equipment maker Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  reports earnings before the open on Tuesday  Oct  23 
For Q3  CAT is expected to report adjusted EPS of  2 85 on revenue of  13 29 billion  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  In the same quarter last year  adjusted EPS was  1 95 on revenue of  11 41 billion 
Naturally  tariffs and the global trade tensions have been a topic of concern among many analysts  During the company s last report  Joe Creed  who was interim CFO at the time  said he expects tariffs would add between  100 million and  200 million to material costs in the second half of the year 
At the same time  CEO Jim Umpleby said that they hadn t seen any material impact on CAT s business in China due to trade tensions  It has been a few months since then and the situation has evolved  so management might provide an update on whether or not much has changed for them 
While tariffs have added some headwinds  management cited several positives that they expect will offset tariffs and higher material costs  The first being that CAT had implemented price increases on July 1 this year  The company has also focused on what it calls its  Operating   Execution Model   which is partially designed to maintain structural cost control 
Overall  analysts are still widely positive on the economic backdrop for the company  Global growth remains strong in many major economies like the U S  and China  although opinions vary widely on how long this level of growth can be maintained  Many countries  including the U S  and China are still focused on infrastructure spending as well 
And almost across the board  commodity prices have stabilized and are well off their lows a few years back  which has aided the recovery in CAT s mining  farming  and oil and gas businesses  In oil and gas and mining  CAT said in July that they were seeing  strong demand and taking orders for delivery well into 2019   When it reported Q2 results  CAT s backlog was at  17 7 billion  up slightly from  17 5 billion in Q1 2018 

Down at the Lows  CAT has rallied substantially from its 2016 low of  56 36  but the stock has pulled back a bit in 2018  Outside of a few green days  CAT has dropped rapidly over the course of October  going from a slight gain on the year to about a 17  decline  Chart source  thinkorswim  by TD Ameritrade  Not a recommendation  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Around CAT s earnings report  options traders have priced in a 5  stock move in either direction  according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim  platform  Implied volatility was at the 81st percentile as of this morning 
In short term options trading at the Oct  26 weekly expiration  call volumes have been lighter in recent trading and there s just been a smattering of activity from the 133 strike price up to the 138 strike  On the put side  however  there was a lot of action during Friday s session 
21 505 contracts traded at the 132 strike put and 15 470 contracts traded at the 130 strike put  versus open interest of 274 contracts and 111 contracts  respectively  This was largely due to several large block trades three orders alone accounted for 28 149 of the volume traded at those strikes 
Looking further out at the Nov  16 monthly expiration  calls have been active at the 145 strike price and activity has been picking up at the 135 and 140 strikes as well  For puts  recent trading has been concentrated at the 130 and 135 strikes  There is also a sizable amount of open interest at the 145 strike put with 16 589 contracts

USD CAD continues to battle the 1 3100 resistance line for the 3rd straight session  We have been in a downtrend since June  and its hanging right around the topline resistance  A significant break of this trend would be very significant in my opinion  and could mean the bulls take this things to 1 3200 and possibly beyond  However  the Loonie has continued to show resilience  and could just as easily we fall back towards the 100DMA  1 3068  or lower  We may also see a pickup in volatility on the Loonie over the next hours or so  as the markets await the BoC rate decision tomorrow

How Bad Will it Get For US Equities 
US stocks continue to take a beating  Disappointing earnings from Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and 3M  NYSE MMM  saw the Dow gap down 400  points at the open  right through the 200 DMA   We are slightly off the lows  but still sputtering  S P and Nasdaq are getting hit even harder  and are down 43 and 134 points  respectively  Does DJI turn around and fill the gap  If we close below the 200 DMA  that would only add fuel to the fire for the bears ",Gianluca Privitera,0.077,0.868,0.055,-0.7243
CAT,2018-10-23,"Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  traded 10  lower on Tuesday morning  after posting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations but disappointed on guidance 
The construction equipment company reported earnings per share of  2 88 and total revenue of  13 5 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  2 83 and  13 2 billion  CAT maintained its 2018 earnings guidance of  11 12  yet some may have been hoping it would raise this projection 
While CEO Jim Umpleby noted that   This was the best third quarter profit per share in our company s history   he also pointed to higher costs for the foreseeable future  This is due in part to increases in steel prices and tariffs and may have been one reason the company was unable to raise guidance 
Turning to the market cycles for CAT  we can see on the chart below that the stock is in the declining phase of its current cycle  We can also see this cycle still has plenty of time left  which means more time to decline  Our best case projection is  114 in the near term  with  101 possible in the coming weeks

CAT,2018-10-25,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  business spending on equipment appeared to have remained slow in September and the goods trade deficit widened further as rising imports outpaced a rebound in exports  suggesting economic growth moderated in the third quarter  But the growth pace in the last quarter was probably solid  with other data on Thursday showing gains in both wholesale and retail inventories last month  A tightening labor market  which is steadily lifting wage growth  is also supporting the economy  The Commerce Department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  dipped 0 1 percent last month amid weakening demand for fabricated metals and electrical equipment  appliances and components   That followed a 0 2 percent decrease in the so called core capital goods orders in August  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0 5 percent last month  Shipments of core capital goods were unchanged in September for a second straight month   Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement   It looks like business has ordered up all the new equipment they need for now to meet the demand for their goods and services   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   The third quarter may prove to be the high water mark for U S  manufacturing   Business spending on equipment is slowing after growing at a brisk pace for more than a year  It was buoyed by the Trump administration s  1 5 trillion tax cut package  which included a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate   But the impact of lower taxes is being offset by the administration s  America First  policies  which have led to a bitter trade war between the United States and China  as well as tit for tat tariffs with other major trade partners   Companies including  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT   3M Co  N MMM  and  Ford Motor Co   N F  have complained about rising manufacturing costs as a result of the duties on imported steel and other raw materials   In its Beige Book report published on Wednesday  the Federal Reserve said  manufacturers reported raising prices of finished goods out of necessity as costs of raw materials such as metals rose  which they attributed to tariffs   The dollar  DXY  rose against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said the monetary union remained fragile and failed to assuage concerns about financial instability in Italy  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while U S  Treasury prices fell  TRADE DRAG In another report on Thursday  the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 0 8 percent to  76 0 billion in September  Exports of goods rose  2 5 billion to  141 0 billion last month  boosted by shipments of industrial supplies  motor vehicles  consumer and capital goods  But food exports continued to decline  likely pulled down by shipments of soybeans  which have borne the brunt of Washington s trade fight with Beijing  The rebound in goods exports last month was eclipsed by a  3 1 billion increase in goods imports to  217 0 billion  There were sharp increases in imports of consumer and capital good  reflecting robust domestic demand  The anticipated drag on GDP growth from the deteriorating trade deficit is expected to be offset somewhat by an increase in inventory investment  The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0 3 percent last month  Retail inventories gained 0 1 percent   We still look for trade to be a significant drag on third quarter growth and inventories to be a significant boost   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   The big swings in trade and inventories between the second and third quarters are likely at least partially due to changes in activity associated with trade policy   According to a Reuters survey of economists  the economy probably grew at a 3 3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter after expanding at a 4 2 percent pace in the April June period  The government will publish its snapshot of third quarter GDP growth on Friday  A third report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 215 000 for the week ended Oct  20  Claims fell to 202 000 during the week ended Sept  15  which was the lowest level since November 1969  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 214 000 in the latest week  The four week moving average of initial claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  was unchanged at 211 750 last week

CAT,2018-10-26,"The latest earnings reports from Caterpillar Inc  and 3M Co   two of the world s leading industrial stocks  indicate that the outlook for the sector is going to get worse before it gets better 
Escalating cost pressures and tariff barriers have started to hit their bottom lines  On October 23  Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT   the powerful mining and construction equipment maker  repeated its warning about rising costs due to higher steel prices and US tariffs 
Caterpillar said in a government filing that the impact of recently imposed tariffs was about  40 million in the third quarter  and the company sees the full year impact of the tariffs at the low end of the range of  100 million to  200 million 
Investors punished Caterpillar severely after the company failed to raise its guidance for the full year despite modestly better than expected third quarter results 
On a similar note  3M Company  NYSE MMM   one of the world s largest industrial conglomerates  warned that high material prices have contributed to a decline in sales  The maker of Post it notes and touch screens cut its 2018 profit forecast to  10 a share  This is the third time this year that the company has trimmed its outlook 
The diminished outlook is the result of weakness in many of the markets where it has a leading position  such as automotive and dental products  Core sales at 3M expanded just 1 3  in the third quarter  falling well short of analysts  expectations for a gain of 3  
3M reported that sales fell for the first time in two years  with declines in three of the company s five main businesses during the third quarter  electronics and energy  health care and consumer products 
Tariffs from the US China trade war amount to a  100 million headwind for the company  but the company will seek to offset that by raising prices  Chief Financial Officer Nick Gangestad said on the conference call 
Tanking Shares  More Pain in Store
Both 3M and Caterpillar are in a bear market this year  as their share prices plunged more than 20  after peaking in early 2018 

Trading at  115 63  Caterpillar has lost 33  from the 52 week high 

In a similar downtrend  3M is trading at  184 99  a 29  drop from this year s high of  259 77 
And the bad news for both of these stocks is that they will likely see further weakness as the Federal Reserve continues with its monetary tightening 
Industrials stocks  such as 3M and Caterpillar  are very sensitive to interest rate moves as their fortunes are closely tied with the economy where demand is rising and interest rates are low  As the Fed tries to cool down the overheated economy  investors usually shun industrial stocks 
In this fast changing economic backdrop  it s better for investors to avoid front line industrial stocks  such 3M and Caterpillar  Their share price charts suggest that they have seen the peak in the current bull market and their earnings momentum will continue to slow 
Despite this warning regarding these large industrial names  we re not suggesting that these companies are entering a recession type demand compression  The point we want to make is that for Caterpillar and 3M the good days of sales growth and profit margins are already behind them  And unfortunately  their future looks even more uncertain 
Bottom Line
As the world s economic growth falters and uncertainty rises in the US  investors should be very cautious as to which stocks they buy and hold  This is certainly not the right time to get bullish on volatile industrial names which get hammered at the first sign of recession ",Haris Anwar/Investing.com,0.108,0.803,0.089,-0.8433

CAT,2018-11-08,"The European market  Stoxx 600  is currently trading around 366 73 in the early EU session Wednesday  surged by almost  1 10  on hopes of softer Trump trade rhetoric as Trump lost his control over the US legislative agenda 

The Democrats have already flipped the 23 minimum seats necessary to take the House majority by almost 30 seats  which will allow them to block any bellicose Republican legislation that attempts to pass through the US Congress  i e  the US is now heading for a potential gridlock over Trump s political and economic agenda  A split US Congress is historically bearish for the USD and positive for the US global equities but could be also negative for export heavy European stocks in the long run 

On Wednesday  the European market was also buoyed by some upbeat corporate report card and a rally in Spanish banks on a favorable tax ruling  The Spanish Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that lenders were not required to pay stamp duty on mortgages  sparing them from potentially having to reimburse a significant amount to borrowers  who for years have already paid the tax themselves 

As highly expected  in a political blow to Trump  the US Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives after urban suburban voters punished Trump at the ballot box  In the first nationwide elections since Trump s stunning presidential victory in 2016  the Democrats reclaimed control of the US House 

The latest US midterm election so far  HOUSE DEM 204 vs REP 187  Majority 218  Total 435 seats   SENATE  DEM 38 vs REP 50  Majority 50  Total 100 seats   GOVERNOR   DEM 20 vs REP 25  Total  36 states   Before the midterm election  the Republicans had control of the House of Representatives  holding 235 seats to the Democrats  193 seats 

In other words  the one party rule in Washington is over as Democrats  DNC  won the seats needed to take the House after capturing districts where President Trump is unpopular and think Trump s Presidential power need to be checked  Trump s Republicans  RNC  got votes primarily from his strong support base of rural America  which is also an indication that they are supporting Trump s trade war agenda  especially against China  contrary to earlier perception 

However a massive  blue wave  of DNC support did not materialize  and America remains a deeply divided country after the midterm election  politically   The RNC comfortably retained control of the Senate by re capturing 3 seats from the RNC with their rural vote holding up well  and also hung on to key governorships including in the swing state of Florida  Trump proclaimed it as a  tremendous success  for his party  but that may be completely untrue 

For Trump  controlling the Senate means Republicans can confirm any appointments to his admin or the judiciary  and it also makes it easier for him to replace officials  But above all  as Trump does not require any approval from the US Congress for his trade war agenda  this may continue to haunt the risk on trade in the coming days 

Overall it s a mixed US election result and not a disaster for the RNC GOP and right now the US Presidential race for 2020 looks wide open  as DNC setting up battles with Trump  A DNC controlled House could cause big problems for Trump over the final two years of his Presidential term  not just by blocking his legislative agenda  but we may see subpoenas flying in for the president s unpublished tax returns  a more stringent inquiry into his links with Russia and eventually his impeachment effort  And we may see the US shut down  less fiscal stimulus effort  a compromise on planned infra stimulus and more political uncertainty in the coming days 

Meanwhile  Trump called House Minority Leader Pelosi this morning to concede defeat  The result puts Pelosi on course to reclaim the speaker s chair after eight years in the minority  making her the most powerful Democrat in the country until a presidential candidate is chosen 

Trump also boasted about his  success  of the midterm in a series of tweets  

 Tremendous success tonight  Thank you to all  

 There s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election  Mr  Trump has a magic about him  This guy has magic coming out of his ears  He is an astonishing vote getter   campaigner  The Republicans are   unbelievably lucky to have him and I m just awed at how well they ve done  It s all the Trump magic   Trump is the magic man  Incredible  he s got the entire media against him  attacking him every day  and he pulls out these enormous wins   Ben Stein   The Capitalist Code 

 DavidAsmanfox   How do the Democrats respond to this  Think of how his position with Republicans improves all the candidates who won tonight  They realize how important he is because of what he did in campaigning for them  They owe him their political career   Thanks  I agree 

But the market is relieved that Trump could dial back some of his bellicose trade policies on DNC pressure  which will eventually help the US for a meaningful trade deal with China and other nations trading blocks and also help the US to repair the badly damaged relation with rest of the world  Trump s defeat in the US House will be positive for globalization and global risk on sentiment  Apart from trade and foreign Iran North Korea policy  the market will also focus on the US WH policies on defense spending and government capex  surging US fiscal deficit  lowering of drug prices  deregulation etc 

 Muller s storm  may be another risk after the US election 

After the US election  Muller may announce  something sensational  in his marathon Russian investigation and on issues of obstruction of justice by Trump  which could be another headwind for the risk on trade  Muller may reveal something serious about  Junior Don  and seek Trump s  personal interview  or written submissions 

Trump  lack of a majority in the US Congress after the midterm election could help Muller to go ahead with his investigation  seek Trump s dubious Deutsche bank transactions involving Russian links and all these  political harassment  could lead Trump an early resignation rather than facing an embarrassing process of impeachment or a defeat in 2020 Presidential election

USD in the back foot as Trump lost his control over US legislative agenda 
In brief  increasing political insecurity could make Trump soft on his trade cold war narratives and could also pose a question mark on his Trumponomics rhetorics  fiscal stimulus  tax cuts   The midterm result could cause political uncertainty and policy paralysis to some extent  which is negative for the USD  The US dollar index slumped over 0 40  after the midterm result trend got clear  USDJPY slips around  0 25   EURUSD jumped almost  0 40   while GBPUSD also surged around  0 37   Basically  USD is under stress on larger than expected RNC win in the US House  30 40 vs 23 expected  prior  42

CAT,2018-11-21,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Caterpillar  CAT   Shares have added about 10 3  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Caterpillar due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Caterpillar Q3 Earnings Top Estimates on Robust Demand Caterpillar delivered adjusted earnings per share of  2 86 in third quarter 2018  which rose 47  year over year driven by continued strength in many of its end markets and incessant focus on cost control  Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 83  The quarterly performance marked the company s seventh consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth after a string of dismal performances over a period of four years  Despite upbeat results  Caterpillar s shares dipped 7  in pre market trading as it maintained its guidance for 2018  This can be attributed to increased material costs due to tariffs and supply chain challenges which are likely to dent its results for the year  Including one time items  Caterpillar s third quarter earnings per share came in at  2 88 compared with  1 77 per share in the prior year quarter  Notably  this was a third quarter record  Improved End Markets Drive Revenues  Revenues improved 18  year over year to  13 5 billion in the quarter under review  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 2 billion  The company witnessed higher sales volume due to improved end user demand across all segments  including an increase in dealer inventories  However  unfavorable currency impacts  primarily owing to a weaker Australian dollar and Brazilian real were a minor concern  Sales increased across all regions  led by Asia Pacific and North America with an increase of 28  and 22   respectively  Sales in Latin America rose 10  while EAME witnessed an increase of 6   Higher Sales Lead to Improved Profits In third quarter  cost of sales increased 18  year over year to  94 billion due to higher manufacturing costs  This can be attributed to higher freight costs as a result of supply chain inefficiencies while increases in steel prices and tariffs triggered the rise in material costs  Gross profit advanced 20  to  4 5 billion  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 4  to  1 3 billion  Research and development  R D  expenses went up 4  year over year to  479 million  Operating profit came in at  2 1 billion  an improvement from the prior year quarter figure of  1 5 billion aided by higher sales volume and favorable price realization  All Segments Deliver Growth Machinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales surged 19  year over year to  12 8 billion  Sales of Energy   Transportation gained 15  to  5 6 billion from the prior year quarter  driven by higher sales volume across all applications except Industrial  Sales at Resource Industries improved 35  year over year to  2 6 billion aided by higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment  Construction Industries sales rose 16  year over year to  5 7 billion on the back of higher sales volume for construction equipment  The ME T segment delivered an operating profit of  2 1 billion  an improvement of 43  from  1 4 billion in the year ago quarter  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit improved 31  to  973 million on higher sales volume which was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and increased SG A R D expenses  The Resource Industries reported operating profit of  414 million in the third quarter  an 81  surge from  229 million in the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and favorable price realization  However  higher manufacturing costs and increased SG A and R D expenses were causes of concern  Construction Industries  profit increased 20  to  1 1 billion due to higher sales volume  partially negated by higher manufacturing costs  Financial Products  revenues went up 9  to  845 million due to higher average financing rates in North America and higher average earning assets in Asia Pacific and North America as well as a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment  However  these gains were partially offset by lower intercompany lending activity in North America and lower average earning assets in Latin Americaand lower average financing rates in Europe  Financial Products  profits were  201 million in the reported quarter  up from  185 million in the prior year quarter  Favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment  higher average earning assets and an increase in net yield on average earning assets were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from available for sale securities in Insurance Services  Cash Position Caterpillar ended the third quarter of 2018 with cash and short term investments of  8 billion  down from  8 3 billion at 2017 end  ME T operating cash flow for the quarter under review was  848 million  During the third quarter  the company made  1 billion to pension plans  repurchased  750 million of its common stock and a made a dividend payout of  511 million  Robust Backlog At the end of third quarter 2018  Caterpillar s backlog was at  17 3 billion  a  1 9 billion improvement year over year aided by increase at all segments  Guidance Maintained Backed by performance so far in 2018  healthy order rates  backlog and improving end markets  Caterpillar maintained adjusted earnings per share guidance at  11 00  12 00 for fiscal 2018  The company anticipates price realization  operational excellence and cost discipline to help offset the impact of higher material and freight costs  including tariffs on fourth quarter results  For fiscal 2018  the company estimates the impact of recently imposed tariffs to be at the low end of the previously provided range of  100 million to  200 million  Supply chain challenges will continue to pressure freight costs  The sudden spike in demand has led to supply chain challenges across the industry  Although the company is making efforts to improve material flows  constraints remain for some parts and components that are impacting lead times and availability  Caterpillar plans to mitigate these impacts through price increases and utilizing the Operating   Execution Model to drive operational excellence and structural cost discipline  Caterpillar added that it will implement a price hike of 1 4  worldwide on machines and engines with exceptions on specific products and regions  This price action will be effective in January 2019  How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then

CAT,2018-11-22,"We look forward as traders  not backwards  but it seems we can almost turn a page on this week and look for markets to ramp back up after US Thanksgiving and Black Friday 
Indeed  if I look at moves overnight as a guide for what we can expect over the coming two sessions  we saw a reasonably upbeat move  with the high yield investment grade credit spread narrowing seven basis points  This fuelled a decent move in US small caps with the Russell 2000 setting up a decent double bottom  while tech stocks finally caught a bid  Large caps did very little  with the Dow Jones index completely unchanged  although I was somewhat enthused that Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  outperformed here 
The move in credit and equity was handed a further tailwind from the complete lack of life in rates  FX and fixed income markets  Consider that these markets had a war on two fronts  with MNI  Marketnews   citing a senior Fed officer and suggesting we could see a pause in the Fed s rate hike cycle in Spring 2019  At the same time  US data flow gave us a further chance to hone in on some of the suspect parts of the US economy  That being  existing home sales  which are growing at the slowest pace since 2014  Core CAPEX orders declined 2 9  YOY  and we still have to factor the decline in the oil price  and therefore the November print promises to be ugly  Nondefense capital goods orders were unchanged for the third month  while durable goods had the biggest fall   4 4   since July 2017 
On any given day we should have seen a genuinely solid bid in US Treasuries  across the curve   with rates markets further pricing out future tightening from the Fed  But as it turns out  markets were calm  In fact  we even saw implied volatility fall in most markets and as you can see from the chart of US 2  and 5 year Treasuries  which of course mirrors the change in policy expectations  but the bulls just don t have the clout to push either market through key support levels  or resistance in price   When we also heard from Foxconn  one of the most leveraged companies to Apple s iPhone sales  saying they were cutting  2 9b in costs  and I d argue in days gone by that US tech would have been 2  lower on this story alone 

The USD should have been 0 5  lower on these dynamics  with USD JPY eyeing a re test of Tuesday low of 112 31  which seems punchy given USD JPY 1 week implied volatility suggests a move of 75 pips over the next seven days  But as it is  we see this pair holding the 113 handle 
Logically  it seems markets will likely see two more days of similar moves and come back focused on taking on the challenge of the event risk next week  So  with US data rolling over a touch  and interest rate pricing having already viciously reacted to a more nuanced tone from key Fed personnel  such as Chair Powell and Vice Chair Clarida  one asks what more we can learn from Fed speakers next week  And  the calendar is littered with key Fed speakers next week  and naturally  the market will be hanging off their every word  as a March hike is currently priced at less than 50  
Recall  there may be concerns in housing  auto s and now the forward looking CAPEX estimates and that suggests Q4 GDP  when released on 31 January  could be closer to 2 5  and certainly lower than the 3 1  consensus growth rate  However  not everything is falling apart and while the fed funds are still some way below the neutral rate  which is considered to be 3  and growth is 70bp above trend  and we could be some 100bp below what the Fed consider as full employment in 2019  then there are reasons to think the Fed will perhaps not pause in spring  This dynamic is incredibly interesting  as the Fed will have to get this right or markets will sense a policy mistake  especially when liquidity is falling and as prominent strategist David Rosengren pointed out  the global monetary base is running at a  7 YoY rate 
I will be watching US leading indicators as a precursor of a further recession  as this incorporates 10 of the key forward indicators and have been a good litmus test of past recessions 

FX markets have done little through Asia today as well  with AUD and NZD seeing the most protracted move  although a 0 2  and 0 4  fall on the session  against the USD  is unconvincing  The 20 day MA has been good support in AUD USD since the explosive rally on 1 November  and we can see volatility increase as the Bollinger bands widen  There has been little in the way of news flow through Asia  with the only real data coming in the shape of Japan CPI  ex food  coming in as expected at 1   while the weekly MoF  Minister of Finance  showed Japanese funds bought  245b of foreign stocks last week  while selling  145B of foreign bonds  The move lower in AUD USD seems a reflection of the correlation with Chinese markets  where we can see the Hang Seng and CSI 300 lower by 0 2  and 0 7  respectively 
The ASX 200 has been the outperformer here  with the 0 7  gain eclipsing the Nikkei 225  which is up 0 2   The daily chart of Aussie SPI futures has worked a dream  and the buy zone of 5620 to 5600 held again beautifully  Valuations have been talked up of late  with the ASX 200 trading on 14x forward earnings   the lowest multiple since 2014  falling from 15 9x in October  Earnings haven t been revised lower to any degree  so value investors are eyeing the market with interest again and centred most of the buying in healthcare  I still feel with liquidity falling and the macro uncertain  the market will see real  value  emerge at lower levels here and award a far higher risk premium than we have seen in years gone by

GBP is the currency to watch through the remainder of the week  although there are still unsolved issues in Italy that will affect the MIB and EUR  GBP looks like the currency that could move most aggressively  GBP USD 1 week implied volatility  vol  had pulled back from the lofty 16  seen last Thursday  but we have seen the market start to pay up for volatility today and vols are pushing higher again  An implied vol of 11  gives us an expected move of 180 points over the coming seven days  which suggests the market sees GBP USD up to 1 2960 or down to 1 2600 
That feels a touch low in my opinion  with the chain of events unfolding over the next few days and culminating in the EU Summit on Sunday  Anyone variable could derail the Summit  starting with an expected revised draft Withdrawal due tonight  that needs to strike the right balance to get the DUP Party back on side  We are even hearing France and Germany are not aligned in their views on Brexit  and the summit could be called off on their disagreements alone  The risks to the GBP are symmetrical here  but it promises to be an interesting ride for those interest and trading Brexit ",IG,0.065,0.831,0.103,0.9945

CommentaryI have become convinced that 2019 is going to deliver another one of those poor trading starts  The stock market is unstable  The stock market is chaotic  Headline risk is extremely high  Resistance levels are holding firm on the major indices  The gyrations in the stock market take me back to the temporary market bottom in the fall of 2008 as the financial crisis unfolded 

In 2008  the market roiled in October  plunged in November  calmed in December  and then setup the final of all final sell offs into the epic March  2009 low

This time around  the S P 500  NYSE SPY  is stuck in a 2 month and counting trading range of wild gyrations starting with the massive October 10th breakdown from its 50 day moving average  DMA  to the 2600 level on an intraday basis  The index has yet to retest its low for 2018  but the rapidly sinking sentiment in the market makes it FEEL like the index has retested a multi year low 

The S P 500  SPY  sliced through its October and November closing lows  but stopped short of October s intraday low  Buyers rallied the index from a 2 9  loss to a mere 0 2  loss 
The NASDAQ and the Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  staged comebacks that were sharp enough to close out the day with gains  These tech laden indices were both down as much as 2 4  and ended the day UP 0 4  and 0 7  respectively 

The NASDAQ left its November low well intact on its way to an incredible snapback rally from a 2 4  intraday loss 
The Invesco QQQ Trust  QQQ  left its November low well intact on its way to an incredible snapback rally from a 2 4  intraday loss 
All three of these major indices confirmed major resistance at their 50 and 200DMAs  The simultaneous failures followed almost exactly the scenarios I warned about in the last Above the 40 post in the immediate wake of the post G20 euphoria  I executed my plan at the time and took profits on all my short term long positions and initiated several big market fades  including Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  puts and CALL options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   There is no time to celebrate that market call because the market quickly transformed from the  Cramer bottom  right back to near oversold levels 
The major lows occurred on the heels of a big drop in the futures  which produced several trading halts and then news of the arrest of the CFO of China s Huawei  The surprising news confirmed the need to end the euphoria over a 90 day  truce  in the China versus U S  trade war  Trade tensions may even rise all over again  Recall that I claimed that the 90 day truce would merely give us 90 more days to gnash our teeth about on going trade headlines  Still  I am taken aback that this scenario only took a day to get started 
Despite the heavy weight of negativity  the intraday lows felt like a panic low and a major washout of sellers  especially with tech stocks in the cloud space and home builders rebounding so strongly that they posted decent gains at the close  That was a time to buy  and I did   This is still a time to buy  so I flipped my short term trading call to cautiously bullish  The intraday lows provide a very clear line in the sand for stopping out of short term bullish positions  Overhead resistance at the 50 and 200DMAs provide an upside target and a point to initiate new fades 
My favorite technical indicator  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  plunged  close enough  to oversold conditions  below 20    At one point during the day  AT40 dropped as low as 23  or so  unfortunately a charting error in FreeStockCharts com has for the past week shown distorted lows after the close of trading   AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  is still languishing in the 20  range as a reminder of the depressed positioning of so many individual stocks 
The volatility index  the VIX  added to the buy signal when it soared as high as 26  The 25 4  surge came one trading day after a 26 2  gain  Combined  these moves represent a highly concentrated lift in fear  The VIX last closed above 26 during the February swoon  The volatility faders went to work from there and pushed the VIX to a mere 2 2  gain on the day  The VIX still closed at elevated levels  above 20   so opportunity remains to fade the VIX even from here  I chose to flip intraday the put options I bought on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  because I loaded up enough on bullish trades like QQQ call options and calls on cloud stocks 

The volatility index  the VIX  is swinging through a wide 2 month range  below 30 and above the 15 35 pivot line 
While I am more constructive on the market  I am only cautiously bullish because the upside from here seems limited to overhead resistance  More importantly  there are enough signs remaining that the market could retest its intraday low in the near term  perhaps even retest the 2018 low in short order  perhaps in January  
Firstly  the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  continues to show weakness and thus flag waning risk tolerance in financial markets  If AUD JPY closes below its 50DMA  I will assume the currency pair is flashing a freshly bearish signal 

AUD JPY sliced through 200DMA support and bounced back from a 50DMA breakdown  The important currency pair still looks weak with a downward bias 
Small caps are taking a harsh beating and are under performing  The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  lost 0 3  for the day  IWM gapped down to open right at its 2018 closing low and traded as far down as a 15 month low before rebounding  I think IWM s hold on its low is particularly tenuous because the index faded its entire post G20 gain at one point on Monday  Its 4 3  loss the next day wiped out its entire rally from the November low in one fell swoop 

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  looks like it is working on a major breakdown of its 2018 lows  A loss for the year is almost certain 
The financials also continue to look sick  I have been amazed at the muted alarms over this persistent weakness and under performance  Financials were supposed to be big beneficiaries of the current environment  I have duly noted persistent narratives from pundits of lower regulations  lower taxes  a strong economy  low valuations  and strong balance sheets  Yet  the sellers keep fading and pushing the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  ever lower  Today  XLF closed with a 1 5  loss  underperformed the market yet again  and at one point traded at a 15 month low 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  formed a hammer patter as it snapped back from a 15 year low  Sellers still kept the ETF below its lower Bollinger  Band  BB  
This latest cycle continues to fascinate me  The mild bullish divergence that I essentially dismissed before last week s rally turned out to be meaningful  I noted that lesson and so am more inclined to treat this latest close call as a bullish sign  Next up on Friday is the November jobs report waiting to twist the minds of traders and investors alike  Another Fed meeting follows with a pronouncement on monetary policy on December 19  If a late breaking report from the Wall Street Journal is accurate  then the Fed appears already prepared to capitulate to market fears  The may soon back down from its plan to steadily and regularly hike interest rates 

Federal Reserve officials are considering whether to signal a new wait and see approach after a likely interest rate increase at their meeting in December  which could slow down the pace of rate increases next year

There are a LOT of charts that demonstrate the market s drama and buying shorting opportunities  I will wait until after Friday s close to post a sample so I can be more conclusive  In the meantime  I DO want to post a quick note on a home builder 
Lennar  NYSE LEN  continues to get a lot of focus on CNBC s Fast Money  For some reason  the stock has become a favorite bottom fishing stock on that show especially after a big block of call options were purchased earlier in the year  Once again  LEN was rolled out as an ideal value play where all the negatives are already priced in  I will address this notion soon in the context of the earnings of Toll Brothers  TOL  and the stock s amazing post earnings comeback 
As I have done each time before  I have to issue an objection to this trading call  This time  I am turning my thumbs down even in the wake of a seasonally strong period and my plan to pick up selective home builder stocks to play this seasonally strong period  Unfortunately for LEN  the stock has yet to demonstrate convincing  renewed strength  The stock is not a buy until it can pull away from 50DMA resistance and what now looks like a double peak 

Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  made a promising move to print a double bottom at its 2016 closing low  but the stock has yet to follow through and confirm that low with a higher high and breakout

CAT,2019-01-16,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Caterpillar  CAT   This company  which is in the Zacks Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This construction equipment company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6 36  
For the last reported quarter  Caterpillar came out with earnings of  2 86 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 83 per share  representing a surprise of 1 06   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 66 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 97 per share  delivering a surprise of 11 65  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Caterpillar  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Caterpillar currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 30   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 28  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",Zacks Investment Research,0.037,0.824,0.139,0.9909
CAT,2019-01-20,"Caterpillar  CAT  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction equipment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 99 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  38 4  
Revenues are expected to be  14 29 billion  up 10 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 38  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Caterpillar 
For Caterpillar  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Caterpillar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Caterpillar would post earnings of  2 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 86  delivering a surprise of  1 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Caterpillar appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",Zacks Investment Research,0.055,0.796,0.148,0.9979
CAT,2019-01-22,"With U S  markets off line for MLK day  the break has given investors a chance to catch their breath after a vast improvement in global financial conditions really since 26 December 
With Asia ramping back up  we have seen S P 500 futures resume trade  0 6  lower  and while we saw the S P 500 close near its highs on Friday  this move in futures could be quite telling  and it feels as though this could be a good place to lighten up on longs here  It s somewhat premature to suggest shorts on any key indices yet  as price is still trending higher  However  after this 14  rally since 26 December  the U S  market is overbought here and in a game of probabilities  I see growing risks of a near term peak and potential reversal  Should it play out  it will flow through to other global indices 
U S  corporate earnings will play a role in the near term direction  and specifically  I would be looking at Caterpillar s  NYSE CAT  numbers tomorrow  Here  we can see a strong correlation between CAT s dealer reported machine sales and the global PMI series  which  in turn  are highly correlated to global equity markets  After such a brutal drawdown in risk assets in Q4  18  the transparency investors gain from corporate reporting  and the ability to mark to market the environment corporates operate in relative to the dynamics the market has priced is huge  Corporate reporting allows us to have greater confidence that the  E   earnings  side of the P E equation is even remotely accurate 

When so many global equity markets are trading on  cheap  valuations  the concern  of course  is the degree of risk premium we need to consider given the macro environment  and the associated opportunity costs  think  real  U S  Treasury yields   We also need to have confidence in the ability to forecast earnings  and in fast moving  volatile markets  we simply lose faith in the required assumptions and models become almost irrelevant  Earnings reporting season allows analysts to claw back some confidence in their operating environment and one would argue this is helping to lower implied volatility  for now anyhow 
Liquidity  money supply and fund flow
Much ink has been spilled on how excess liquidity  driven by changes in the Fed s balance sheet   money supply and fund flows have sucked the life out of equity and credit markets  not to mention impacting the USD  With that in mind  we can see after a period in mid December  where the pace of declines in excess reserves abated  and global money supply increased  sentiment towards risk assets was less negative   this trend is now reversing  Does this mean we are set for higher volatility again and renewed bearish exposures  Price will tell 


German DAX   who says equities don t reflect economics 
Staying in the equities space  I will be keeping an eye on the German DAX  which gapped through 11 000 last week on higher volume  A bullish move  but as we have seen for the past five years or so  the DAX is one of the most correlated to domestic  not to mention Chinese economic performance  With the EU and German ZEW survey in play  a further deterioration in the expectations survey should weigh on the index  I had been expecting a move into the June 2018 downtrend at 11 780  but my conviction behind this call is diminishing  and naturally  exposures need to be managed accordingly 
There is no survey for traders to ascertain expectations  and while there are signs of stabilization in this data point  it would not surprise to see this index drop from the current read of  21 and towards the weakest reads since 2011  Recall  we still have the EU PMI data  and ECB meeting through this week  so the DAX should get renewed focus from traders  We also will be focused on EURUSD  which has traded in a whopping 21 point range in the last 12 hours  On the day  I am a willing buyer of EURUSD into  1 1320  the lower Bollinger  band   and given overnight implied vols highlight an implied move of 44 points  on the session   my order seems a punchy call  On the upside  I would look to fade EURUSD strength into 1 1420 

Eyeing today s session so far and it s been one to forget with little moves in G10 FX  while copper futures are 1 6  lower  although Chinese and Hong Kong markets are around 0 7  lower  The ASX 200 is 0 6  lower  with the financial sector down 1 3  lower  with the sector promoting a sizeable 24 point headwind for the local market  There are signs of rotation into defensive sectors of the market with small buying in utilities and health care  while it should be noted that volumes are pretty woeful and some 33  below the 30 day average  for this time  
Aussie SPI futures look an interesting guide for those focusing on the ASX200  with price eyeing a more convincing break of yesterday s pin bar reversal low  5814  and rising wedge pattern  This argues for a deeper reversal  and we can also see stochastic momentum holding a bearish crossover  I am looking for a move into 5756  potentially even 5520   where we may see the bulls look to support  However  as always  we trade price and probabilities  so the preference is to react to behavior around expected support levels 

In FX markets  we saw GBPUSD temporarily push above 1 29  but the positive flows have had to contend with a further barrage of Brexit related headlines  Jeremy Corbyn endorsing a plan for MPs to have a say on a second referendum has been a focal point  a fate the betting markets place at around 38  at this juncture  source  Oddschecker   Indeed  it seems something is brewing in the Commons that will involve MPs actually having a say on what they want  and not what they don t want to see  and if we are truly going to see progress  then it needs to evolve through next week 
Observing from the other side of the world  it seems that UK politics is genuinely broken  and there is no such thing as right and left politics  just Brexit or Remain  and differing degrees of this 
AUDUSD has also held a tight range  but the risks are skewed to the downside in my opinion  The market should start to focus on the 5 February RBA meeting  and whether the RBA statement moves closer to the 46  chance of a cut currently priced over the coming 12 months in the swaps market  We get Aussie jobs on Thursday local time  with NAB business confidence and Q4 CPI next week  These could be influential on whether the RBA offers a more dovish assessment on policy  The move implied from options pricing  expiring 5th February  is 104 points from the current spot  and while there is time premium involved here  the market sees the move capped into 0 7050 to 0 7250 is this fair ",Chris Weston,0.06,0.846,0.094,0.9879
CAT,2019-01-24,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Caterpillar is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CAT in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  3 00 per share for CAT  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 99 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CAT  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  0 30  heading into earnings season Caterpillar Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that CAT has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Caterpillar  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,Zacks Investment Research,0.004,0.866,0.131,0.9833

What s Next for Caterpillar 
While Caterpillar has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Caterpillar was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

CAT,2019-01-28,"Investing com   Saudi attempts to talk up its production cuts and play down the Venezuelan crisis  which many had counted on to be a bastion of support for oil this week  seems to be backfiring 
New York traded West Texas Intermediate and London s Brent crude fell as much as 4  on Monday before settling off their lows  after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih told Russia s RIA news agency that political turmoil in Venezuela has so far had zero impact on global oil markets  He instead re emphasized Saudi output cuts  which he said were above Riyadh s original commitments 
 WTI settled down  1 70  or 3 2   at  51 99 per barrel  after a session low at  51 34 
Brent  the global oil benchmark  fell by  1 80  or 2 9   to  59 79 per barrel by 2 45 PM ET  19 45 GMT  
Adding to oil s pressure was the slide in Wall Street s equities indexes  which fell by more than 1  each on worries that China s worsening economic slowdown was eating into corporate profits of firms such as  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  
Separately  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro s decision to stall the expulsion of U S  diplomats from the country has also cooled some tensions between Caracas and Washington  weighing on oil prices too  Oil prices recovered slightly in after hours trading on Monday  after the Trump administration announced sanctions against Venezuela s state owned oil firm PDVSA to pressure Maduro to step aside for Juan Guaido  the opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week 
Although Venezuela only ships only about 500 000 barrels per day to the United States    less than 10 percent of the 5 million bpd of imports averaged by American refiners    its heavier grade crude is essential for producing diesel and other transportation fuels in the U S  While the United States produces about 12 million bpd of crude on its own  that is mostly of the light crude variant meant for making gasoline 
Saudi Energy Minister Falih  responding to a question on Caracas  said he saw no need to take additional measures on the oil market because of the situation in Venezuela 
So  there would be no necessity for OPEC to retreat from the production cuts it had embarked on since December to bring supply demand back into balance 
WTI is up 22  from Christmas Eve lows of  42 36 mainly because of OPEC cuts  although recent volatility had reduced year to date gains to around 13  from highs of nearly 20  
To reinforce his point  Falih told a separate interview with Bloomberg Television that Saudi Arabia will pump oil for six months at levels  well below  the voluntary production limit it accepted under OPEC s oil cuts accord   January production will be 10 2 million barrels per day and February will be 10 1 million versus the original 10 33 million volunteered by the Saudis in December 
Falih said the global oil output deal would need to be reassessed in March April and hoped its impact would be  more than a hundred percent  by then ",Investing.com,0.107,0.83,0.064,-0.9712

CAT,2019-01-29,"The European market  Stoxx 600  closed around 354 38 Monday  slumped by almost  0 97  on China slowdown concern and subdued earning cues   guidance from Wall Street  China s December industrial  corporate  profit dips for the 2nd consecutive month and the slowest pace of yearly growth since 1990  in another sign of an economic slowdown  China s industrial profits for December fell by a more than expected 1 9   the second monthly decline and a figure that brings the 2018 tally to 10 3   almost halved compared to 2017 
The industrial bellwether Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and chipmaker Nvidia reported subdued earnings and issued lower than expected guidance due to a lingering slowdown in China and other APC region  Overall  the market is concerned about not only China slowdown  but the downgrade of corporate earnings in the days ahead as a significant part of their earnings are China dependent 
Chinese consumers are now probably spending next to its US peers and thus any slowdown in China is causing a global alarm  Europe is also very sensitive to China  being one of the largest trading partners and thus any China  cold  is also causing  high fever  in Europe  Central banks from Fed to ECB are all watching China closely  Draghi also hoped for China recovery in the days ahead in a speech Monday  But the European market sentiment was further dragged after Draghi said the Eurozone economy has performed worse than expected in recent months 
The European market was supported by a rebound in telecoms  bargain hunting after few days of plunge  and miners on hopes of rising iron ore prices following the dam collapse at the Vale mine in Brazil  while it was dragged by banks  techs  automobiles and energies  as oil tumbled on China global growth worries and higher US supplies  
On early Tuesday  Stoxx 600 is currently trading around 356 30  surged by almost  0 54  on defensive push such as utilities  consumer goods amid subdued earnings report card and lingering China cold trade war tensions  Earlier Stoxx 600 made a low of 354 20 on a report that the US has leveled serious criminal charges against China s telecom giant Huawei and issued a formal extradition request to Canada for the Huawei CFO Meng just days before the next round of talks between the two warring nations 
The US prosecutors have charged Huawei lied to bank executives about its relationship with a company in Iran called Skycom  falsely asserting that it was not an affiliate of the larger company  In a pair of cases unsealed Monday  Federal prosecutors accused Huawei of violating the US sanctions on Iran and of stealing trade secrets from a US business partner  portraying the company for flouting to US laws while trying to do business in the country 
Overall  this may be coincidental  but Trump may be trying to use the Huawei CFO Meng as a leverage for the China trade talks  which could jeopardize the whole trade negotiations

CAT,2019-01-29,"The much anticipated U S  sanctions on Venezuelan oil are in  What hasn t emerged is the rally many had expected from the throttling of heavy  sulfur laden crude supply which American refiners need for producing diesel and other transportation fuels 
In Tuesday s early trade  the world s two most prominent oil futures benchmarks the U S  West Texas Intermediate and London s Brent were both up less than half a percentage point in Singapore  That global oil prices couldn t see meaningful gains despite U S  companies being banned from doing business with Venezuela s state oil firm PDVSA speaks volumes about the expected impact of the sanctions 

The absence of a major rally was even more startling considering Monday s crash of 3 percent in both WTI and Brent futures  A commensurate recovery in Tuesday s futures trade would have justified the perceived shortage of  sour  crude in the market that refiners in the U S  Gulf Coast of Mexico in particular counted on Venezuela for 
Multiple Mitigating Factors
But as it stands  multiple mitigating factors may prevent oil bulls from getting the payday they expect from the political crisis unfolding in Caracas 
Chief among them  said Phil Davis  founder of PSW Investments in New York  was the outlook for the global economy  which was deteriorating faster than any supply tightness in oil created by OPEC production cuts 
Monday s slump in oil prices came as profits at Chinese industrial firms contracted in December for a second straight month  amplifying weak signals from the world s second biggest economy right after a dire global outlook posted by the International Monetary Fund  Beijing also reported a week ago that its economy grew at the slowest pace in nearly 30 years in 2018  U S  companies that manufacture in China  such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   meanwhile  issued profit warnings 
Anemic Demand
Davis added 

 The result of all these is anemic demand for oil as a whole  right from gasoline to diesel and aviation oil to railroad fuels  In the U S   you won t see major holiday travel until Memorial Day  which means slower gas business at pumps  There won t be any inordinate trucking activity to deliver holiday packages  So  while there may be a shortage of sour crude for making diesel  actual demand for diesel itself is much lower than what s required for a sustained rally in oil  

Despite output cuts by Saudi Arabia  Russia and other members of the enlarged OPEC  producer club since December  the world isn t exactly short of oil 
The International Energy Agency said in September global supplies reached a historic 100 million bpd in August  U S  gasoline stockpiles hit record highs last week and the American Petroleum Institute cautioned that those inventories  could approach burdensome levels   weighing further on pump prices that have barely recovered from last year s 40 percent slump despite a 15 percent rebound year to date in WTI futures 
Venezuela Still Free To Export Outside The U S 
One countervailing effect to the sanctions announced by the Trump administration was that while they forbid PDVSA from earning money for exports to the U S   there were no restrictions on the sale of Venezuelan oil to other countries  That means the government of Nicholas Maduro who Washington no longer recognizes as Caracas  legitimate leader is free to redirect its crude 
Due to the country s decade long impoverishment and lack of investment in production  oil exports from Venezuela to the U S  have fallen from 1 2 million barrels per day to less than 500 000 bpd  That accounts for less than 10 percent of total U S  oil exports  standing at anywhere between 5 million and 8 million bpd a week 
U S  Gulf Coast refineries that had relied heavily on Venezuelan oil over the years have tried to turn to  sweet  light crude  as well as medium grade oil  as the supply of sours tightened amid declining production in Mexico and  lately  lower exports from OPEC  Valero  NYSE VLO   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Citgo are among the largest importers of Venezuelan crude in the U S 
Difficulty in sourcing heavier grades led to five year highs in the premium for the sour type Mars Blend versus WTI last week 
Canada  already the largest supplier of all types of oil to the U S   has enough heavy crude but can t ship easily to Gulf Coast refineries due to a lack of pipelines 
Creative Thinking Will Help U S  Refiners Find Alternatives
Yet  Iraq  Colombia and Mexico could redirect some of their heavier oil blends to the U S  if Venezuela tries to sell to Asian customers due to the U S  ban 
All this proves one thing  with some creative thinking and planning  refiners can make do with the new sanctions 
The American Fuel   Petrochemical Manufacturers  which represents 95 percent of the refining sector  is already indicating this after it barely opposed Washington s sanctions against the PDVSA on Tuesday  while it had lobbied hard in the past against any attempts to restrict Venezuelan oil supplies 
Last But Not Least  The Trump Factor
Given the abundant supplies of gasoline in the market  it is unlikely that U S  pump prices will shoot up much from the sanctions 
Of course  all this could change if Maduro remains in power much longer than anticipated  blocking the ascension of opposition leader Juan Guaido  whom Washington recognizes as Caracas  new leader 
Should crude futures begin to rally sharply from the crisis  there s always the possibility that President Donald Trump  whose disdain for high oil prices is well known  could issue a new round of sanction waivers for Iranian oil to tamp the market down  like last year

sales decline to unfavorable currency impact The U S  China trade war that commenced in July last year affected both countries  economies and reflected on Q4 earnings  American companies operating in

Invest in Alternative Mutual Funds Alternative funds not only aim to diversify your portfolio and limit risks but also generate steady returns in times of financial downturns  These funds primarily invest in three types of funds namely long short equity funds  trading leveraged equity funds and market neutral  equity funds aim to profit from strategically investing in overvalued and undervalued stocks  regardless of the market scenario  Undervalued stocks  or stocks that are expected to gain  are bought for long term positions while overvalued stocks  or stocks that are expected to decline  are subjected to short selling Trading leveraged equity funds seek to generate profitable returns that equal fixed multiples of the short term returns of a financial index  These funds are called leveraged equity funds because they use borrowed capital to increase the returns on the investment Market neutral funds have the objective to provide positive returns and reduce risk by opting for diversification in all market environments  The goal is achieved by taking paired long and short positions  Long position is taken on outperforming stocks and short position is taken on the underperforming stock  Gains harnessed by market neutral funds are based on price changes of the stocks involved and not market movements  thus market neutral   Read more on Alternative Mutual Funds

Key Events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 rebounded from an early slide this morning  while European shares remained under pressure from weak corporate results and conflicting headlines on U S  China trade negotiations 
The STOXX 600 swung between gains and losses in a tumultuous opening session  it opened around 0 1 percent lower following a mixed Asian session tracking mixed reports about the outlook of trade talks  The pan European index then jumped into positive territory  nearing 4 month highs  thanks to a Reuters report that Chinese and U S  negotiators were nearing some draft commitments on a number of the most contentious issues of their 11 month old trade dispute 
Later  however  poor earnings reports pushed the benchmark back below opening levels  Technically  should the price close at the current weak levels  it would form a shooting star  bearish in an uptrend 
British multinational energy and services firm Centrica  LON CNA  underperformed  plunging 11 percent  after it warned the recently introduced national energy price cap will squeeze cash flow and hurt its financials this year 
Meanwhile  Danish Moeller   Maersk  CO MAERSKb   the world s largest shipping company  tumbled 8 7 percent even after meeting analyst expectations  after it warned that trade war jitters may hurt future profits  Though we have no real answer  we can t help but wonder why investors would decide that the stock is worth almost 9 percent less  if at the same time they were bidding market prices up based on positive trade headlines 

Yields on 10 year Treasurys jumped  which is typically considered bullish for equities  investors would presumably sell safe haven assets to reinvest in riskier assets  However  we expect yields to fall after they break out to the downside of a symmetrical triangle  bearish in a downtrend  whose top is pressured by the 50 DMA  after the 100 DMA already crossed below the 200 DMA  Such a breakout would be a bearish signal for equities  suggesting a trend in which investors seek safety over growth 
Germany s 10 year yields tracked U S  Treasurys higher  while Japan s 10 year yields fell to their lowest levels since November 2016 when they began a sharp climb after newly elected U S  President Donald Trump revived the stock market s bull spirit  Has Japan s economy lost its momentum 

The greenback gave up an advance against the yuan  sliding for the third day and touching the lowest since mid July  even after coming back from a 0 44 percent decline 
Gold is trading near its highest price since May  It s difficult to attribute the trend to dollar weakness  considering the USD has been on an overall upward trajectory in February and just about 0 6 percent away from the highest level since mid December 
Global Financial Affairs
In yesterday s U S  session  equities edged higher  with the S P 500 eking out a seventh consecutive advance  after minutes from the last Fed monetary policy meeting showed policymakers are looking to halt quantitative tightening later this year  Moreover and in stark contrast with Moeller Maersk s bleak trade war driven outlook Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  jumped after providing a positive view for Chinese demand  boosting the Materials sector 
While bets are rising for a resolution of the U S  China tariffs spat  Fed minutes fell short of lifting equities as much as when Chair Jerome Powell pronounced the words  patience  and  flexible   just a few weeks ago  This could indicate that this time the market narrative had already priced in the central bank s dovish turn 
However  we have been warning of a reversal  The 18   post Christmas U S  stock jump is showing signs of running out of steam  Today s report from Reuters would have been a strong  positive catalyst just a month ago  Conversely  when good news is dismissed so precipitously  any bit of bad news threatens to throw the stock market into chaos

UBS expects Caterpillar s 2020 earnings to fall 8 percent from 2019  as continued growth in mining and buybacks will not be enough to offset headwinds in construction and oil   gas   The firm cut its earnings estimates for both 2020 and 2021 
These earnings declines  Fisher wrote  were not priced into the stock  and  we expect downward earnings revisions to pressure the stock over the next 12 months

CAT,2019-03-18,"By Timothy Aeppel  Reuters    U S  makers of bulldozers and other heavy equipment are raising prices  losing sales and in some cases beginning to trim workers in response to the Trump administration s protracted trade disputes with various countries  according to a new report  Advocates of tariffs point to continued job growth and low overall inflation as proof that tariffs are not harming these manufacturers  which include global producers such as  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   Alamo Group Inc and Terex Corp  But an economic analysis conducted on behalf the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and set to be released on Monday by IHS Markit  notes that increased costs and the disruption of supply chains will slowly filter through the overall economy  gradually raising prices for finished goods and curbing employment over the next decade  Scott Hazelton  a co author of the report  said tariffs will increase the cost of producing off road equipment in the U S  between 6 percent to 7 percent over the period   Caterpillar  a key component of the Dow  has said tariffs cost the company  100 million last year  The study notes heavy equipment makers are particularly exposed to higher steel prices  Accounting for all steel used   both directly by these manufacturers and the parts they buy from others   the material represents 18 5 percent of the cost of a farm machine and 25 8 percent for mining machines   If you re a domestic producer  you re caught between eating a cost increase or raising prices and potentially losing business   Hazelton said  Gradall Industries Inc is among those getting hit at both ends of their business  The company  a subsidiary of Alamo Group Inc  has seen the price of massive metal castings it imports from China go up by 25 percent due to tariffs  for instance  on top of higher domestic steel prices   Mike Haberman  president of Gradall  said they raised prices twice last year in response to higher cost imports and steel  Meanwhile   our exports to China are down 30 to 40 percent   said Haberman  due to retaliatory tariffs China slapped on imports of Gradall s machines and the economic slowdown in that country  The Section 232 tariffs imposed by Washington hit most foreign suppliers of metals  which have prompted retaliatory duties from many of those countries  Haberman said he has not shed workers yet  but stopped hiring last year  Other companies  however  are beginning to eye job cuts   John Garrison  chief executive of Terex  said he plans to start reducing headcount in one of his business lines this year  but declined to specify which sector or the number of jobs that might be cut   The company has three segments   aerial work platforms  cranes and material processing machines

CAT,2019-04-01,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Caterpillar in Focus
Headquartered in Deerfield  Caterpillar  CAT  is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of 10 37  so far this year  The construction equipment company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 86 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 45   This compares to the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry s yield of 1 17  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 44 is up 4 9  from last year  In the past five year period  Caterpillar has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 5   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Caterpillar s payout ratio is 31   which means it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  CAT expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  12 24 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 09  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  CAT presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",Zacks Investment Research,0.025,0.768,0.207,0.998

CAT,2019-04-07,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Caterpillar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 53  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 23  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Caterpillar  current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 17 08 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 62  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Caterpillar has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 51  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Caterpillar s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Caterpillar has a P S ratio of 1 51  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 31 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Caterpillar currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Caterpillar a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Caterpillar is just 0 74  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 84  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Caterpillar might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of F  This gives CAT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen one upward and one downward revision in the past sixty days  whereas the next year estimate has also seen one upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has declined 0 41  in the past two months  while the next year estimate declined by 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Caterpillar Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCaterpillar is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among top 17  of more than 250 industries  instils our confidence However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling

CAT,2019-04-16,"Caterpillar  CAT  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction equipment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 7  
Revenues are expected to be  13 40 billion  up 4 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Caterpillar 
For Caterpillar  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 82  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Caterpillar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Caterpillar would post earnings of  2 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 55  delivering a surprise of  14 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Caterpillar doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",Zacks Investment Research,0.058,0.789,0.153,0.998

CAT,2019-05-02,"By Timothy Aeppel CLAYTON  N C   Reuters     Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT  on Thursday provided investors with details on its push to grow its services business while also laying out dividend increases and more consistent share repurchases in the coming years   The heavy machinery maker is looking to smooth volatility in its earnings by selling more parts and services  and said it intends to grow services revenue to  28 billion by 2026  up from  18 billion in 2018 and double what it was in 2016  Deerfield  Illinois based Caterpillar s main customers are in businesses like mining and construction  which are prone to wide swings with the business cycle    Services will help dampen the impact of cycles  but we will never be immune from the cycle   Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said at an investor meeting at a Caterpillar equipment factory in Clayton  North Carolina  Last week the company said about 850 000 of its machines are connected to the cloud  which it sees as a way to sell services to customers  That should grow to 1 million machines by year end  Bob De Lange  group president of services  distribution and digital  said on Thursday  New Caterpillar machines are dotted with sensors that allow close monitoring and can warn when parts are about to fail  Caterpillar makes most of its service income from selling spare parts  according to industry analysts  New digital offerings  such as monitoring services that help track the health of machines  are a small but growing revenue source  Umpleby said the company s network of dealers  which it relies on to deliver and service machines  are participating in the services push and will also see added profits  though he declined to elaborate on that split  He emphasized  however  that the added revenue target for 2026 is for Caterpillar only  The services business  spread across the company s construction  resource and energy   transportation units  contributed about 33 percent to Caterpillar s  54 7 billion revenue in 2018  The company announced it will pay a dividend of  1 03 per share  up 20 percent from its previous payout  on Aug  20 to shareholders at the close of business on July 22  It is targeting at least high single digit dividend increases in each of the next four years and plans to buy back shares more consistently  Last week  Caterpillar had spooked investors when it reported first quarter results that showed rising costs hitting margins in its construction equipment business and weak sales in the Asia Pacific region linked to slow growth in China  Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said on Thursday that tariffs would cost the company  250 million to  350 million in 2019 if there was no relief   Still  he said Caterpillar is  cautiously optimistic  there will be a resolution of the trade dispute with China  Caterpillar has raised prices to offset some of the higher costs and pushed efficiency moves at its far flung network of factories   The company now has a target for adjusted operating margins of 3 to 6 percentage points above historical performance from 2010 to 2016

CAT,2019-05-08,"By Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao BEIJING  Reuters    China s exports unexpectedly shrank in April but imports surprised with their first increase in five months  painting a mixed picture of the economy as Washington ratchets up pressure on Beijing with threats of more punishing tariffs   The latest trade data  which would normally be pored over for clues on how the world s second largest economy is faring  has been overshadowed by worries that the U S  China trade war is escalating  rather than nearing a resolution as many investors had expected   High level Chinese and U S  negotiators will meet in Washington in the next two days  as Beijing tries to avoid a sharp increase in tariffs on its goods ordered by President Donald Trump to take effect from Friday  Investors have been hoping that China s April trade data would add to signs that its economy is beginning to steady  easing worries about cooling global growth  But exports fell 2 7 percent from a year earlier  customs data showed on Wednesday  ANZ estimated more than 80 percent of the headline decline was due to a sharp drop in shipments to the United States  while its high tech exports continued to be weighed down by sluggish global demand for smartphones and other electronic gadgets  Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth to slow to 2 3 percent after March s surprising 14 2 percent jump  which some analysts suspected was inflated by seasonal factors and temporary business distortions related to a cut in the value added tax  VAT  effective April 1   The outlook for Chinese exports is challenging  If Trump follows through on his latest tariff threats  we think this would drag down export growth by two to three percentage points   Capital Economics said in a note   Even if a last minute deal is struck this week to avoid further tariffs  the downbeat prospects for global growth will probably mean that export growth remains subdued   POSITIVE IMPORT SURPRISE Imports  however  beat expectations with a 4 0 percent rise year on year  much better than analysts  forecasts for a 3 6 percent fall and March s 7 6 percent drop  The gain was the first since November  suggesting domestic demand is starting to perk up as Beijing rolls out more stimulus  such as higher spending on roads  railways and ports  Imports of copper  widely used in construction and manufacturing  rose from March  but were down on year   China s major trading partners  big multinational suppliers like  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  and global investors have been closely watching to see how long it will take support measures announced in recent months to take hold  Tang Jianwei  a senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai  said China stands to lose in either case   If there is a set back in trade talks  both external demand and domestic demand could be hit  If the U S  and China reach a trade deal  China will have to step up imports form the U S   which will reduce its trade surplus  which will reduce net exports  contribution to GDP growth   he said  China had an overall trade surplus of  13 84 billion in April  smaller than forecasts of  35 billion  Its trade surplus with the United States  a major irritant for Washington  widened to  21 01 billion in April  from  20 5 billion in March  China s imports from the U S  fell nearly 26 percent while exports to the U S  fell just over 13 percent   TRADE TURNABOUT   Some analysts believe recent signs of improvement in both the Chinese and American economies may have hardened their negotiating positions on trade after months of progress made when the business outlook appeared much more shaky  China posted surprisingly strong data for March  but initial April readings have been more subdued  suggesting the economy is still struggling for traction   Factory surveys for April suggested demand was improving at a much slower rate at home and abroad  adding to the debate over how much more stimulus China needs to generate a sustainable recovery  without risking a rapid jump in debt   Weak growth in Chinese exports to the U S  will also be concerning to Chinese officials  particularly amid a potential escalation in the trade war   said Nick Marro  an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit   The data will add more urgency to the trade negotiations this week and could push China more forcefully towards an agreement  despite its past reluctance to negotiate under threat   Top U S  trade officials said China had backtracked on substantial commitments it made earlier in trade talks  That prompted Trump to issue a new deadline of Friday to raise tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent  Trump also threatened new levies soon  The swift deterioration in negotiations between the world s two largest economies has jolted global financial markets  which had been increasingly betting that a deal would be reached soon  Major stock indexes in trade reliant Asia continued to fall on Wednesday  tracking a slide on Wall Street  
 Today s exports data support our view that there is real risk of double dip in growth  and Beijing cannot afford to stop easing  policy  yet  With the rapid escalation of the trade conflict with the U S   we believe Beijing will likely step up easing measures again   Nomura analysts wrote in a note ",Reuters,0.102,0.752,0.146,0.9914
CAT,2019-05-08,The Zacks  industry primarily includes companies which manufacture and sell construction  mining  and utility equipment  The industry participants serve a diverse range of customers utilizing machinery in infrastructure  forestry  heavy and general construction  surface and underground mining operations  The industry also provides support for oil and gas  power generation  marine  rail and industrial applications Let us take a look at the three major themes currently governing the industry  The implementation of tariffs on steel imports into the United States last year dealt a severe blow to the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  Given that steel is a primary raw material  every company involved in manufacturing bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to the tariffs  Though this can be mitigated to some extent with price increases  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  Further  the industry has been plagued with shortage of skilled laborers  higher wage costs and flaring up transportation expenses for quite some time now  Supply chain challenges stemming from lead time expansions and elevated freight charges may continue to aggravate costs and dent profits of these companies in the near term  Per the Institute for Supply Management s latest report  Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  for April rose 52 8    exhibiting strong growth in manufacturing for the 32nd consecutive month  The upbeat performance continues to be led by strong production output and persistent strength in new orders  signaling strong economic momentum  The PMI has remained above 50 since the beginning of 2018  Notably  a reading above 50  indicates expansion in manufacturing economy  Over the last 12 months  PMI has averaged 57 2   Moreover  U S  manufacturing companies are now hiring more and offering relatively higher wages in the market  Continued improvement in residential and non residential construction  and revival in infrastructure demand bode well for the industry  Mining companies are also resuming capital spending on the back of rising commodity prices  Notably  oil and gas extraction is driving improvement in the mining sector  Further  the recently passed tax reform is likely to act as a catalyst by expediting manufacturing investment in factories  new equipment and other capital goods  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy prospects in the near term  The Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  which is part of the broader  Sector currently  carries a Zacks Industry Rank  224  which places it at the bottom 12  of 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since the beginning of this year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has declined 3  Despite the bleak near term prospects  we will present a few Manufacturing   Construction And Mining stocks that one can retain given their growth prospects  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation first Industry Underperforms

CAT,2019-06-09,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Caterpillar in Focus
Headquartered in Deerfield  Caterpillar  CAT  is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of  2 05  so far this year  The construction equipment company is paying out a dividend of  0 86 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 76  compared to the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry s yield of 1 5  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 44 is up 4 9  from last year  Caterpillar has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Caterpillar s current payout ratio is 30   This means it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  CAT expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  12 25 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 18  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  CAT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",Zacks Investment Research,0.019,0.777,0.204,0.9981

U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said yesterday he doesn t expect a trade resolution even if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping do meet at the G 20 summit in Osaka this month  according to the Wall Street Journal  As well  the South China Morning Post reports that Caterpillar could be subject to tighter Chinese security and environmental reviews if the country hits back at U S  tariffs  former commerce vice minister Wei Jianguo says 
Indeed  Caterpillar already expects to lose between  250  and  350 million in 2019 on current tariffs  even before any  tighter Chinese security and environmental reviews   This negative outlook is already being reflected in the stock s technical chart

CAT,2019-06-24,"It s probably the most difficult time to predict the future direction of the U S  stock markets  Despite the myriad powerful headwinds gathering  which could hurt companies  profitability and future growth  stock investors  in general  are choosing to ignore the warning signs  instead  preferring to view the glass as half full 
Stocks have continued to show strength in June with the S P 500 advancing 6  month to date by Friday s close  although trade tensions between the U S  and China linger and there are some clear indications that the U S  engine of growth is losing its steam  And yet  the S P 500 surged to a fresh record Thursday while the blue chip Dow index sits 0 4  from its October closing high 
If you re skeptical about this one sided market view  then take a cue from the top industrial stocks that provide early warning signals when things are turning bad  We ve picked two industrial giants to understand if the recent strength in the market is backed by economic fundamentals 
1  3M  Weakness Across the Board
Shares of 3M Company  NYSE MMM   one of the world s largest industrial conglomerates  remain in a bear market after peaking in early 2018  Since January 2018 the stock has fallen more than 23  and there s little hope it will recover from this slump soon  Down 8 5  since the start of the year  the shares closed Friday s session at  173 22 

The Minnesota based maker of things from Post its to air filters and touch screens reported in April its biggest quarterly earnings miss by far in recent memory  Sales fell 5  year over year to  7 9 billion in the first quarter  a worse than expected outcome  Adjusted profit fell too  and the company lowered its outlook for the year 
That weakness was broad based  suggesting demand for its industrial products is getting hit from all directions  with a drop in operating income across all five business units 
Sales in its electronics group  which makes products such as films for LCD screens  fell almost 12   hurt by slowing smartphone demand  The automotive segment suffered as car makers cut production and inventory  To deal with this sharp slowdown  3M is tightening its belt and eliminating 2 000 jobs  suggesting any turnaround won t be coming soon 
For the quarter ending in June  analysts are expecting a 19  decline in earnings per share to  2 09 on sales of  8 04 billion 
2  Caterpillar  An Economic Bellwether Struggling
The shares of powerful mining and construction equipment maker  Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT   are under pressure on concerns that the company won t be able to escape the slowdown  Though they ve gained 6 6  since January  closing Friday at  133 9  they re down more than 4  since this time last year and the future isn t looking very rosy 

In its most recent earnings report  Caterpillar said inventories were building up  while earnings were hurt by declining market share and  aggressive pricing  from China 
UBS  in a recent note  downgraded Caterpillar stock  saying more than half of the company s end markets will  peak  in 2019   pressuring revenue and margins in 2020 as demand declines  
The weak prospects from Caterpillar  considered an economic bellwether  are in line with the latest global economic forecasts from the IMF and OECD  Both institutions have cut their projections for major economies in 2019 amid geopolitical and trade tensions 
Bottom Line
The warnings from some of the largest industrial companies this year demonstrate that the recent show of strength by U S  markets lacks depth and is mainly fueled by interest rate expectations  A powerful rally in so called defensive stocks  such as utilities  consumer staples and real estate  also supports this argument  These are the areas of the markets that investors turn to when the future becomes murkier 
The current market rally  in our view  is built on shaky ground and can t be sustained unless we see more cyclical areas  such as industrials  taking part in this upward move  Investors should tread very carefully in this uncertain environment ",Haris Anwar/Investing.com,0.123,0.79,0.087,-0.9708

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  CAT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",Zacks Investment Research,0.019,0.779,0.202,0.998
CAT,2019-07-19,"Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   is a company that has had somewhat of a quiet year  with shares up 7 7  year to date  The company has managed to make some gains but nothing eye opening  Nonetheless  Caterpillar has been able to provide returns for its shareholders in a time filled with economic uncertainty  Caterpillar  along with other companies such as Merck   NYSE MRK    Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    and IBM   NYSE IBM    to name a few  are especially susceptible to the ongoing trade conflict between the world s two largest economies  the U S  and China  China is said to make up between 5  and 10  of Caterpillar s sales  particularly in hydraulic excavators and demolition vehicles  The company benefited from the bullish sentiment that followed the G20 summit where the U S  and China agreed to halt tariffs while trade deal talks resumed 
Overview 
Caterpillar is the world s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment  Their CAT branded bulldozers  steamrollers  and excavators have become staples of the construction community  The company also manufactures diesel natural gas engines and industrial gas turbines  Caterpillar is based in Deerfield  Illinois and operates in six segments of which four are reportable segments  The Machinery  Energy and Transportation segment accounted for 90  of the company s total revenue in 2018  Resource Industries services consumers using machinery in mining  heavy construction  and other applications  The company s Financial Products sector accounted for 10  of its total revenue in 2018 
In early June  Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby expressed his confidence in the company despite the ongoing trade war  Umpleby stated that  We ve navigated trade tensions in our 94 year history  this is not new for us   The Caterpillar CEO went on to assure that the company would still manage to hit their forecast despite the trade tensions  The company is poised on getting through the rough trade landscape unscathed  and has been focusing its efforts on improving operating margins and building its services business  In May of this year  Caterpillar announced its plans to double down on its digital capabilities  The company now has 850 000 connected machines and engines around the world  which is a 70  increase from its 2017 levels 
Q2 Outlook and Earnings Trends 
Caterpillar was able to bring in  13 47 billion in total revenues for the first quarter of 2019  CAT s construction industries brought in  5 87 billion while the resource industries brought in  2 73 billion  which was a 18  year over year jump  The Machinery  Energy and Transportation sector all together brought in  12 72 billion and Financial Products brought in the other  742 million  The company was able to surpass our revenue estimate by 0 5   and its reported EPS of  2 94 surpassed our estimates by 3 52   Caterpillar has been able to beat our Consensus Estimates three out of the past four quarters for an average EPS surprise of 0 45  
For Q2  our Consensus Estimates are forecasting the manufacturer s bottom line to jump 5 05  to  3 12  and projecting revenues to reach  14 52 billion  a 3 66  hike  Estimates are calling for the construction industry revenue to increase 7 8  to  6 33 billion  with resource revenues increasing to  2 76 billion for the current quarter  Machinery  Energy and Power is expected to jump 8 5  to  13 8 billion  and financial product revenues estimates are projecting  756 million for Q2  Estimate revisions have been moving in the right direction for the company lately with two out of three revisions calling for an increase  

Bottom Line 
Caterpillar is a company that has not let the trade war uncertainty hinder their optimistic outlook  The company is looking to follow up their sound first quarter where they were able to report an EPS increase of 4  and a revenue increase of 5  year over year  Last quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter that the company was able to report top and bottom line growth  With Jim Umpleby at the helm  the company has been able to string together some solid performances that has changed the dynamic of Caterpillar

CAT,2019-07-22,"Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  is a stock I have posted on over the years  and in particular ahead of the the U S  election when I suggested it would be one to benefit from a Trump win  which was indeed the case  with the stock duly rising from  90 per share to ultimately top out at  173 24 per share last year on a large upthrust candle on high volume  classic volume price analysis  
Since then it has weakened and moved into an extended congestion phase on the monthly chart as the price action continues to trade within the spread of the dramatic volatility candle of October last year  Last month s price action completed a two bar reversal with a well defined platform of support now in place at  112 per share  Above  the ceiling of resistance at  144 per share and denoted with the red dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator is now in play having capped the advance of earlier in the year  Therefore  for an extended rally to develop this level needs to be breached with good volume  as does the secondary level at  158 per share which would then open the way to the stock regaining the  170 per share level in the longer term  And with earnings due on the 24th July with a forecast EPS of  3 12 this could provide the catalyst for a move away from the current congestion phase 
A further factor to consider is Caterpillar s status as a bellwether for the global economy making it particularly sensitive to the current Sino U S  trade tariff talks which to date appear to be drifting and perhaps reflect the present consolidation phase of price action for this stock ",Anna Coulling,0.008,0.883,0.11,0.9766
CAT,2019-07-24,"Caterpillar  CAT  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 83 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 12 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 97 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  9 29   A quarter ago  it was expected that this construction equipment company would post earnings of  2 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 94  delivering a surprise of 3 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Caterpillar  which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  posted revenues of  14 43 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 64   This compares to year ago revenues of  14 01 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Caterpillar shares have added about 8 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Caterpillar 
While Caterpillar has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Caterpillar was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 08 on  14 01 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  12 22 on  56 91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Manufacturing   Construction and Mining is currently in the bottom 36  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",Zacks Investment Research,0.009,0.903,0.088,0.9897
CAT,2019-07-24,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points While most companies are beating estimates  the tone and substance of management commentary is on the cautious side  with uncertainty about global trade a notable headwind  Total earnings for the 138 S P 500 members that have reported Q2 results already are up  2 8  on  3 4  higher revenues  with 79 0  beating EPS estimates and 59 4  beating revenue estimates  The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 138 index members is unsurprisingly very weak relative to other recent periods  The proportion of these index members beating EPS estimates is about in line with historical trends  but positive revenue surprises are modestly on the low side   For the Finance sector  we now have Q2 results from 54 5  of the sector s market cap in the index  Total earnings for these Finance companies are up  4 1  on  3 2  higher revenues  with 71 8  beating EPS estimates and 66 7  beating revenue estimates  The most notable part of the Finance sector results thus far is the favorable momentum on the revenue front  both in terms of growth as well as surprises  Looking at Q2 as a whole  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down  1 3  from the year earlier period on  4 0  higher revenues  This would follow the  0 1  earnings decline on  4 5  higher revenues in Q1  Q2 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Basic Materials and Conglomerates as double digit decliners  while Technology  and Construction are expected to fall nearly  9  With a number companies guiding lower  estimates for the current period  2019 Q3  are coming down  with earnings growth for the period currently expected to be a decline of  2 5  on  4 4  higher revenues  For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q2 results from 76 index members  Total earnings for these 76 companies are down  5 7  from the same period last year on  2 7  higher revenues  with 68 4  beating EPS estimates and 63 2  beating revenue estimates  Looking at the quarter as a whole for the small cap index  total Q2 earnings are expected to be  11 3  below the year earlier level on  3 0  higher revenues  This compares to  18 2  decline in Q1 earnings on  4 3  higher revenues  For full year 2019  total earnings for the S P 500 index are now barely in positive territory  up  0 3  on  2 3  higher revenues  This would follow the  23 3  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Strong growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings expected to be up  10 2  that year  The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 18 5X and index close  as of July 23rd  is  162 44  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  179 99 for 2020  P E of 16 8X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  
Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of July 24th  2019 
 We now have Q2 results from 138 S P 500 members that combined account for 35 7  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 138 index members are up 2 8  from the same period last year on  3 4  higher revenues  with 79 0  beating EPS estimates and 59 4  beating revenue estimates 
The comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context 
 
 
 
The earnings and revenue growth for these 138 index members is modestly below what we saw from this same sample of results in the preceding period  The growth pace is materially below what we had seen in earlier periods  but we knew that already 
Positive EPS surprises are about in line with historical trends  while revenue beats percentages are modestly below historical levels  It is reasonable to interpret these results as suggesting that estimates were likely reasonable ahead of the start of this reporting cycle 
Importantly  a number of major companies have guided lower for the current and coming quarters  If this trend continues  we will likely a bigger drop in estimates for Q3 than we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season  
The trade issue has become a recurring theme  with Caterpillar  CAT  becoming the latest operator to cite this as a reason lowered guidance  We earlier saw JPMorgan  JPM  and other major banks explain the tepid growth in corporate lending as partly due to corporate clients holding back on their spending plans as a result of the trade uncertainty  Railroad operator CSX Corp   CSX  had earlier lowered its outlook for the year as the company expected shipping volumes from its industrial customers to remain under pressure as a result of the trade overhang 
Estimates for the current period  2019 Q3  have been steadily coming down  as the chart below shows 
 
 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings and revenue growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 3 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the March quarter  actually down  0 1   and the expectation is for a  1 3  decline in the June quarter  Earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory in Q3 as well  down  2 5    with positive growth expected to resume only in last quarter of the year 
Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons due to the huge boost to profitability in the year earlier period  The chart below puts earnings growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for the second half of the year and beyond hold or come down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant downward adjustments to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  But with many companies citing the issue as a reason for their lowered guidance  we will likely see an acceleration in negative revisions in the coming days

CAT,2019-07-28,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Caterpillar in Focus
Based in Deerfield  Caterpillar  CAT  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 4 6   Currently paying a dividend of  1 03 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 1   In comparison  the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry s yield is 1 43   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 87  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 12 is up 25 6  from last year  In the past five year period  Caterpillar has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 4 17   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Caterpillar s current payout ratio is 30   This means it paid out 30  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  CAT expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 79 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 08  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  CAT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",Zacks Investment Research,0.012,0.801,0.187,0.9977

Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of July 31st  2019 
We now have Q2 results from 305 S P 500 members that combined account for 72 6  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 305 index members are down  3 5  from the same period last year on  4 7  higher revenues  with 77 7  beating EPS estimates and 57 7  beating revenue estimates 
The comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context 
 
 
The earnings for these 305 index members is modestly below what we saw from this same sample of results in the preceding period  while revenue growth is marginally better  The growth pace is materially below what we had seen in earlier periods  but we knew that already 
Positive EPS surprises are about in line with historical trends  while revenue beats percentages are below historical levels  It is reasonable to interpret these results as suggesting that estimates were likely reasonable ahead of the start of this reporting cycle 
Importantly  a number of major companies have guided lower for the current and coming quarters  If this trend continues  we will likely a bigger drop in estimates for Q3 than we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season  
The trade issue has become a recurring theme  with Caterpillar  CAT  becoming the latest operator to cite this as a reason lowered guidance  We earlier saw JPMorgan  JPM  and other major banks explain the tepid growth in corporate lending as partly due to corporate clients holding back on their spending plans as a result of the trade uncertainty  Railroad operator CSX Corp   CSX  had earlier lowered its outlook for the year as the company expected shipping volumes from its industrial customers to remain under pressure as a result of the trade overhang 
Estimates for the current period  2019 Q3  have been steadily coming down  as the chart below shows 
 
 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings and revenue growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 3 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the March quarter  actually down  0 1   and the expectation is for a  4 9  decline in the June quarter  Earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory in Q3 as well  down  3 2    with positive growth expected to resume only in last quarter of the year 
Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons due to the huge boost to profitability in the year earlier period  The chart below puts earnings growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for the second half of the year and beyond hold or come down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant downward adjustments to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  But with many companies citing the issue as a reason for their lowered guidance  we will likely see an acceleration in negative revisions in the coming days

CAT,2019-08-09,"The market is juggling a number of balls  ranging from the seemingly never ending trade tariffs issue to worries about global growth and Fed policy  Treasury bond yields have become an excellent proxy for watching the interplay of all these worries in real time  And the relationship has been fairly straight forward  with the major stock market indexes going down as the yield on the 10 year Treasury bond goes down 
Treasury bond yields have long been a very good proxy for economic growth and inflation outlook  with down trending yields typically indicative of the market s weak growth and inflation outlook  But the current ongoing downtrend in yields has more to do with Treasury bonds  well earned reputation for safety 
These instruments are not only risk free  from a credit risk standpoint   but also extremely liquid that makes it easy to get in and out  Investors  both local as well as foreign  flocking to Treasury bonds as a safety play in the current uncertain environment when the day to day market movement is driven less by fundamentals and more by something as hard to handicap as a Presidential tweet 
I have long been sanguine about the outlook for the U S  economy and the eventual resolution of the trade issue  The way to deal with this situation is to tune out the noise and stay focused on long term fundamentals of profitability  valuation and diversification  using every instance of panicky market selling to pick up quality stocks that are on your watch list  Timing the market is never easy and this has become almost impossible to do in the current topsy turvy environment 
Trade   Earnings 
There is little doubt that tariffs are bad for earnings  There is not only the direct relationship of higher tariffs weighing on margins  but also an indirect effect through reduced corporate confidence weighing on spending and investments 
Companies exposed to international trade have been making this point at every available opportunity this earnings season  from CSX Corp   CSX  and Caterpillar  CAT  to even the big banks like JPMorgan  JPM  and others partly blaming the trade uncertainty for tepid growth in loan portfolios  We will likely hear more about the trade issue from companies reporting this week  ranging from Macy s  M  and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   WMT  to Deere   Co   DE  and chipmakers Nvidia  NVDA  and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AMAT  
In total  we have more than 250 companies reporting results this week  including 11 S P 500 members  By the end of this week  we will have seen Q2 results from 462 companies or 92 4  of the index s total membership  We have a couple of retailers reporting this week  but the earnings focus will solely be on the Retail sector in the coming days 
Our Take on the Q2 Earnings Season
The overall picture emerging from the Q2 earnings season is good enough  not great  but not bad either  The fact that there is not much growth is hardly news to anyone  as we knew all along the very tough comparisons for this quarter  as well as the remainder of this year  Earnings growth was essentially flat in the first quarter of the year and we appear to be on track for a similar performance in Q2 as well 
Here are the key takeaways from the Q2 earnings season after seeing results from 451 S P 500 members through Friday  August 9th 
First  no major surprises on the growth front  which we knew will be anemic  We should keep in mind however that the growth challenge is more a function of tough comparisons to last year s record results than a cyclical downturn in profitability 
Total earnings for the 451 index members that have reported are up  0 7  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues  Earnings and revenue growth for the same cohort of companies had been  0 1  and  4 6  in the preceding earnings season  respectively  In other words  earnings and revenue growth is tracking modestly above what we had seen in the March quarter 
The comparison chart below puts this growth picture in a historical context for these 451 index members 
 
 
 
 
Earnings growth for the quarter was expected to be in negative territory before this earnings season got underway  But the blended growth rate  which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies is for flat growth  0  growth to be precise  on  4 6  revenue growth   This could change as we go through the remainder of this earnings season  But at least at this stage  Q2 growth is even with what we had seen in the preceding quarter 
Second  positive EPS surprises are about in line with historical trends while the proportion of these companies beating revenue estimates is notably on the weaker side 
For the 451 index members that have reported results already  75 6  are beating EPS estimates and 57 4  are beating revenue estimates  For the same cohort of companies  the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises was 77 4  and 61  in the Q1 earnings season 
The comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages in a historical context for these 451 companies 
 
 
 
 
Third  estimates for 2019 Q3 are coming down more than what we saw in the comparable period for the preceding two quarters  but about in line with historical trends  The current  4 1  decline is down from  3 4  last week and  1  in mid June 
The chart below shows how estimates for 2019 Q3 have evolved over the last five weeks 
 
 
 
 
Estimates for full year 2019 are coming down as well  though the magnitude of negative revisions is a lot lower currently than had been the case at the start of the year 
Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of August 9th 
We now have Q2 results from 451 S P 500 members or 90 2  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these companies are up  0 7  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues  with 75 6  beating EPS estimates and 57 4  beating revenue estimates 
For Q2 as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be flat from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  which would follow the  0 1  earnings decline on  4 2  higher revenues in 2019 Q1 
The table below shows the summary picture for Q2  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding earnings season

CAT,2019-08-13,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Caterpillar in Focus
Headquartered in Deerfield  Caterpillar  CAT  is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of  6 34  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 03 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 46   In comparison  the Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry s yield is 1 72   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 92  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  4 12 is up 25 6  from last year  Caterpillar has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4 17   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Caterpillar s current payout ratio is 31   This means it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for CAT for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 72 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 46  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  CAT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",Zacks Investment Research,0.012,0.786,0.202,0.9981
CAT,2019-08-22,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Caterpillar  CAT   Shares have lost about 12 5  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Caterpillar due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s

adjusted earnings per share of  2 83 lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 12  The figure also declined 5  from the prior year quarter s adjusted earnings per share of  2 97  Higher manufacturing costs  lower construction equipment sales in Asia Pacific primarily dragged down by China and weak sales at the company s energy and transportation segment weighed on the results  Following the weaker than expected results  Caterpillar s shares fell 5  in pre market trading  Including one time items  Caterpillar s earnings per share came in at  2 82 in the prior year quarter while there were no such adjustments in the current reported quarter Revenues Lag EstimatesRevenues improved 3  year over year to  14 4 billion in the quarter under review  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  14 5

year quarter figure of  462 million  Operating profit in the quarter was  2 21 billion  up 2  from the prior year quarter   Benefits from favorable price realization and lower SG A and R D expense

Resource Industries   Construction Deliver GrowthMachinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales rose 3  year over year to  13 7 billion  Construction Industries sales rose 5  year over year to a

Latin America remained flat while EAME and Asia Pacific reported declines Sales at Resource Industries improved 11  year over year to  2 8 billion aided by higher equipment demand and favorable price realization  Sales of Energy   Transportation dropped 4  year over year to  5 5 billion due to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts The ME T segment delivered operating profit of  2 18 billion  an improvement of 2  from the year ago quarter  The Resource Industries reported operating profit of  481 million in the second quarter  up 17  from the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and favorable price realization  However  higher manufacturing costs somewhat negated these benefits  Construction Industries  profit improved 8  to a record  1 247 million due to favorable price realization partially offset by higher manufacturing costs  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit declined 12  to  886 million on account of an unfavorable mix of applications and lower volume Financial Products  revenues went up 5  to  873 million  Financial Products  profits were  193 million in the reported quarter  up 44  from  134 million in the prior year

modest sales growth in 2019  which assumes a recovery in Oil and Gas near the end of the year and dealers working through higher machine inventory levels  Price realization will help mitigate manufacturing costs  With a higher amount of restructuring costs incurred in the second quarter of 2019  Caterpillar anticipates restructuring costs for the remainder of the year to be significantly

CAT,2019-09-05,"After heightened tensions related to the US China trade war escalation last month  China announced that its trade officials  with U S  counterparts in Washington early next month  Lower level officials will have  serious  dialogues this month to prepare for the talks  which were initially scheduled for

CAT,2019-09-10,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Caterpillar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 65  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Caterpillar s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 03  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Caterpillar has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 85  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Caterpillar stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Caterpillar has a P S ratio of about 1 34  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 23 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  CAT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Caterpillar currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Caterpillar a solid choice for value investors    What About the Stock Overall    Though Caterpillar might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CAT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen twelve downward revision compared to no upward in the same time period      This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 6 2  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has declined by 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Caterpillar Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Caterpillar is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front   However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 22  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report

Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  Given that steel is a primary raw material in manufacturing  every company bore the brunt of rising steel prices  Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT    CAT   a dominant industry player  resorted to pricing actions and cost control to sustain margins in the wake of the input cost inflation  After exhibiting growth for 35 consecutive months  the U S

second consecutive quarterly decrease  Any positive development on the United States China trade war front will aid the sector s recovery  Mining companies are also resuming capital spending on the back of rising commodity prices  Notably  oil and gas extraction is driving improvement in the mining sector  Continued improvement in residential and non residential construction  and revival in infrastructure demand bode well for the industry  Per Statista  new construction spending in the United States is  to grow from  1 29 trillion in 2018 to  1 45 trillion in by 2023  Residential

For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  11 65 per share and revenue of  55 65 billion  which would represent changes of  3 83  and  1 69   respectively  from the prior year 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for CAT  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 1 06  lower  CAT is holding a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell  right now 
Digging into valuation  CAT currently has a Forward P E ratio of 11 03  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 10 48  so we one might conclude that CAT is trading at a premium comparatively 
It is also worth noting that CAT currently has a PEG ratio of 0 92  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Manufacturing   Construction and Mining was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 06 at yesterday s closing price 
The Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry is part of the Industrial Products sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 101  which puts it in the top 40  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

CAT,2019-10-15,"Caterpillar  CAT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This construction equipment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 83 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  13 38 billion  down 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 54  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Caterpillar 
For Caterpillar  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Caterpillar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Caterpillar would post earnings of  3 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 83  delivering a surprise of  9 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Caterpillar doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",Zacks Investment Research,0.06,0.789,0.151,0.998
CAT,2019-10-15,"Friday s excitement over a mini trade deal was short lived as the President  the Secretary of the Treasury and the Government of China began to backpedal from the initial announcement  The pressure remains on the White House to come to a deal and the Chinese negotiators know this  Not only have the public polls for a House impeachment climbed into the majority  but the U S  economic data continues to deteriorate  And with no trade deal or tariff relief in sight  there is still little reason for CEOs to spend on CapEx and increase hiring

China calls  time out  on phase one and invites the U S  for more talks 
China wants to hold more talks this month to hammer out the details of the  phase one  trade deal touted by Donald Trump before Xi Jinping agrees to sign it  according to people familiar with the matter 
Beijing may send a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He  China s top negotiator  to finalize a written deal that could be signed by the presidents at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next month in Chile  one of the people said  Another person said China also wants Trump to scrap a planned tariff hike in December in addition to the hike scheduled for this week  something the administration hasn t yet endorsed  The people asked not to be named discussing the private negotiations 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  speaking in an interview Monday on CNBC  said he expects officials to work in coming weeks to get the first stage ready for both sides to sign  If that doesn t happen  the new U S  import taxes on Chinese products will be imposed starting Dec  15  he said 
 The U S  must concede on its December tariff threat if they want sign a deal during APEC summit  otherwise it would be a humiliating treaty for China   said Huo Jianguo  a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now vice chairman of the China Society For World Trade Organization Studies   The U S  has definitely shown some good gestures but we shouldn t exclude the possibility of another flip flop

 Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  is becoming more concerned about the credit worthiness of consumers 
 The strength of the US consumer has been the bedrock of the current economic expansion  Just a few weeks ago  in a CNBC interview  Fed Vice Chair Clarida said that  I cannot think of a time where in the aggregate the consumer has been in better shape   While the US consumer s balance sheet is in fine shape overall  mainly because levels of debt and debt servicing costs remain low  there s a segment whose income statements are under stress   rental households with lower income and lower credit scores  How big are they  Not small  at least on one metric  borrowers with FICO scores below 650 account for about 28  of the population  If the direction of gains in employment reverses  look for the cracks highlighted by our US economics  cross asset and equity strategy teams to widen  These cracks tend to lead an overall downturn in household creditworthiness  so we re keeping a careful watch to see if they spread to other segments of consumer debt and eventually creep up the income chain

 This is deeply concerning   said IATA s Director General Alexandre de Juniac   Not since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 has demand fallen for 10 consecutive months   and with no signs of a detente on trade  we can expect the tough business environment for air cargo to continue

This is due to too much U S  production

Will this be the quarterly earnings call where a question about an investment in China becomes a long term negative 
American brands now face two major challenges in a country that is increasingly a foe of the U S  on matters of trade and geopolitics  One is that local Chinese brands are getting stronger  The other is that Chinese consumers are increasingly turning away from foreign brands because they have run afoul of Chinese politics  The result is that some American brands that used to be cool are falling out of fashion The recent NBA flap in China was a reminder of just how quickly Chinese attitudes can turn on Western brands  Within hours of a tweet later deleted by the Houston Rockets  general manager expressing support for Hong Kong antigovernment protesters  stores removed Rockets gear and sponsors pulled deals with the NBA  All game broadcasts were canceled  Searches for Rockets merchandise on e commerce sites yielded friendly error messages encouraging shoppers to consider something else  perhaps a toy rocket 
The shift signals a possible end of an era  For years  it was customary for Western executives to tout their plans for dominating China a market they felt they had to win as markets elsewhere matured  But foreign consumer brands now hold a smaller market share in the categories tracked by McKinsey   Co  than at any time since the global financial crisis  according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of research from the U S  consulting firm  incorporating data from Euromonitor and IHS Markit  Market share losses were particularly evident in categories such as pet food  passenger cars  videogames  smartphones and appliances

CAT,2019-10-22," Bloomberg     A bellwether of the global industrial economy may be sending out distress signals 
  Caterpillar   Inc   NYSE CAT  is heading for a  mild earnings recession    according to   Morgan Stanley    NYSE MS   and analysts expect the heavy equipment maker to post its first year over year decline in quarterly profit since 2016 when it reports results on Wednesday 
Margins are shrinking as demand cools and the U S  China trade war fuels caution among customers  Machine sales have slipped in Asia and the U S  on weaker orders in construction industries  just as the Deerfield  Illinois based company has been trying to raise prices  That helps explain why analysts have pared the earnings outlook five times since August 
The following charts show why Caterpillar s earnings report could bring more bad news for the world economy 
Machinery Meter
In June  worldwide machinery sales for Caterpillar grew at the slowest pace in more than two years on a 3 month rolling  year over year basis  The company posted the same increase in July and August  The sluggishness is largely due to a slowdown in North America  its largest market  and declining market share in China  Sales in North America expanded at the weakest rate in almost two years in August  and in Asia contracted the most since 2016 
Last week  the International Monetary Fund made a fifth straight cut to its 2019 global growth forecast  citing a broad deceleration across the world s largest economies as trade tensions undermine the expansion  The forecast for this year would be the weakest since 2009  when the world economy shrank 
Lots on Dealer Lots
With concern over the sales outlook  the amount of equipment available on sellers  lots has been in the spotlight all year  The company said in July that dealer machine and engine inventories increased about  500 million in the three months through June  compared with an increase of about  100 million in the same period a year earlier  It s been counting on dealers working through the buildup to help meet 2019 profit targets  But analysts at William Blair   Co   who pared their earnings forecast on Oct  7  said dealer inventories are instead rising and more production cuts may be needed 
Caterpillar isn t alone  Manufacturers of durable goods in the U S  had enough inventory to last 1 69 months in August  the longest since November 2016  according to the Census Bureau 
Stock Figures
Concern over the economic outlook and its impact on demand is showing up in analysts  share price targets  The rolling 12 month forecast for Caterpillar s stock is down about 18  from the same time a year ago   Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   trimmed its 2019 2021 earnings per share estimates by 4  on average  The bank said it expects earnings before interest and taxes to decline year over year in 2020  driven by  meaningful production cuts in North America and China construction equipment  while mining demand remains tepid given widespread macro uncertainty  
The stock price outlook could get help from a resolution in the trade war and further cuts in interest rates among central banks  Larry De Maria  an analyst at William Blair  said in his report earlier this month  But the uncertainty going into a U S  election year  generally weaker industrial economy  and cyclical construction equipment markets should ultimately override those potential positives  limiting upside  he said 
Softening the Blow
To be sure  there are bright spots for Caterpillar  Earnings are still forecast to reach a record this year  and much of the bad news may already be reflected in the share price  The stock has risen about 4  in 2019  trailing the 15  gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Also  mining equipment demand has held up  and should help soften the blow from a slowdown in construction  according to Karen Ubelhart  an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence 
 Mining equipment should lead segment growth  yet is only 15 20  of sales and earnings   Ubelhart said in a note last week  When Caterpillar reports earnings   commentary on China will remain a focus  as will significant deceleration in North American construction equipment demand   ",Bloomberg,0.083,0.821,0.096,0.8863

The latest examples 
  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   a bellwether of the world s industrial economy    just reported a 6  drop in third quarter revenue compared with a year earlier  Jim Umpleby  CEO of the Illinois based maker of construction machinery   said that in the final three months of the year   we now expect end user demand to be flat and dealers to make further inventory reductions due to global economic uncertainty   Hasbro shares tumbled 17  on Tuesday after the Rhode Island based toy maker reported weaker than expected profit largely   blamed on tariffs that aren t even in place yet   If the December 15th tariffs were to go into effect  we would take pricing to again protect our gross margin  and those price increases would be passed along to consumers   CEO Brian Goldner said   We don t see tariffs being enacted two weeks before Christmas is giving the consumer the optimal holiday season   Harley Davidson said tariffs were a  21 6 million drag on third quarter earnings  almost double the impact of a year ago  The Wisconsin based   motorcycle maker is on track to start producing bikes in Thailand that will be shipped to the European Union  a workaround the company started putting in motion last year  CFO John Olin said  we re looking at our business with the abundance of caution necessary in an environment like this   Polaris  the Minnesota based maker of off road vehicles  motorcycles  snowmobiles and boats  has implemented about 60 tariff mitigation initiatives that have combined to reduce the impact on its   bottom line by about  5 million this year  CEO Scott Wine said  He cited efforts to shift sourcing of some parts out of China and negotiate with suppliers as examples As U S  companies try to cope  worries are growing that household spending will be next to suffer if the  tariff fights drag on 
 Going forward  it s going to be the impact on the American consumer  because again  consumption is what drives our GDP   said Cordero  who oversees one of the busiest ports in the U S   If that s impacted  then of course we are going to see an impact on the economy

CAT,2019-10-23,"Caterpillar  CAT  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 66 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 82 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 86 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  5 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this construction equipment company would post earnings of  3 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 83  delivering a surprise of  9 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Caterpillar  which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing   Construction and Mining industry  posted revenues of  12 76 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 67   This compares to year ago revenues of  13 51 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Caterpillar shares have added about 5 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Caterpillar 
While Caterpillar has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Caterpillar was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 88 on  14 47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  11 64 on  55 64 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Nvidia is very close to the target we laid out a few weeks ago  but based on the charting  the stock appears to be forming a rising wedge  a bearish reversal pattern  It is one that would suggest the stock falls in the days following results  perhaps to  188  But this is a dynamic situation  and I will have to keep close tabs on the stock during the week 

Cisco 

Cisco is another tough call  with earnings  The stock has made it back to  49  which was the target we laid out a few weeks ago  I think the stock continues its trend higher following results  especially with the RSI moving higher  potentially sending it back to  51

CAT,2019-11-11,"C H  Robinson Worldwide  Inc   CHRW  stock tumbled roughly 15  after it posted worse than projected quarterly results on October 29  The third party logistics powerhouse s outlook appears to be headed in the wrong direction amid a global economic slowdown 
What s Wrong 
C H  Robinson is a third party logistics firm that provides everything from freight transportation and logistics to outsource solutions and more from North America to Asia  The company has recently fallen victim to a broader economic slowdown  C H  Robinson  like economic bellwether Caterpillar  CAT   has been hurt by the fact that businesses have started to hold off on big purchases and other growth initiatives amid macroeconomic uncertainty  made worse by the U S  China trade war 
CHRW s Q3 revenue fell 8 7   the fourth straight period it failed to top our revenue estimates   while income from operations tumbled 18 2   Meanwhile  the company s adjusted quarterly earnings fell over 14  to  1 07 per share to come in well short of our  1 16 a share Zacks Consensus Estimate  Year to date  company revenues are down 7 8 percent  driven by declines across transportations units 
C H  Robinson CEO Bob Biesterfeld summed up the company s current situation and how the worldwide economic picture is set to impact his company in prepared third quarter remarks 
 We anticipated an aggressive industry pricing environment coming into the second half of this year driven by excess capacity and softening demand and knew we faced difficult comparisons versus our strong double digit net revenue growth in the second half of last year  Our results were negatively impacted by truckload margin compression in North America   Biesterfeld said 
 Looking ahead  we expect that North American routing guides will continue to reset at lower prices in response to the falling cost environment and decline in spot market freight opportunities  While industry data suggests capacity continues to exit the North America truckload market  we believe capacity will exceed available shipments for the next few quarters  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other Fundamentals 
CHRW stock is down over 13  in the past 12 months and its shares tumbled from  90 52 to  77 08 per share in one day after it posted its third quarter results  Investors will also notice just how quickly and dramatically C H  Robinson s longer term earnings picture has turned in the wrong direction  The company is also part of our Transportation   Services industry that sits in the bottom 27  of our 252 different Zacks industries at the moment 
On the positive side  the Minneapolis  Minnesota based firm currently pays an annualized dividend of  2 00 per share  for a solid 2 53  yield  CHRW is also trading at a discount against its industry at 17 8X forward earnings estimates compared to 18 2X  while XPO Logistics  XPO  comes in at 21 2X 
Q4 Outlook   Earnings Trends 
C H  Robinson s fourth quarter revenues are projected to slip 7 2  to  3 84 billion  based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates at the moment  Overall  the company s full year fiscal 2019 sales are projected to fall 7 7  to  15 36 billion 
The logistics firm s Q1 fiscal 2020 sales are then projected to dip nearly 3   CHRW s full year fiscal 2020 revenue is actually expected to pop almost 2  above our current year estimate  but this would still come in far below the company s 2018 results 
At the bottom end of the income statement  CHRW s adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to plummet 24 6  from the year ago period  with full year FY19 set to slip more than 6   C H  Robinson s first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings are projected to fall 14 7   which is expected to help drag down its full year FY20 EPS figure by 1  
The chart below also helps investors see just how rough the company s earnings estimate revision picture has turned recently 
 
 
 
 
Bottom Line
Clearly  many of C H  Robinson Worldwide s current problems are outside of its control  But there are no moral victories on Wall Street and investors should remember that the International Monetary Fund in October announced that it expects the global economy to grow at its slowest pace since 2009 this year 
C H  Robinson Worldwide is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  at the moment that also sports an  F  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system  Investors still interested in the broader Transportation   Services space might instead consider  2  Buy  ranked I D  Systems  Inc   PWFL

CAT,2019-11-15,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh EAST MOLINE  Illinois  Reuters    Devin Spencer has been on edge ever since Deere   Co  laid off dozens of his colleagues at its Harvester Works plant in western Illinois due to dwindling demand for farm combines  He considers himself lucky to have escaped the indefinite layoffs  but has been relegated to a lower level job with a pay cut  The 29 year old welder blames America s trade war with China  which has dented U S  agricultural exports and  in turn  slowed sales of equipment  for his situation  Spencer  who is married with a young son  fears the worst if sales continue to sag and Deere cuts more workers  He is not alone  Hundreds of workers at Harvester Works are facing an uncertain future as a result of the 16 month old tariff war    Orders have sunk so low that I am lucky to have a job   he said   What happens if we don t get orders  I am out of the door   Deere  the world s largest tractor maker  said last month it had indefinitely laid off 50 employees at Harvester Works  part of 163 layoffs across Iowa and Illinois  adding that each factory balanced the size of its workforce with demand for its products   Harvester Works  union head David Thompson told Reuters that weeks later the company extended temporary layoffs for another 100 workers at Harvester Works until early January  The workers were due to return to work in November  he said  Another 300 employees have been downgraded to lower level roles  Thompson added   Deere has not publicly disclosed the extension of the temporary layoffs or the relegation of workers  The company declined to comment for this story  citing a quiet period before quarterly earnings on Nov  27  All the layoffs and job shuffles  which Thompson says have affected about 41  of the plant s roughly 1 100 workforce  show how the trade war is hitting the operations of some manufacturers like Deere  regarded as a bellwether for U S  agriculture and manufacturing  Last week  Deere told 12 workers at a facility that makes planting equipment just 15 minutes  drive from Harvester Works that they would be laid off indefinitely from early January  the plant s labor union head Heather Keag told Reuters  President Donald Trump s trade war  coupled with poor weather in the U S  farm belt  has dented the company s earnings and forced it to cut production  as well as trim full year profit and sales forecasts  Retail sales of Deere s combines in North America have been falling since May  according to the company which reports figures on a three month rolling basis  Its rivals are also battling lower sales    LOT OF ANXIETY  FEAR  Trump blames China for hollowing out U S  manufacturing  and says his tariffs are needed to force a change in the way Beijing does business   He says his measures will ultimately benefit U S  companies and workers by not only opening up the Chinese market  but also bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States   Thompson  who did not vote for Trump  a Republican  agreed some measures were required  but said workers at his facility were bearing the brunt of the fallout   There is a lot of anxiety  a lot of fear   he said  The mood was different in early 2018  A nascent recovery in demand had led to healthy growth in orders for Deere s planters and combines  Harvester Works began hiring new workers  said Thompson   But as the trade war began taking a toll on the farm economy  Spencer said farmers started cancelling their orders    We could all see the writing on the wall   he said   Deere is not alone  Rival  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   the world s largest heavy equipment maker  has decided to let go of 120 workers in Texas  for example  while United States Steel Corp has had layoffs in Michigan  U S  Federal Reserve reports show American factories are running way below their long run average production levels and companies are delaying capital spending due to uncertainty over trade policy  U S  manufacturing activity fell to a more than decade low in September   Trump  however  said on Tuesday that industries had not been hurt by his administration s trade actions   Harvester Works is in Illinois  a heavily Democratic state  But some industrial swing states like Pennsylvania  Wisconsin and Michigan that Trump narrowly won in 2016 are now shedding thousands of factory jobs  These states are up for grabs in 2020   SWEEPING THE FLOOR Deere s shares have gained about 2  since Trump announced a  phase one  trade agreement with Beijing on hopes that more agricultural sales to China would encourage farmers to resume purchases  The deal  however  is still being put to paper  Thompson worries the agreement will not be enough to help lift demand for his factory s combines   Meanwhile Spencer  the welder  is now sweeping the floor of the plant  Apart from the psychological impact of doing a less skilled job  the change has reduced his earnings by more than a third  Spencer says he can no longer afford a vacation  When Trump first declared a war on the global trade order last year  he said   Trade wars are good and easy to win    However  employees at Harvester Works have yet to see any positives  according to Josh Saunders  who has been moved from a higher paying welding role to an assembly job  The 37 year old  who has a wife and two stepsons  is worried losing a job with one of the better employers in the area could force him to sell his house and move away

CAT,2019-11-19,"By John Kemp
LONDON  Reuters    The global economy may have narrowly avoided a recession  with most industrial and financial indicators pointing to a slight improvement in September October after a sharp slowdown in the middle of the year 
World trade volumes were down almost 1 5  in the three months from June to August compared with the same period a year earlier  the worst performance since the recession of 2008 09 
The trade data are the most recent available from the Netherland Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis   World trade monitor   CPB  Oct  25  
Since then  however  most equity and bond market indicators as well as industrial production surveys have shown the slowdown has eased    
South Korea s KOSPI 100 equity index  normally a good proxy for trade given the country s heavy exposure to exports  is up 11  since the end of August and has risen year on year for the first time since May 2018 
 Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   s share price  another bellwether for the global economy because of its central role in the heavy industrial supply chain  is up almost 21  since the end of August and is showing the strongest upward momentum since 2018 
In the bond market  the U S  Treasury yield curve has un inverted  with yields on 10 year notes now 23 basis points above three month bills  from a discount of 52 basis points near the end of August 
The curve normally inverts before a sharp slowdown and then often starts to normalize shortly before the onset of a recession as the Federal Reserve cuts short term rates 
In this case  however  investors are increasingly confident the Fed s three interest rate cuts since July will be enough to forestall a descent into recession 
Bond traders seem convinced the earlier loss of momentum will prove to be a mid cycle slowdown  like 1967  1995  1998 or 2015  rather than mark the end of the expansion  like 2001 or 2008 
MANUFACTURING
Recent industrial production data from the United States  Germany and Japan all provide some evidence the economy is turning a corner 
U S  manufacturing output excluding motor vehicles and parts  hit by the strike at General Motors  NYSE GM   was down 0 5  in the three months from August to October compared with a year earlier 
But the rolling three month average improved in September and October for the first time since the start of the year  suggesting that recessionary forces were easing 
Japan s manufacturing production was down 0 8  in the three months from July to September compared with a year earlier  but the rate of decline was easing 
Germany s industrial output was also down by more than 4  in July September compared with a year ago  but again the rate of decline showed signs of easing 
Interest rate cuts  dialled down trade tensions between the United States and China  and the resilience of the service sector in many countries all seem to have helped keep the global economy from descending into a recession 
There have been negative first round effects on growth from reduced business investment but  so far  few signs of second round effects on employment  consumer confidence and household spending 
On most measures  the global economy has escaped recession by a narrow margin  but the nascent re acceleration is fragile and depends on an improvement in business confidence and investment to become self sustaining 
The improving outlook for the economy and therefore oil consumption in 2019 2020 has been reflected in higher oil prices and firmer calendar spreads 
Front month Brent futures prices have moved above year ago levels for the first time since October 2018  suggesting traders expect the worst of the 2018 19 slump is over 
Brent s six month calendar spread  which is probably a better measure for short and medium term expectations about the production consumption balance  is progressively tightening 
If the global economy avoids a recession  as now seems likely  the slowdown in U S  shale production growth and continued output restraint from Saudi Arabia  should reduce the prospective surplus in the oil market next year

CAT,2019-11-21,"After much talk of an imminent recession  we find ourselves once again back in a roaring bull market  The latest leg higher in equities   which has pushed the benchmark indices to records   is making some beaten down stocks attractive again and prompting investors to buy cyclical stocks  which are closely tied to the performance of the economy 
But despite this euphoria  triggered by some improvements in trade negotiations between the U S  and China  it s not yet clear how sustained that turnaround will be and whether we can comfortably call a bottom in cyclical stocks  such as industrials 
In an economy where the unemployment rate remains at a historically low level and the central bank is ready to cut interest rates  there are still some signs of trouble on the horizon 
The U S  Commerce Department  for example  reported last Friday that retail sales in October failed to rebound  following a weak reading in September  That prompted JPMorgan Chase   Co  to cut its fourth quarter estimate of gross domestic product to 1 25  from 1 75  on an annualized basis 
On the U S  China trade front  the news flow is certainly positive and it s possible that both countries might soon conclude the first phase of their trade deal  But  in our view  it s still risky to build too much excitement around these talks  Both countries continue to send conflicting signals and there is very little information available to conclude that all is going well 
While negotiators held  constructive discussions  over the weekend  CNBC reported on Monday that China is pessimistic about reaching a deal due to U S  President Donald Trump s reluctance to roll back existing tariffs 
First Sign of Trouble
Despite these concerns  the stock market s current rally shows that investors this time are almost certain there will be a positive outcome which will fuel growth and pave the way for companies to meet earnings estimates for 2020 
When the trade war escalated early this year  investors shunned cyclical companies  But that trend is changing fast with many such sectors outperforming the S P 500 for now  The KBW Nasdaq Bank index  for example  has posted a 26  gain year to date  compared with the S P 500 s 24  rise  The S P 500 industrials sector is also outperforming the broader market  up 28  so far this year 
If you re skeptical about this one sided market view  then it s a prudent strategy to not get too excited and buy stocks which will quickly give up their gains at the first sign of trouble

Bottom Line
The recent show of strength by U S  markets is mainly fueled by interest rate expectations and hopes that the trade dispute with China will be resolved  Despite these positive developments  it s not an  all clear  scenario and many risks are still lurking  In this uncertain situation  it s better not to buy stocks which have proved too risky and volatile  such as 3M and Caterpillar ",Haris Anwar/Investing.com,0.138,0.745,0.117,-0.9113

Investing com   Wall Street capped a strong week with a loss on Friday as lingering concerns about the coronavirus offset U S  employment data showing the economy created more jobs than expected last month 
The S P 500 fell 0 54   Nasdaq Composite slipped 0 54  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 0 94   The Dow and S P had their best weeks in eight months

 The new coronavirus outbreak abroad has created some new risks to the near term external growth backdrop  but there is little apparent reason for monetary policymakers to consider rate cuts at the moment  and we continue to expect the Fed to sit on the sidelines through 2020   RBC said in a note
