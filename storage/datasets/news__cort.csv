110971,332486,CORT,What Drives Catalyst Pharmaceuticals Above 250  This Year ,opinion,Shares of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ CPRX   have soared 285 7  this year so far  massively outperforming the  s gain of 9 8   Here we analyze the factors that have led to this huge rally Catalyst Pharma s key drug Firdapse is currently approved in the EU for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome  LEMS  in adults  However  the drug is not yet approved in the United States Notably  the company announced positive top line results from a second phase III study of Firdapse for treatment of LEMS  The findings showed that Firdapse has a relieving effect of significant magnitude when it comes to treating the symptoms of LEMS   The company remains on track to resubmit a new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 Catalyst Pharmais also working to develop Firdapse for additional indications  It initiated an investigator sponsored phase II III study on the drug in February 2016 for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK antibody positive MG   In March  the company reported top line data from the same trial  The company expects to initiate MuSK MG phase III study in the first quarter of 2018 In October 2015  the company began a small blinded study on Firdapse for treating certain types of congenital myasthenic syndromes  CMS  in the pediatric population  ranging from two to 17 years of age   However  post discussions with the FDA  the study has been expanded beyond the purview of minors to include adult CMS patients and the enrollment size has grown to nearly 20 patients  Top line data from the study is expected in the first half of 2018  Positive data would allow the company to add the CMS indication to Firdapse s label  either as part of the NDA resubmission for Firdapse for LEMS or as a supplement to the resubmission  Catalyst Pharma had acquired in licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   back in 2012 for development and commercialization of the product in the United States   The drug enjoys a Breakthrough Therapy status  granted by the FDA for treatment of LEMS  It also boasts an Orphan Drug designation  courtesy of the regulatory body  for both LEMS and CMS besides MG It is to be noted that LEMS is an ultra rare disease and therefore its market represents great potential despite drugs and treatments like steroids  azathioprine  other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use  Additionally  guanidine HCl tablets are approved for treatment of LEMS  However  the drug is unrecognized as an effective therapeutic option due to significant side effects  This  in turn  has created ample space for introducing new therapies in the market for LEMS Also  CMS is an ultra rare disease affecting around 1 000 and 1 500 citizens across the United States  Moreover  approximately 5 8  of the MG patient population is estimated to be MuSK antibody positive  Therefore  approval of Firdapse to administer for these diseases will be a huge boost to the company  driven by its promising commercial potential in the target markets Further  Catalyst Pharma is on track to explore the possibility of developing CPP 115  a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor  for addressing epilepsy  initially infantile spasms  and treating other selected neurological indications namely  complex partial seizures and Tourette s disorder Incidentally  CPP 115 is tagged with both an Orphan Drug status in the United States for treatment of infantile spasms as well as an Orphan Medicinal Product designation in the EU for West syndrome  a form of infantile spasms   Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price    Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderCatalystPharma

Cemiplimab is a checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD 1  programmed death protein 1   The cemiplimab monotherapy study showed an overall response rate  ORR  of 46 3   The median duration of response  DOR  had not yet been reached at the data cut off point  At the time of this analysis  all patients had a minimum follow up of six months 
The safety profile in the study was generally consistent with approved anti PD 1 agents  Notably  for patients with CSCC that cannot be cured by surgery or radiation  there are no FDA approved treatment options  This is the largest prospective study ever conducted in this disease and many patients were able to achieve deep and durable responses  Hence  the candidate is expected to provide the company with access to a market promising huge potential 
So far this year  shares of Regeneron have gained 4  compared with the s growth of 2 8  

 
Per the company s press release  CSCC is the second most common and deadliest skin cancer after melanoma in the United States  The disease is also responsible for most deaths among non melanoma skin cancer patients  Although it is easier to apprehend the condition in early stages  it becomes quite difficult to treat the same once progressed to advanced stages 
The data from the EMPOWER CSCC 1 study will form the basis of a rolling Biologics License Application  BLA  submission to the FDA  which has been initiated and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018  The company also expects to make a filing to the European Medicines Agency  EMA  in the first quarter of 2018 
The results were consistent with the positive phase I trial expansion cohort results reported at ASCO in June  2017  which led to the candidate receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation in September Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price

The CHMP informed the company that it will refer the marketing authorisation application  MAA  to a scientific advisory group for additional advice as part of its ongoing risk benefit assessment 
Hence  the CHMP expects to issue an opinion on the same during the first half of 2018 
In July 2017  the CHMP issued a second Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide SC for their ongoing regulatory review

Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1 4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly   Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen Inc s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia 
Moreover  the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma  a malignant bone tumor  
Meanwhile  Radius Health is also developing abaloparatide TD for as a short wear time transdermal patch  In December 2015  the company initiated a human replicative clinical evaluation to compare the optimized abaloparatide TD patch with its subcutaneous formulation  The company posted positive results from the trial in September 2016 
The company is currently focused on completing the manufacturing  scale up  and other required activities needed to initiate a pivotal study to evaluate bioequivalence to abaloparatide SC  The transdermal patch program has the potential to allow physicians who treat osteoporosis  but rarely use injectable drugs  to expand their practices to include the use of anabolic therapy

The performance of the Alcon business was weak due to competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases  Consequently  Novartis moved its ophthalmic pharmaceuticals business to the company s pharmaceuticals division  Alcon will now focus on medical devices  surgical and the vision care business with three major businesses   IOLs  consumables behind the equipment  and contact lenses 
The turnaround has been encouraging and management believes creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value  A decision is expected in the first half of 2019  depending on Alcon s performance in the future

Shares of Lilly have gained 6 9  in the past six months  outperforming the  s rise of 4 5  in that period 

The RAINFALL study evaluated Cyramza in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5 fluorouracil as first line treatment for HER2 negative metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma versus a placebo
The company was hopeful that the positive PFS would lead to an OS benefit  Treating advanced gastric cancer is a challenge  which is further underscored by the fact that no major advances over chemotherapies have been achieved for treating metastatic gastric cancer 
Moreover  initial data from another phase III study on Cyramza presented at ESMO 2017 Congress showed that the drug met PFS endpoint in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma

111048,332563,CORT,Mallinckrodt  MNK  Down 55  Year To Date  What Lies Ahead ,opinion,"Shares of Mallinckrodt plc   NYSE MNK   have tumbled 55 1  year to date  compared with the  decline of 29 2  

 
Dublin  Ireland based Mallinckrodt is a specialty biopharmaceutical with a worldwide presence  The company develops  manufactures  markets and distributes branded and generic specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products and therapies along with nuclear medicine products 
The company suffered a setback after a U S  District Court invalidated 11 patents covering its second largest product Inomax   We remind investors that in February 2015  Mallinckrodt along with its subsidiaries filed suit in the U S  District Court for the District of Delaware against Praxair  Inc    NYSE PX   following receipt of a January 2015 notice from the latter  The notice was regarding Praxair s submission of an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV patent certification with the FDA for a generic version of Inomax 
Subsequently  in July 2016  Mallinckrodt filed a second suit against Praxair following receipt of a Paragraph IV notice concerning three additional patents recently added to the FDA Orange Book regarding its ANDA for a generic version of Inomax  Thereafter  a third suit was filed in September 2016  Mallinckrodt plans to appeal against the decision and stated that Inomax has patent protection till 2018 
The company s largest product  Acthar s  sales declined in the third quarter as the payer environment has become increasingly complex for specialty drugs  A large number of prescriptions were unfilled beyond the level management expected  The weakness in the sales is expected to persist in the fourth quarter 
Moreover  the generic segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition  which is hurting both volumes and prices  The company expects double digit declines in revenues from this segment  In addition  continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also 
The company is currently streamlining its business  The company aims to focus better on its specialty pharmaceutical business after having sold its Nuclear Imaging business 
Earlier in the month  Mallinckrodt announced that it will acquire a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company Ocera Therapeutics  Inc  Ocera s experimental product OCR 002  an ammonia scavenger  is being evaluated for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy  a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with hyperammonemia  a complication of acute or chronic liver disease 
The candidate is currently in phase II  Mallinckrodt will discuss with the FDA to confirm the regulatory pathway to gain FDA approval and subsequently launch the IV formulation  expected by 2022  and the oral formulation  expected by 2024 
While these recent acquisitions will expand the company s portfolio  the decline in legacy product sales will adversely impact revenues

Significantly  the company is also planning to evaluate the combination of CDX 1140 with other anti tumor agents 
We remind investors that last November  Celldex presented positive pre clinical data on CDX 1140 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting  The trial outcomes demonstrated that CDX 1140 binds to CD40 with high affinity and does not block CD40 ligand binding  It also showed direct anti tumor activity in immune deficient mice with human lymphomas

111056,332571,CORT,Bristol Myers  Opdivo s Lung Cancer Study Meets Early Success,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that its late stage study evaluating Opdivo versus docetaxel was stopped earlier than expected as it met the primary endpoint  The CheckMate 078 study was being conducted on mainly Chinese patients  who were previously treated for advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  
The study showed that the patients receiving Opdivo  nivolumab  demonstrated superior overall survival benefit  OS  compared with them who received the standard care of treatment  docetaxel  Based on these top line results  Bristol Myers submitted a Biologics License Application  BLA  to the Chinese regulatory authority seeking approval for Opdivo in previously treated lung cancer patients 
 If approved  Opdivo will become the first immuno oncology treatment approved for previously treated lung cancer patients in China 
So far this year  Bristol Myers  shares have rallied 8 7  compared with the  gain of 16 3  

We note that Opdivo is already approved for a number of indications  These include classical Hodgkin lymphoma  recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  SCCHN  with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy  Additionally  it is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  SCCHN  in adults progressing on or after platinum based therapy

Adynovi is an extended half life recombinant Factor VIII  rFVIII  treatment for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older living with hemophilia A for on demand and prophylactic use  The drug was first approved as Adynovate by the FDA in the United States for hemophilia A  in pediatric patients under 12 years of age 
Adynovate was also approved by the FDA for use in surgical settings for both adult and pediatric patients  It then received approval in Japan  Canada  Colombia and Switzerland 
We note that the CHMP submission was based on outcomes from three phase III studies of patients with hemophilia A  a designated orphan disease by the European Commission  It is a rare bleeding disorder that causes longer than normal bleeding due to lack of clotting factor VIII  FVIII  in the blood 
The CHMP opinion will be reviewed by the European Commission  which will grant marketing authorization in the EU  If approved  the adults and adolescent patients having hemophilia A in Europe will get a new treatment option with a twice weekly prophylaxis dosing schedule  This will help the patients to manage their hemophilia A care with their physicians in the way that works best for them

111084,332599,CORT,Pacira s Exparel SNDA To Be Reviewed By FDA Advisory Committee,opinion,"Shares of Pacira Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ PCRX   declined about 6 6  on Nov 14  This followed the FDA s notice stating that the company s supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for  label expansion of Exparel  bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension  in the nerve block setting will be discussed at a meeting of the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee   AADPAC   before a final decision  
Currently  Pacira intends to get the drug approved to include administration via nerve block for regional analgesia  The meeting related to the approval is scheduled to take place in mid February next year  However  the action date set by the FDA remained unchanged on Apr 6  2018 
Exparel is a liposome injection of bupivacaine  which is indicated for single dose administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia 
So far this year  Pacira s share price has increased 23 6   as against the  s decline of 0 4  
 

 
We remind investors that the company received a complete response letter  CRL  from the FDA in 2015  following a review of its sNDA for the use of Exparel in nerve block to provide postsurgical analgesia  The FDA requested another clinical trial to establish the efficacy of Exparel in an additional clinical setting beyond femoral nerve block for total knee arthroplasty  TKA    Also  it requested a study following safety outcomes through the time to reach maximum concentration of Exparel 
However  the FDA accepted the company s resubmission of its sNDA in October 2017  The sNDA filing was based on positive data from a phase III study of Exparel in femoral nerve block for total knee arthroplasty  lower extremity  and a phase III study of Exparel in brachial plexus block for shoulder surgeries  upper extremity   Notably  eight Pacira sponsored studies support this expanded indication  The sNDA also includes data from two investigator initiated studies that provide additional experience in smaller  peripheral nerve block settings 
A potential approval for the expanded indication of Exparel is expected to further boost sales of the company

Today  we wanted to focus on one of these trends in particular  growth  Of course  we always want the share prices of our stocks to grow  but the term  growth stock  refers to a company whose earnings and revenue are expected to grow at an above average rate compared to the overall market and its industry peers

111321,332836,CORT,Perrigo  PRGO  Misses Q2 Earnings Estimates  Cuts  16 View,opinion,"Perrigo Company plc s   NYSE PRGO   second quarter 2016 earnings of  1 93 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 00  Reported earnings also declined 11  from the year ago figure Net sales in the reported quarter also declined 3  to  1 48 billion primarily due to relatively lower sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment that was partially offset by higher sales in the Prescription Pharmaceuticals  Rx  segment  Revenues  however  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 44 billion 
Mixed Performance in Q2
Perrigo reports revenues primarily from the following segments  Consumer Healthcare  Branded Consumer Healthcare  created as a result of the Mar 2015 Omega Pharma acquisition   Rx Pharmaceuticals  Specialty Sciences  and Other  which includes the active pharmaceutical ingredients business  
Excluding net sales contribution from held for sale businesses  primarily the U S  Vitamins  Minerals and Supplements business within the Consumer Healthcare segment   adjusted net sales in the quarter came in at  1 44 billion  a decline of 4  from the year ago period and 3  on a constant currency basis  New product sales of  89 million were offset partially by  16 million in discontinued products 
Consumer Healthcare  Perrigo reported adjusted Consumer Healthcare net sales in the second quarter of  644 million  down 9  from the year ago period and 8  on a constant currency basis 
This decrease was due to lower sales of existing products   84 million   primarily in the cough cold category owing to a relatively weak allergy season as compared to last year  the timing of promotions  lower orders in the contract manufacturing business and the effects of relatively lower pricing in the analgesics category  In addition  discontinued product sales were  12 million  These were partially offset by new product sales of  32 million  which included the store brand launch of fluticasone nasal spray and new products in the infant formula category 
Branded Consumer Healthcare  The company reported net sales of  394 million  up almost 24  sequentially  New product sales and acquisitions contributed  28 million and  29 million  respectively  offset by lower sales in the lifestyle and natural health vitamins categories  which had experienced a lifestyle category new product launch in the second quarter of 2015 
Rx Pharmaceuticals  The Rx Pharmaceuticals segment performed encouragingly during the quarter  with net sales rising 5  to  293 million driven by  44 million related to recent product acquisitions and new product sales of  26 million  These were partially offset by a decrease in sales of existing products of  50 million due to price erosion across the portfolio and the lack of an exclusive market position for two key products versus the prior year 
Specialty Sciences  Segmental revenues comprised royalties of  90 million received by Perrigo on net sales of Biogen Inc  s   NASDAQ BIIB   multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  up 7  year over year 
2016 Earnings Outlook Lowered

111338,332853,CORT,Corcept Begins Recovery After Disastrous Launch Of Korlym,opinion,Last year  the drug developer Corcept Therapeutics  CORT  received FDA approval for their flagship product Korlym  mifepristone  for the treatment of Cushing s syndrome  Investors were initially ecstatic about the drug s approval  since it was the only drug available for Cushing s Syndrome patients that would be on the market  It s also worth noting that Korlym was granted orphan drug status by the FDA  which gives it 7 years of exclusivity on the market  as opposed to the standard 5   Considering how popular orphan drugs were amongst biotech investors last year  it wasn t surprising to see major interest in CORT from the market The FDA approval for Korlym was on February 17  2012  Instead of a  sell the news  reaction  investors were happy to bid up the price of CORT above  4 share  Corcept  apparently eager to hit the market  launched the drug on April 10th  and investors kept the stock steady in anticipation of further developments CORT didn t run into any trouble until July 2012  when it announced a public offering of 11 million shares worth of common stock  The company claimed that it needed the money to fund the clinical development of Korlym for additional indications and for other compounds in the pipeline  like CORT 108297  but it was also suggested that the company needed more money for the marketing of Korlym for Cushing s Syndrome  This wasn t particularly alarming for CORT investors  and the stock only dropped enough to counteract the effects of the share dilution It wasn t until August 7th when the company its second quarter results that investors began to panic  The company posted a net loss of  7 6 million for the quarter  which was only marginally better than the  8 9 million worth of losses posted in Q2 2011 despite the fact that they had a highly anticipated drug on the market for four months  Even worse was the actual sales revenue of Korlym  which came in at  875 000  While the cost of sales was surprisingly low   48 000   the sales volume was extremely disappointing  To break even on its operations  Corcept would have to grow Korlym sales by approximately 870  Still  investors were willing to cut Corcept some slack since drug launches can take extra time to pick up steam  It was also encouraging to see that Corcept had an enormous pile of cash  The company had  34 9 million on June 30th  and would also be adding the  46 1 million gained from the aforementioned public stock offering in July  Although Korlym wasn t pulling its own weight  Corcept was in good financial shape and investors were willing to wait a bit longer On October 31st  Corcept posted Q3 2012 results which were only marginally better than the results we saw in the second quarter  The company managed to post a larger net loss of  8 3 million  and increased Korlym sales to  1 1 million  Also worth noting is that Korlym wasn t available for the entirety of the second quarter  so the implied 26  quarterly sales growth is actually a much smaller figure  For some reason  Korlym wasn t able to show any momentum despite the complete lack of competition Understandably  the market punished the stock  The stock lost about half of its value  dropping from  2 50 to  1 32 by November 8th  While Korlym s performance was extremely poor relative to initial investor expectations after FDA approval of the drug in early 2012  it s important to consider that Corcept s market capitalization was roughly  130 million at that point  Corcept  with about  100 million in cash at the time  and only about  30 million in debt  was quite undervalued If you ve been following CORT in recent trading  you can notice that CORT has seen an inflow of buyers that are willing to extend a little more faith in Korlym and the rest of the company s pipeline  We ve also seen some renewed bullishness from analysts both old and new  Janney Capital initiated coverage of Corcept just yesterday with a buy rating and a  3 00 price target The opinion is still quite mixed on Corcept  On one hand you have bears who are pointing at the very weak launch of Korlym  and on the other you have bulls who are willing to bet on the value of the rest of Corcept s pipeline as well as the potential for Korlym to turn around  I think that we should give Korlym another quarter to show signs of potential in the Cushing s Syndrome market before we pass judgment on the drug  but things look grim so far  The rest of Corcept s pipeline  particularly the sNDA that could be submitted for Korlym in the treatment of psychotic depression  looks promising ,2013-01-09,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corcept-begins-recovery-after-disastrous-launch-of-korlym-150161,150161

The open label study is evaluating if the addition of Korlym increases the effect of Halaven in patients with TNBC whose tumors express the glucocorticoid receptor  GR   one of the receptors to which Korlym binds  The trial enrolled 21 patients with GR positive tumors and two with tumors whose GR status is currently unknown  Out of these patients  3 patients exhibited a partial response  defined as a 30  or greater reduction in tumor size  8 had stable disease and 11 had progressive disease 
Preliminary data from the trial showed that the combination is active in treating TNBC  Final results are expected in mid 2016 
We note that Korlym is already approved for the once daily oral treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to endogenous Cushing s syndrome in adult patients with glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus type 2 who have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery  A potential label expansion of the drug will boost its sales 
Concurrently  Corcept provided updates on other candidates in its pipeline  The company has begun dosing patients in a phase 1 II trial on CORT125134  in combination with Abraxane  for the treatment of a range of solid tumor cancers  While the first phase will identify a recommended dose of Abraxane and CORT125134  the second phase will test the combination s efficacy against a range of tumor types in one or more 20 patient cohorts  Initial results are expected in 2017

111349,332864,CORT,5 Liquid Stocks For A Steady Flow Of High Returns ,opinion,"Investors always look for companies that are financially strong and thus have potential to perform steadily  Betting on a company s liquidity  which is a good indicator of its financial position  serves their purpose well  A company with a higher level of liquidity can convert its assets into cash to pay short term debt obligations faster than those with a lower level of liquidity  
However  a higher level of liquidity may not always mean that the company is financially strong  It may also indicate that the firm is failing to utilize its assets efficiently  Hence  in addition to companies with high liquidity  one may also search for efficient ones  A combination of efficiency and liquidity can lead to strong returns 
Ratios to Measure Liquidity 
Liquidity ratios   Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio   are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity 
Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company s financial health is in the pink  It may also mean that the company failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal 
Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluded current assets relative to current liabilities  Like current ratio  quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable 
Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It only looks toward a company s ability to clear current debt obligations using most liquid assets  Though cash ratio higher than 1 may point to a company s sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash 
As evident  a ratio of greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always underline a company s financial health 
Screening Parameters
In order to avoid selection of inefficient companies  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be called efficient 
In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too  we have added our proprietary  to the screen 
Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 While liquidity ratios of greater  than 1 are desirable  stocks with high ratios may indicate inefficient companies      
Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than industry average indicates a company s efficiency  
Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   
 Growth Style Score less than or equal to B
 Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 handily beat other stocks  
Just these few criteria narrow down the universe of over 7 700stocks to only 12 
Here are five stocks that meet these criteria
