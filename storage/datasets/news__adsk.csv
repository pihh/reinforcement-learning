BOSTON  Reuters    Hedge fund White Elm Capital is returning money to outside clients at the end of the year  ending a 12 year run of picking stocks for pensions  endowments and wealthy families  its founder  Matthew Iorio  wrote in a letter on Friday 
Iorio  whose fund is having one of its best years ever with a nearly 30  gain after fees  said now was the right time to end  He called the decision  very difficult  but said he was  happy to be returning capital when we are performing at the top of our game  
Reuters saw a copy of the letter  A spokesman for the firm declined to comment beyond the letter 
White Elm is the latest in a growing number of hedge funds to shut down as raising and retaining capital and running a hedge fund is becoming ever more difficult

White Elm s outside investors will get most of their money back by the end of January  2020  the letter said  adding that all current clients have earned money with White Elm 
The firm  which traces its roots to Tiger Management  one of the industry s most successful funds ever  was launched in 2007  managed more than  1 billion in assets at its peak and has seen returns go up and down  At the end of 2018  the firm oversaw  328 million in assets  according to a regulatory filing

So what
The software as a service company is benefiting from strong demand for its design products in growing industries such as construction and architecture  However  investors are even more excited about how its shift toward subscription based selling is paying off for the business  That move supported a 28  sales spike in the fiscal third quarter as operating margin improved to 13  of sales from 2  a year ago  Autodesk s cash flow is a testament to its strong business model  too  with free cash flow set to cross  1 3 billion this year compared to  300 million in 2018  
Now what
Autodesk s 55  spike in billings last quarter suggests a strong finish to fiscal 2019  as do other key metrics including subscription revenue  earnings  and cash flow  Investors are looking for the company to post revenue of about  890 million when it announces Q4 results in late February or early March  for a 21  increase year over year  The stock s rally will depend on management hitting that goal while projecting another solid fiscal year ahead for the business ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgh2w,2056971

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Autodesk  which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Software industry  posted revenues of  842 70 million for the quarter ended October 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  660 90 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters

Autodesk shares have added about 31 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 25  
What s Next for Autodesk 
While Autodesk has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Autodesk was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

117294,338809,ADSK,The Truth About Market Timing   December 04  2019,opinion,"Is the ability to time the markets more of a data driven science or a  gut   feeling  art 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Acacia Communications  Inc   ACIA   Axcelis Technologies  Inc   ACLS   ACM Research  Inc   ACMR   Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE   Autodesk  Inc   NASDAQ ADSK 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Fruitful market timing requires three key parts  1  A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks  or securities  gold or different kinds of investments   2  The capacity to act on the sign accurately  3  The control to follow up on it 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

117315,338830,ADSK,How To Time The Markets Like An Investing Pro   September 26  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Autodesk  Inc   NASDAQ ADSK   Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE   ACM Research  Inc   ACMR   Axcelis Technologies  Inc   ACLS   Acacia Communications  Inc   ACIA 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

117337,338852,ADSK,The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About   September 05  2019,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Autodesk  Inc   NASDAQ ADSK   Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE   ACM Research  Inc   ACMR   Axcelis Technologies  Inc   ACLS   Acacia Communications  Inc   ACIA 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

117362,338877,ADSK,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  February 28 
1  Trump  Kim Talks Collapse 
U S  President Donald Trump said he had walked away from a nuclear deal at his summit with Kim Jong un because of unacceptable demands from the North Korean leader to lift punishing U S  led sanctions 
 It was all about the sanctions   Trump said at a news conference after the talks were cut short   Basically  they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety  and we couldn t do that  
Trump said two days of talks in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi had made good progress in building relations and on the key issue of denuclearization  but it was important not to rush into a bad deal 
 Sometimes you have to walk  and this was just one of those times   Trump said  adding  it was a friendly walk  
2  Cold Shower for U S  China Trade Hopes
Markets have turned more cautious on trade developments between the U S  and China after comments from U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about a possible deal between Washington and Beijing 
Lighthizer told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday it was too early to predict an outcome to the U S  China trade negotiations  U S  issues with China are  too serious  to be resolved with promises from Beijing to purchase more U S  goods  and any deal between the two countries must include a way to ensure commitments are met  he told U S  lawmakers 
That was his first public comment since Trump announced a delay to the scheduled increase in Chinese import tariffs on Sunday 
3  China s Manufacturing Downturn Deepens
Markets digested more weak economic data out of China  where factory activity contracted to a three year low as export orders fell at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis 
The official Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  fell to 49 2 in February from 49 5 in January  pointing to a contraction in activity for the third straight month  according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics  NBS  
Analysts had forecast the manufacturing gauge would stay unchanged from January s 49 5  The 50 mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis 
The gloomy findings are likely to reinforce views that the world s second largest economy is still losing steam  after growth last year cooled to a near 30 year low 
4  U S  Futures Point to Lower Open 
U S  stock futures pointed to a lower open  as risk sentiment took a hit amid shaky trade talks and the collapse of the Trump Kim summit

117368,338883,ADSK,Yes  You Can Time The Market  Find Out How   August 08  2019,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Computer and Technology stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  Autodesk  Inc   NASDAQ ADSK   Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE   ACM Research  Inc   ACMR   Axcelis Technologies  Inc   ACLS   Acacia Communications  Inc   ACIA 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

117396,338911,ADSK,Autodesk  Flex veterans raise  179 million for manufacturing startup,news,"By Stephen Nellis
 Reuters    A group of former executives from  Autodesk Inc   NASDAQ ADSK  and Flex Ltd has raised  179 million in venture capital for a manufacturing startup that aims to use a combination of robots and new software to remove much of the manual labor from manufacturing electronic devices 
San Francisco based Bright Machines focuses on two areas  One is  micro factories  made up of robot cells it says its customers are using in half a dozen countries to replace the people who assemble and inspect electronics  The other area is new software tools to make the manufacturing process more efficient 
Bright Machines did not name its customers  but said they use its micro factories to make hundreds of thousands of products that can be found  in your driveway  in your pocket or in a hospital   Chief Executive Officer Amar Hanspal told Reuters 
Hanspal was the co CEO of software maker Autodesk along with Carl Bass  who sits on the new startup s board  Also on the Bright Machines board is former Flex executive Lior Susan  founder of Eclipse Ventures  which led the funding round  and former Flex CEO Mike McNamara 
Among them  the executives have seen the manufacturing process end to end  Autodesk s flagship software  AutoCAD  is used to design items like circuit boards  And Flex is the world s third largest contract manufacturer  having made gadgets for Fitbit Inc in the past  among others 
Robots can take months to set up and train and then are good at only one task  Bright Machines wants to make its robots adaptable  on the fly  to make many kinds of  electronics in a box  such as a smart phone or networking devices for data centers 
Hanspal thinks Bright Machines can plug software gaps  For example  when engineers design parts  the design files contain information about the shape and size of the parts  But the information never tends to make it to the factory to help train the robots  which run on a separate software system 
The goal is a machine on which gadget designers can upload a design file and have raw material fed in one end of the machine and a gadget spit out the other  And the machines could just as easily be in California as in China 
 One customer we re working with explicitly wants to make their products in the U S    Hanspal said   It s not a political thing  They want to make their products where their company is  ",2018-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/autodesk-flex-veterans-raise-179-million-for-manufacturing-startup-1655766,1655766

117401,338916,ADSK,Why Autodesk  ADSK  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Autodesk  NASDAQ ADSK   which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Software industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this design software company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 10 53   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Autodesk came out with earnings of  0 46 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 42 per share  representing a surprise of 9 52   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 26 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 29 per share  delivering a surprise of 11 54  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Autodesk  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Autodesk has an Earnings ESP of  0 18  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-autodesk-adsk-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200422113,200422113

1  U S  China Trade Dispute Remains In Focus
Trade concerns continued to nag at investors after U S  President Donald Trump appeared to have opened a new front in the trade war by considering new tariffs  this time on cars 
The Trump administration is weighing a plan that would impose tariffs of as much as 25  on imported vehicles  citing national security grounds 
The move opens yet another front in the Trump administration s trade battles with both allies and rivals  a confrontational approach that has yielded mixed results 
Meanwhile  China s Commerce Ministry said earlier that it had not pledged to cut the country s trade surplus with the U S  by a certain figure  fueling uncertainty over trade talks between the world s two largest economic powers 
2  U S  Stock Futures Point To Muted Open
U S  stock futures pointed to a muted open  as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of corporate earnings and economic data  while monitoring fresh developments surrounding talks with China and North Korea 
At around 5 45AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures dipped around 7 points  or less than 0 1   the S P 500 futures inched up 1 point  while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 7 points  or roughly 0 1  
Stocks ended slightly higher on Wednesday  as an early session sell off was entirely erased following the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve s latest policy meeting 
On the earnings front  reports from  Best Buy   NYSE BBY   Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   and Gap  NYSE GPS  will be the notable reporters from the retail sector  while Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL   Autodesk  NASDAQ ADSK   and McKesson  NYSE MCK  will also report results on Thursday

While the minutes showed most policymakers thought it likely another interest rate increase would be warranted  soon   they also revealed the Fed would tolerate inflation rising above its goal for a time  suggesting it would not raise the tempo at which it increases interest rates 
On the economic data side  investors will get the weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8 30AM ET  followed by home prices for March at 9AM ET

117427,338942,ADSK,Autodesk  ADSK  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Autodesk  NASDAQ ADSK  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This design software company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  566 7  
Revenues are expected to be  707 09 million  up 27 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Autodesk 
For Autodesk  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Autodesk will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Autodesk would post earnings of  0 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 29  delivering a surprise of  11 54  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Autodesk doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autodesk-adsk-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200390987,200390987

Why the Move 
The U S  economy has been slowing down though most of the recently released economic data points have come in decent  This has probably led investors to the mid cap growth spectrum as large cap stocks are more internationally focused and may suffer given the prevailing global growth worries

117456,338971,ADSK,Check Out These 4 Stocks With Superb Earnings Acceleration ,opinion,Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth interests all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Notably  earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in stock price Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Meanwhile  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance Screening Parameters Let s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth

That said  the 3Ds  Debasement  Debt and Derivatives  are alive and well and expanding as ever  Then yesterday  the Turkish lira blew up  in turn tanking the euro to its lowest closing level   1 14400  in better than a year with the Euro Banks getting boffed in the balance     but Gold merely peeked out from under its sheets  and as a sporting gesture dropped a minuscule 80  oz  for the day before returning to dreamland   Course   currency contagion  notwithstanding  ought we really be all that concerned  After all  we re talkin  Turkey here  the annual gross domestic product for which is smaller than that of California or Texas or New York or Florida  So do we really give a derri re du rat  Gold clearly doesn t 
 But it cudda been worse for gold  mmb   cause the dollar had a strong day    
May we refer you  dear Squire  to last week s missive in which was substantively shown concurrent rises in both the dollar and Gold    along with a rising Fed Funds rate    essentially throughout 2005 
Still   tis unsettling given all that is unsettling  round the globe to see Gold being comprehensively ignored  A high level  hardened  Gold stackin  hoarder who can delineate the Gold Story as well as anyone we ve ever met  let alone read  wrote in the past week rather agog about it all with this simple query   What s going on   In sharing this question with another valued reader  they hit on the key word   Competition  
Competition is the irresistible force  made up to be sure by the aforementioned 3Ds  but categorized as well by the stock market   We must own eBay     34 09  trailing twelve month loss  97     We must own TripAdvisor     54 35  ttm loss  97     We must own AutoDesk     134 85  ttm loss   2 38    We must own Salesforce     145 51  ttm price earnings ratio 223 9x    We must own NetApp     81 95  ttm p e ratio 292 7x    We must own SBA Communications     156 10  ttm p e ratio 624 4x   How any of these equities    and many others like them    are even allowed in as S P 500 constituents is beyond us  The obliteration of such irresistible force upon colliding with the immovable object ought finally morph the latter into motion  sending it well up into the stratosphere     or at least back to Base Camp 1377 
By which we segu  to Gold s weekly bars  And for you counters out there  the present parabolic Short trend is 15 red dots in duration  which for the 36 weekly Short trends millennium to date ties for the fourth most lengthy  But as you can see  the rightmost price bars do have that look of crossing the runway s threshold toward touching down  A wee bounce here  a giggly jiggle there  and the landing complete  But talk about a late arrival  Time then to refuel 

 Course to view Gold by the day since its All Time Closing High at 1900 nearly seven years ago  as depicted below  it looks more like wheels still up with nose down  price  1219  having materially penetrated beneath the 300 day moving average  1291   That noted  the depth of penetration is about as far as such  recent  pokes have gone  such that strictly in the technical sense  buyers now ought be frothing at the mouth to get in on the El Cheapo 

Meanwhile as all else  bubbles  along  St  Louis Fed Head James  Bullish  Bullard says there s perhaps     more blue sky ahead than what people think     as opposed to the economy reversing into recession  and that as an example  Australia is a country     that has not had a recession in     25 years or more   So just as we showed two weeks ago that Gold after all is just Copper  StateSide we might now sing  We are Australian       The Seekers   87   Either way  seeking to raise their Bank s funds rate come this 26 September is the Federal Open Market Committee   barring one or more of you valued readers faxing to them the following chart of the Economic Barometer  

Just as the Econ Baro and the S P 500 are parting ways  so too are Gold s  Baby Blues  ascending from flatlining price as we next see below left across the daily bars for the last three months to date  The rising blue dots signal the downtrend s consistency as becoming less so  another sign that the immovable object is near to getting off its rump  Zooming in on the 10 day Market Profile below right suggests that clearing 1223 ought give price a shot at the 1231 shelf   ya gotta start somewhere  

As for Silver her  Baby Blues  too are on the upside move  albeit her finger still appears flippish  Hardly the happy camper our Sister Silver   

In wrapping it up here  whilst much of the Northern Hemisphere relishes through mid summer  hardly on vacances next week is the Econ Baro  16 metrics due either to halt its skid  contain it  else exacerbate it  Then we ve the stock market  which as measured by the S P 500 returned to within a whisker of its all time high of 2872 before coming off the boil at week s end  a double top there  We still see 2154  the 25  correction  as playing out  As for Gold s remaining the immovable object  the otherwise irresistible force of all that is based on foundationless fluff moves ever closing to facing its fallout  Which we ll in turn see    finally    as making Gold  Simply irresistible  ",2018-08-12,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold--the-immovable-object-200338149,200338149

117479,338994,ADSK,Autodesk  ADSK  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Autodesk  NASDAQ ADSK  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This design software company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  316 7  
Revenues are expected to be  642 33 million  up 24 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Autodesk 
For Autodesk  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Autodesk will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Autodesk would post earnings of  0 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 19  delivering a surprise of  11 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Autodesk doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autodesk-adsk-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200358785,200358785

117513,339028,ADSK,Autodesk  ADSK  Down 7 4  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Autodesk  Inc    NASDAQ ADSK    Shares have lost about 7 4  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ADSK due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Recent EarningsAutodesk incurred fourth quarter fiscal 2018 non GAAP loss of 9 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents  The figure was also better than the company s guided range of a loss of 10 14 cents per share Revenues of  553 8 million beat the consensus mark of  545 3 million and increased nearly 15 7  year over year  The figure surpassed the guided range of  537  547 million Moreover  deferred revenues increased 9  to  1 96 billion in the quarter  which reflects growing strength of the business model  Total recurring revenues were 93   a significant increase from 86  reported in the year ago quarter Quarter DetailsRevenues were impacted by a 40 2  year over year decline in License revenues  7 3  of total revenues   which totaled  40 3 million in the quarter Maintenance revenues  39 7  of total revenue  also declined 18  from the year ago quarter to  219 8 million  primarily due to lower subscriptions However  the company s business model transition continues to be on track  Subscription revenues soared 104 8  year over year to  293 7 million  driven by strong product subscriptions and other subscription plan types  Total subscriptions increased approximately 127K from the prior quarter to 3 72 million Subscription plan  product  end of life and cloud subscriptions  increased approximately 371K from the last quarter to 2 27 million backed by new product subscriptions as well as maintenance to subscription or M2S program which recorded 168K subscriptions Total annualized recurring revenues  ARR  were  2 05 billion  up 25  from the year ago quarter  driven by product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement  EBA  subscriptions Subscription plan ARR of  1 18 billion surged 106  year over year and 105  on a constant currency  cc  basis  However  maintenance plan ARR of  879 million declined 18  from the year ago quarter and 17  at cc Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure  The company s e store generated nearly 20  of products subscription sales in the quarter  Moreover  half of AutoCAD LT subscriptions in the United States came through the e store Autodesk is gaining from the EBA program  In the quarter  the company witnessed more than 70 deals valued at more than  1 million with significant contribution from EBAs  Furthermore  14 of them were valued at  5 million or more New customers represented about 30  of the mix in the quarter and contributed a significant portion of subscription additions Cloud subscription additions of 45K represented a decline of 50  year over year  However  increasing adoption of BIM 360 Docs and Field tools and other high value products is a positive  The company won several large contracts from top ranked construction companies  Management expects cloud to be a key growth driver beyond fiscal 2020 Autodesk s broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets  Geographically  revenues in the Americas increased 10  year over year to  232 million  EMEA revenues increased 19  to  221 million while the same from APAC increased 23  from the

administrative expenses as percentage of revenues declined 550 bps  450 bps and 80 bps  respectively  This was partially offset by higher restructuring charges and other facility exit costs  which expanded 1510 bps from the year ago quarter to 17  Non GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined 1080 bps to 91 4  The company reported non GAAP operating loss of  17 5 million in the quarter compared with the year ago quarter s operating loss of  81 5 million Balance SheetAutodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents  including marketable securities  of  1 32 billion compared with  1 45 billion as of Oct 31  2017 As of Jan 31  2018  cash from operating activities was  0 9 million compared with  169 7 million in the year ago period The company

quarter  under ASC 606  and 11 14 cents  under ASC 605  Cash flow in the quarter will be negatively impacted by the company s restructuring activity and exit tax related to the shift of European

117521,339036,ADSK,U S  futures trade down ahead of Fed speakers and key data,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures were trading lower on Wednesday as market participants continued to digest the more hawkish tone evidenced in the release of the Federal Reserve  Fed  meeting minutes the prior day and looked ahead to speeches from Fed officials and data on the labor market and manufacturing activity 
The blue chip Dow futures dropped 57 points  or 0 32   by 10 56GMT  or 6 56AM ET  the S P 500 futures fell 6 points  or 0 29   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 14 points  or 0 32  
The increased chance of a rate hike in June rattled global markets on Thursday and pushed the US Dollar Index to seven week highs as traders readjusted their outlook for U S  monetary policy 
The odds for tightening in June shot up from 4  last week to 34  at Wednesday s market close  according to Fed fund futures data compiled by CME Group 
Compared to data early in the session on Wednesday that saw September as most likely meeting for the next rate hike  markets now assigned a 56  chance to action being taken in July and priced in there being at least two increases this year 
With this in mind  market participants will pay close attention to speeches scheduled on Thursday from Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer and New York Fed president William Dudley 
Both voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  that decides on interest rates  their remarks could be key to giving a more up to date reading on the current state of play at the core of the U S  central bank 
Furthermore  as the minutes indicated that the turning point for a June move would be based on economic data showing growth accelerating  the labor market continuing to firm and inflation rising towards the 2  target  investors will be even more attentive to economic reports 
For Thursday s session  they will digest the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for May  weekly jobless claims and the Chicago Fed national activity for April at 12 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET

117522,339037,ADSK,U S  stocks turn red for 2016 as hawkish Fed tone continues,news,"Investing com   Wall Street continued to lose heart on Thursday  turning negative year to date  with positive earnings news from major blue chip companies unable to wash away the bearish tone instilled by a Federal Reserve  Fed  that gave indications that it was ready to continue with the normalization of monetary policy 
At 16 08GMT or 12 08ET  the Dow 30 tumbled 126 points  or 0 72   while the S P 500 shed 13 points  or 0 62   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded down 37 points  or 0 86  
A day after markets were surprised by the hawkish tone in the Fed s meeting minutes that made clear that the possibility of a rate hike in June was still in the cards  a couple of Fed officials continued the hawkish tone on Thursday 
Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker  well known for his hawkish stance but a non voter this year  blamed the markets on Thursday for overestimating the length of the pause that the U S  central bank would take before continuing to tighten monetary policy and insisted that there was a strong case for raising the rates in June 
New York Fed president William Dudley later agreed that it was  reasonable  to expect an increase in either June or July depending on the evolution of economic data 
Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer steered clear of monetary policy barely hinting in a prepared speech that  what we need most  now that we are near full employment and approaching our target inflation rate  is faster potential growth  
The US Dollar Index continued at a seven week peak as markets readjusted their forecasts for the future path of monetary policy 
Fed fund futures last discounted a 30  probability of a hike for the June 15 meeting  compared to last week s 4   while July now seems a likely candidate for the increase with the odds at 52  
On the economic front  all the more important now that the minutes made it blatantly clear that the Fed was focusing its decision based on the economy s evolution  weekly jobless claims dropped less than expected 
Meanwhile  the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index showed a second consecutive surprise contraction in May 
In positive company news  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  soared almost 9   leading the gainers on the Dow  as the world s largest retailer presented first quarter earnings that crushed expectations

117558,339073,ADSK,Top Analyst Reports For Royal Dutch Shell  Mastercard   Itau Unibanco,opinion,"Wednesday  March 8  2018
 
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   RDS A   Mastercard  MA  and Itau Unibanco Banco  ITUB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
 
You can see 
 
Royal Dutch Shell s shares have gained 23 5  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry  which has gained 8 3  over the same period  Such performance was primarily supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
 
The company finished 2017 on a solid note with the integrated behemoth s fourth quarter upstream unit profit soaring from the year ago period thanks to steady commodity price recovery  Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company generated healthy cash flows yet again  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend  However  with production volumes going down  Shell s near to medium term revenue outlook remains cloudy 
 
 You can   
 
Shares of Mastercard have increased 61 8  over the last one year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s gain of 36 6  during the same period  The company is well positioned for growth  given its solid market position  ongoing expansion and digital initiatives  and significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments  
 
The acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company s efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 10  upward over the last 60 days  
 
However  the company continues to face increasing costs  Moreover  higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on the bottom line 
 
 You can   
 
Itau Unibanco Banco s shares have outperformed the Zacks Foreign Banks industry over the past six months  gaining 16 1  vs 4 7   The company remains focused on building strategies to expand inorganically  In December 2016  it completed the acquisition of 40  equity stake in Itau BMG Consignado  
 
Further  it has been diversifying its loan composition with focus on origination of products with lower risks and more guarantees  However  rising operational risk  with management s expectation of non interest expenses to grow in the range of 0 5 3 5  in 2018  remains a concern

The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All 
 
Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early

117619,339134,ADSK,Will HP s Strategy Of Revamping Printing Business Pay Off ,opinion,HP Inc  s   NYSE HPQ   latest quarterly results reflect solid execution in its printing business The company s printing business  quarterly revenues have witnessed back to back year over year growth  During third quarter fiscal 2017  Printing revenues were up 6  year over year to  4 698 billion  primarily due to a 10  increase in supplies revenues Moreover  the company recorded increase in unit shipments in all the three quarters of fiscal 2017  During the first  second and third quarters  HP registered year over year growth of 6   3 6  and 1 3   respectively  in unit shipments Additionally  per reports of the independent research firm  International Data Corporation   IDC    HP has been witnessing market share improvement in Hardcopy Peripherals for the last three consecutive quarters  This indicates that the company s strategies are in the right direction Challenges in HP s Printing BusinessHP is one of the two publicly traded entities formed after the November 2015 split of Hewlett Packard Company  Besides HP Inc   the split led to the formation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE    HP primarily focuses on PCs and printing products and services Notably  over the past several years  the company s printing business has been facing challenges like sluggish demand and cut throat competition in the space which have eroded its revenues and market share It should be noted that demand for printers is not as strong as it was 10 years ago  It has witnessed a secular decline over the past several years  as consumers are increasingly favoring digital alternatives over printed materials due to their cost effectiveness Furthermore  over the past few quarters  HP has been losing market share to its Japanese rivals   Canon and Epson   due to intense price competition  These Japanese manufacturers have been able to slash prices due to a weak yen compared to the U S  dollar HP s Counter StrategiesIn an effort to revamp its printer business  HP is looking at every aspect of growth  including product innovation and differentiation  acquisition  and expansion of 3D printing capabilities Innovation is the KeyIt should be noted that if demand for anything does not remain as strong as it did once  one should resort to creative ideas in order to make innovative and differentiated products for gaining greater market share from rivals It seems that HP has learned this lesson and is focusing on developing innovative and differentiated products  Last year  the company rolled out a smart pocket sized printer for smartphones and tablets called Sprocket Furthermore  the company  last year  unveiled its A3 multifunction printers  MFPs   which are now being shipped to more than 80 countries covering all key markets  These printers are designed to hamper the traditional  55 billion A3 copier category  The all new A3 MFPs   with latest printing technology   enhance overall customer and partner experience with advanced security features  The printers also provide brighter colors  shorter production cycles and higher production throughput Trying Inorganic Growth TacticApart from focusing on developing differentiated products  HP is also looking at acquisitions to drive growth  Most recently  the company completed the acquisition of Samsung  KS 005930  Electronics  printer business Apart from bringing in additional revenues  the acquisition will help HP in expanding its printing business  as Samsung s printer business has more than 6 500 printing patents  All these will support development and manufacturing of HP printers  going forward Besides eliminating a major competitor  the above discussed deal will also facilitate price control  Also  it will give HP access to Samsung s partners and strengthen the former s position across various geographies Enhancing 3D Printing CapabilitiesThe company is also trying to enhance its 3D printing business capabilities  in an effort to revive tumbling sales  It should be noted that even though HP has been operating in this space for almost five years now  the company is way behind 3D Systems Corporation   NYSE DDD   and Stratasys Ltd    NASDAQ SSYS   Thus  in order to fortify its presence in this space  last year  HP unveiled its Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution with two models to choose from   4200 and 3200  Unlike 3D Systems and Stratasys  which target all kinds of consumers  HP emphasizes only on industrial markets due to the ability to afford a premium range of 3D printing solutions To satisfy customers in this space  HP has collaborated with various companies like Siemens  BMW  Nike Inc  NYSE NKE   and Autodesk Inc  NASDAQ ADSK    with an aim to develop more advanced 3D printing technologies for a wide array of industrial use Bottom LineHP s efforts to revive its printing business have been commendable  Looking at satisfactory results from HP s strategies  we feel the company can turnaround the printing business  and have a bigger share in the inkjet as well as 3D printer market Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see 
Bristol Myers shares have underperformed the broader market as well as the large cap pharma group this year  losing  8  in the year to date period  on persistent concerns about generic competition for several of its key products  particularly the HCV franchise  These headwinds notwithstanding  the Zacks analyst likes the company s improving operating outlook as reflected in management s raised guidance at the time of the Q1 earnings release  Bristol Myers  key products should continue to fuel top line growth  Meanwhile  Bristol Myers is working on expanding the Opdivo label which should boost results as well  With the FDA approving Merck s Keytruda  for the first line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC  the company is expected to see further loss of market share   You can      
Priceline shares performed in line with the Zacks ecommerce industry over the last one year  gaining  43 7  vs   44 3  and outperforming the broader Technology sector as well as the S P 500 index  The stock has lost ground following the May 9th quarterly release when it beat on EPS and essentially in line revenues  but offered a subdued outlook for the current period and beyond  The soft guidance notwithstanding  the Zacks analyst likes Priceline s strong position in international markets  good execution  prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position  The secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growth opportunities in the domestic market are other positives  On the flip side  weaker average daily room rates  macro headwinds  increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax related litigation remain overhangs   You can      
Phillips 66 shares have done better than the Zacks oil refining   marketing industry  but they have lagged the Zacks Energy sector  the stock is down  9 4  vs   12 4  for the industry and  8  for the Zacks Energy sector   The company s above peer group performance this year reflects the size  efficiency and strength of each of its operations  The company is on track to fortify its position in every business segment by streamlining its asset portfolio and investing in growth opportunities  The Zacks analyst likes Phillips 66 s intention to allocate money for higher margin business units like Midstream and Chemicals instead of extensive refining and marketing operations  During first quarter 2017  the company posted better than expected results following higher margins from the Refining and Chemicals businesses  However  the company s bottom line deteriorated year over year owing to reduced volumes from turnaround activities and increased expenses   You can

   Our Take
SAP has managed to deliver a robust top line performance despite what Gartner and other research firms had to say about IT spending woes  The company has established dominance over three of the most critical client demand areas  namely efficient customer engagement  human capital management and interconnected commerce network  Stiff industry rivalry and cutthroat competition in contemporary business enterprises are causing firms to scour for technological platforms that can help them outshine peers 
We believe that robust demand momentum for efficient software tools by leading business enterprises offers SAP excellent opportunities for future growth  Strong key financial metrics of the company and upward guidance revision signals brighter days ahead

117882,339397,ADSK,Oracle  In The SaaS  Cloud Acquisition Mode,opinion,Oracle  ORCL  is still on the SaaS  Cloud acquisition move  Technology in SaaS and Cloud areas are expected to lead the M A market for 2013  Today SaaS and Cloud are viewed as mainstream strategic imperatives for software vendors improving product and service areas  Third quarter SaaS company acquirers have included Oracle as well companies Autodesk  Mastercard  Rackspace  Citrix  Athenahealth  Google and IBM  SaaS accounted for 23 2  of all software industry acquisitions in 3Q12  Enterprises such as Oracle have adapted to social business solutions and more rapidly adopting initiatives  SaaS and Cloud will be used to strengthen Oracle s strategies  product and services  IT spending forecasts for growth predicted a recovery in 2013 followed by accelerating growth in 2014 2013 M A GrowthM A is Oracle s fastest growth path for 2013  In 2012  SaaS and Cloud was growing to more than 15  of global technology M A deal volume  The company is one of the most persistent cloud organizations in the industry  Oracle agreed to buy Eloqua Inc for Marketing SaaS with social networking  which went public  for  871 million and purchased Taleo  SaaS included Oracle s completed  2 billion purchase of Taleo which offerings of human capital through recruitment and managing talent through social networking and collaboration  The latest acquisition  Acme Packet  APKT  for  1 7 billion  It s cloud strategy is focused on delivering enterprise class applications and middleware however the customer wants  Oracle s integration of SaaS acquisitions in 2011 2012 have developed a full portfolio of SaaS services  Valuations for 2013 will be further measured on Oracle s ability to sell its entirely new cloud applications to new customer markets  they ve never sold to before    To help accelerate their adaptation to the innovation that technology is enabling in many industries  non technology buyers increased technology buying activity all year  ending with 10  of full year aggregate value and 12  of volume   via EY Report SaaS and Cloud TechnologyErnst   Young states that these areas specifically will be a hot bed for activity   The macroeconomic pressures that returned in late 2011 held down global technology M A activity in 2012  But  that pressure also helped clarify what s important   We saw growth in the strength of transformative megatrends   social mobile cloud  big data analytics and accelerated adaptation   while the really big ticket deals pulled back  Heading into early 2013  the short term outlook suggests a soft couple of quarters but the long term outlook for technology M A remains strong  as both technology and non technology industries have an ongoing need to adapt to disruptive technology innovation  Looking ahead  mixed signals for technology M A with possible recovery in late 2013 In 4Q12  technology M A data gave mixed signals  suggesting that the market might be approaching a near term bottom  However  the report noted 22  growth in mid priced deals  between US 100m and US 1b  in 4Q12  which suggests that the broad based need for transactions that help companies accelerate their adaptation to transformative technology innovation has not changed  What has changed is that macroeconomic uncertainty increased throughout 2012 at the same time that many valuations increased  This was demonstrated by the 16  increase in the NASDAQ  driving up the valuation risk inherent in large transformative deals  We expect the first quarter of 2013 will be seasonally down  Overall we expect a relatively stable volume of strategic deals in 2013 as compared with 2012  but with growth weighted more toward the second half of the year   via Joe Steger  PWC The report also highlights Cloud and SaaS as leaders due to strong growth trends   Cloud   SaaS  deals dominate M A  Largely on the strength of SaaS growth  the cloud SaaS megatrend  ran away  from the rest of the pack of deal driving trends in 2012  growing to more than 15  of global technology M A deal volume  Cloud SaaS deals ranged from supply chain management  marketing and retail SaaS to cloud oriented networking gear  Big data analytics deal volume saw similar growth  but from a smaller base  E Y Global Top 10 2012 Deals List Cisco Systems  Inc  acquired NDS Group Ltd SAP AG acquired

contributes to strong growth factors  The volume of deals continues to remain steady  Growth in strategic technology deals by Cloud  SaaS and other leading trends will continue to also move forward innovation through the industries  These other trends include smart mobility  social networking  big data and analytics The major catalysts driving cloud deals forward in 2013 are enterprise software companies  need to redefine their business models and find sources of sticky revenue that can replace for many of them  dwindling maintenance revenue streams  Knowing that the annuity model of cloud computing works best with multiyear payments required at the beginning of a customer engagement  enterprise software companies are looking to strengthen this area of their product portfolios  Third  the faster cloud acquisitions can be integrated into their legacy systems  the more upsell can be achieved with their large installed bases of customers  The greatest challenge many of them face however is selling entirely new cloud applications to entirely new customers they ve never sold to before  The potential of these entirely new markets however is going to be a valuation multiplier in 2013 and beyond 2013 US Technology M A Insights  PWC Free Report Download Price Waterhouse Coopers  PwC  report published   This report highlights the detailed M A activity within the technology sector and 2013 outlook of strategic acquisitions  private equity  trends  divestitures  deal environments  catalysts for Internet  IT Services  hardware and networking  software  and semiconductor sectors  PwC is seeing SaaS  mobile devices  analytics and Big Data as the drivers of current and future M A growth and a fundamental shift in deal volumes to software and Internet deals based on these technologies  The report says the most promising areas of M A activity in 2013 are mobile application development start ups who have the intellectual property it would take years for enterprise software companies to create on their own Investors OutlookSaaS  Cloud and Trends will continue to be M A deals focus on enterprise software suppliers increasing offerings  As competition increases and traditional older software companies struggle with challenges of rapid adoption of customer growth in these services of SaaS and Cloud  Be on the lookout for 2013  a new generation of SaaS  Cloud

117883,339398,ADSK,Top Trade Ideas For Week Of May 27  2014,opinion,"Autodesk Inc  NASDAQ ADSK 

Autodesk  ran higher from August 2013 until peaking in late February  The pullback from there ended near the 200 day SMA and it is just moving out of a base higher  The RSI is bullish and the MACD is bullish and rising 

Aetna Inc  NYSE AET 
Aetna  has been on a large scale trend higher for more than a year  The last dip back near the 200 day SMA was a buying opportunity but it offers another now as it peeks through resistance  The RSI is bullish and the MACD rising  both supporting more upside 
Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW 
Dow Chemical  had a run higher after leaving a Diamond in late November  It started a base in early March and is now peeking above resistance with support for more upside from a rising and bullish RSI and a MACD moving higher 
Landstar System Inc  NASDAQ LSTR  
Landstar Systems  has been moving higher since December with some fits and starts  It is at resistance now and has support to continue higher from a bullish RSI and a MACD breaking higher 
Rockwell Automation Inc  NYSE ROK 
Rockwell Automation  had a small pullback to end April and has been pushing on the 50 day SMA since then from progressively higher support  The RSI is tapping on the mid line and the MACD has turned up and is rising after a positive cross 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  as we kick off summer and head into the shortened Holiday week sees the equity markets looking solid and positive  Elsewhere Gold looks stuck in a holding pattern while Crude Oil continues to rise  The US Dollar Index and US Treasuries are both biased higher  The Shanghai Composite is doing a good job of holding support but showing no signs of strength while the Emerging Markets are biased to the upside  Volatility looks to remain subdued and biased lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts agree with the SPY and QQQ looking strong on both timeframes while the IWM lags on the weekly timeframe  The Dollar  Treasuries and Oil moving higher will cause many to raise caution on equities as they do not all move together in theory  But they can advance for long period before any change  Stick to what the price action is saying  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

117885,339400,ADSK,Autodesk  Set To Move Higher,opinion,"Autodesk Inc  NASDAQ ADSK   had a solid run higher from August last year until its peak at 58 68 at the end of February  Over that period the stock rose 80   The pullback retraced 50  of that move  and then consolidated between the 38 2  and 50  levels before turning back higher 
It has now drawn a Cup and Handle pattern after testing the prior consolidation at 55 and a minor retrace and turn higher  The pattern targets a move to 65 25  There is also an AB CD pattern that would target a move to 68 90 above 

Two styles with two targets over 18  higher  How can yo not like that  And with the bottom of the Handle at 53 50 nearby as a stop it is a low risk trade too  The Cup and Handle triggers over 55 but the AB CD is in play now  I bought a little yesterday at 54 78  Your money  your choice
