20961,242476,AEGN,5 Reasons To Like Taylor Morrison Home Corp   TMHC ,opinion,"Taylor Morrison Home Corporation   NYSE TMHC   is a home builder and land developer engaged in building single family detached and attached homes for first time buyers  move up families  and active adult  55   customers  Its three most popular brands are Taylor Morrison  Monarch and Darling Homes  concentrated in the Arizona  California  Colorado  Florida and Texas states 
The construction sector  to which it belongs  is the second of 16 Zacks classified sectors and has returned 38 1  year to date  Of the seven companies that have reported earnings this quarter  5 have topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while 2 have missed 
The building products industry  to which Taylor Morrison belongs  has the highest rank within the sector  So there are many opportunities here including Atlantia   OTC ATASY    Aegion Corp   NASDAQ AEGN    Boise Cascade   NYSE BCC    D R  Horton   NYSE DHI    Beazer Homes USA   NYSE BZH   and more  But the reasons I think Taylor Morrison stands out are as follows 
1  Growth Story
The company has generated double digit year over year revenue growth in each of the last four quarters and more than doubled its revenue between 2013 and 2018  Current year revenues look set to outpace the growth rate in any of these years 
Irrespective of the doldrums the residential construction business is in  Taylor Morrison s numbers indicate that it can continue on the growth path  In its last quarter  units sold increased over 30   orders grew 20  with backlog increasing 4 5  
The backlog represents a 7  increase in units and 1  increase in value  mainly on account of adding the entry level segment 
TMHC also has the resources to continue catering to the strong demand it s seeing  At the end of the last quarter  owned  80   and controlled lots numbered approximately 54 000 and based on the trailing 12 months  closings  this amounts to 5 3 years of supply with 2019 and 2020 procurement more or less complete 
Around 95  of guided units were in inventory at quarter end  The mid point of guided units represents around 45  of closing backlog 
Customer segmentation has been a key strategy for the company  allowing it to drive higher prices and therefore  margins  Given the growing demand at the entry level and stronger pricing at 50   its recent partnerships and acquisitions have focused on these two segments 
2  Key Partnership
Taylor Morrison has signed an  exclusive strategic partnership  with Christopher Todd Communities  CTC   which is focused on build to rent single family housing communities 
The National Multifamily Housing Council stated in their vision 2030 report that the number of renter households has been increasing by 800 000 a year since 2010  So building 4 6 million new rental units over the next 10 years will be required to cater to this demand  Management says that while there are approximately 16 million single family rental homes in the market today  new home production dedicated to this segment is less than 5  of the total  So there is significant scope for expansion 
CTC is a relatively small player in the space  but it s differentiated from other players because of its focus on building lifestyle communities  This differentiating factor fits Taylor Morrison s somewhat premium brand image  which is what makes the deal a perfect fit  Moreover  this is likely the reason it is a hit with millennials  which comprise 50  of its communities  This demographic group wants to spend the least amount of time and money on maintenance  so they prefer rental apartments where all or substantially all of the maintenance work is taken care of 
CTC s experience on the property management side is what Taylor Morrison is banking on  So while TMHC will focus on land acquisition  after burning through CT s current inventory   development and construction  CT will be in charge of overseeing design  planning  building science  leasing and property management 
The partnership plans to develop 2 000 single family rental homes to be delivered over the next few years in Arizona alone  Others will follow  including some from TMHC land holdings  Management doesn t intend to hold the properties for much longer than a year after completion  so that s when sales will be recorded  CT has high renewal rates  and 90  of people that don t renew are looking to purchase a property  So this may open up additional opportunities for TMHC 
Additionally  it will increase scale efficiencies in both purchasing and construction  thereby lowering cost 
3  Strategic Acquisition
In the fourth quarter of 2018  it closed the acquisition of AV Homes  AV increased its share in five important markets  Orlando  Phoenix  Charlotte  Raleigh and Dallas Ft  Worth  while adding Jacksonville  Management said that the combined company would be among the top five in six markets and top 10 in 14 markets  thus helping it scale and drive profitability 
The acquisition also added two important customer segments  Taylor Morrison was always associated with an upwardly mobile  second home purchaser  or slightly more premium segment  The acquisition has added to the entry level  and augmented  particularly in the Orlando  Phoenix and Raleigh areas  the active adult 55  segment  thus broadening its scope  Affordable housing for the entry level first time buyer is a particularly hot segment  where demand exceeds supply  So it s an important place to be in 
When management announced the acquisition  they expected annualized synergies of  30 million  but on the last conference call  they said they were on track to achieve annualized synergies of  50 million  This was despite the fact that the acquisition increased its headcount by 20  
The main downsides were the  400 million of debt it brought that the company has already started paying off and the gross margin impact from the addition of a segment with a lower margin profile 
4  Economy Is Supportive
A very big economic factor pushing home sales are interest rates  particularly on 30 year fixed rate maturities because that s the one most home buyers go for  According to Freddie Mac  that rate is now down 1 06 percentage points from last year to 3 65   It expects the fourth quarter and 2019 rate to average at 3 7  and 4   respectively  Fannie Mae and Mortgage Bankers Association expect the 2019 average to be 3 9  and 3 8   respectively 
Rates are expected to remain low in 2020 as trade war uncertainties have pushed investors to the safe haven of treasuries  which is keeping interest rates down  As a result  refinancing activity is high and millennials are jumping into the action 
Management said that low interest rates are encouraging entry level buyers while increasing the confidence of move up buyers  both of which are helping the company    
Additionally  the low unemployment rate  rising wages and disposable income and a modest inflation rate are other factors helping demand

higher demand for these products that contributed to sales growth  Earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  margin in the quarter was recorded flat year over year at 13   as benefits from lower furnace rebuild and start up costs as well as higher sales volumes were partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input cost inflation The Roofing segment s net sales grew 11  year over year

Consensus Estimate  while revenues missed the same due to lower revenues across segments and margin pressure  Notably  the company lowered Infrastructure Solutions and Corrosion Protection s revenue projection Adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 40 cents declined 11 1  from the year ago profit level  Total revenues of  308 8 million lagged the consensus mark of  327 million by 5 5   Also  the reported figure was down 9 1  on a year over year basis On a same store basis  revenues fell 6  due to lower contribution from a large coating project at Corrosion Protection Aegion Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross margin of 21 6  remained on par with the year ago period  However  adjusted operating margin contracted 100 bps year over year to 6 4  owing to lack of high margin coating project contributions within Corrosion Protection Segmental PerformanceInfrastructure Solutions  Revenues in the segment inched up 0 3  year over year to  156 1 million  Excluding exited or to be exited businesses  the same grew 2  from the prior year period  driven by strong improvements in crew productivity in the North America CIPP business Adjusted gross and operating margins rose 70 bps and 60 bps  respectively  during the reported quarter  The upside was driven by a solid uptick in the North America CIPP business and the exit of underperforming international CIPP operations  In fact  gross margins in the North America CIPP business improved nearly 200 bps from the prior year New orders in the segment jumped more than 40  from the year ago period  backed by strongest quarterly wins in the North America CIPP business  Segment s backlog  excluding the impact of exited or to be exited businesses  came in at  310 9 million as of Sep 30  2019  marginally down from the corresponding period of 2018  The decline was mainly due to softness in the AsiaPacific Fyfe business  caused by economic and geopolitical challenges Corrosion Protection  The segment s revenues deteriorated 28 1  year over year to  75 9 million  Excluding exited or to be exited operations  revenues were down 21  year over year due to the absence of contributions from large Middle East coating projects completed in the prior year  Market softness in the Canadian cathodic protection business added to the woes Adjusted gross margin contracted 280 bps in the quarter  which can be attributed to top line weakness  Adjusted operating margin also shrank a significant 620 bps year over year due to the above mentioned headwinds Backlog  excluding the impact of exited or to be exited businesses  in the segment came in at  134 8 million as of Sep 30  2019  up 7 6  year over year Energy Services  The segment s revenues during the reported quarter totaled  76 8 million  down 2  year over year  The decrease was primarily due to lower construction revenues  partly offset by higher maintenance and turnaround volumes Nonetheless  adjusted gross and operating margins improved a whopping 260 bps and 250 bps  respectively  from the year ago level  backed by significant improvement in construction profits following isolated project challenges in the prior year Backlog in the said segment grew 11 7  from the year ago quarter to  213 4 million as of Sep 30  2019 Financial UpdateAegion s cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30  2019 were  52 million

comparable period of 2018 Backlog as of Sep 30  2019 totaled  683 million  Excluding the impact of exited or to be exited businesses  the said metric grew 5  year over year  driven by a 16  increase in orders Update on Strategic ActionsIn 2017  Aegion had embarked on a series of strategic actions targeted to generate more predictable and sustainable long term earnings growth  In October 2019  the company divested the CIPP contracting operations in the Netherlands and a 55  interest in the Tite Liner joint venture in Mexico The company expects planned divestitures and its exit from the remaining international businesses to be completed by the end of 2019  except the Northern Ireland operation  which is expected to complete by early 2020 Sale of the Middle East unit will substantially complete within 2019  however  some immaterial wind down activities will extend through Jun 30  2020 due to completion of projects remaining in backlog 2019 Guidance TweakedAegion expects a modest improvement in 2019 adjusted EPS on the back of a strong backlog position and market outlook in core businesses The company predicts revenue growth to be flat to slightly down in the Infrastructure Solutions business  Minus the effect of exited or to be exited operations  its top line is projected to grow 1 2  from a year ago  compared with 2 4  expected earlier   Adjusted gross margins in the said segment are likely to improve 250 300 bps compared with 150 250 bps projected earlier Revenues in the Corrosion Protection unit are anticipated to decline 23 26  year over year versus 15 20  expected earlier  Exclusive of the impact of discontinued or to be discontinued operations  revenues might decline 13 16  from the prior year level  5 10  projected earlier   The segment s adjusted gross margins will probably be 21 22  In the Energy Services segment  revenues will possibly fall 2 4  year over year  thanks to lower turnaround activities  Adjusted gross margins are projected to expand in the band of 50 100 bps Zacks Rank   Peer ReleasesAegion currently sports a Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy   You can see  United Rentals   NYSE URI   reported   wherein earnings and

surprise trend  Its earnings surpassed expectations in 13 of the last 14 quarters  Moreover  second quarter earnings and revenues rose 23 1  and 21 1  year over year  respectively  Also  adjusted

efficiency in using shareholders  funds  The company believes that positive construction market outlook and recent acquisitions will boost results in the upcoming quarters Let s delve deeper into the factors that substantiate its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Key Growth DriversStrong End Market Demand   United Rentals serves the following three principal end markets for equipment rental in North America   industrial and other non construction  commercial construction as well as residential construction  In second quarter 2019  equipment rentals contributed 86  to the company s total revenues  Overall construction market scenario were positive through first half 2019  The company expects upbeat results in the second half as well  given improved demand condition in construction end markets served  Infrastructure  especially transportation and power are major tailwinds   However  end market demand is broad based  with strength in the United States and Canada Meanwhile  the company generates a substantial portion of its revenues from the energy sector  Courtesy of this factor  United Rentals is well poised to benefit from any improvement in energy sector activity in the upcoming months  The company also expects its equipment rental services to experience solid demand in 2019  Notably  weakness in the upstream business was observed during first half of this year but downstream or midstream businesses are still strong Expansion Via Acquisitions  United Rentals is expanding geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures  On Nov 30  2018  the company announced the acquisition of WesternOne Rentals   Sales LP  a leading regional equipment rental provider in Western Canada  The acquisition enabled United Rentals to expand services to Alberta  British Columbia and Manitoba Moreover  the company acquired BlueLine on October 2018  The buyout continues to be significant as it boosts United Rentals  capacity across the largest metropolitan areas in North America  including the U S  coasts as well as the Gulf South and Ontario  The buyout is likely to increase the company s fleet by more than 46 000 rental assets across 114 branch locations For 2019  the company is focusing on its strategy to improve profitability through superior standard of service to customers and acquisitions to expand core equipment rental business along with continued expansion of trench  power and pump footprint as well as tool offerings HeadwindsAcquisitions Pressurize Near Term Margins  Although consistent acquisitions are expected to generate long term growth for United Rentals  these have exerted pressure on margins  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43 5  in the first quarter  calling for a decline of 150 basis points  bps  year over year  In the second quarter  adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 110 bps to 46 9   The downside was primarily caused by the impact of BlueLine and Baker buyouts  The company also trimmed full year guidance to reflect a slightly slower than expected pace for the BlueLine integration as well as historic bad weather in several key regions in the past quarter  Adjusted EBITDA is projected between  4 35 billion and  4 5 billion  versus  4 35  4 55 billion projected earlier  compared with  3 86 billion in 2018 Higher Costs  Ongoing higher freight and fuel costs mar growth prospects of the company  Also  labor

cash flow generation  Notably  these businesses enable the company to generate more predictable earnings and returns in excess of the cost of capital Since the inception of the strategic move  it exited 22 international contracting markets that lacked potential  scale and operating leverage to deliver consistent profits  Notably  these markets generated less than 10  of its total revenues and more than  17 million adjusted operating losses from 2014 to 2018 In North America  it divested highly volatile upstream businesses and the Fyfe North America contracting unit  Evidently  in second quarter 2019  the company s adjusted gross margin improved 10 basis points  bps  and adjusted operating margin expanded 50 bps year over year  owing to restructuring and cost containment efforts  Its total revenues  excluding contribution from the exited businesses  had a compound annual growth rate of 4  in the past five year  The company believes that these initiatives  which are likely to be completed by the end of the year  will aid overall performance in 2019 and beyond Solid Segmental Prospects  Given the above mentioned initiatives  its three segments   namely Infrastructure Solutions  Corrosion Protection and Energy Services   are poised to come up with solid results going forward In the oil and gas market  the company is currently focused on well positioned and stable midstream and downstream markets  along with its core municipal water and wastewater markets  It also emphasizes on improving North America Corrpro operations  which lead to the generation of nearly two thirds of revenues from the Corrosion Protection segment through cathodic protection offerings In the Infrastructure Solutions unit  it intends to leverage North America and European manufacturing footprint to expand third party tube sales  which is a higher margin and lower risk model for serving international markets In the last reported quarter  the Energy Services business saw strong year over year improvement  driven by strength in its core maintenance activities  The company expects the segment s backlog to grow in the third quarter  This will in turn position it for business growth in 2020 Technical Enhancement Bodes Well  Aegion has increased investments in technology over the last few quarters  Resultantly  it is expected to bear fruits in 2020 and 2021  The company s annual R D investment more than doubled in the past three years  Moreover  it plans to invest more in technology over the next few years to build a cultural mindset regarding innovation Notably  it has significantly invested in the commercialization process  Also  the company has built internal mechanical service reinstatement technology and new UV Cure felt liner  Aegion is developing a new external weld coating technology and Liquid Ring  which is a more reliable and cost effective method for applying liquid epoxy coatings to cross country midstream pipelines These technical enhancements will help the company to come up with improved results going forward Solid Growth Prospect  Aegion  which shares space with frontdoor  inc    NASDAQ FTDR    Gibraltar Industries  Inc

Surprise   Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit decreased 14 2  from the year ago level to  52 8 million  Adjusted gross margin of 19 1   however  improved 20 basis points  bps   This upside was

to  6 5 million  However  adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps to 2 3  year over year Segmental PerformanceInfrastructure Solutions  revenues slipped 2 1  year over year to  131 5 million  While excluding the impact of exited or to be exited businesses  revenues inched up 2   driven by a solid uptick in North America CIPP business along with a fewer impacts of manpower and equipment challenges as compared to the prior year period Adjusted gross and operating margins rose 370 and 450 bps  respectively  during the reported quarter  An 8  reduction in adjusted operating expenses owing to cost cutting and restructuring initiatives  led to this uptrend Segment s backlog came in at  305 2 million as of Mar 31  2019  down 12 6  from the corresponding period of 2018 Revenues in the Corrosion Protection deteriorated 34 3  year over year to  64 5 million  Revenues  excluding the impact of the exited or to be exited operations  also dwindled 18  due to loss of contributions

cash charges from the announced actions to be approximately  12  16 million in 2019 2019 GuidanceAegion expects a modest improvement in adjusted EPS on the back of a strong backlog position and market outlook in its core businesses  It anticipates strong top lines and profitability boosts in Infrastructure Solutions  Energy Services and the cathodic protection business within Corrosion Protection The company predicts 1 3  revenue growth in the Infrastructure Solutions business  While minus the effect of the exited or to be exited operations  its top line is projected to grow 6 8   supported by

Protection unit are anticipated to decline 15 20  year over year  Not counting the impact of the discontinued or to be discontinued operations  revenues might slide 3 5   The reported segment s

21153,242668,AEGN,Aegion  AEGN  Set For A Strong 2018 Despite Cost Headwinds,opinion,On May 8  we issued an updated research report on Aegion Corporation   NASDAQ AEGN    The company is likely to benefit from strong order flow  demand in the North America CIPP  cured in place pipe  rehabilitation business and improving margins in cathodic protection business  However  while its restructuring actions will lead to cost savings  restructuring charges will dent margins in the near term  Higher labor cost also remains a concern  Aegion reported first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share  which declined 28  year over year  However  earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Total revenues in the quarter remained flat year over year  at  325 million  as record revenues of the Energy Services segment were offset by lost contribution from the large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project  The revenue figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  299 million  Strong Order Flow  Upbeat Earnings View for 2018 In first quarter 2018  Aegion witnessed an increase of 1  in new orders to  353 million  overcoming the impact of exiting the Fyfe North America structural construction business in fiscal 2017  As of Mar 31  2018  the company s contract backlog improved 9  year over year to  718 million  Despite the impact of inclement winter that affected parts of the United States and Canada for the first four months of the year  Aegion s order flow remained strong  The company anticipates recovering the lost volumes in the first quarter due to harsh weather within the Infrastructure Solutions segment and noted positive momentum in its U S  and Canada cathodic protection businesses  For 2018  total revenues are expected to be essentially flat with 2017 s record results  due to the non recurrence of more than  90 million in revenues in 2017 from the large deepwater project  Gross margin and adjusted operating margin improvement is projected to lie between 50 basis points  bps  and 100 bps  The company expects year over year improvement of more than 30  in earnings in 2018  Management anticipates the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23 24  including the impact of the tax reform  Segments Poised for Growth For the Infrastructure Solutions segment  further penetration into the pressure pipe market driven by new product development  investments in underserved North America CIPP regions and improved product sales will bolster results  Moreover  the increasing need for pipeline rehabilitation supports a long term sustainable market for segment  In the Corrosion Protection segment  significant contributions from large international robotic field joint coating projects will aid the segment s growth  Further  ongoing momentum in the U S  and Canada cathodic protection businesses bodes well for the segment  The cathodic protection business  margins are gaining from the multiple leadership changes in the first half of 2017 and the aggressive focus on improved project execution and labor utilization  The design and installation of cathodic protection systems to help prevent pipeline corrosion have historically contributed around 50  of the revenues for the segment  There are over one million miles of regulated pipelines in North America  which remain the safest and most cost effective mode of oil and gas transmission  It remains an attractive and growing market which Aegion plans to invest in for future growth  The Energy services segment has delivered improved year over year performance for five consecutive quarters which is anticipated to continue in the near term  Restructuring efforts undertaken in the past are also yielding results  Aegion has long term relationships with oil refinery and industrial customers on the West Coast through the Energy Services segment and plans to leverage those relationships to expand services  There are opportunities in other industries on the West Coast such as oil and oil product terminals  chemicals  industrial gas and power to leverage its experience in maintenance and construction services  Restructuring to Drive Long Term Benefits  Hurt Near Term Margins The company is currently implementing its realignment and restructuring plan  The plans include the divestiture of the pipe coating and insulation businesses in Louisiana  It also involves the exit of non pipe related contract applications for the Tyfo system in North America  Further  the company intends to reduce corporate and other operating costs as well as right size its cathodic protection services operation in Canada  These actions will reduce exposure in the North American upstream oil and gas markets and generate more predictable and sustainable long term earnings growth  During 2017  the company also concluded a detailed assessment of the Infrastructure Solutions  CIPP businesses in Australia and Denmark  These restructuring actions will help reduce consolidated annual expenses by over  20 million  Cost reductions are anticipated to be fully realized in 2018  However  Aegion anticipates total restructuring and impairment charges to be between  117 million and  120 million  Most of this is expected to be completed before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018  Cost Concerns Aegion is witnessing a tighter labor market across North America  It is expected to become more challenging as it enters the peak of construction season in the upcoming months  The company is reviewing options to simplify its operating and tax organizational structure under the new U S  tax laws  Consequently  it may incur additional restructuring charges related to changes to its legal entity structure and related intercompany transactions   The company has outperformed the  in the past year  The stock has gained 22 5   while the industry recorded growth of 9 5   Aegion carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the industry include PGT Innovations  Inc    NYSE PGTI    Armstrong World Industries  Inc    NYSE AWI   and Installed Building Products  Inc    NYSE IBP    While PGT Innovations sports a Zacks Rank  1

21194,242709,AEGN,Aegion  AEGN  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Aegion Corporation   NASDAQ AEGN   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 28  after the closing bell  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings came in line with the prior year quarter while revenues improved 11   Continued momentum across key markets for all three segments translated to strong orders and revenues in the quarter  However  this was offset by the impact of restructuring activity in the Infrastructure Solutions segment  In the last four reported quarters  Aegion s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates on two occasions while missing the other two  The company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7 05   Aegion Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aegion is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Aegion s Earnings ESP is  14 28  as the Most Accurate estimate of 20 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  Aegion currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s rank combined with a negative ESP makes positive surprise quite unlikely this season  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Factors at Play Aegion is undergoing a series of strategic actions per which the company has planned to divest the Corrosion Protection s pipe coating and insulation business in Louisiana  Per the plan  the company has approved to exit all non pipe related contract applications for the Tyfo Fibrwrap system in North America  restructure Corrosion Protection s operations in Canada and implement cost reduction actions as well  The company will continue to face performance issues subject to restructuring actions  which along with associated costs will impact fourth quarter earnings  Nevertheless  Aegion s strong end markets  strong backlog and order growth will aid fourth quarter results  Notably  per the company s contract backlog on Sep 30  2017 was  756 million  a  141 million increase year over year  In the first nine month period of 2017  Aegion noted a 26  rise in new orders to  1 1 billion  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates  total backlog for Aegion in the fourth quarter will be around  740 million  up 4  year over year  Segment wise  the backlog for the Corrosion Protection  Infrastructure Solutions and Energy Services will be around  180 million   350 million and  210 million  respectively  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates  revenues for the Corrosion Protection segment are projected at  98 million  a 18  year over year drop reflecting the impact of restructuring actions and challenges in the U S  cathodic protection business  However  revenues for the Energy Services segment are anticipated to rise 3  to  67 million benefiting from improved backlog levels  The Infrastructure Solutions segment s revenues are projected to grow 11  year over year to  152 million  The Infrastructure Solutions segment is poised for growth as the North America CIPP rehabilitation business continues to witness persistent expansion owing to good market demand  Further  improved pressure pipe market penetration on the back of new product development will boost revenues  Per the Zacks model  total revenues are currently pegged at  332 5 million  3  growth over the prior year quarter  The Corrosion Protection segment is expected to report operating profit of around  1 4 million  a substantial drop from the  10 1 million reported in the prior year quarter  The Energy Services segment s operating income is projected at  1 18 million compared with  1 4 million in the prior year comparable period  However  the Infrastructure Solutions segment will log 21  improvement in profit to  12 6 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 23 cents  a decline of 48  year over year  Over the past year  Aegion has underperformed the industry it belongs to  The company has gained around 4 8   while the  registered growth of 16 5    Stocks That Warrant a Look Here are some stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL   has an Earnings ESP of  9 62  and a Zacks Rank  1  Its shares have rallied 35  in a year s time  You can see   MasTec Inc    NYSE MTZ   has an Earnings ESP of  8 53  and a Zacks Rank

21258,242773,AEGN,Should You Drop Aegion Corp From Your Portfolio ,opinion,"Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  reported a largely weak 4Q2015 in which EPS declined by a double digit percentage  The management warned that current quarter bottom line will likely fall below a similar period a year ago as foul winds persist 
Weak market conditions and currency headwinds played a major role in clouding Aegion s performance in the last quarter  But what will 2016 be like for the company  This Aegion analysis article examines the company s strengths and weaknesses so that you can make investment decision based on fact rather than myth  But first  here is quick recap of Aegion s earnings results in the last quarter 
4Q2015 highlight
Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  posted 4Q2015 EPS of  0 36  a penny better than the consensus estimate but down 25  YoY  On an adjusted basis  the company posted EPS loss of  0 91  a penny worse than a similar quarter a year ago 
Revenue reading of  331 million fell 6  YoY and also missed the consensus target of  338 million 
The chart below shows Aegion s revenue and cost of revenue for the last five quarters 

What s exciting about Aegion 
The company is right sizing
Because the management of Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  understands the unfavorable conditions in the energy sector  they are aggressively working to reduce the company s exposure to more risky businesses  For example  Aegion has recently significantly lowered its exposure to certain typically high cost North American oil regions 
This operations realignment measure is both expected to preserve cash and lower operating cost burden  It is a laudable move as the company battles multiple challenges because of the price decay in the oil market 
Efficiency drive
Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  is underway with a restructuring plan that is specifically designed to make the company operate more efficiently  Therefore  what the management is doing is looking for opportunities to trim costs  The restructuring initiative kicked off as a response to the declining crude oil prices and Aegion has been gradually scaling the program to reign in on costs everywhere 
Aegion s ongoing restructuring efforts are expected to yield roughly  15 million in cost synergies with the bulk of the saving expected to fall in 2016 
Aggressive debt reduction program
Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  finished 2015 with  337 8 million in long term debt  which decreased from  351 1 million in the previous year  The management recently reiterated its commitment to continue strengthening the balance sheet by paying down the outstanding debt  This year  the management has scheduled to reduce the debt by  18 million 
Capability expansion
In the recent years  Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  has tended to increase investment to boost capacity in more lucrative segments such as midstream and pressure pipe markets  As part of the efforts to accelerate expansion in pressure pipeline market  Aegion acquired Underground Solutions  thus adding to its portfolio key tools  PVC technology and talents to enable it to succeed in the segment 
Acquisition of Underground Technology cost Aegion  85 million and the management expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings this year 
The idea of doubling down efforts in pressure pipe market is to unlock more sustainable long term revenue growth opportunities 
Positive outlook
Despite troubles in the energy sector  Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  is looking forward to favorable conditions in many of its end markets  The management is citing municipal water and wastewater systems rehabilitation as a particularly promising segment in 2016 
It is estimated that trenchless water system rehabilitation opportunity in North American is worth more than  1 billion  Given its brand reputation  expertise and scale  AEGN is well placed to grab a large pie of the market 
Large contracts
In 4Q2015  Aegion signed a multi year involving providing pipe coating and insulation solutions  The contract should guarantee a significant level of revenue inflow for a couple of years  thus mitigating the pressures of weak macroeconomic conditions 
Solid backlog
Although 2015 was largely a challenging year for Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  as it was for many other companies because of oil price rout and global economic slowdown  the company still management to grow its backlog in the year  Aegion s backlog in 2015 rose a decent 2 4  to  776 5 million  defying an  11 1 million hit courtesy of currency headwind 
What s worrying about Aegion 
Intense competition
Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  has a serious war to confront in North American upstream market in 2016  Because of the collapse of crude prices  customers have reacted by cutting their expenditures  The result is that upstream projects have become few and those few available are hotly contested 
Adverse impact of realignment
As Aegion tries to position itself to avoid taking more serious hit from crude oil price rout  the company risks losing revenue  It has significantly narrowed exposure to the more troubled North American oil region  but it could lose roughly  100 million from that region in 2016  Such a shock to the topline could be felt right down at the bottom line 
Currency headwind
A strong U S  dollar against a basket of major global currencies is a thorn in the flesh of Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN   Unfavorable shifts in the forex market caused a negative hit to Aegion s financials in 2015 and the problem could be more severe in 2016 
The cost of restructuring
To cut cost  Aegion will send home some 652 employees  But it will cost money to retrench the workers  It is estimated that Aegion could face pre tax cash charges of  7 to  8 million in the form of employee severance  benefits and other costs related to the workforce reduction  The bulk of the retrenchment related charges are expected to fall in the current quarter  That further complicates the picture for Aegion given that the company is already taking a beating from oil price rout and slowdown in various segments of its business 
Capital deployment
Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  recently declared a fresh buyback program that will begin after the completion of the existing program sometime this year  The new buyback program is also  20 million same as the existing one that was to cover 2015 and a bit of 2016 
Takeaway
Aegion Corp  NASDAQ AEGN  is trying to right size  which is a great move for the company to survive prevailing pressures in its industry  But the fact of the matter is that meaningful growth may be out until perhaps after 2016  Current holders may be encouraged to maintain the ticker in the portfolio but aspiring shareholders may have to wait until there are genuine signs of the clouds clearing ",2016-04-03,InvestCorrectly,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-drop-aegion-corp-(nasdaq:aegn)-from-your-portfolio-200123690,200123690

Second  the winding down of the energy services upstream work  part of the downsizing in central California and the decision to exit the Permian Basin  given difficult market conditions  negatively impacted second quarter margins more than anticipated  It is likely to hurt margins in the near future again Nevertheless  Aegion remains confident that the tailwinds in the N A  municipal pipe rehabilitation market  an improving U S  midstream market and execution of the Appomattox contract will build positive momentum in 2016 and 2017  The company expects improved earnings in second half 2016 despite ongoing challenges in the energy markets Aegion recently completed three small international acquisitions   two of which were in the second quarter  First  the company invested approximately  3 million to acquire the remaining international legal rights not covered when it purchased the Latin America operations back in 2012  Aegion now has access to an additional 72 countries in Europe  Africa and the Middle East

As anticipated  a portion of the backlog decline was also in the West Coast downstream market  reflecting a slowdown in turn around activity in second half 2016 and the absence of additional work  The company expects that backlog comparison for the remainder of the year will also be affected by the upstream downsizing Aegion Corporation carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the industry include Argan  Inc    NYSE AGX    Gibraltar Industries  Inc    NASDAQ ROCK   and United Rentals  Inc    NYSE URI    These three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aegion-(aegn)-expects-improved-2h16-despite-headwinds-200153818,200153818
21269,242784,AEGN,Jacobs  JEC  Q4 Earnings  Will The Stock Beat Estimates  ,opinion,"Premium technical services company  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016  ended Sep 30  2016  results before the market opens on Nov 22  2016 
In the last four quarters  the company has delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 8 50  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Play
Jacobs  business exposure in diversified end markets is expected to reinforce financials in the fiscal fourth quarter 
Increased transportation spending of the government authorities of Australia and the UK  higher demand for power generation services  rise in aviation demand and growth in spending of biopharmaceutical majors would likely boost Jacobs  revenues in the quarter under review  Also  the company believes that its strategic operational efficacy enhancement programs would help widen margins in the quarter 
However  several persistent headwinds within the construction industry might hurt the company s results  For instance  weak energy and mining market conditions have been hindering growth for industrial and construction companies like Jacobs  This is because low prices of oil and core metals have forced the energy and mining companies to postpone  reduce or even cut investments  At the same time  a stronger U S  currency might weigh over Jacobs  foreign revenues and earnings in the to be reported quarter 
In Aug  2016  Jacobs narrowed its earnings per share  EPS  guidance to the range of  2 95  3 15 per share from the previously guided  2 90  3 20 band for fiscal 2016
