meaningful  as well as how management uses these measures in our 10 K When used on this call  net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction based expenses  and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share  Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher  Chairman and CEO  Scott Hill  Chief Financial Officer  and Ben Jackson  our President  I ll now turn the call over to Scott Scott Hill    Chief Financial OfficerThanks Warren  Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us today  I ll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our solid fourth quarter and record 2019 results Fourth quarter net revenues totaled  1 3 billion  driven by trading and clearing revenues of  626 million and data and listings revenues of  672 million  Within data and listings  data services revenues totaled  559 million  up 4  on a constant currency basis  For the full year  data services revenues grew 5  on a constant currency revenues basis Adjusted operating expenses totaled  570 million in the fourth quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased year over year to  0 95  For the full year  adjusted EPS were  3 88  up 8  versus 2018  We have grown adjusted EPS every single year since we first listed on the New York Stock Exchange 14 years ago 2019 operating cash flows of  2 7 billion were up 5  versus 2018  yielding record free cash flow of  2 3 billion  Turning to Slide 5  you can see that we returned nearly 90  of that  2 3 billion to shareholders  19  more than in the prior year  This record  2 1 billion of capital return was more than double the amount we returned the year prior to our acquisition of IDC in 2015  And importantly  we did all of this while maintaining our target leverage and investing in key strategic initiatives across our trading  data  fixed income  mortgage and digital assets network As we turn to 2020  we remain committed to continuing to grow our capital return as we grow  Our Board recently authorized a 9  increase in our quarterly dividend  We have grown the dividend roughly 14  a year since 2013  while over the same period  adjusted EPS has grown around 15   Our Board also approved a 20  increase in our share repurchase authorizations to  2 4 billion  which will allow us to increase our quarterly buyback level to around  400 million  while also providing capacity to act opportunistically Now let s move to Slide 6  where I will provide an overview of the performance of our trading and clearing segment  Trading and clearing revenue totaled  626 million in the fourth quarter  down 4  on a constant currency basis In energy  while fourth quarter revenues were down 5  versus a strong fourth quarter of last year  full year revenues grew 4  on a constant currency basis  This record performance was driven by strong growth in higher RPC products such as our Dutch natural gas contract  or TTF  in addition to other crude and refined products  Importantly  the open interest that built throughout 2019  as anticipated  translated in the strong volumes in January  with record energy ADV up 29  year over year  improved RPC and open interest up 12  versus the prior year period In our Ag market  fourth quarter revenues increased 5  year over year  including strength in cocoa  coffee and cotton  2020 is also off to a strong start with January volumes increasing 30  year over year  increasing RPC and open interest approaching record levels and up 14  year over year In our financial futures complex  fourth quarter revenues were down 13   driven primarily by lower interest rate volumes  However  sterling open interest ended the year up 20   and is up 36  at the end of January  Volumes grew 72  in January and RPC was stable Finally  in our fixed income and credit businesses  revenues totaled  96 million in the fourth quarter  This compares to  83 million last year and includes a full quarter of Simplifile  which we acquired in June of last year Next on Slide 7  I will discuss the data and listings segment  Fourth quarter data services revenue totaled a record  559 million  up 4  on a constant currency basis versus the prior year  This marks the 40th consecutive quarter of year over year data services revenue growth  For the full year  revenues grew 5  at constant currency and landed right in the middle of the range we provided a year ago Fourth quarter growth in pricing and analytics was 4  on a constant currency basis  A challenging business environment in Europe partially offset solid growth in North America  accelerating growth in Asia Pacific and double digit growth in our Index business  We expect the impact from the challenges in Europe to persist through the first quarter  after which we anticipate absolute revenue and growth in pricing and analytics will accelerate  yielding 5  to 6  growth for the full year Exchange data and feeds grew 2  year over year on a constant currency basis  driven by solid growth in futures data  offset by softer trends at the NYSE  Desktops and connectivity growth was 7  year over year on a constant currency basis  and similar to the last few quarters  was driven by strong performance in our ICE Global Network offering  where network capacity grew 14  versus the prior year Finally  in our listings business  revenues totaled  113 million in the fourth quarter  The NYSE listed 12 IPOs during the quarter and 58 for the full year  During 2019  the NYSE helped customers raise a total of nearly  112 billion of capital  ranking first globally in total capital raised for the ninth consecutive year I will conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some 2020 guidance  We expect 2020 data revenues to be in the range of  2 29 billion to  2 33 billion  This includes revenues of  560 million to  565 million in the first quarter and assumes further sequential improvement in terms of both dollars and growth each quarter as we move through the year Moving to expenses  we anticipate full year adjusted operating expenses between  2 275 billion and  2 325 billion  As I noted on our third quarter call  you need to add roughly  50 million to the 2019 base to account for Simplifile  the reclass of certain licensing expenses and a few onetime items that we highlighted as we moved through the year  Off that base  and very consistent with prior years  compensation expenses will increase by  30 million to  40 million Expenses related to revenue growth are expected to increase by  15 million to  25 million  And finally  we will make  20 million to  30 million in incremental investments in our technology platforms  as well as key growth initiatives such as ICE Futures Abu Dhabi and Bakkt  These investments will be largely funded by  15 million to  25 million of expense efficiencies  Finally  we expect  570 million to  580 million in the first quarter for expenses  including around  5 million of severance  which we do not expect to recur in later quarters In summary  we delivered a solid finish to another record year  We once again grew revenues  operating income  free cash flow and capital return  And at the same time  we invested across our business and are well positioned to once again meet the needs of our customers  grow the top and bottom line  and deliver enhanced shareholder returns during 2020 and beyond I will be happy to take your questions during Q A  but for now  I will hand it to Jeff to expand on some of our strategic initiatives as we enter the new year Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Scott  and good morning to everyone on the call  Please turn to Slide 9  2019 marked our 14th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share  It s a track record that reflects the quality of our strategy  and more importantly  the execution of that strategy As growth opportunities emerge around the world  it s our technology  expertise and culture that enable us to quickly and efficiently capture these opportunities  It s an approach that empowers product innovation  and it s a proven model that s yielded both consistent growth and shareholder value creation In our natural gas markets  shale production in North America is surging  while legacy LNG contracts across Asia are unwinding  Similar to the evolution of crude oil markets a number of years ago  the liberalization of natural gas is driving demand for a globally recognized benchmark  And our European natural gas complex  led by our TTF contract  is quickly emerging as the Brent of natural gas with average daily volume up over 100  in 2019 and up 56  on average annually over the last five years  As liberalization takes hold  what were once regional markets such as European TTF and our Japan Korea Marker  called JKM  are becoming increasingly interconnected and global in nature  And it s this evolution that drove record natural gas revenues  up 16  year over year in 2019 In our oil markets  we have invested in building a global platform  Today  our oil complex spans over 600 products  including locational spreads  product spreads  refining spreads and products that are built off our benchmark energy contracts such as Brent Crude and Gas Oil We continue to invest in our Energy business  During the fourth quarter  we announced the formation of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi  known as IFAD  In November  the Abu Dhabi Supreme Petroleum Council announced plans to lift designation restrictions on Murban crude  allowing barrels to move more freely and to price against our futures contract  which we plan to launch later this year  subject to regulatory approval  Murban crude is a highly fungible and sought after grade of oil  and it s utilized by a wide range of global customers  including over 60 refineries in the Asia Pacific region  As we have done in the past  we are applying our blueprint for building new marketplaces by partnering with key industry participants such as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company  as well as nine of the world s largest trading firms  including Shell  BP  Vitol and Petro China  Leveraging ICE s current technology and infrastructure  the Murban crude contract is expected to clear alongside of our global oil business at ICE Clear Europe  bringing capital efficiencies to customers that are underpinned by our flagship Brent crude oil and low sulfur gas oil contracts  as well as our leading Asian oil complex Our performance in the global energy market is a product of the investments that we have made  some more than a decade ago  and our commitment to staying close to our customers  It s an approach that permeates this organization  creating long term relationships and helping to drive effective and efficient product innovation  This approach is also important to our data business  where we are uniquely positioned to leverage our distribution and our infrastructure to create new content and to expand the breadth of our multi asset class offering For example  in early January  we announced that we will be rolling out a suite of new ESG solutions  including climate risk analytics and ESG reference data  Leveraging our current infrastructure and reference data expertise  customers will soon have access to terms and conditions on nearly 500 ESG data points such as a company s greenhouse gas emissions or its board diversity metrics  This will not be a rating  and we will not be providing any opinion  Instead  we will provide our customers with a standardized set  consisting of the critical information they need to better assess ESG risks and to establish more precise investment parameters  In addition  our new climate analytics  fueled in part by our leading pricing and reference data  will help customers better understand and quantify key ESG investment factors such as wildfire  flood and hurricane risks And while we returned a record  2 1 billion of capital to shareholders in 2019  which was a nearly 20  increase from the last year  we also continued to invest in our early stage growth initiatives across mortgages  ETFs and digital assets  Starting at ICE Mortgage Services  we benefited from strong refinancing trends  as well as the continued adoption of digital mortgage solutions  While still a small part of the overall US mortgage originations at less than 1   over 120 000 eNotes were created in 2019  nearly eight times our 2018 total  In addition  MERS saw a nearly 30  increase in the number of e registry users in 2019  And at Simplifile  e recording volumes also set a record  transmitting over 17 million documents through our network in 2019  up 22  year over year Also  in October  we launched our ETF Hub  and shortly thereafter  added fixed income capabilities  As we have noted on prior calls  our first phase is focused on building the network  by adding authorized participants known in the industry as APs  as well as additional ETF sponsors  Through the end of January  we were pleased to announce that we now have four APs that are actively using the platform  made up of J P  Morgan  Bank of America  Citadel and Virtu  marking an important step toward building liquidity in primary trading  which is otherwise known as the ETF create redeem process  In addition  over 70 of BlackRock s fixed income ETFs have utilized the platform so far  funds that now represent the vast majority of BlackRock s fixed income ETF assets under management And in fact  yesterday  we announced the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions  a platform that we believe will accelerate the second phase of our digital asset strategy  A little more than a year ago  we outlined our future plans for Bakkt  Our mission was to build a broader ecosystem to support the full life cycle of a digital asset  We began by building a regulated bitcoin custody solution  as well as launching regulated futures and options on bitcoin  all to enable greater price transparency and to provide institutions with a trusted regulatory framework In late October  we announced that we will be launching a new consumer app  serving as a wallet for a broad array of digital assets  Now  from airline miles to hotel points  to crypto currencies  users will be able to seamlessly manage  convert and transact across this platform  Aligning our historical B2B platform with these new B2C solutions will position Bakkt as an aggregator and a marketplace for a broad set of digital assets  Our acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions will be an important part of accelerating these initiatives  Bridge2 supports roughly 4 500 different loyalty  incentive and employee perk programs across a broad range of industries  including the loyalty and rewards programs of seven of the top 10 US financial institutions  Together  these initiatives will expand Bakkt s presence across an asset class that today stands at over  1 trillion in value Now  if you ll turn to Slide 10  2019 was another record year at ICE  And as we move into 2020  we are focused on applying our expertise and our technology to drive transparency and efficiency for our customers and create value for our stockholders As I wrap up my prepared remarks  I want to thank Chuck Vice for the immense contribution he has made to ICE for the last 20 years  While not as much a presence on the calls these days  Chuck has been mission critical to setting our strategy  executing on our growth initiatives  and importantly  shaping our culture for our younger generation of managers  Chuck will officially stay on as an advisor to me into 2022  but his impact on ICE will undoubtedly extend well beyond that  I also want to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2019  and I want to thank my colleagues for the efforts that they have contributed to yet another record year for ICE And finally  if you d allow me to  I d like to share my thoughts on how we think about shareholder value creation  ICE has a long history of creating shareholder value  and we ve done so by thinking outside the box and by engaging in value accretive transactions  building partnerships and delivering on organic growth opportunities that others have not considered or did not have the vision or ability to successfully execute  We have  for many years  held an internal bimonthly meeting with ICE senior management to kick around new ideas on how to engage with third parties or respond to third party inquiries  which could culminate in business combinations or licenses or partnerships or even ICE divestitures In fact  a routine part of our quarterly meetings with our Board of Directors is to discuss the best of these ideas to gain further input  We look to be opportunistic and we hold such meetings to develop new ideas in order to exploit the talents and the technologies  the capabilities and the assets that we have already assembled for the benefit of our shareholders  One only has to look at our 2019 results and our 2020 guidance to see the power inherent in our current platform  We have and we always will take a disciplined approach to acquisitions  It s an opportunistic and proactive approach that does not preclude  but instead encourages  exploratory conversations and thought alongside of our rigorous analysis  And it is that approach that has resulted in a long track record of value creation for our shareholders  as demonstrated today here on this Slide 10 When we started ICE  our goal was to build an online marketplace  one that would match buyers and sellers of electric power  Back then  I sought out an opportunity to visit eBay to meet with its CEO  Meg Whitman  I was in search of advice on how to build an online marketplace  something that she was uniquely positioned to offer me  given the similarities between our business models  After all  we both match buyers and sellers  We both collect an organized data  We both work with third parties to provide physical distribution  We both build useful analytics to enhance the transaction experience  And there were clear parallels between new ideas in the market for centralized clearing  which we didn t have at the time  and an Internet based PayPal While our respective marketplaces serve different customer bases  they are still marketplaces  and there is much to be gleaned from similar businesses that operate in different industries  different regions and different customer verticals  In the case of our recent statement related to eBay  like many other firms that we converse with  the company  for reasons of its own  was not interested in delving into the range of ideas that we hope to engage with them on  and thus  we re not able to move forward or validate whether any of our ideas have any true merit  Ordinarily  we would just keep an open dialog in the hopes that our paths would cross at a more fortuitous time  but press leaks that suggested there was some imminent business combination has required us to clarify the current situation And with that now  I am going to turn the call back to our moderator  Rocco  and he will conduct the question and answer session for us until 9 30 a m  Eastern Time Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Today s first question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Richard Repetto    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  Good morning  Jeff  Scott  So first  thank you for the remarks at the conclusion of the prepared remarks  I think  Jeff  everybody looks at you as the most innovative guy in the space  the true visionary in the exchange space  At least I do anyway  But I think most of us got caught off guard by the media reports  And I know you have made some of the connections just in the prepared remarks  But where I think this caught a little bit    caught more attention than the normal is that the size of the transaction  the media saying it was over  30 billion  that being almost 60  of your market cap  So I guess the question is  can you say anything to that magnitude of a transaction  And then  maybe if it is true  then just go deeper into the connection that you saw  And I know you did some of that in the prepared remarks  But why    what do you see the value here in eBay  What s the angle Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Well  I want to be respectful to eBay because they are not engaged with us  and to a certain degree  it s kind of like a question where you ask me  we re standing out in front of my neighbor s house and you say  if you own that house  how would you redecorate their living room  And I was raised to not do that and I also want to have a good relationship with my neighbor  So I don t really want to talk about their business too much But I guess  I was surprised that the market views just the inquiry as being so unique  This company was  for probably more than a decade  run by Devin Wenig  who many people on this call know because prior to that job  Devon ran and built a company that s now known as Refinitiv  which is a foreign exchange trading platform and a large data distribution network and a company that is now under acquisition by the London Stock Exchange  a peer of ours in the industry  And as Devon advanced above the operation of the eBay marketplace to run all of eBay  he was replaced by a fellow known as Scott Cutler  Scott Cutler  prior to that job  was the right hand of Duncan Niederauer and worked for us at the New York Stock Exchange  and now is running an exchange e commerce platform unicorn  known as StockX So the idea that we would reach out to people who I know  who many of you on the phone know  to talk about whether or not there are parallels between their business and our business  I didn t think is particularly shocking and outrageous  But out of respect to the company  they have their own ideas and agendas  And their new CEO  Scott Schenkel  is dealing with a lot of activity in inbounds with activists in their stock  And so I want to be respectful of him and the decisions that they are going to make on how they are going to run their business But that being said  I think  Rich  in your world  you have the analysts that look at exchanges and data companies as a vertical and look at e commerce platforms and technology companies as a vertical  And you think of those as being in two different atmospheres  in two different verticals  But for more than a decade  the Board of Directors of eBay  at least in my view as an engineer  looked at their company largely as one that had more synergies and characteristics of what comes out of the exchange world than the e commerce world  And I am not sure that it s been fair for the market to hold eBay accountable as an e commerce company and compare it to the likes of Amazon  and whether or not it should be viewed as a 25 year old cash market for collectible goods  which looks a lot more like the New York Stock Exchange than Amazon  And that curiosity and the fact that we know people there led us to open a dialog  and that s kind of the end of the story  So  hopefully  that helps to characterize some of the confusion out there OperatorThank you  Our next question today comes from Ken Worthington of J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Kenneth Worthington    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  Good morning and thank you for taking my question  Maybe  Scott  on the third quarter call  you said that pricing and analytics revenue and growth would improve again in 4Q on a workflow automation shift from    or to passive in fixed income  Revenue did grow  but just  1 million  and growth fell sequentially from 3Q to 4Q from 5  constant currency to 4  constant currency  And you again in your prepared remarks said that growth would improve throughout 2020  So maybe why did we see the growth rate fall in 4Q rather than rise  And help us get confidence that the trend will kind of reverse and improve throughout this year  Thanks Scott Hill    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That s a great question  Ken  and a fair one  because I also said on the second quarter call that I thought the pricing and analytics business would see a stronger fourth quarter than we saw  Let me start with the good news  Number one  I think  the key metric that we look at is ASV  and from an ASV standpoint  we ended  Phonetic  the year with pricing and analytics at 5   And I will come back to why I think that s going to get better  so that s an encouraging fact Our growth in North America in pricing and analytics has been very solid around 5  to 6  for the last three years and we expect that will continue as we move into the year  Asia growth    or growth in Asia  which I will admit is only 5  to 6  of the revenues  really took off last year  And it took off because as we moved through  18 and  19  we recognized that in a much more disaggregated market  an extended sales team was necessary  and so we started to make those investments in  18  They don t immediately hit the ground running  But as we moved through the back half of  19  we saw the productivity of that sales team really grow  The revenue growth really started to take off  And so the investments in  18  the hiring in  19 and the intent to continue to hire in  20  all of which is reflected in our expense guidance  gives us a lot of confidence that Asia growth will continue to accelerate as well Europe is really where we saw the slowdown in 2019  And I think  there are couple of factors that are at play  One is  Europe is a fairly uncertain business environment right now  and so we saw customers who had been doing a lot of work  getting ready for various regulatory changes in  18 and  17 before it  really paused in  19  trying to figure out what is Brexit going to mean to me  What are the next decisions I am going to make  If I am in the UK  what rules and regulations I am subject to  If I am in Europe  how might this change  If I ve got    if I m both in UK and Europe  what changes might exist as well  So  we did see a bit of a pause with customers as we moved through  19  Again  none of that was new  We were seeing it as we moved through the year In addition  we made some changes in Europe related to our pricing and billing to try and get to more of a global standard approach  and we saw some impact from that  some customer confusion over some of those changes  And that s really where I missed the call on the fourth quarter  We ended up having some    again some lower consumption in the fourth quarter and even some credits that we issued that impacted revenue negatively in the fourth quarter that I just didn t see coming  not because I wasn t aware of the changes  but I just didn t anticipate the impact that we would see Good news is  that s behind us  And as I said in my prepared remarks  a little bit of that challenge persists into the first quarter  but from there  we think growth accelerates  And then you asked the question  why should we be confident about that  The reason you ought to be confident about that is because just like we did in Asia  we have really been making a big investment in European sales force  We added 10  to the sales team last year  We are going to add another 16  this year  again  all reflected in the expense guidance I gave you  Every one of those sales resources will immediately be positively productive  meaning they will generate more revenue than expense  and the overall sales team will generate productivity around 6   7  this year  And so  investments in the sales team that we started last year will continue this year  And I am confident  having been at recently the sales kick off  that that team is very motivated to turn the growth story around  And with a lot of these customer challenges behind us  I am confident they can do it The other thing that gives me a lot of confidence is  Brexit is behind us  And now  customers are going to have to figure out  all right  now that I know Brexit is done  I have entered the world where I need to get back to work on making our business better  and we think we have a lot of data offerings that can make our customers  businesses better  New products will play a big part of it  We ve recently talked about  and Jeff did in his prepared remarks  our ESG offering  As you know  Ken  ESG is far more mature in Europe  and so customers will be looking at those products  I think  in a positive way  and I think that will generate growth in the back half of the year And so  if you take all those factors into consideration  I missed the fourth quarter and I missed it twice  But the challenges that resulted in the credits that lowered revenue in the fourth quarter  again  are behind us  The investments in the sales team  the new product innovation  the fact that Brexit is behind us  all that gives me confidence that Europe will rebound  And as it does  in dollars and in growth terms  overall pricing and analytics will as well  And I fully anticipate that we will see 5  to 6  growth in the pricing and analytics business in 2020  which again is consistent  That business has grown about 6  on average over the last three years and we think it will again this year OperatorThank you  Our next question today comes from Alex Kramm of UBS  Please go ahead Alex Kramm    UBS    AnalystYeah  hey  So I d just stay on the same topic as Ken  just now on the data  You sounds fairly optimistic  but your commentary was all about pricing and analytics  If I look about    at your overall guidance for data  I think you also committed on the last call to 4  to 6  overall for 2020  I don t want to split hairs too much  but I think when I calculate  your guidance is    I think 3 6 to 5 4  Phonetic  FX is helping you I think this year  So are you essentially taking that 2020 4  to 6  off the table and it s more like  I don t know  4  to 5   Or where do we end up  So maybe a little bit more commentary about some of the other challenges or tough comps that you are facing in the other businesses  please Scott Hill    Chief Financial OfficerYes  it s a good question  Alex  This one  though  I am going to take credit for having said it correct last quarter  What I mentioned last quarter is that I was confident that the pricing and analytics business will grow 5  to 6   I just reiterated that  I said I thought we would see solid connectivity growth of around 4   which again  over the last three years  on average is about what we have seen  Capacity  as I said  was up 14  last year  We anticipate that s going to be up 8  this year  I am very confident in that business  And what I said is  I thought if you added all that together without me saying anything about the exchange data business  we would be in the 4  to 6  range  and I mentioned consistent with our model I think the math you did is exactly right  I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance and where the Street is right now  it aligns perfectly  The challenge that we have got is on the exchange data side  We have seen softness related to the exchange data at NYSE  And as you know from following the company as long as you have  on the exchange data side  we don t tend to see necessarily meaningful growth every single year  Every 18 to 24 months  as we add products  as we find opportunities to capture value in our pricing  we do that  There s not a lot of price change that is coming through the exchange data side for the futures business in 2020 And so if you roll all that together  very strong performance in pricing and analytics as it rebounds from some of the challenges in Europe I mentioned  Continued strong demand for capacity  which I have indicated to you  I believe  is the leading indicator  just like open interest is for future revenue growth out in  21 and  22 and beyond  So solid performance in the connectivity business as capacity grows  and then  challenges in the exchange data space that I don t think would surprise any of you listening to the call Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Alex  this is Jeff  Let me just iterate on that last point because I have mentioned in prior calls  and I want to highlight again for you  that at the Securities and Exchange Commission  there is a group of people that have tried to use the rule making process to lower the fees for equity exchange data  It s had just the opposite impact  which is  it s paralyzed the exchange data pricing debate  There are lawsuits going on  rule makings  new filings  so on and so forth  This just sort of freezes time and will  in my mind  for a very long time going forward as lawsuits are litigated and appealed and what have you So as Scott is putting a model together and as management is thinking about revenue opportunities there  we just basically say it kind of is going to be what it s going to be  I don t expect it to go up  I don t expect to go down  It s really pretty frozen  And I don t think that s necessarily the intent of the customers that have been trying to advocate for this because it s frozen in a sense that we couldn t even lower prices if we wanted to  And so  it s sort of is what it is  and that s why Scott has mentioned  you all that follow this space can see that OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone  So  maybe go back to the M A discussion for a second  so I guess  since the IDC deal  ICE is really kind of focused on more bolt on deals to really sort of build on your core capabilities  whether it s trading  data  connectivity  etc  I guess  all deals are kind of on the smaller side  Your interest in eBay  albeit early and implied potentially a wide range of things  but including maybe something larger  So  has anything changed  And I guess  as we look forward  should we anticipate larger deals from ICE in the future  including maybe in verticals that are not as obvious to us as what we have seen in the past Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a good question  And I ll try to    and you and I ve spoken publicly about some of our philosophy to some of your clients  but let me just reiterate it for others  We have a great platform  and you just look at this first quarter and where we are going  it is phenomenal  The legacy businesses that we ve built and the efficiencies that we ve plugged into that platform are going to deliver growth  And so  I look at my job and the job of the managers that are my colleagues sitting around this table  and as we think about whether not we can create additional growth and alpha for investors  we ve really landed and in two places that seem to work for this company  One is to buy smaller companies that are earlier in their life  where if we plug them into that platform that I just mentioned  we can accelerate their growth  and we have done a number of things like that If you look at our mortgage business  I think it s probably the fastest growing part of ICE  These were smaller  younger companies that we put together and put on a very  very efficient new platform that we ve tweaked and built  And they are growing double digits and I think will continue to do that  I think this acquisition that we announced yesterday  Bridge2    when we talk about thinking outside the box  I don t think any of our investors or peers have ever thought about whether or not you should be listening airline miles on an exchange  But these are the kinds of things that we re thinking about in terms of the second part of your question which is  are you looking at new verticals The other thing that generates good returns for our investor base is if we buy older  larger  mature companies  where we can do something  and this was like IDC  like NYSE  where we can do something with our platform and technology that would take an otherwise business that may be declining and reinvigorate it  To a certain degree    and we really believe that  by the way  To a certain degree  we had a bit of audacity when we bought Interactive Data  We said  if we buy this company  we think we can double its growth rate  and we did  And you should ask us why would you say that  You didn t even have a sales force in ICE  You didn t even have a billing platform that could send out an invoice for somebody that wanted to buy data  and yet    and we were not in the fixed income space  and that was a large fixed income platform  And what is the audacity of this management team at ICE to say you can buy this business and double it  And the reality is  because we really believe in the underpinnings of our platform and this network distribution that we have  And we took that company  and within a year  we had dramatically improved its top line growth  while eliminating tremendous costs by getting on this sufficient infrastructure that we ve built around here So  those two ends of the barbells  larger companies  more complicated companies that could use invigoration  and smaller companies where we can improve their distribution  tend to be how we best create value  Typically  as you know  Alex  most people come to us to talk about companies in the middle that are fully valued and might be really attractive businesses  and they are and they re businesses we would love to own  but they are at a point where they are doing fine on themselves and there s nothing that we could do that would invigorate them to a degree that would overcome any premium that we might have to pay  And we are just not people that want to subject our investor base to those kinds of acquisitions because they tend to be red black bets in the long run  and on either end of the barbell are pretty well sure things for us  And we are in the luxurious position where we don t have to do anything  as so we can    because our platform is so strong as designed  that we have the luxury of having these biweekly meetings that you and I ve talked about in the past    bimonthly meetings  excuse me  to think outside the box OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW  Please go ahead Kyle Voigt    KBW    AnalystMaybe just a question on Bakkt  As you mentioned  you are planning to launch its consumer app later this year  I guess  what are you looking at to evaluate the success of the consumer app and maybe Bakkt  more broadly  Is it just adoption rates at first  And then  how should investors really think about the revenue model over the medium term from kind of the consumer facing part of that business  Thanks Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a good question  And we set it up as a separate brand and we set it up as a company with separate investor pool so that    we could have owned 100  of the company  but we elected not to because it may have a different growth metric and valuation metric than our core business  And that was intentional to give us flexibility that at some point  we could pull it all in  at some point  we could spin it all out  at some point  we could bring in other partners  And so  we have a capital markets flexibility around the way we have organized and named the company and set up the management  And in fact  we have them within our offices in a unique space that s key card controlled by them  and so it s truly allowed to operate within our ecosystem as a start up And in that regard  the next big hurdle for the company will be getting that app into consumer hands  and we will be looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense  Fortunately  the company is not a particularly big drain on us  And with Bridge2  Scott will update you in the next quarter about how the company looks  But we have a lot of financial flexibility now with the company  given that it has a revenue stream both from trading and from operation of all these rewards programs for 4 500 companies  And so  I will be looking more toward consumer adoption We also are engaged with    while we have talked about one consumer oriented company on this call  we are engaged with a lot of consumer oriented companies  And we have been very public about our engagement with Microsoft and how    whether or not this platform can deal with digital game pieces and whether there is a market and a marketplace for digital gaming assets and that would fit nicely with other digital assets  And so  we are having a lot of conversations with larger consumer brands and merchants with some interesting ideas  now that we have got rewards and cryptocurrency and potentially gaming in one ecosystem  and what else could plug into that and what are the synergies between various businesses  Is it a case that an airline would like to have a different rewards relationship with certain kinds of partners  with certain kinds of consumers  Is there consumer data that can be shared across a collection of retailers that view a common customer base  that can use their rewards programs and incentives in different ways  Can more millennials be attracted to those companies by virtue of having cryptocurrency or gaming assets in that ecosystem  And so  the conversations that we are having across a broad range of industries really lead me to say  not so much revenue and bottom line  but it s broad adoption  I think  for 2020 that we ll be looking toward OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America  Please go ahead Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  and thanks for taking the question  Maybe one more on    just more capital allocation and M A  And Jeff  you provided a lot of commentary on strategy and how you think about new transactions  which is helpful  And I guess maybe more on the financial aspect  when you are looking at areas that are maybe newer or not as straightforward to like the core business  how do you guys think about maybe the potential opportunities  but maybe the potential risks when you are looking at things that aren t as straightforward  And then the timing of maybe like the financial returns versus like those end market deals  if you can just put some context around it  whether it s you  Jeff  or Scott Scott Hill    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  that s a great question  and I really appreciate you re asking it  because I think it s important    Jeff  I think  very clearly stated that everything that s been discussed is very consistent with the same structure that we followed for 15 years  the biweekly meetings  the way we ve thought strategically about the deal  the thoughts on how we use our platform  our management expertise to think about combinations  The financial approach is exactly the same  It s very    in the summer of 2017  we walked you through precisely how we think about M A  that we expect deals to generate returns on investment above 10   that we expect synergies to largely be realized in the first three years  that we look for deals that deliver accretion  and that s intentionally kind of third down the list  because it s really that return on investment and the importance of it being above our cost of capital and above our hurdle rate  that s really important  And that financial model  that financial discipline  it s how we approach every single deal  Whether it s a bolt on deal or a big deal  it s an obvious deal or a less obvious deal  the financial approach is exactly the same Now  clearly  to the extent that it s deal that s a little bit off the beaten path  it s really important to be able to get in a due diligence  And yes  we expect we can get synergies  but where might those synergies be  And so the important elements of the model with deals that are  again  a little more off the beaten path really are  we need to go in and validate where we think the cost can come out  where we think the platform synergies will exist  But again  the approach to it is no different  the same financial discipline  the same financial model  And frankly  the same financial hurdles that we have told you guide our capital allocation are exactly the ones we apply to every single deal  regardless of the nature of that deal Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd let me just give you    that was a quantitative answer  Let me give you a qualitative point that I hope doesn t get lost on our investor pool  This is a founder led company  and I am surrounded by a management team that    we have worked together for a very long time  and we really know  and I definitely know  what this company is and isn t  To a certain degree  we stitched it together  I really know what we do well  but more importantly  I know what we don t do well  I know areas that we are really poor at  And there is no illusion that somehow  we are going to magically get better at something  and by the way  unless we decide we want to get that expertise  But generally speaking  we know the lane that creates value for us  and we have used that same model over and over and over again  and there is no reason to deviate from that model And so  when we think about  is there a marketplace for airline miles or swords and sickles that are on a video game  we are not crazy  we didn t lose our minds  We know what our platform does and we know how to lever it  and we feel really good about our ability to continue to find new asset classes  and maybe more importantly for this investor group  like mortgages  like fixed income create redeem  things that other management teams haven t touched but that bolt on well to our platform  And so  I just want to reassure everybody that the founder is still here and the management team that I am a part of is still together  And we know who we are  we know what we do and we didn t lose our minds over the weekend OperatorOur next question today comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies  Please go ahead Dan Fannon    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  And I guess just one more on M A  and I appreciate all the commentary thus far  But  I guess  just the current context of what you guys are looking at today and how different that might be than  say  a year ago in terms of your outlook and outreach toward M A  the number and size of deals  and I guess just based on what you have said today and outlined in terms of your track record  I guess  it was  Phonetic  point like why wouldn t eBay engage with you  given the success you have had previously Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  it s easy to answer the second part first  which is  I don t know  And I also mentioned that the first outreach to eBay was roughly 20 years ago  So  it s not one touch  OK  So we think about things in the long run  By the way  when we bought the New York Stock Exchange  people were shocked and it came as a big surprise  my gosh  we have been talking to the New York Stock Exchange since we were a start up  So  to a certain degree  opportunity has to present itself  Timing has to present itself that both management teams feel like it s the right move at the right time  And you have to respect other people  As a public company CEO  I am totally respectful that different managements have different agendas  and they have different struggles and different opportunity sets  and we can t see them and we don t know them  what they are  And so I would never be critical of somebody who wants to rebuff us because I take    we rebuff people all the time  but we try to stay nice and close because you live long lives and you never know  And here we are 20 years after I sat with Meg Whitman  And in fact  I asked Meg Whitman to be on my Board of Directors  honestly  and I asked for a lot of guidance from her  and she is lovely and helpful and provided a real incentive and goal for us as a start up And so anyway  I think you should assume that we have    that we are not unique with this one leak  that there are dozens and dozens of companies that we have had longtime touches with that we could talk to and share ideas with  that have gone on and will continue to go on OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Ken Hill of Rosenblatt  Please go ahead Kenneth Hill    Rosenblatt Securities    AnalystHi  good morning  I wanted to come back to Bakkt for a minute  You guys have talked about    a lot about M A  but I was wondering if you are considering any partnerships in that space with some of the traditional payment players because loyalty program seems like a hot area  And I asked because a lot of the payment firms I cover  when they roll out new products  they are doing it over tens of millions or hundreds of millions of customers  So could a partnership in that area help jump start some customer adoption for Bakkt Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a very good question  If you look at the employee pool and the talent that we have recruited to Bakkt  there s a lot of people that have come from various payment companies  and now  people that have  Phonetic  come from rewards companies once we close with Bridge2  And so  we have a pretty good canvas in terms of having private dialogs with various companies  And there is a lot of conversation going on at that level  a lot of conversation with traditional banking and Wall Street  who are thinking about what does  Phonetic  the fintech will look like for banking when we go to a zero commission stock trading environment for retail consumers  What     how is fintech going to change the broad financial services landscape  And gee  here s Bakkt  and it has a digital wallet with a lot of connectivity right now  and what else can be done with it So there is a tremendous number of conversations going on  But importantly  we have built really an industrial scale platform there that we have been working on now for well over a year with dozens and dozens and dozens of engineers that have built something that we know will scale  because we are in a scale business  that can hopefully look right out of the box as a company that doesn t look and feel like a traditional start up in terms of its ability to deal with some traditional payments  people or banks or merchants because    I have talked to a lot of fintech entrepreneurs  and one of the things that a lot of people don t understand  and rightly so and not to be critical  but financial services has a lot of rules and regulations around the world  and we exist in that ecosystem and understand how we are going to be judged and monitored  And successful businesses need to scale  and that s not easy to do  And a lot of younger entrepreneurs building fintech don t fully recognize that when you are handling other people s money  you really need a very powerful ecosystem with internal audits and checks and balances and surrounded by a cybersecurity overlay  So  I think that s getting built n  which gives us flexibility to talk to some of the kinds of companies that you are thinking of because I think it s going to be an attractive platform OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  thanks  Thanks very much  Maybe just continuing along that  again  Jeff these    your answers are really insightful here  so really appreciate it  Just assuming  given your conversation for eBay  you are really talking about the marketplace component of eBay  But maybe more broadly  what is it that your    the ICE platform  why is that uniquely positioned to leverage a consumer marketplace  And then  maybe just talk about what are your ambitions longer term to move more into the consumer space versus the B2B space that ICE has always been in  especially on the financial customers  And then just a quick one for Scott  How much do you think you could raise the debt to EBITDA capacity if you are bringing on a more recurring revenue business versus just the ICE legacy business right now Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo let me just say    again  I don t want to comment on eBay and how they run their company or how we would help them run their company  Those are conversations that  at some point  we would love to have with eBay management if they are open to it  but I don t really want to do that in public  But let me just say that    I will tell you that a large platform that we have  which is largely a database management platform  doesn t really know whether or not the top high frequency trading firm that s using a liquid cooled computer and blasting bits and bytes off the ionosphere in order to interface with us  That bit and byte is no different than a retiree sitting in their kitchen clicking on a mouse  Our ability to handle massive amounts of data securely  efficiently  put it in a database  sort it  search it  manipulate it  cleanse it and give it back out to people  is a core talent that we have here  That is what ICE is Just as an aside  I started the company by buying a little failing firm from MidAmerican Energy  which is Warren Buffett s electric utility    and by the way  I bought it right before he acquired MidAmerican  So he is a smarter investor than most of us on the call  But I bought this company  it was called the Continental Power Exchange  I changed the name  I decided to call it Intercontinental because I thought being continental was too limiting  And I took the word power out of it because I thought just focusing on power was too limiting  And so  we end up with the name Intercontinental Exchange  I swear  if I were starting this company today  I would probably call it the Intercontinental Massively Scalable Network and Database Company because that s what we are  That s what airline miles and gaming swords and credit default swaps and delivering barges that we manage in Rotterdam for fuel oil  that s what happens  Those endpoints are ubiquitous to that network in my mind Scott Hill    Chief Financial OfficerAnd just to pick up on that for the more boring part of the question about financial capacity  not bits and bytes  or swords and sickles  I think the key thing I would tell you is  our capacity for any deal really rests on  I think  three key factors  Number one  our commitment to  Indecipherable  our investors  so the deal has the right return and to be able to present a good deal to the ratings agencies and the bondholders to borrow  And so we have to be able to do that  If we can tell the right story and demonstrate how it meets the needs of all of our important constituents  that will generate capacity for us The second thing is  the deal that we are talking about has to generate the cash to allow us to delever and to do so in a meaningfully fast way  And we have done that historically  All of the times that we have decided to lever up  we have committed to lever back down within three years  And in most cases  it s taken 18 months and not much more  And so that s the second thing  Do you have a plan to delever  and by the way  do you have a track record of being able to delever  And so the relationships with our investors  with bondholders are important  The ability and the track record of deleveraging is important But then the third thing  we ve spent an hour not talking about a volume business that s crushing it right now  We had some good questions earlier about a data business that is growing at twice the level of the large company we acquired a few years ago at over 50  margins  The combination of that business generates  3 3 billion of EBITDA  It generated last year  2 3 billion of free cash flow  That s where capacity comes from  That s the starting point  It s the strength of the existing business  The fact that all of our colleagues aren t listening to this call  but they are running our exchanges and our clearing houses and selling data and building ETF Hub and building the mortgage business  that s the foundation of capacity because if we don t have that  3 billion of EBITDA  if that EBITDA hadn t grown every single year for 14 years  we wouldn t be able to enter into a conversation about going and levering up  So it s those three things that drive it  with the last one being the fundamentally most important one OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen  this concludes our question and answer session  I d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks Jeffrey Sprecher    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Rocco  Well  this was an interesting call  and this management team will go away and think big thoughts and we will be back to share those with you next quarter  But meanwhile  as Scott said  please take a look at our volume and open interest and refine your models and see what s going on here  because we are very  very proud of where we are year to date  And we look forward to talking next quarter Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  65 minutesCall participants Warren Gardiner    Vice President of Investor

145354,366869,ICE,Oil Steadies After Russia Asks for Time to Decide on Output Cuts,news," Bloomberg     Oil fluctuated after giving up prior gains as an OPEC  committee recommended output cuts  but didn t reach a decision on an emergency meeting amid Russia resistance 
Futures in New York were little changed Thursday after the panel recommended curbing production by 600 000 barrels a day to offset the demand impact from the coronavirus outbreak  But the committee failed to set a date for an emergency meeting in February to implement the suggestion after Russia asked for more time 
 There s a little bit of hope OPEC will support the market   said Michael Loewen  director of commodity strategy at Scotiabank   Even before the virus  OPEC s prior production cuts still left markets oversupplied and Russia has been reluctant to stick to these  so that also casts doubt on what they re willing to do here  
Crude is down about 17  this year as the spread of the virus disrupts travel and fuel consumption  upending trade flows worldwide  The oil market s structure also deepened further into a bearish contango this week  suggesting ample supply will persist  Major companies from  BP   LON BP  Plc to  Total  SA  PA TOTF  expect the disease to wipe out up to a third of global demand growth in 2020  but OPEC itself has predicted a more modest decline even in its worst case scenario

Futures rose in New York as a technical indicator signaled crude is oversold after falling more than 20  since early January amid plentiful supplies and slumping demand  Saudi Arabia s push for deeper output reductions to combat the drop in consumption due to the coronavirus outbreak is being received with caution by Russia  whose budget is more resilient to lower prices

 While prices are rising today after a sell off  crude is likely to continue tumbling on demand fears until the coronavirus abates or OPEC  implements a supply cut   said Vandana Hari  founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore   Waiting for the virus to subside might prove costly for OPEC and its allies

The potential link up has no clear rationale  Piper Sandler Cos  said  while Oppenheimer   Co  voiced a widespread reaction when headlines about the talks first appeared  EBay is not a  conventional  M A target for an exchange 
 News of the EBay approach strikes us as outside the box of typical exchange M A and ICE  NYSE ICE  playbooks   analysts at  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   wrote in a note to clients   We question both potential expense and revenue synergies  
A 0 3  rise in the shares of the exchange as of 12 57 p m  Wednesday in New York failed to offset Tuesday s 7 5  slump on the news 
Despite those skeptics  the deal talks show NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc  is taking a wider view of potential combinations as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher keeps pace with acquisitive rivals such as  London Stock Exchange  Group  LON LSE  Inc  and CME Group Inc   NASDAQ CME 
ICE late Tuesday confirmed that it had approached the online marketplace to discuss a deal  though no discussions were active  The news came just a month after Sprecher told analysts and investors that he s always on the prowl for potentially game changing deals 
 We meet every two weeks  go over the landscape with this topic in mind   Sprecher said during a presentation at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   s financial services industry conference in December   I think there is more transformative M A in our future  but it s got to feel right  And when we do it and announce that  you all have to say   That s so logical

 With the launch of the Bakkt app  we will  for the first time  offer consumers a robust platform to consolidate and use all of their digital assets  from crypto to loyalty points to in game tokens  in one user friendly wallet   Mike Blandina  CEO of Bakkt  said in a statement 
ICE s competitors have been active in M A  A consortium led by Thomson Reuters Corp  is selling Refinitiv Holdings Ltd  to the London Stock Exchange for  27 billion  The deal  announced in 2019  is expected to be completed by year end  In 2018  CME Group bought NEX Group Ltd  for  3 85 billion to give the Chicago exchange owner new markets in cash U S  Treasury and currency trading 
Sprecher told the Goldman Sachs conference he s not concerned about missing out on those acquisitions 
 I didn t like those deals   he said   I didn t think they were right for us  
The right acquisition has to add to the long term value of the company  Sprecher said   So that s not an easy thing  To a certain degree  you have to hang around the net  you have to have meetings every two weeks  but continue to refine your thinking  ",2020-02-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nyse-ownersoutside-the-box-ebay-approach-leaves-analysts-bewildered-2077077,2077077

Futures fell 1  in New York on Tuesday  Traders remained gripped by the outbreak in China that threatens to curb global crude demand growth by as much as 400 000 barrels a day  according to an analysis by OPEC and allied producers 
 We re getting close to the bottom and it s clear OPEC is not going to sit on their hands   said Phil Flynn  an analyst at Price Futures Group Inc   There s some dire predictions being priced in right now  
The deadly virus has menaced markets by upending trade flows and is estimated to have cut 20  from China s oil demand as quarantined cities and closed factories cripple industrial activity in the second largest economy in the world  Refineries are curbing operations  while the nation s top processor is trying to resell millions of barrels of crude it no longer needs  The crisis could wipe out a third of the growth in global consumption this year  said  BP   LON BP  Plc Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary 
OPEC  consulted with China in an urgent assessment of how the coronavirus may hurt oil demand  and what measures the group could take to stop prices falling any lower  A full meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies is currently scheduled for March  but the group is considering whether to hold that gathering earlier  The coalition is expected to discuss potential production cuts in response to the outbreak in China on Wednesday 
West Texas Intermediate for March delivery fell 50 cents to  49 61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a rebound that saw prices trade as high as  51 55 earlier in the day 
Brent for April delivery lost 49 cents to  53 96 on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange putting its premium over WTI at  4 16 
Traders are wary the virus induced sell off has driven prices to alarming levels that could ignite a crash resembling the plunge in October 2018 when Wall Street banks rushed to sell futures to cover options contracts  sparking further declines 
 WTI is trying to hold on to that  50 support level   says Olivier Jakob  analyst at Petromatrix   But it s going to be difficult unless OPEC takes decisive action  otherwise we ll get to the lows of 2018

145420,366935,ICE,eBay Soars on a Report of an Acquisition Bid by Intercontinental Exchange,news,"Shares of eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  surged nearly 9  late Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the online marketplace specialist has received a takeover offer from the New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange  NYSE ICE   
Citing people familiar with the matter  the Journal says Intercontinental Exchange recently made an offer valuing eBay  at more than  30 billion     a healthy premium given its roughly  28 billion market capitalization before the news broke  This would almost certainly be a dilutive cash and stock deal considering Intercontinental Exchange s market cap stood at  just   55 billion this morning  which also explains why its shares simultaneously fell around 7 5  this afternoon 

At the same time  the Journal s sources noted this isn t the first time ICE has approached eBay proposing they combine forces  But the report also cautioned that the two companies are not holding formal negotiations at this time  and there s no guarantee a deal will be made 
eBay only just released slightly better than expected fourth quarter 2019 results last week  But the stock slumped as the market reacted to eBay s underwhelming guidance  which called for flat organic revenue growth in the seasonally slow first quarter and only modest organic growth of 1  to 3  for the coming year 
The Journal added that Intercontinental Exchange is primarily eyeing eBay s core marketplace operations  which served 183 million active buyers last quarter  up 2  year over year  and represented around  2 2 billion of eBay s roughly  2 8 billion in total fourth quarter revenue  
Intercontinental Exchange is not interested  however  in purchasing eBay s noncore businesses  To that end  eBay only recently agreed to sell its StubHub subsidiary in a deal worth just over  4 billion last quarter after a monthslong strategic review process  That transaction should close by the end of the  current  first quarter of 2020 
And just this morning  activist investor Starboard Value issued a letter ramping up pressure on the company to follow by divesting its classifieds segment    a move that some industry watchers estimate could fetch as much as  10 billion 
For what it s worth  during last week s quarterly conference call  eBay management insisted that it will continue to prioritize shareholder value creation as it weighs the future of both the core marketplace business and classifieds  But interim CEO Scott Schenkel pledged to provide an update around the middle of this year 

At this point  I would not exclude any option  Although it s unlikely that we would pursue an option of divesting platform by platform  which a lot of people have reached out on that  That s not really in our     best interest or in line with maximizing shareholder value creation  But it s completely doable  and we re looking at all those options 

In the end  it s unclear exactly how much ICE is willing to pay to bring eBay s marketplace under its wing  But while it might be tempting to buy this tech stock now given the prospect of a juicy takeover premium  I d be remiss if I didn t remind investors that such acquisitions should not represent a central piece of any bullish investment thesis  Rather  I think most shareholders would do well to focus first on eBay s progress returning its core business to sustained  profitable growth ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr3j0,2076178
145422,366937,ICE,Oil Rebounds From One Year Low With OPEC  Split on Cuts,news," Bloomberg     Oil recovered from a one year low to trade above  50 a barrel as Saudi Arabia ran into Russian resistance in its push for further production cuts to combat a virus driven demand hit 
Futures rebounded with Asian stocks on Wednesday  but oil is still down more than 20  since early January as the coronavirus dents global demand  Saudi Arabia s push for deeper supply reductions to combat the drop in consumption due to the outbreak is being received with caution by Russia  whose budget is more resilient to lower prices 
 BP   LON BP  Plc is forecasting the crisis will wipe out one third of global oil demand growth this year  although OPEC s internal analysis indicates a modest drop of around 400 000 barrels a day for about six months  In the U S   an industry report showed an expansion in crude stockpiles  adding to worries about weak consumption 
 While prices are rising today after a sell off  crude is likely to continue tumbling on demand fears until the coronavirus abates or OPEC  implements a supply cut   said Vandana Hari  founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore   Waiting for the virus to subside might prove costly for OPEC and its allies

145448,366963,ICE,Cocoa Set for Bumpy Ride as Africa Premium Disrupts Futures,news," Bloomberg     Cocoa traders are bracing for wild swings as a premium imposed by the world s largest producers is likely to generate a disconnect between futures and physical markets 
Ivory Coast and Ghana are charging  400 per metric ton above the futures price for cocoa for shipment from October  making traders less likely to deliver beans from the top growers when futures contracts expire in London  the hub for West African hedging 
Futures usually move toward the price of the underlying physical commodity as contracts approach expiry in a process known as convergence  Attracting cocoa from Ivory Coast and Ghana for delivery to the exchange will now require nearby futures to trade at a massive premium to later dated contracts because of the  400 charge  known as Living Income Differential and instituted by those nations to boost farmer proceeds 
 Physical convergence will be a hell of a long way away from where it s been in the past   said Jonathan Parkman  deputy head of agriculture at Marex Spectron Group   If people are desperate not to give up their cocoa because they had to pay the LID    and obviously if you deliver against the exchange you don t get that back    the risk has escalated massively as a result  
Spread Risks
A disconnect between futures and physical markets could result in declining exchange stockpiles  which are already at low levels  One solution could be to add a premium equivalent to the LID at the time of delivery  Traders discussed the issue with ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe  which decided to keep rules unchanged  according to people familiar with the matter  who asked not to be identified because the information is private 
In New York  where the contract is more speculative  traders opted not to raise the issue with ICE Futures U S   the people said 
ICE declined to comment 
Buyers of cocoa from both countries pay the futures price  the LID and a differential for quality  Traders could still grade beans to the exchange if they obtain a discount for the quality  while some may choose to certify beans to obtain easier inventory financing 
 The quality differential is one component of the total price that can offset the cost of the new living income differential   said Eric Bergman  a vice president at Jenkins Sugar Group Inc   If the market experiences a large surplus  cocoa will still get delivered to the exchange  
But the risk to spreads is not just to the upside  ICE Europe warehouses have also been saddled with bulk inventories from Cameroon  considered a lower quality supplier  Two firms hold the majority of exchange stockpiles  according to people familiar with the matter  If one of them decides to dump Cameroon beans in 1 000 ton piles  spreads could collapse  The exchange recently tried to address the issue by making the lifespan of bulk cocoa certificates last longer after a second grading

145456,366971,ICE,Utilities stocks trump other havens as virus fears spread,news,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  utilities stocks have outperformed other traditional havens in recent days  as worries over the spreading coronavirus epidemic sparked a rush to safety 
The S P 500 Utilities  SPLRCU  index is up about 3 2  since Jan  21  when the first case of coronavirus was reported in the United States  The index has risen 6 6  this month  logging its best monthly gain since 2016 and beating every other sector in the S P 
By comparison  gold rose 1 8  in that period  while the Japanese yen notched a 1 6  gain  and the dollar edged lower  The ICE  NYSE ICE  BofA US Treasury Index   which tracks the performance of U S  dollar denominated sovereign debt publicly issued by the U S  government in its domestic market  rose 2  
 Not all safe haven assets are created equal   said John Praveen  portfolio manager for QMA  the quantitative equity and global multi asset solutions business of PGIM in Newark  New Jersey 
Comparatively high yields and expectations of steady earnings during troubled times have made utilities a popular destination for nervous investors 
With the economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak still unclear  utilities have more recently attracted those seeking to reduce exposure to riskier assets while still remaining in equities  which have outpaced most other markets over the last decade 
 Markets are     not expecting the end of the world   said Juha Seppala  director of the macro asset allocation strategy team at UBS Asset Management   You want to be defensive  you want to reduce your risk  but you don t want to be completely out of the market  
 GRAPHIC  Safe havens    
The benchmark S P 500 Index  SPX  is down about 3  since Jan  21 but remains close to record highs earlier last month  Betting against stocks has been a losing strategy during the more than decade long bull market  the S P gained 29  last year despite a trade war between the United States and China and worries over a slowdown in global growth 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  said they expected a 0 4 percentage point hit to U S  annualized growth in the first quarter  followed by a rebound in the second 
High yields in utilities stocks have been another draw for investors at a time when Treasury yields are near historic lows  The S P utilities sector sports a dividend yield of nearly 3   compared with 1 6  and 2 2  for 10 year Treasuries and the S P 500  respectively  according to Refinitiv data 
 GRAPHIC  Utilities    
The dollar  which often rises during times of market stress  has declined 0 3  since Jan  21  Weaker than expected U S  data on Friday   the Chicago Purchasing Management Index fell to a lower than expected 42 9  the lowest since December 2015  as new orders tumbled and producers forecast tepid activity in 2020   sent the dollar index down 0 5  on Friday

Futures lost almost 3  in New York on Wednesday as the death toll from the virus climbed  travel restrictions were imposed on the city of 11 million from which it emerged  and the World Health Organization mulled whether to declare an international emergency 
The coronavirus outbreak panicked traders because of the deleterious impact epidemics can have on travel and demand for transport fuels  The WHO is scheduled to meet again Thursday to plot a strategy

145482,366997,ICE,Mexico goes ghost as its oil hedge bill spirals,news,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Devika Krishna Kumar MEXICO CITY NEW YORK  Reuters    Mexico is playing a risky game of hide and seek with the oil market  To frustrate speculators and contain an annual bill of more than  1 billion  Mexico is going to new lengths to mask its attempts to insure its revenue from oil sales against falling prices   no mean feat for a hedging program known as Wall Street s biggest oil trade   Getting the hedge right is crucial for Mexico as it offers stability at a time the government is planning to boost social welfare and security spending  the economy is stagnating and the country s credit worthiness is under intense scrutiny  Once an enigmatic agreement between a handful of finance industry officials and Wall Street banks  the hedge is now the most anticipated deal in the oil futures market  making it harder  and more costly  for Mexico to arrange  For its 2020 hedge  however  Mexico has adopted a different strategy than in previous years  according to a Wall Street source with direct knowledge of the deal  This time  an estimated two thirds of the options Mexico bought in financial markets were indexed to the international Brent crude benchmark  shifting away from the Maya oil Mexico mainly produces  according to the source  By using such a heavily traded contract as Brent  Mexico should have been able to cut costs by getting lower quotes for its trades and to place bets more unobtrusively to avoid prices shifting ahead of its moves  market sources said   But critics say the strategy creates new risks  By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil  the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico s export mix dominated by Maya  which is typically cheaper than Brent  SWEET OR SOUR  I would expect a divergence of prices over the long term  This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge  This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal to possibly no benefit of the hedge   said Ryan Dusek  director at consulting firm Opportune LLP  based in Houston  who added that the trade could end up being  worthless   The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge  The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years   For the 2009 deal  for example   Barclays   LON BARC    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent  data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed  The Wall Street source said for 2020  Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   at  54  56 a barrel and hedged Maya at  42   Brent  LCOc1  is trading at around  63 a barrel while Maya s official selling price for deliveries to the U S  Gulf Coast is about  55  according to S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts pricing data  The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price  so if the actual market price is lower  the options pay out and make up the difference   acting effectively as an insurance policy  But if the price of Maya  a heavy sour crude  falls faster than Brent  a light sweet crude   or Maya drops and Brent rises   Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in  analysts and market sources said  Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump  Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent   HACIENDA HEDGE  Mere rumors of Mexico s  Hacienda hedge   which gets its name from the country s finance ministry  can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade   Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it   said Victor Gomez  a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018  In part due to this  the hedge s cost has increased 10 fold in peso terms since 2001  even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed  the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed  Mexico spent the equivalent of  212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016  hedging 212 million barrels cost  956 million  In 2017  Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged   Now  for the first time in at least 19 years  finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they re spending to protect 2020 revenue  saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs   What we don t want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market  because that raises the costs of the premium   Gabriel Yorio  one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  who took office a year ago  told reporters this month  The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U S  dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity oriented funds  which were natural counterparties to the deal  have closed  Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1 73 million barrels a day it produces they re protecting  nor to what extent they re using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue  All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of  49 a barrel   Graphic  Mexico oil hedge     Since 2001  Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year  in 2009  2015 and 2016  the data showed  Nevertheless  those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead   at least before including the cost of the 2020 program  Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks  In response to further questions in Reuters  records request  Mexico s transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years  It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs  affect Mexico s monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk   This is part of Mexico s strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying   said Gomez  Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan  9  Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico s oil exports  Last year  Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U S  Gulf Coast to be based 65  on U S  West Texas Intermediate in Houston   a light sweet crude which is the most traded U S  Gulf Coast grade   and 35  on Brent futures  Before  it had been derived from West Texas Sour  Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets  The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur  which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel  FUND OR OPTIONS Mexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments  From the mid 2010s  Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies  For example  Mexico locked in a price of  79 for its 2015 hedge  with  76 40 guaranteed by options and the remaining  2 60 backed by the fund  In 2017  the last time the ministry released such information   4 of its  42 hedge was covered by the fund   Gomez and Julio Ruiz  another former official involved in the hedge until 2018  said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully    They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund   Gomez said  Nevertheless  those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge  said Ruiz  adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state owned Pemex  the world s most heavily indebted oil company   In congress  many will say they don t agree with how this money is spent  and that it shouldn t be spent on the oil hedging program   Ruiz said   
 But Mexico s finances would become a lot more volatile without it  ",2020-01-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mexico-goes-ghost-as-its-oil-hedge-bill-spirals-2065879,2065879
145488,367003,ICE,Brazil green lights U S  deportation of more Brazilians by plane,news,"By Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA  Reuters    The U S  government will deport a planeload of Brazilians on Friday  the second such chartered flight since October to return an increasing number of migrants trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico 
The flight from El Paso will arrive in Belo Horizonte in central Brazil early on Saturday morning  Brazil s Foreign Ministry told Reuters  The October flight had 70 deportees aboard 
The two deportation flights in October and this week are the first authorized by Brazil since 2006 and mark a policy change by far right President Jair Bolsonaro who has sought closer ties with the Trump Administration  two Brazilian officials said on condition of anonymity 
Brazil has previously refused to receive mass deportations from the United States and is now allowing these transfers to help President Donald Trump s policy of speeding up deportations of illegal migrants at the Mexican border  they said 
Brazil s Foreign Ministry confirmed the Brazilian government had been notified of the repatriation of Brazilian nationals who were not admitted to the United States 
 What else can we do  They are being detained at the border and aren t going to be able to enter the United States  We have to bring them home   a third official told Reuters when asked about the deportations 
Trump has made restricting legal and illegal immigration a central focus of his presidency and his 2020 reelection campaign  His administration has issued a series of sweeping policies seeking to limit access to U S  asylum at the Mexico border and has pledged to ramp up deportations of migrants living illegally in the United States 
Matthew Albence  acting director of U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  which coordinates deportation flights  said larger flights were more efficient  but did not provide details of the flight set to depart for Brazil on Friday 
 We can put 70  people  on a plane and get them all at one time  as opposed to flying 70 individuals by themselves   Albence said during an interview at the agency s headquarters in Washington   That s certainly a lot cheaper and more efficient  
The number of Brazilians arrested by the U S  Immigration and Customs Agency  ICE  NYSE ICE   at the U S  Mexico border surged to 17 900 in fiscal 2019  a more than tenfold increase from the previous year  according to the U S  government 
Brazilian diplomats believe this surge was due to Brazilians wanting to live in the United States anticipating tougher rules for visas under Trump and deciding to enter from Mexico 
The two Brazilian government sources told Reuters Brazilian diplomats were told not to place hurdles in the way of U S  deportation of Brazilians because that could hurt closer ties with Washington 
Few Brazilians have a valid reason to request asylum as the country is neither at war nor seen as dangerous for minorities  according to Brazilian officials  so they are mostly denied entry and held in U S  detention at the border 
The increase in Brazilians arriving at the U S  Mexico border seeking asylum has led the U S  Department of Homeland Security to consider sending Brazilian migrants back to Mexico to await court hearings under a new Trump administration program that currently applies only to Spanish speakers  a U S  official and a Mexican official familiar with the discussions told Reuters last week 
The Trump administration has also explored the possibility of sending Brazilian asylum seekers to other nations  according to the U S  official ",2020-01-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/brazil-green-lights-us-deportation-of-more-brazilians-by-plane-2066501,2066501
145490,367005,ICE,Oil Heads for Worst Week in a Year as Virus Selloff Deepens,news," Bloomberg     Oil headed for its worst weekly slump in more than a year amid fears that China s coronavirus will cripple fuel demand just as markets struggle with a fragile world economy and adequate supplies 
Futures sank as much as 2 9  in London to approach  60 a barrel for the first time since November as deaths from the coronavirus rose to 25 and China expanded travel restrictions for over 40 million people in an attempt to halt contagion  The U S  is monitoring more than 60 people for potential infection  and lawmakers said health authorities are expected to confirm a third case 
The Asian virus has spooked traders even as the World Health Organization stopped short of declaring a global health emergency  The contagion is disrupting travel during the Lunar New Year holiday  when hundreds of millions normally fly or ride home  The selloff has accelerated as trend following funds turned bearish  according to TD Securities 
 Contagion fears are spiking ahead of the biggest yearly migration ahead of new year   says Daniel Ghali  a commodities strategist at TD Securities   The fear factor is the risk of contagion  synonymous to what happened in 2003 with SARS which led to a 2  drop in Chinese economic growth  
The fast spreading virus is the latest challenge for a market that s been buffeted this year by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa  as well as the phase one trade deal between Beijing and Washington   Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   said earlier this week that  if the coronavirus has an impact similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic  demand could be curbed by 260 000 barrels a day

145493,367008,ICE,Democratic U S  presidential hopefuls seek contrast with Trump on immigration,news,"By Amanda Becker and Sharon Bernstein
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Candidates running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have been uniformly critical of the immigration policies of U S  President Donald Trump  who was elected after promising to crack down on illegal immigration and bolster enforcement along the U S  Mexico border 
Here is a look at the immigration positions of Trump and the leading Democratic candidates looking to take him on in the November election 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
Since entering the White House in 2017  Trump has moved to end former President Barack Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  which protects immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children from deportation 
He has also curtailed immigration from majority Muslim countries  and temporarily instituted a policy along the U S  Mexico border separating children from the parents or guardians with whom they crossed the border  holding them in separate facilities 
JOE BIDEN
The former vice president struggled in early presidential debates to defend some immigration measures taken by Obama when Biden served under him  including the deportation of more than 3 million immigrants between 2009 and 2016 
But in his immigration platform released Dec  11  Biden acknowledged the pain caused by the Obama administration moves  even as he harshly criticized Trump s policies 
The plan cites Biden s support of DACA and if he is elected president  Biden would immediately reinstate and strengthen the program  including ensuring that participants are eligible for federal education grants to attend college 
Biden would end workplace immigration raids and stop enforcement actions at schools  medical facilities and houses of worship  He would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and make it easier for those with legal residency to become citizens as well 
ELIZABETH WARREN
Warren  a U S  senator from Massachusetts  has said she would decriminalize migration by immediately issuing guidance to federal prosecutors that they not pursue cases related to administrative immigration violations 
She would also separate immigration and law enforcement agencies into separate entities  and reshape the U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  and U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   and would support comprehensive reform 
Warren would eliminate privately owned immigration detention facilities and only detain those who pose a flight or safety risk  She would create an immigration court system independent from the U S  Department of Justice and increase the number of refugees allowed into the country 
BERNIE SANDERS
Sanders  a U S  senator from Vermont  says he would work with Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that includes a pathway to citizenship  He has promised to halt all deportations until a full study can be made of current and past immigration policies and practices 
Sanders favors providing immediate legal status for those eligible for DACA  Sanders voted against ICE and would break it up along with CBP  distributing their responsibilities to other agencies 
He would decriminalize unauthorized immigration and streamline the process for applying for citizenship  However he has said that he opposes open borders 
PETE BUTTIGIEG
Buttigieg  the former mayor of South Bend  Indiana  promises to push for a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people who are in the United States illegally  including participants in the DACA program 
He would back reforms to help those in the country on work visas to move more easily from one job to another  His immigration platform includes expanding visa programs to encourage immigrant doctors and nurses to work in areas where health care providers are scarce  and enacting programs that encourage young immigrants to move to communities that have lost working age population 
A U S  Navy veteran  Buttigieg has promised to protect immigrant soldiers from deportation and has criticized the Trump administration s move to send troops to the U S  Mexico border as a waste of time 
AMY KLOBUCHAR
Klobuchar  a U S  senator from Minnesota  says she would push to re open stalled Congressional negotiations over immigration reform within her first 100 days in office  aiming to pass a comprehensive bill in her first year 
She supports the DREAM act  which would encode in law protections for children brought to the United States illegally as well as a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are in the country illegally 
Klobuchar would end Trump administration efforts to deport DACA recipients and those who are living in the United States under other programs aimed to protect them from violence and other issues in their home countries  such as Temporary Protected Status 
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG
The former New York Mayor and billionaire founder of Bloomberg News supports a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people in the United States illegally and an expansion of legal immigration 
He would end family separation at the border and restore protections for refugees  But Bloomberg opposes open borders 
ANDREW YANG
Yang  a technology entrepreneur  supports the DREAM Act  He favors increasing the guest worker program  while making sure workers leave when the approved time is up 
He supports a pathway to citizenship for people who are in the United States illegally  saying on his website that it would be  prohibitively expensive  disruptive and inhumane  to round up and deport the roughly 11 million people who do not have legal status 
TOM STEYER
Billionaire climate activist Steyer says as president he would decriminalize border crossings  processing those who enter the country illegally under civil law rather than criminal statutes 
Steyer would restore restrictions on immigrants with temporary protected status due to issues in their countries of origin  and end restrictions on travel from several mostly Muslim countries put in place by Trump 
Steyer backs a pathway to citizenship for people in the United States illegally and says he would reform ICE and CBP ",2020-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/democratic-us-presidential-hopefuls-seek-contrast-with-trump-on-immigration-2068233,2068233

Investing com   Oil prices slumped Monday  as the intensified efforts of the Chinese authorities to curtail the spread of the coronavirus look set to have a significant impact on demand from the world s largest importer of crude 
By 8 35 AM ET  1335 GMT   U S  crude futures were down 2 8  at  52 68 a barrel  having earlier hit a 16 week low of  52 19  Brent  the global crude benchmark  was down 2 7  at  58 30 a barrel  off the 16 week low of  57 74 
Outside China  12 countries have also reported infections from the virus   Australia  Canada  France  Japan  Malaysia  Nepal  Singapore  South Korea  Taiwan  Thailand  Vietnam and the United States  
 Macro concerns over energy demand due to curtailed movement of people and trade have been weighing on an oil market that is otherwise tight due to ongoing supply concerns in Libya and OPEC  output cuts   said analysts Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao at ING  in a research note 
These demand concerns are carrying more weight within the market that the latest talk emerging that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering deeper production cuts  limiting the supply of oil hitting the market 
Prince Abdulaziz  Saudi Arabia s state minister for energy affairs  added to jawboning by stating the kingdom  is closely monitoring the developments in the global oil market resulting from the gloomy expectations about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the Chinese and the global economy and oil market fundamentals  in a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency  Saudi Arabia is the world s largest exporter of oil

145495,367010,ICE,Does The Coronavirus Leave Anywhere To Hide  Sugar Provides Shield And Gains,opinion,"To the average investor  being long any commodity other than gold might seem suicidal now  with the coronavirus appearing to have  infected  almost every raw material from oil to copper and the soy that China buys in such abundance   
Yet  in the sea of red drowning the commodities complex  a few flickers of green continue to provide hope for longs  One of them is in sugar 
Raw sugar on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures U S  was poised for a third week of gains out of four on Friday  after hitting a high in the previous session that fell just short of the two year peaks struck last week  Assuming there s no slide on the day  the sweetener could finish the week up 1 5  
Sugar Up Most For Month Since 2018  Oil In Reverse
But more importantly  with today being the final session of January  raw sugar is also showing a gain of nearly 9  on the month  If it closes again in the positive  it could have the highest monthly gain since October 2018 s astronomical gain of nearly 27  
Now compare that January gain in sugar with how oil has performed for the month  Oil s benchmark Brent crude is poised for a loss of more than 12  on month  its deepest slide since November 2018 
And it makes sense to compare sugar with oil because sugar s most important commercial by product is ethanol   the biofuel that s blended with gasoline  or petroleum 
Sugar Is Just Among A Handful Of Commodities With Monthly Gains
In fact  sugar is one of five leading commodities from a field of 36 that are showing gains for January  Investing com data shows  The winners other than precious metals gold and palladium are wheat  cotton and cocoa 
Typically  sugar prices track those of oil given their dependence on gasoline for ethanol blending   which is mandated at 10  in the United States 
But since the coronavirus outbreak  sugar has strangely been marching to its own drum beat  as traders and investors focus almost entirely on a supply squeeze forced by a weak crop out of top producer Brazil 
Massive Production Shortage
 We see sugar prices following through on a rally supported by a massive global production deficit   said Eric Scoles  commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago  adding 
 This is still a very bullish market and my analysis suggests strong fundamentals are still in place  
Jack Scoville  vice president and analyst for  soft  commodities that include sugar at Chicago s Price Futures Group  said Brazil could be forced to produce more sugar and less ethanol due to the current weakness in crude oil prices

145497,367012,ICE,Owner Of NYSE Approaches EBay And Creates Buying Opportunity,opinion,"Intercontinental Exchange   NYSE ICE    an unlikely acquirer  has shown interest in the online marketplace giant eBay   NASDAQ EBAY    ICE  owner of the New York Stock Exchange  confirmed its interest in buying eBay in a press release at the end of the trading day on February 4th  shooting EBAY shares up almost 10   ICE stock has traded down over 8  since this news was released 

ICE wants EBAY shareholders to be aware of its interest in the company  as they believe an acquisition would be beneficial to shareholders of both firms  Below is a quote directly from ICE s press release 
 Over ICE s 20 year history  the company s track record of creating shareholder value  both through organic growth and acquisitions  speaks for itself  ICE does look to explore potential opportunities that it expects will deliver enhanced shareholder value and will continue to do so in the future  
Potential Synergies
A financial exchange and an ecommerce site may sound like an odd couple  but they are more similar than you think  Both of these businesses provide effectively the same essential function  connecting buyers and sellers  The only real difference is that one marketplace is for financial instruments  while the other is for consumer products 
EBAY is looking ripe for a buyout with this stock trading at its lowest forward P E  12 2x  in over a decade  before ICE s announcement  It wouldn t surprise me at all if this global online marketplace has been approached with other offers 

ICE is an acquisition machine  but up until this point  the firm has only been interested in businesses that expand its core competencies  financial data and exchanges  eBay would be an out of the box acquisition for ICE  Analysts   investors are concerned that eBay would not create nearly the same cost synergies as an exchange  and it is vague how this acquisition would further ICE s move towards becoming a data driven business 
Founder  Chairman    CEO Jeffrey Sprecher has a sound track record of successful acquisitions that have created value for his shareholders since the firm was founded two decades ago  Sprecher has pushed ICE s share price up over 1333  since it went public at the end of 2005 
All the stars would have to align for this deal to go through  This is not the first time ICE has approached eBay  and according to the press release  eBay has not engaged the current offer in a meaningful way  Even if eBay does agree to the acquisition  it is going to take some convincing to get ICE s shareholders onboard with this acquisition 
Take Away
I have confidence in management s insight into the matter  and if this does go through  I have faith that this will benefit ICE s long term objective  Regardless of what happens  I believe that the share price drop has created a buying opportunity for this financial powerhouse

145498,367013,ICE,IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Meets Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   came out with quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 94 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets would post earnings of  0 95 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 06  delivering a surprise of 11 58  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
ICE  which belongs to the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry  posted revenues of  1 30 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 14   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 31 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ICE shares have added about 0 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 2  
What s Next for ICE 
While ICE has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ICE was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 02 on  1 36 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 17 on  5 52 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Securities and Exchanges is currently in the bottom 20  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intercontinentalexchange-ice-meets-q4-earnings-estimates-200505176,200505176
145499,367014,ICE,Alteryx  Boeing  Intercontinental Exchange And EBay As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate Release         Chicago  IL   February 6  2020    highlights Alteryx Inc    NYSE AYX   as the Bull of the Day and Boeing   NYSE BA   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onIntercontinental Exchange   NYSE ICE   and eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks                                                 Promising software companies tend to trade at fairly high valuation multiples  The lure for investors is the scalability of the business  It can be costly to develop  test and market new software products  but once a critical mass of sales is reached  gross margins skyrocket   because the marginal cost of each deliverable is fairly small Once a software company swings solidly into profitability  the shares often get a boost as investors anticipate a steep increase in revenues and earnings as the stock  grows into  its previously lofty valuation Alteryx Inc  appears to be on the brink of just such an inflection point and a Wednesday selloff may be just the catalyst investors needed to achieve an attractive entry point Based in Irvine  CA in the heart of Silicon Valley  Alteryx is a fast growing developer of data science and analytic software  Their products put the power of advanced data science in the hands of the end user The genesis of Alteryx was a data engine that incorporated data from the US Census and allowed customers to analyze the information graphically in order to reach target demographics as accurately as possible  Eventually  Alteryx software was included by the Census Bureau in packages of information it sold commercially That original product grew into analytics tools that allow customers to easily manage and evaluate sets of data of all sizes  from small and specific to huge sets of global information  The goal is to make advanced data science functionality available to solve complex business problems even to those who don t have rigorous training in the field Business is booming After operating at near break even levels for several quarters  Alteryx broke through in Q3 2019 with a net profit of  0 24 share  handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of just  0 08 share Analysts are expecting another profitable quarter with  0 29 share in net earnings on  131 million in revenues when the company posts year end results on February 13th  bringing full year 2019 earnings to  0 60 share   a massive improvement over the  0 02 share loss Alteryx posted in 2018 Projections for 2020 are even better with  516M in sales and  0 83 share in net earnings   increases of 31  and 39   respectively That s really the sweet spot for a software company   the point at which earnings start to grow faster than revenues because of the effect of improving margins Due in part to a strong rally over the past two months  Alteryx still trades at a very rich 12 month forward P E ratio of 175X  but investors caught a break when the shares fell more than 6  on Wednesday on no significant news for the company or the industry Another earnings beat next week should get Alteryx moving in a positive direction again  making this temporary selloff a buying opportunity Just as we often say that cheap stocks are cheap for a reason  it s likewise true that expensive stocks can be expensive for a reason  In the case of Alteryx  the high multiple is a reflection of the company s enormous potential You wouldn t want a whole portfolio full of high priced names  but having a few companies with this type of growth potential can represent a great opportunity to hit some home runs  It s been more than a year since the first fatal accident involving Boeing s 737 MAX aircraft and 10 months since the second crash and the subsequent worldwide grounding of the company s most popular   and most profitable   plane Boeing shares took a hit on the initial news  especially the revelations that an advanced control system that had been added to the aircraft   ostensibly to make it safer   had likely contributed to both accidents as the pilots struggled to control the planes after the MCAS system took over to prevent a stall that wasn t actually happening Troubling internal memos that Boeing eventually turned over amid a Congressional investigation indicated that Boeing engineers and test pilots had doubts about the safety and effectiveness of the MCAS system during the development process  yet their concerns went unheeded as the workhorse 737 became an increasingly complicated machine The shares tumbled from an all time closing high of  440 in March 2019  but held fairly steady in the  350  380 range  largely because even as Boeing temporarily suspended production of the MAX  they retained outstanding orders for the plane that stretched 5 10 years into the future  Investors believed that any revenue shortfall would be fairly quickly made up once the MAX was back in the skies There s no sign of an imminent certification for the 737 Max to resume commercial flights and even the most optimistic estimates now anticipate that the middle of 2020 is the earliest possibility  Former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was ousted by the board of directors and his replacement David Calhoun has been incentivized with a possible bonus of up to  7 million if he achieves several milestones   chiefly overseeing the return of the 737 MAX to the skies The spread of the deadly Coronavirus and a corresponding severe drop off in air travel to  from and within China has added to fears of softening demand for new aircraft orders The most recent Boeing annual report issued at the end of January shows the effect of the 737 grounding in stark detail Revenue was down 25 percent between 2018 and 2019  from  101 1 billion to  76 6 billion  Operating cash flow had been  15 3 billion in 2018 turned into an operating loss of  2 4 billion  Core earnings of  16 01 share in 2018 became a net loss of   3 47  share in 2019 Recent analyst downward revisions earn Boeing a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  The earnings presentation also included a frankly worded warning about the potential impact on future results  Boeing cited the timing and conditions of regulatory approvals  the ongoing production rate and delivery profile and an estimated  4B of  abnormal  production costs to be expensed as incurred  but primarily in 2020  Those are expenses associated with the suspension of production and the eventual resumption of production at low output   Management noted that they are prudently managing liquidity and preserving balance sheet flexibility   a worthy endeavor  but hardly the encouraging language of a company that s firing on all cylinders Boeing is a veritable titan of US engineering and manufacturing and it s likely that once the 737 mess is resolved  the company will regain its positive earnings trajectory  For the time being however  investors would be wise to steer clear of Boeing until the timing of the recovery is more clear Additional content Owner of NYSE Approaches eBay  Creates Buying

145500,367015,ICE,Blistering Rally Slows As Tesla Hits Reverse  Jobs Data Awaited,opinion,"The beat goes on  but a little less intensely so far today  Though stocks enjoyed more overnight gains as China announced tariff cuts and overseas markets rose  it looks like the parabolic rally of the last two days is slowing down 
That s not too surprising  Major indices are at record highs  and Tuesday and Wednesday s kind of gains aren t easy to sustain  We might need some new catalysts to keep the party hopping  and the China tariff news today is nice but not unexpected  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   which helped spark things earlier this week  got slammed yesterday and is down again in pre market trading  
Following the bounce yesterday  attention could turn away from earnings and toward tomorrow s monthly payrolls data  Analysts generally anticipate a slight improvement in job and wage growth for January  The average analyst estimate ahead of Friday s report is for job growth of 164 000 in January  according to Briefing com  up a bit from December s lukewarm 145 000  Some analysts think growth could top 170 000  We ll see 
Analysts also expect wages to climb a more solid 0 3  in January after rising just 0 1  in December  Keep an eye on year over year wage growth  which has been coming down from last year s long stretch of 3  or higher and was only 2 9  last time out  That s not too shabby because it still outpaces inflation  but it would be good to see more money hitting the average person s wallet  
Weekly jobless claims edged lower to just 202 000  according to data this morning  U S  productivity rose 1 4  in Q4  below the expected 1 6  
Hopes for progress fighting the coronavirus probably played a big role in yesterday s recovery  and so did word from some high profile economists that the virus might not have a big impact on the economy  A big comeback in crude prices  sometimes seen as a canary in the coal mine for world economic demand  also helped propel stocks 
The 10 year Treasury yield rose all the way back to nearly 1 65  on Wednesday before dipping to 1 63  early today  It could be an important indicator to watch Thursday for more insight on the path forward for stocks  If it climbs back above old technical support at 1 7  and into the range between 1 7  and 1 95  that it occupied for many weeks prior to last month  maybe that sends a signal that investors have more confidence in the U S  economy  The challenge remains low yields overseas  where the German bund is way under water at negative 0 37   
Crude and gold delivered small gains ahead of Thursday s open  and volatility eased even further  The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  is below 15 after testing 20 last week 
Aid For The Needy TSLA which looks like it s in the midst of a classic short squeeze cooled off in a big way Wednesday  but almost everything else continued to sizzle as coronarvirus fears eased The warmth extended to some sectors that had a rough time so far this year  including Energy and Health Care  The fact that crude oil got its head back above  50 a barrel again Wednesday helped some of the big energy firms  while voting in Iowa appeared to give a helping hand to Health Care  especially some of the providers  This isn t a political column  but we have to consider politics in the case of Health Care yesterday  The lack of a clear winner in the Iowa caucuses is one of the things that might have helped the sector  Some expected Sen  Bernie Sanders to win  and he s talked about replacing private health coverage  Now experts watching the Health Care space say the sector could be helped if someone else emerges and doesn t sound as threatening Strong earnings from Humana  NYSE HUM  appeared to be another bullish development for Health Care  and some analysts raised their price targets for the company  Lately  the entire sector had been running in the mud  with almost any good news met with resistance  That didn t happen Wednesday  The Earnings BeatA few big companies saw their stocks take a beating yesterday as investors reacted to earnings and forecasts  Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS   Ford  NYSE F  and Merck  NYSE MRK  gave up ground and  Nike   NYSE NKE  also got clipped  like DIS  by China demand worries  General Motors  NYSE GM  moved higher 
On the positive side  Twitter  NYSE TWTR  is up big this morning after the company missed analysts  earnings estimates but reported a bigger than expected gain in user numbers 
After the closing bell today come earnings from Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  and Uber  NYSE UBER   both of which might be interesting to check  Barron s said ATVI investors could key in on adjusted revenue from both Call of Duty mobile and console releases and World of Warcraft Classic 
Though TSLA is in reverse  another big company s shares enjoyed a meteoric rise Wednesday  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  rose more than 17  after getting a favorable patent decision for a multiple sclerosis drug  The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose more than 2 5  Wednesday  helped by BIIB  
TSLA s hammering yesterday goes to show you can t go up forever  That said  TD Ameritrade data shows that millennial investors were big buyers of the stock most of last year  so they might be enjoying the fruits of that even with yesterday s sharp losses 






CHART OF THE DAY   CHANNELING THE DOLLAR  The U S  Dollar Index  DXY  has been in a slow uptrend for over a year  though it may be hard to spot without the aid of the yellow channel lines  After briefly piercing the lower channel in late 2019  DXY has returned to the trend in recent days  Data source  ICE  NYSE ICE  Data Services  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results   
Fed Still Seen Likely to Wait  Despite the shellacking stocks took last week amid coronavirus fears  investors seem relatively confident that the Fed plans to hold rates about where they are well into 2020  Chances of a rate cut even by late July remain below 50   according to CME futures  The market puts 92  odds on rates holding steady at next month s meeting  Earlier this week  Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said the virus hasn t changed his economic outlook  media reports said  
Earnings Tally Looks Brighter  It looks like S P 500 companies collected a few more Franklins and Hamiltons last quarter than analysts originally gave them credit for  While Q4 earnings season is only about 75  over  enough companies have reported to give a decent sense of how things might ultimately turn out  As of Wednesday  research firm CFRA pegged Q4 earnings growth yes  that s growth at 0 4   Most analysts went into the quarter expecting a small overall earnings loss  The updated FactSet estimate is likely coming tomorrow 
Looking more closely  five of the 11 S P 500 sectors are still expected to report earnings in the red column  CFRA said  led by double digit declines in Energy  Industrials  and Materials  The firm expects Utilities and Financials to enjoy double digit earnings growth in Q4  CFRA expects full year 2019 earnings to be up 1   and looks for 6 6  earnings growth this year  down from its previous estimate of 7 6   Some analysts might be paring back Q1 earnings and economic growth estimates due to the coronavirus and its potential impact on China s economy 
Can You Trade Tesla  Well  sure  it s possible  However  trading TSLA  here is something you shouldn t consider unless you really understand the risk and how to control it  You can make small or big bets  but you have to control risk and limit it  Decide how much money you can lose in any trade before tip toeing in  As we noted yesterday  there s something futures traders used to warn newcomers about back in the Chicago trading pit days  They would say   Be careful  Sometimes there are chocolate covered hand grenades   Meaning something that looks luscious from the outside might bite you back if you handle it too much 
At this point  shares have come down double digits from early week highs  but consider that even a nearly 50  drop from current levels would put TSLA above what had been all time highs until recently  The company would also still have a market cap that s among the highest in the auto industry  Does that whet your appetite

145517,367032,ICE,Oil Holds Biggest Weekly Loss Since July on Easing Gulf Tension,news," Bloomberg     Oil was steady after the biggest weekly drop since July as an easing of geopolitical tension in the Middle East turned attention back to a flood of new supply set to hit the market this year 
The threat of an outright war has receded since Tehran fired missiles at U S  Iraqi bases last week in retaliation for Washington s assassination of its top general  The situation in Iran remains volatile  however  amid protests against the government s accidental downing of a commercial airliner  In Libya  warring factions have called a cease fire in their nine month conflict 
West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery added 6 cents to  59 10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 8 45 a m  local time  approaching its 50 day moving average  The contract fell 6 4  last week  the most since mid July 
Oil prices are now back where they were in mid December  with the market seemingly shrugging off the chance of more disruptions in the Persian Gulf  The lack of a geopolitical risk premium is partly due to plentiful supplies of U S  shale and a torrent of new crude from non OPEC countries including Brazil  Guyana and Norway  On the demand side  the U S  and China are set to sign their limited trade deal this week  which may improve sentiment 
 We are now rolling into a period with a softer fundamental oil market balance   said Helge Andre Martinsen  senior oil market analyst at DNB Bank ASA   We need actual supply disruptions to push prices close to  70  But watch out for increasing Iranian proxy activity and an acceleration of Iran s nuclear program in the months ahead  
Brent Futures for March settlement was 13 cents higher at  65 11 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe Exchange after losing 5 3  last week  The global crude benchmark traded at a  5 99 premium to WTI for the same month 
While the chances of imminent war have lessened  relations between the U S  and Iran remain combustible  Tehran has said it will stop abiding by limits on uranium enrichment  while the U S  imposed new sanctions on the Islamic Republic  Oil markets are underestimating the risks in the Middle East and may be wrong in assuming Iran s retaliation is over  said Jason Bordoff  head of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York 
The U S  reported record weekly net oil exports earlier this month  Meanwhile  Brazil and Guyana are set to add more than 400 000 barrels of combined daily supplies to the market this year  a volume that would offset most of the auxiliary cuts agreed to by OPEC and its allies in late 2019  according to Stratas Advisors ",2020-01-13,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-holds-biggest-weekly-loss-since-july-on-easing-gulf-tension-2058015,2058015

Futures slipped as much as 0 7  in New York to near  58 a barrel as traders focused on the approaching seasonal lull in demand once winter ends  and amid signs of plentiful supply around the world  The American Petroleum Institute reported inventories expanded by 1 1 million barrels last week  according to people familiar with the data 
West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery fell 16 cents  or 0 3   to  58 07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 10 14 a m  in London  The contract closed Monday at the lowest since Dec  3  Concerns that the U S  and Iran were headed for conflict over the killing of an Iranian general  which sent prices soaring earlier this month  have largely dissipated 
Front month WTI Futures were at a discount  or contango  to second month for a second day  a relationship normally suggesting oversupply 
Brent futures for March settlement dropped 15 cents to  64 34 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange after climbing 0 5  on Tuesday  The global benchmark crude traded at a  6 22 premium to WTI for the same month 
 The preliminary API data is likely weighing on sentiment this morning   said Harry Tchilinguirian  head of commodity markets strategy at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  SA 
The U S  government s Energy Information Administration will release official data on stockpiles later today  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast that the EIA will report that inventories rose by 1 1 million barrels in the week ended Jan  10  in line with the API s numbers  It would be the second straight increase following three weeks of declines 
There were mixed sentiments about the trade pact that President Donald Trump is poised to sign with China  which in theory defuses tensions that weighed on markets throughout last year  but isn t wholly assuaging concerns  Existing U S  tariffs on Chinese goods are likely to stay in place until after the presidential election  people familiar said  while Reuters reported the U S  is drafting more rules to block sales to Huawei Technologies Co 
 While the stay in existing tariffs may be disappointing  further details from the agreement tonight might change the mood in the market   said Howie Lee  an economist at Oversea Chinese Banking Corp  in Singapore   Additional positive details  especially pertaining to phase two negotiations  might yet give crude prices a lift  ",2020-01-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-trades-near-sixweek-low-as-data-shows-us-stockpiles-rose-2059766,2059766
145524,367039,ICE,Oil Climbs the Most in Two Weeks as Trade Deals Boost Optimism,news," Bloomberg     Oil posted its largest gain in almost two weeks  swept along in a broader equities rally as the preliminary U S  China trade truce and an accord between America  Canada and Mexico fueled optimism about economic growth 
Futures settled 1 2  higher Thursday  as stocks hit record highs  Under the initial settlement between the world s largest economies  China pledged to increase purchases of U S  commodities  Also  the Senate approved President Trump s U S  Mexico Canada  USMCA  trade accord that revamps the 1994 NAFTA agreement 
 The China U S  agreement and the Senate passing of USMCA   will help to boost the economy  said Michael Lynch  president of Strategic Energy   Economic Research Inc  in Winchester  Massachusetts   After 3 years  here is the first two bits of good news for the economy  
Prices bounced back after sinking to a six week low Wednesday when the Energy Information Administration reported domestic petroleum stocks had expanded to the highest levels in four months 
The market would have appeared to have risen more Wednesday if price hadn t fallen sharply before the U S  China trade signing  said Lynch   The market had worked harder to get prices off that low  
The Paris based International Energy Agency in a report forecast China s oil demand would average 14 1 million barrels a day this year  compared with 13 6 million last year   China was a source of worry  and concerns were that its demand would slow  But that doesn t appear to have been the case   Lynch said 
West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery rose 71 cents to settle at  58 52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising the most since Jan  8

Futures in New York were steady after closing up 1 2  Thursday  Washington and Beijing signed a phase one trade deal on Wednesday  while the Senate passed the U S  Mexico Canada free trade agreement a day later  However  that wasn t enough to stop crude from heading for a second weekly decline after a big jump in American oil product stockpiles highlighted weak demand 
China pledged  52 4 billion in additional purchases of American energy over 2020 and 2021 in the agreement  although there was some skepticism in the market about whether it would be able to reach the target  Meanwhile  the International Energy Agency warned in its monthly report that supplies from Iraq  the Middle East s second biggest producer  are potentially vulnerable due to rising political risks in the country and broader region 
 The big mover for oil was the double whammy of positivity from the U S  China trade deal and the Senate passing the USMCA   Stephen Innes  Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader  said in a note  That  should provide a significant lift to the U S  economy and give a boost to oil prices since the U S  is the largest consumer of oil   he said

145528,367043,ICE,Oil Falls for Second Week as Ample Supply Offsets Trade Hopes,news," Bloomberg     Oil declined for the second week as signs that supplies remain plentiful offset optimism over the signing of the U S  China trade agreement 
Futures in New York were little changed Friday but ended the week 0 9  lower  Refiners have turned a crude surplus into a product surplus with U S  gasoline and distillate stocks expanding by over 40 million barrels last week  The build overshadowed Beijing s commitment to spending  52 4 billion in additional purchases of American energy in the next two years as part the phase one trade deal between the world s biggest economies 
 There is a positive vibe after the trade deal  but the fact is we are so oversupplied it s going to be difficult to get the market up past  60   said Bob Yawger  futures director at Mizuho Securities USA LLC in New York 
Before the landmark U S  China accord was signed  prices reached a six week low Wednesday after U S  government data showed petroleum inventories in the country expanded to the highest levels since September  Inventories at the critical Cushing  Oklahoma  commercial storage hub rose for the first time in 10 weeks

145535,367050,ICE,TIPS ETFs Likely To Benefit From Fed Meeting,opinion,"The Federal Reserve stayed put on its interest rate policy on Jan 29  after three rate cuts in 2019  It also hinted at keeping interest rates unchanged in 2020 unless there is any drastic change in the economic outlook  The central bank has kept the benchmark interest rates at the band of 1 50 1 75   The Federal Reserve put stress on the importance  
The Fed has acknowledged the strength of the U S  job market while raised concerns about the new coronavirus from China  Fed chair Powell indicated that the coronavirus outbreak is   which will have some effects on the Chinese economy  at least in the short term   The World Health Organization plans to reconsider whether the new virus outbreak from China should be seen as a global pandemic 
Great Time for TIPS ETFs 
TIPS offers robust real returns during inflationary periods unlike its unprotected peers in the fixed income world  These securities pay an interest on an inflated principal amount  principal rises with inflation  and when the securities mature  investors get either the inflation adjusted principal or the original principal  whichever is greater  As a result  both principal amount and interest payments will keep on increasing with rising consumer prices 
This mechanism may make TIPS ETFs an investors  darling in the coming days as the U S  central bank affirms commitment to higher inflation  The Fed committee tried to notify that their policy is inclined to  inflation returning to the Committee s   
Investors should note that in recent months  Fed officials have expressed concerns about their incapability to   So  the latest dialogue appears confirmatory of the pickup in U S  inflation  read    
Though the expected trend of inflation depends a lot on the movement of energy prices  which are likely to be depressed due to the coronavirus outbreak   investors with a long term view can count on the potential uptick in inflation as the U S  economic backdrop appears more stable than before  read

145550,367065,ICE,Iran U S  Tensions Stoke Fears of Spike in Gasoline Prices,news," Bloomberg     Escalating Iran U S  tensions raise the prospect of a spike in gasoline prices  though the effects so far have been minimal 
Gasoline prices have held steady in the U S  following the Thursday killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iran s threats of retaliation that could include attacks designed to disrupt the flow of crude oil  However  oil and gasoline prices could surge if hostilities escalate 
 So far  what we ve seen in oil    which is about a  1 per barrel increase from a week ago    is not too unsurprising   Patrick DeHaan  senior petroleum analyst at retail fuel price tracker GasBuddy  said by phone   But more of the impact could be after Iran retaliates  which they ve certainly all but promised to the U S  at this point  
Even so  motorists may see a  slight uptick  in gasoline prices over the next seven to 12 days  DeHaan predicted 
Auto club AAA reported a nationwide average of  2 58 per gallon on Monday  Gasoline futures also show little change  with the NYMEX RBOB contract for February delivery up just 0 38  at  1 75 per gallon 
Oil futures rose as much as 3 1  on Monday  Brent crude oil futures climbed to as high as  70 74 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe after a 3 6  surge Friday  West Texas Intermediate for February delivery climbed as much as 2 65  and were at  63 16 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 12 21 p m 
Ample domestic supply and slowing economic growth ensure any increase in oil prices isn t expected to last long  said Jim Lucier  managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners 
A surge in U S  crude oil production has helped insulate the country from supply disruptions overseas 
 Before the U S  energy revolution took off  American consumers were generally vulnerable to price shocks due to instability in the Middle East   said Dean Foreman  chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute   However  the rise of U S  energy leadership has helped to reduce market volatility by about half since 2014  Consequently  recent geopolitical events have had relatively small effects on energy prices and provide a consistent reminder of how vital it is to have a strong domestic U S  oil and natural gas industry  ",2020-01-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iranus-tensions-stoke-fears-of-spike-in-gasoline-prices-2053305,2053305

145553,367068,ICE,Schwab In Great Position To Return More Capital To Shareholders,opinion,"With Schwab s balance sheet restructuring  check out the changes in cash flow generation for the discount broker cum asset management king  the last 3 years 
While some of this might be temporary  the cash flow and free cash flow improvement means that Schwab  NYSE SCHW  COULD return more capital to shareholders over the next few years  Given the conservative nature of Schwab however  that doesn t mean it will 





Looking at the periods  pre balance sheet restructuring  which has resulted in the recent surge of cash flow  but Schwab should be able to generate at least  1 billion to  1 5 billion in free cash flow every quarter  which would result in  4 to  6 billion annually 
 Readers can see from looking at the dividend and share repo section that Schwab went years without repurchasing any stock  
The question is whether Schwab wants the dividend to be a bigger share of capital return or whether the Board wants to hold back more capital and use excess for share repurchases  Presently  the dividend is less than 10  of Schwab s free cash flow while the pay out ratio  less meaningful  is 25  of Schwab s earnings per share 
Chuck s Valuation

Note Schwab s current cash flow and free cash flow per share valuation and the free cash flow yield   lines 692  693  and 698  Finally  here is a chart update on Schwab  from Gary S  Morrow   garysmorrow   a great technician  posted last Friday  November 15 

Conclusion
Chuck has already endured the worst of the selling around the zero commission price war  but that bad news is masking many positives around Schwab s balance sheet restructuring and cash flow generation  Even if we assume that the surge in Schwab s cash flow is somewhat temporary   steady state  assumptions still indicate Schwab will have more capital to return to shareholders over the next few years 
Morningstar retained Schwab s  wide moat  status after the zero commission headlines  and Schwab s recent business update last week noted that Schwab s  new accounts  rose 142 000 in October  19  up 31  from September  19  yes  one month change  and rose 7  from October  18 
For full and fair disclosure  Schwab has been this blog s primary custodian since Day 1  in May  1995  and there has never been need for another one  although at times I m sure Chuck has wanted to strangle me  and I them   The support teams are great 
Schwab s all time high was May  18 near  58 per share  Calendar 2020   per Street consensus   is looking for a slightly negative year in terms of revenue and EPS growth   2  and  7  respectively  but let s see if Schwab doesn t use some of the excess capital to repurchase shares 
Finally a caveat for readers  typically Financial stocks do not traditionally get valued on  cash flow  and free cash flow basis  but rather capital adequacy and return on equity  However Schwab  and the discount brokers like the exchanges   CME  ICE  NYSE ICE    are more asset intensive with volume driven over a fixed cost base  Schwab might have to retain some of that excess cash flow to hold on the balance sheet to generate interest income  but some of that will also likely get returned to shareholders 
The bottom line is that the stock is substantially cheaper today with the worst of the price wars behind it  As Schwab works through 2020 the lowest expected growth it s expecting in years  long term investors should take an interest in the stock

145555,367070,ICE,10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs Of 2019,opinion,Amid both peaks and troughs  the ETF industry is seeing explosive growth  courtesy of its unique strategies  creativity  transparency  diversification benefits  enhanced tax competences  low turnover and of course low cost  Additionally  rise in  thematic investing  and craze for  smart beta  have increased the popularity of ETFs Investors seek to trade in ETFs that can easily be purchased and sold on the market  suggesting that the funds should have enough liquidity  Volume  or the number of shares traded in a particular period  is definitely the most important consideration for determining the liquidity of a particular fund  Higher number of shares provides easy access to move in and out of the product  keeping the bid ask spreads tight  read    Further  greater volume ensures easy creation and redemption of shares in the fund basket  which is a regular and vital mechanism in ETFs  This is especially true as authorized participants  AP  have the ability to create new baskets of ETF shares for underlying securities or redeem them when required  This phenomenon allows ETFs to trade in line with their net asset value  NAV  Nevertheless  assessing just the number of shares is not a profitable task  as a higher number of cheaper funds can be bought for a given amount of money  leading to increased volumes  As a result  honing in on dollar volume ETFs will reveal the true picture of liquidity  Dollar volume measures the number of shares traded multiplied by share price  see      That said  we

145557,367072,ICE,Oil Set for Biggest Weekly Loss Since July as Mideast Risk Eases,news," Bloomberg     Oil headed for its biggest weekly loss since July as the prospect of an immediate confrontation between the U S  and Iran abated  allaying fears of disruption to Middle East energy supplies 
Futures initially soared to an eight month high above  65 a barrel in New York on Jan  8 as Washington and Tehran faced off after the killing of a top Iranian general  but all of this year s gains dissipated as the two adversaries backed away from a full scale conflict  Crude is now trading back below  60  down 5 9  for the week 
The aborted rally is another sign that global oil markets remain comfortably supplied  largely because of the U S  shale oil revolution  Nationwide crude inventories increased by 1 16 million barrels last week despite expectations for a decline  and gasoline stockpiles hit a 10 month high  government data showed on Jan  8 
Crude Oil WTI Futures for February delivery slipped 17 cents  or 0 3   to  59 39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 10 50 a m  London time  Brent futures for March settlement lost 13 cents to  65 24 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange 
 The situation in the oil market has eased surprisingly quickly   said Carsten Fritsch  an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt   While the start of the week was still dominated by concerns about the conflict between the U S  and Iran escalating and possibly resulting in disruptions to oil shipments  this topic now appears to be considered closed  
The conflict has so far spared output and exports from the Middle East  and the global market has a comfortable supply cushion  OPEC members are sitting on huge amounts of spare capacity after cutting production for most of the past three years  and American production is increasing 
However  tensions in the Persian Gulf remains elevated as President Donald Trump continues to squeeze Tehran with stringent economic sanctions over its nuclear program  Less than four months ago  half of Saudi Arabia s production capacity was temporarily disabled in a missile strike    which the U S  blames on Iran but the Islamic Republic refutes    a stark reminder of the vulnerability of facilities in the region that supplies about a third of the world s oil 
 Although the threat of outright war has receded  the industry remains on edge  expecting disruptions like shipping incidents or attacks on oil facilities on par with events last year   Eurasia Group analysts Robert Johnston and Henning Gloystein said in a note

145573,367088,ICE,IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   came out with quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 95 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 85 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11 58   A quarter ago  it was expected that this owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of 2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ICE  which belongs to the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry  posted revenues of  1 34 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 16   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 20 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ICE shares have added about 23 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 5  
What s Next for ICE 
While ICE has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ICE was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 on  1 34 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 82 on  5 23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Securities and Exchanges is currently in the top 4  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intercontinentalexchange-ice-q3-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates-200480762,200480762
145579,367094,ICE,The Phil Flynn Energy Report  11 12 2019,opinion,"53 Billion Barrels Of Oil With No Place To Go
Iran raised a few eyeballs after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran has a new oil field that would increase Iran s proven reserves by an impressive 53 billion barrels of oil  Overnight  this would increase its proven reserves by about one third  The only problem is  with sanctions in place and the lack of capital investment  that oil might not see the light of day for decades to come  There is also some speculation that the timing of the announcement might be a way to tweak its rival Saudi Arabia just before they are trying to price its Saudi Aramco IPO 
Regardless  Dow Jones reported that an Energy Department official has confirmed that sanctions on Iran have removed about 2 0 million barrels from the global marketplace  This comes a day after it was reported by Reuters that Iran is enriching uranium at its underground Fordow site  The reports say that Iran is rapidly accelerating enrichment more broadly according to a report by the U N  s International Atomic Energy Agency  Iran is making further breaches of its 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reduces the odds that a deal with Iran to lift sanctions can be had and this is bullish for oil 
This comes as that same official suggested that the U S  will hit a production level of 3 0 million barrels a day  Still that same official seems to suggest that despite the increase in supply  he sees U S  shale producers pulling back  He says that it is a healthy sign that shale producers are going after value and not volume 
IMO rules are causing wide swings in the market  Bloomberg reports that late last week  high sulfur fuel oil for December was trading at a discount of almost  30 a barrel to Brent  according to data from ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe  In June  the same contract was at a  13 discount  The ship fuel rules  known as IMO 2020 by traders  are expected to favor low sulfur crudes  and both Urals and Arab Light have a relatively high content of the pollutant 
Oil prices are moving positively on trade developments  According to reports it appears that the Trump Administration is going to delay EU auto tariffs as negotiations seem to be bearing fruit  Also there is speculation that Trump will say some positive things about U S  China trade talk progress  Still  behind the U S  China trade talks is the fact that protests in China are becoming more violent  Some fear this could complicate trade progress 
We are still getting a lot of feedback about the Energy Information Administration article  I want to give Mr  Robert Merriam time to explain what he thinks is important from our back and forth from my readers  He says to the main points to help readers understand that EIA counts reports barrels as imports  and CBP reports exports  as when they clear U S  Customs   This process is done digitally electronically  often in advance by a few days  of the vessel arrival to the U S  port of destination  so it s not tied to the ship s physical location  Moreover  abbreviated tweets on the pro of the vessel arrival to U S  port of destination  so it s not tied to the ship s physical location  Moreover  abbreviated tweets on the process made it seem that we re simply waiting for some shipping clerk to file paperwork and mail it in  That does sound pretty lax but that s not the case at all   These transactions are filed digitally by the importer exporter and are uploaded into the CBP transactions database that is made available to EIA in near real time  In addition  for imports  we conduct our own survey that captures their reports directly and compare that to what is filed with Customs to validate our imports surveys  We re simply measuring these import export transactions at a different point in time from the ship trackers and it s not based on when they land 
I think the crux of  some  reader skepticism is that they doubted the estimated weekly export drop and thus assumed that we backed into or errantly derived the stock build as a result  giving the market an errant signal  That s a major misconception and likely the reason that those traders who better understand the new relationship and reasons underlying massive daily moves in out of crude from inventory are not shocked by the large stock swings in some weeks  once they fully assess the factors that likely caused it  resulting in the muted price moves we often see despite some analysts  fixation on one number in isolation without context  stocks 
Our stock data is collected directly by us  from the largest holders of crude who are distinct from the import export entities  Also  note that when the import is reported to us as clearing Customs in a reporting week  the terminal refinery that will be receiving that shipment as inventory is directed to also include that shipment as part of their inventory  i e   in transit inventory  so that we have accounted for both ends of the transaction both the import and in transit inventory are collected in the same week  This too can contribute to large weekly inventory swings  as VLCCs and other large tankers become players 
It s independently collected data from different sources  refiners  importers  terminals  pipelines  blenders  that we assess against each other as part of our rigorous validation efforts each week  This past week  the large decline in  cleared Customs  exports was directionally fully supportive of the large build in inventory build that was reported to us 
We regularly assess our weekly estimates by comparing each element to the later provided monthly data  In the case of crude exports  we review the Census monthly data and compare it to initial weekly figures  For exports  we re seeing that our weekly estimates in the last 12 months are often within   5  or so  This is a vast improvement over our prior export estimation methodology  I ve pasted down below a quick comparison of weekly vs  monthly crude export comparisons for the last 12 months  I ve used the 4 week avg  for the month nearest to the month s end compared to Census  monthly published valued for the same month  The green indicates our weekly estimate was higher than Census monthly  the yellow is lower  I think the results are pretty good and show no pattern or over under estimation bias  But I push my staff to continue to look for ways to make these results even tighter 
I am fully aware of the scrutiny our weekly data gets each week and the importance the market places on these reports  not just for stocks  but for all the elements and all products  So I push my staff to apply best methods and rigor in the short time we have to get out our weekly estimates  We assess our results against the later received monthly data we collect too and also other available third party sources  which I d encourage all analysts to do as well  I d argue that we come very close in almost every case for the vast majority of elements  but one shouldn t expect perfect precision given the complexity and reality of survey sampling  But I m proud of the work my team does and the high quality we produce even as we look to keep getting better  no doubt there are opportunities for that ",2019-11-12,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-phil-flynn-energy-report-11122019-200484592,200484592

145587,367102,ICE,Oil Steady After Biggest Loss in Three Weeks on Supply Outlook,news," Bloomberg     Oil steadied after the biggest decline in three weeks on Friday as Kuwait aimed to reach a deal with Saudi Arabia that will restore crude output along their border  and U S  shale explorers boosted drilling 
February futures held above  60 a barrel in New York after falling 1 2  on Friday  the steepest pullback since Nov  29  The Kuwait Saudi shared neutral zone  which has been shut for at least four years due to disputes between the two countries  can produce as much as 500 000 barrels a day  U S  explorers last week increased drilling by the most in almost two years  according to data from Baker Hughes Co   boosting the supply outlook

 Prices increased a bit too far in the fourth quarter  and I m keeping a negative price outlook for the first half of 2020   said Giovanni Staunovo  an analyst at UBS Group AG in Zurich   It s surprising that market participants remain unconcerned about what looks to be another strong year of non OPEC supply ahead

145588,367103,ICE,Oil Steadies Amid Middle East Tensions  Shrinking Stockpiles,news," Bloomberg     Oil steadied after posting its biggest annual gain in three years amid elevated tensions in the Middle East and signs that U S  crude stockpiles fell further 
Futures held near  61 a barrel in New York  An Iran backed Iraqi militia withdrew from the U S  embassy in Baghdad after storming the compound to protest deadly airstrikes  The American Petroleum Institute reported crude inventories fell again last week  according to Reuters  Official data is due on Friday 
Oil had a strong end to last year following an agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to deepen output cuts  and a breakthrough in the U S  China trade dispute  President Donald Trump said he will sign the first phase of a deal on Jan  15 and later go to Beijing to begin talks on a second stage  There were other bullish signs for crude with the 50 day moving average for West Texas Intermediate rising above the 200 day marker 
 The New Year is starting in an upbeat mood   said Tamas Varga  an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd   The oil balance is to get tighter provided OPEC will keep fulfilling its swing producer role

145589,367104,ICE,Oil Soars as U S  Killing of Iran General Stirs Fear of Conflict,news," Bloomberg     Oil jumped toward  70 a barrel in London after a U S  airstrike ordered by President Donald Trump killed a top Iranian general in Iraq  intensifying fears of conflict in the world s most important crude producing region 
Brent futures surged by more than 4  in busy trading on Friday to levels not seen since the attacks on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities in September  The airstrike near Baghdad airport killed Qassem Soleimani  the Iranian general who led the Revolutionary Guards  Quds force  according to a U S  Defense Department statement 
While no oil installations or production were affected  targeting one of Iran s most powerful generals ratchets up tension between Washington and Tehran  heightening fears of an armed confrontation that could pull in other countries  Iran s supreme leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  vowed that  severe retaliation  awaits the killers of Soleimani 
 This is a seismic event in the region   said Jason Bordoff  a former Barack Obama administration official who now works for Columbia University   This is how U S  Iran tit for tat spirals out of control  Iran s response will be severe and deadly  And certainly may include escalating attacks on energy infrastructure  
Brent crude for March settlement climbed as much as  2 91  or 4 4   to  69 16 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  and traded at  68 62 as of 9 59 a m  London time  The global benchmark s bullish options bias was the biggest since early November while the closely watched spread between the December 2020 and December 2021 contracts was at the strongest level since October 2018 
West Texas Intermediate for February delivery was 3 6  higher at  63 36 a barrel  after advancing as much as 4 4  to the highest level since May  Total aggregate volume for Brent and WTI was about 10 times the 30 day average 
Tensions have been building between Washington and Tehran after an Iran backed Iraqi militia stormed the American embassy in Baghdad to protest deadly U S  airstrikes earlier this week  Concerns in the region have persisted over the past year as Saudi Arabia s energy facilities as well as foreign tankers in and around the Persian Gulf have been the target of several attacks  The area has five of OPEC s biggest oil producers 
The U S  and Iran are already facing off over Trump s crippling economic campaign against Tehran and suspected Iranian reprisals  Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Thursday that America was ready to deploy more force in Iraq after the attack on its embassy 
The attack on Soleimani rattled other markets  U S  equity futures and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid  while most shares in Asia reversed or erased gains  Gold hit the highest in four months as investors sought safe haven assets 
The strike also escalates an already tense three way situation between the U S  and major oil producers Iran and Iraq  The two Middle East countries combined pumped more than 6 7 million barrels a day of oil last month  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  more than one fifth of OPEC output 
Energy exports from both countries also rely on the Strait of Hormuz  the narrow and crucial oil and natural gas shipping choke point that s always in focus when Middle East tensions flair  particularly with Iran 
 This is more than just bloodying Iran s nose   Stephen Innes  chief market strategist at AxiTrader Ltd  said in a note   This is an aggressive show of force and an outright provocation that could trigger another Middle East war  
Oversupply Concerns
Still  the rally could just as easily subside  While prices initially soared after the attack on Saudi Arabia s Abqaiq processing facility in September  crude then retreated in another sign that the market s psychology has shifted from fearing supply shortages to a concern with a surplus  largely because of the U S  shale revolution 
Furthermore  OPEC is sitting on vast amounts of spare oil production capacity after reducing supplies for most of the past three years  Consuming countries from the U S  to China control millions of barrels stored in strategic petroleum reserves that can be deployed to offset any shortage 
In the biggest sign of the oil market s transformation  the U S  reported its first months as a net exporter of petroleum  including crude and refined oil products  late last year for the first time in roughly 75 years  In October  America exported a net 389 000 barrels a day  compared with net imports of close to 9 million barrels a day a decade or so earlier ",2020-01-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-soars-as-us-killing-of-iran-general-stirs-fear-of-conflict-2051730,2051730
145591,367106,ICE,Oil Jumps Near  70 as U S  Says Iran May Strike Saudi Again,news," Bloomberg     Oil s wild ride continued as the U S  warned Iran may attack Saudi Arabia again following the American assassination of one of the Islamic Republic s most powerful generals 
Crude futures jumped for a second day  rising to just shy of  70 a barrel in London  as the U S  State Department said there s  heightened risk  of missile attacks near military bases and energy facilities in Saudi Arabia  raising the prospect of disruptions in the world s most important oil producing region 
The warning followed a weekend of bellicose rhetoric  President Donald Trump said he was prepared to strike  in a disproportionate manner  and attack more than 50 Iranian sites if Tehran retaliates against the killing of Qassem Soleimani  while the Middle East nation said it has to  settle a score with the U S  
The killing reverberated through Middle Eastern markets  sending stocks nosediving and setting the tone for what s likely to be a volatile week   Saudi Aramco   SE 2222  tumbled 1 7  on Sunday to the lowest since it started trading last month  On Friday  crude surged  American workers began to withdraw from Iraqi fields and traders scrambled to position themselves for higher prices as concerns rose over direct conflict between the U S  and Iran 
 We should all be bracing for a ferocious response   Helima Croft  chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets said last week   The stage is set for a retaliatory spiral that could keep markets on edge well into 2020  
Oil continued to advance in early Asian trading Monday after surging more than 4  in the immediate aftermath of the attacks  London s Brent jumped almost 2   or  1 35  to  69 95 on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe and was at  69 61 at 7 07 a m  in Singapore  West Texas Intermediate rose 1 4  to  63 92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
Rising tensions between the U S and Iran have already caused unprecedented disruptions to oil markets  but so far they ve been short lived  Last year  Washington blamed Tehran for sabotage attacks on supertankers and a missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia s Abqaiq crude processing plant in September    the largest single supply halt in the industry s history 
Tough Talk
Trump s tough talk on Saturday followed Iran s threat of a protracted response  and eclipsed his assertion a day earlier that the U S  hadn t launched the attack near Baghdad airport on Thursday to  start a war   The president is also sending more troops to the Middle East 
The Iranian leadership has signaled that it will probably target U S  military installations and bases in the Middle East and mobilize its network of militias across the region 
QuickTake  How Qassem Soleimani Helped Shape the Modern Mideast
Iraq is the second largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  pumping 4 65 million barrels a day last month  Its immediate neighbors in the region    Saudi Arabia  Kuwait and Iran    together produce about 15 million barrels a day  Most of their exports leave the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz  a narrow waterway that Iran has repeatedly threatened to shut down if there s a war 
Beyond crude s rise  there were other signals in the market that people were preparing for further disruption 
Volatility rose to its highest level in a month and the cost of derivatives that insure against price spikes increased  Four million barrels of options contracts that would profit from a jump in Brent crude to  95 a barrel traded for both March and September  The cost of insuring tankers could rise again  after it surged in the wake of the Abqaiq attack in September

145596,367111,ICE,Palantir Continues To Thrive Despite Protests,opinion,"Palantir Technologies   PALANTIR  is a Silicon Valley unicorn at least 20 times over  With a current valuation of more than  20 billion  this Peter Thiel and Alex Karp founded company employs more than 2 500 people and  despite having never reported a profit  is eyeing an IPO in the next few years 
But you probably know all of that  You also probably know that Palantir has become a widely covered and controversial company  as its software is being used by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ICE to detain  track  and deport people over immigration violations 
At a recent Duke University tech recruiting and networking event called TechConnect  students protested the company s presence  posting  PALANTIR DEPORTS FAMILIES  over a school street entry sign  A student run hack a thon called HackDuke cut itself free of a lucrative Palantir sponsorship  saying  We do not believe they align with our goals and values  especially as we are a hackathon focused on social good   The group also called for Duke University to cut its ties with the software company 
Student organizations at Harvard  Berkeley  Brown  and Yale all followed up by canceling its own relationships with Palantir  
So has all of these revelations and backs turned on Palantir hurt the company 





So far  data shows that Palantir is trudging along just fine  growing the workforce all while maintaining a healthy hiring environment 
There are more than 2 500 Palantir employees on LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  as of this week  At this time last year  that number was 2 200  and a year before that  around 2 100  in a clear sign that the company s growth is accelerating 











Part of the reason for that growth is that the company is increasingly adding new jobs to its hiring websites  As of this week  the company is hiring for the most ever positions since at least 2016  Its current 221 openings are up 23  from the 179 positions it was hiring in October 2018  
If anything  the attention given Palantir over the past couple of months has put it in the limelight  The company s Twitter following saw a surge in the past couple months  growing from 25 300 followers in August to 26 400 followers as of this week 
As for whether or not that limelight is positive or negative  time will tell  and we ll keep an eye on it

145599,367114,ICE,IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 31 billion  up 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 62  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ICE 
For ICE  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ICE will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ICE would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ICE doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intercontinentalexchange-ice-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200477681,200477681

145608,367123,ICE,Oil Drops From 2 1 2 Month High Amid Clouded OPEC  Intentions,news," Bloomberg     Oil ceded some gains amid uncertainty about whether OPEC and other major crude producers intend to impose any new significant supply curbs 
Futures dropped below  59 a barrel New York on Thursday as headlines from the cartel s gathering in Vienna offered conflicting signals about the progress and content of closed door discussions  The latest indications were that the group agreed to adjust official production targets but it remains to be seen if that will result in real reductions despite prospects for a global oversupply 
 It s OPEC day and there is a sense of cautious optimism in the air   PVM Oil Associates analyst Stephen Brennock wrote in a report   There is a consensus among market players that the oil cartel will deepen supply curbs in order to avert a supply imbalance in the new year  
A key committee convened by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia recommended cutting overall output quotas by 500 000 barrels a day during the first quarter  according to Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak said  However  the committee didn t discuss how the reduction would be distributed among member nations  he said

Oil is set for a weekly gain as shrinking American crude stockpiles and signs of progress on a possible U S  China trade deal added to the bullish tone  Russia  which has only complied with its OPEC  production quota for just three months of this year  had its proposal to exclude a very light oil called condensate from the country s quota  approved by OPEC  on Thursday  An adjustment to Iraq s production was also reported to be a sticking point in the group approving a final deal 
 If it s off the October 2018 baseline  a 500 000 barrel a day shared out cut is not too impressive  that s all we learned   Bob McNally  founder of Rapidan Energy Advisors LLC said in a Bloomberg TV interview   That s a nothing burger  that s almost a rollover by any other definition

145616,367131,ICE,Asia Morning Note  A Confusing State Of Affairs,opinion,"Markets 
Investors anxiety about the state of the global economy and apprehensions over U S  China trade talks pushed stocks lower Monday as political bustle swamped Washington 
Ahead of crucial trade talks the US blacklisted 8 Chinese technology firms while implicating them for human rights violations in China s Xinjiang province  The Trump administration is walking the talk after raising human rights issues in Muslim heavy Xinjiang at the United Nations last month and is escalating its economic war with China on yet another front 
This new shift in US strategy against China is now raising suspicions amid growing pressure stateside  that the administration may throw its support behind the pro democracy protest in Hong Kong  All of which suggests a whole lot more than tariffs will be on the dinner menu when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visits Washington for trade talks with his US counterparts 
Market participants are getting very jittery about all those US China headlines  even the latest claiming China want to a partial deal while providing a timetable to work out harder issues are being met by investors with a high degree if circumspect 
A large percentage of the market thinks China may roll the dice and take advantage of what they think is President Trump weakened political state trying to push negotiation closer to the election data  In this context  President Trump may decide to hardball the upcoming talks suggesting there could be a high level of disappointment even relative to the market muted expectations 
The market continues to look unsettled  but the muted equity markets suggest investors are expecting to see very little progress from the trade talks this week  Still  if the October 15 and December 15 tariffs were to be put on hold indefinitely  it could be a significant catalyst for risk to sustain a bid at this point 
Oil market
Trade war headwinds and a dreary global macro outlook saw oil prices quickly erode early New York session gains after OPEC reported its most significant month on month output fall in 17 years   However  the report was speedily digested as a result of the attacks on Saudi Arabia s Abqaiq processing facility  and then the dominate economic doom and gloom saga took over for the remainder of the day 
The narrative is still very much focused on the macro with the fear of economic slowdown weighing on oil demand dominating sentiment  which is now at the weakest level since February this year according to data from the US CFTE and ICE  NYSE ICE  future Europe  Both exchanges reported a 17  drop in combined net bullish positions in WTI and Brent 
Against that overtly bearish backdrop  and while it s virtually impossible to predict with any confidence how these trade talks will unfold  oil prices could be in for a sustained rally if the October 15 and December 15 tariffs were to be put on hold indefinitely which could see some of the braver at heart to  support  dips  thinking the risk reward skew is higher as much of the latest macro is baked into the price 
Gold markets
Gold prices fell when  US treasury yields rose  and the US dollar subsequently strengthened as traders wait for the resumption of US China trade talks  The market is going into the US China trade talks with little expectations  so even the so called  skinny deal  will be viewed in an extremely risk positive light  And if the next round of tariffs is put on hold indefinitely  we should expect a sustained rally on risk assets suggesting gold may lose some lustre 
The weaker global macro and the October Fed rate cut is thought to be very much in the current price  and with the October Fed cuts suggest the risk reward may still skew to the upside  What may not be fully factored into the equation given how difficult it is to predict with any confidence  is a trade war detent which could send Gold prices tumbling as investors dive back into equities and global growth assets if such an outcome were to arise 
We continue to expect Gold traders to critique their positions against US bond yields while looking for clues from this week s Fed speak and  some waver in the hawkish FOMC divide 
However  despite the dreary ISM data  it doesn t appear that the more hawkish members of the FOMC are shifting their position  Kansas City President George said the recent moderation of growth was in line with her outlook but suggested she would be flexible is the data came out worse than she expected  She said she would continue to focus on the consumer while she pinned the recent strength of the dollar on the move by foreign investors to own US assets 
Boston Fed President Rosengren said the labour market remained tight and he was confident the consumer would continue to drive growth  In his view  if the economy grows at 1 7   consumption remains strong  and inflation is gradually going up coupled with a low unemployment rate  so there is no need for further policy accommodation 
Currency markets
The dollar weakness is on hold as has been the case this year the 1 10975 1 1000 marked strong resistance on the EUR USD  It s as if we get to that level and trader then ask themselves given how dismal the EU economy is  if we don t buy US assets what will we buy 
But there s a lot of watching and waiting as traders reduce some of their risk aversion bets ahead of the trade talks with the USD JPY trading above 107 25
EM Asia
Asia currency in the absence of a significant catalyst will continue to track the yuan which remains the best global barometer for trade war risk although as with every other asset in the world trying to predict a skew coming out of this weeks trade meeting is virtually impossible at this stage  Expect headline risk to continue influencing trading flows in the Yuan ",2019-10-08,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asia-morning-note-a-confusing-state-of-affairs-200471360,200471360
145620,367135,ICE,U S  interior immigration arrests fell despite Trump push,news,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Non border immigration arrests in the United States fell by 10 percent in the year to September from a year earlier  the latest U S  data shows  a drop the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   said was partly due to the diversion of the agency s resources to the border 
The figures were included in an annual ICE enforcement report reviewed by Reuters and set to be released on Wednesday 
In an interview with Reuters on Monday  acting ICE Director Matthew Albence said efforts to arrest immigrants inside the United States were hampered by a surge of mostly Central American families and children arriving at the U S  Mexico border earlier this year  which diverted the agency s resources 
Albence said 350 of the agency s more than 20 000 employees were reassigned to deal with the border crisis at various times during the last year  Additionally  he said the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants meant an increased workload in detention centers and in the field 
 Simply put  there are only so many resources to go around   Albence said   We ve had some places where  for months at a time  fugitive operations teams were shut down  
Albence also attributed the lower arrest totals to a lack of cooperation from so called  sanctuary  jurisdictions that don t honor the agency s requests to hold immigrants booked into local jails 
 It s compounded by jurisdictions not cooperating with us   he said 
U S  President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a central focus of his presidency and reelection campaign  He tweeted in June that immigration authorities would begin to deport  millions of illegal aliens  without legal status 
U S  immigration officers arrested approximately 143 000 immigrants in fiscal 2019  which ended Sept  30  down from nearly 159 000 arrests a year earlier  according to the report 
For a graphic on Trump immigration enforcement lags behind Obama  click 
Under former President Barack Obama  ICE focused its arrest efforts on immigrants with criminal convictions  In fiscal year 2016   the last full year under Obama   86 percent of those arrested by ICE had criminal convictions  Approximately 110 000 immigrants were arrested by ICE that year 
However  Trump issued an executive order shortly after taking office that moved away from the Obama era prioritization of criminal cases 
Of the total ICE arrests last year  only 64 percent of those picked up had been convicted of crimes  Driving under the influence  traffic offenses  drug crimes and immigration violations made up more than half of all convictions 
Albence addressed the possibility that his agency soon may need to grapple with enforcement against immigrants brought to the country as children and offered deportation relief and work permits through the Obama era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  The Supreme Court is expected to rule next year over Trump s attempt to phase out the program 
Albence said DACA enrollees ordered removed by an immigration judge  certainly  would be subject to deportation

145626,367141,ICE,Palladium Is An Unsung Green Superhero,opinion,"Smog from vehicle emissions is estimated to cause a third of the air pollution in the United States  The fact that cars and trucks have tailpipes at street level makes the exhaust fumes even more harmful than industrial smokestacks  because people breathe them directly into their lungs 
Despite greater environmental awareness and transit use  vehicles continue to emit a toxic cloud of four air pollutants  caused by the burning of gasoline in the internal combustion engine  They are  
Carbon monoxide  expelled when the carbon in fuel doesn t burn completely  Breathing CO is particularly harmful because it impairs the ability to move oxygen through the body  Hydrocarbons  a compound of hydrogen and carbon  Nitrous oxides  a product of burnt fuel  created when nitrogen reacts with oxygen  Particulate matter  which consists of tiny soot particles that contribute to hazy skies and  when inhaled on a regular basis  can cause lung damage  Other health problems known to result from air pollution include asthma  heart disease  birth defects and eye irritation 
A  found over 30 000 Americans had died from diseases connected to air pollution in 2015  the latest year data was available  
According to Environmental Defense Fund  the transportation sector is responsible for 27  of the country s greenhouse gas emissions  Passenger vehicles produce four times more greenhouse gases than all of domestic aviation  
In 2018 there were 276 million vehicles registered in the US  40  of which were cars  In 1990 just under 200 million were registered  The sheer number of people that continue to drive and buy cars has offset pollution control measures adopted by the auto industry  along with the growing popularity of hybrid electric vehicles  electric vehicles and renewable fuels   ethanol and biodiesel  




Despite dips during recessions  light vehicle sales per year in the United States have grown from about 15 million in 1978 to 17 2 million in 2018 




The US used to be the world s biggest contributor of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  but in 2008 China took the ignoble top spot  
Cars being a status symbol  the Middle Kingdom has about 300 million vehicles registered  The Chinese government has taken steps to clamp down on air pollution and diversify into cleaner sectors  The country is a market leader in solar power  electric vehicles and the provision of new nuclear power  Gradually  coal powered fired power plants are being phased out  While China and India still rely on the cheap fossil fuel  less coal plants are being planned  China permitted just 5 gigawatts  GW  of coal power in 2018 versus 184GW in 2015  India allowed under 3GW of coal in 2018 compared to 39GW in 2010  and has added more solar and wind power capacity than coal over the last two years    
Yet air pollution in China and India is horrific  A 2018  reported toxic air hacks around US 38 billion off the Chinese economy each year  due to early deaths and lost food production  Smog inducing ozone and fine particles are destroying about 20 million tonnes of rice  wheat  maize and soybeans  
Secret weapon 
That sounds grim  but there is a    catalytic converters  which in 1975 became mandatory for automakers to put into all new cars and trucks  Also known as autocatalysts  these devices reduce noxious emissions  and have been an important reason for internal combustion engines  ICE  NYSE ICE   polluting up to 90  less than they did in the 1970s  along with the tightening of nation wide tailpipe emission regulations  led by California  
Enter palladium
Catalytic converters are supplied for both diesel fueled ICEs and gasoline engines  Both contain a mix of PGEs and other metals including platinum and palladium  A higher percentage of platinum is used in diesel autocatalysts  whereas gasoline powered autocatalysts employ more palladium 
Palladium  Pd  is one of six platinum group elements  PGE  found in the Periodic Table of the Elements  The others are iridium  Ir   osmium  Os   platinum  Pt   rhodium  Rh  and ruthenium  Ru    
According to the International Platinum Group Metals Association  IPA   one quarter of all manufactured goods either contain a PGE  or a PGE played a key role in its production  That makes PGEs indispensable for industrial applications 
Autocatalyst demand accounts for three quarters of the need for palladium  In 2018  out of a total market of 10 1 million ounces  catalytic converters used 8 6Moz  the balance going towards other industrial applications and jewelry 
Diesel phase out 
It used to be that diesel vehicles were sought after because diesel is cheaper than gasoline  Many considered diesels no worse than gas engines for air pollution  In 2016 the diesel car industry was shaken after Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  admitted it had cheated on its emission tests  The  diesel gate  scandal was made worse amid new reports of the dangers of air pollution  
A 2017 study in the journal  Nature  found that emissions from diesel vehicles which exceeded certification limits were associated with 38 000 premature deaths  The following year  a German court ruled that smog belching vehicles were to be banned from the centers of Stuttgart and Dusseldorf  
Concerns over air pollution led the EU to set a target of cutting emissions by at least 40  by 2030  from 1990 levels    the mayors of 10 European capitals are urging a switch to zero emissions vehicles within the next 20 years   something the British Columbia government has pledged to happen by 2040 according to a new climate plan  
As of last month  all passenger vehicles sold in Europe must meet  Euro 6d TEMP  standards  showing they comply with NOx and particulate matter emissions  China will implement its next round of carbon emission rules between 2020 and 2023  involving higher palladium and rhodium loadings  according to  Johnson Matthey   LON JMAT   a UK based chemicals company  
Platinum s loss is palladium s gain
Diesel engines are therefore being phased out in favor of gas powered cars that meet stricter emission regs  Testing is reportedly underway in parts of China and the European Union and will be mandatory in those two regions by 2020  
The move away from diesel has hurt not only diesel car manufacturers but platinum  Less demand for diesel autocatalysts has weighed on platinum prices  which tumbled from about  1 400 an ounce in January 2014  to the current  876 oz  The metal s market value since 2011 has halved  
In contrast  palladium has more than doubled over the last three years   124   and ran up 18  in 2018  Spot palladium raced past US 1 700 an ounce in September  and traded at  1 663 oz on October 7  far outpacing spot gold  which finished Monday at  1 492 oz  




Despite a global downturn in auto sales in 2018  and the first eight months of this year  palladium prices have stayed buoyant  
Among the factors in its favor are a 3 6  forecasted rise in autocatalyst demand  driven by tighter emissions standards  and increased market share for gasoline vehicles in Europe 
In the near future  palladium is also likely to see a major surge in demand due to a widespread recall by Fiat Chrysler  FCA   In March FCA issued a voluntary recall of nearly 900 000 gasoline fueled vehicles  due to defective catalytic converters  The recall is expected to create a need for another 77 000 ounces of palladium  thereby putting upward pressure on prices  
Supply squeeze 




Moreover  currently and for the foreseeable future  palladium is facing constricted supply  The palladium market has been in deficit for years 
An analyst  said the deficit in 2019 is expected to widen to 1 8Moz  and 1 9Moz in 2020  
The reason has mostly to do with structural problems in South Africa  
About 90  of palladium is mined as a by product of nickel and copper mining in Russia and platinum mining in South Africa  These two countries dominate the Pd market  with Russia producing 2 84 million ounces in 2018  and South Africa mining 2 59Moz  
South Africa s platinum mining companies are under constant pressure to contain costs  because their mines are some of the deepest  hottest and most labor intensive in the world  They also face frequent strikes  In 2014 workers at the country s three major producers   Lonmin  now Sibanye    Anglo American   LON AAL  Platinum and Implats   downed tools for five months demanding that wages be doubled  
In fact  earlier this week Implats took a big step to diversify it s risk away from those South African mines by allocating capital to North America and acquiring Canada s North American Palladium Inc   NAP  for  753 million  NAP is one of two primary palladium producers globally   The other was bought by another South African company 2 years ago  Sibanye  Sibanye bought Stillwater Mining and its palladium mine in the USA 
There are significant infrastructure constraints that the South African s are dealing with  South Africa has limited processing capacity and water is a constant concern
No substitutes 
Some have suggested that platinum could be substituted for palladium if palladium prices continue to trade significantly higher than platinum prices  The problem however is supply  Both metals are looking at long term structural supply deficits even though investment interest in platinum has piqued recently due to the negative interest rate environment globally  in the first half of 2019  an unprecedented 855 000 ounces of investment demand was driven by 720 000 ounces of Pt that flowed into ETFs   
 that palladium heavy catalytic converters perform better than platinum under extreme conditions emission tests  and that switching to a platinum based autocatalyst would be too expensive  
Hybrid demand
The palladium supply deficit is due to supply problems set against robust demand not only for palladium in gas powered vehicles  but hybrids  which despite being cleaner than straight gas models  also require heightening emissions controls  
A small but growing number of consumers are choosing hybrids  which are seen as bridging the gap between ICEs and all electrics  A 2018 report by  JP Morgan Chase   NYSE JPM    Co  predicts hybrids are expected to grow from 3  of global marketshare to 23  by 2025 
It s also important to note research showing that hybrid electric vehicles require more palladium and lithium than traditional gas powered cars and trucks  
Consolidation 
Palladium s run seems unstoppable  which is putting a renewed focus on mergers and acquisitions in the sector  
In July 2018 Silver Wheaton  a heavy hitter in the precious metals streaming business   in Montana  CEO Randy Smallwood is bullish on Pd due to the expected rise in autocatalyst demand  
Brokerages are also paying attention to the star platinum group metal and companies that mine it  RBC Dominion Securities has reportedly initiated coverage of North American Palladium  which was  for   CAD 753 billion  The boards of both companies approved the deal  but it still needs regulatory approval  
In a note  analyst Mark Mihaljevic based an  outperform  rating and  26 sh price on the company s  positive financial outlook  demonstrated capital returns through regular and special dividends  and unique exposure to palladium   adding he expects the palladium deficit to continue into 2021  
The Toronto based company s Lac des Iles mine northwest of Thunder Bay  Ontario has been in production for over 30 years  It is one of two the only primary palladium mines in the world  the other being Stillwater 
This past August  North American Palladium   about 95 kilometers from Lac des Iles  The acquisition was the result of exceeding the mandated two year expenditure requirement  and completing the requisite cash payments  to option partners Implats and Transition Metals Corp  
Meanwhile Platinum Group Metals  a junior working in South Africa  has put forward a   The DFS outlines a 45 year decline accessible polymetallic mine  producing an annual 420 000 ounces of palladium  platinum  gold and rhodium  along with copper and nickel by products

Palladium One  TSX V PDM  FRA 7N11  OTC NKORF 
The key point here  is with M A shrinking the already small palladium sector   remember 90  of palladium is produced as a by product  and pure palladium deposits are very rare   there are limited investment opportunities for getting into a PGE play with a heavy exposure to palladium  
Palladium One s Lantinen Koillismaa  LK  Project in Finland has the rocks that few copper nickel platinum group elements  Cu Ni PGE  deposits can boast  
About 2 4 billion years ago  a continental rifting event created the Koillismaa Complex which hosts the LK Project and several other mafic ultramafic intrusions containing palladium rich Cu Ni PGE sulfide minerals  chromium and iron titanium vanadium  
Continental rifting has produced some of the largest Cu Ni PGE  copper  nickel  platinum group elements  deposits in the world including the Duluth Complex in Minnesota  Norilsk in Russia  and China s Jinchuan deposit 
Several of these mafic ultramafic intrusions occur in Scandinavia  in an area known as the Fennoscandia shield  This is  elephant deposit country  
The Fennoscandia shield includes a number of large Cu Ni PGE deposits including Pechanga on Russia s Kola peninsula  Kevitsa  Sakatti  and the Portimo Complex located 90 km northwest of LK 
This summer PDM came out with a maiden resource estimate at Kaukua  the most explored  1 km strike length  mineralized zone on the 25 km basal intrusive contact  2 500 hectare  property 
The first  maiden  NI 43 101 compliant resource on Kaukua places Palladium One in the starting blocks of what should prove to be a very interesting run at developing an open pit Cu Ni PGE mine in a premier mining jurisdiction  Finland 
The main difference between the new and  historic   2013 resource is that PDM has defined the resource using reasonable constraint assumptions for economic extraction inside used an conceptual open pit mine plan  with a cutoff grade of 0 3 grams per tonne palladium  versus the earlier unconstrained 0 1 g t cutoff grade resource  This  pit constrained  resource is estimated at 
11 million indicated tonnes grading 1 8 grams of palladium equivalent per tonne  0 81 grams palladium  0 27 platinum  0 09 gold  0 09  nickel and 0 15  copper  for 635 000 oz Pd Eq  11 million tonnes of inferred grading 1 5 grams per tonne Pd Eq  0 64 palladium  0 20 platinum  0 08 gold  0 08  nickel and 0 13  copper  for 525 800 oz Pd Eq  This leaves Palladium One with a total indicated  inferred resource of 1 16 million ounces palladium equivalent  at its LK Project  
About 97  of the earlier indicated resource has been incorporated into the new pit constrained resource estimate  and 85  of the inferred  Importantly  tThe total pit constrained resource is currently split evenly between indicated and inferred categories 
Future drilling at Kaukua will target higher grade PGE zones plus nickel and copper  and upgradeing inferred resources to indicated  
Half a kilometer south of the resource estimate  the Kaukua South zone has outlined a target from only 6 drill holes of between 0 23 and 3 million tonnes grading between 0 7 and one gram palladium equivalent 
There are nine exploration permit renewal applications at LK feature three mineralized zones  Kaukua  Murtolampi and Haukiaho  plus 2 reservation applications for an additional 13 km of basal contact   Historical exploration goes back to the 1960s and was undertaken primarily by Outokumpu  who were exploring for shallow nickel and copper mineralization 
GTK  the Geological Survey of Finland  and Outokumpu punched in a series of widely spaced  shallow  typically   40 meters depth  drill holes that demonstrated anomalous Cu Ni PGE mineralization all along the entire 25 km of basal contact  Therein lies the exploration opportunity  the upside 
Only about four kilometers of the 25 km basal contact has been systematically drill tested  whereas the entire 25 km contact has received widely spaced reconnaissance drilling that demonstrates mineralization   What s needed is shallow high resolution IP geophysics to vector into the higher sulphide zones  which host higher grades  and start drilling to add tonnes 
At Haukiaho  where historic exploration did not use IP   the 2013 historic resource estimate identified 23 2 million inferred tonnes grading 0 21  copper  0 14  nickel  0 13 g t platinum  0 31 g t palladium and 0 10 g t gold  Au   0 53 g t PGE   using a 0 1 g t Pd cutoff  Current management do not believe adequate work was undertaken at Haukiaho and therefore they did not attempt to prepare a resource estimate for Haukiaho but rather believe IP and more drilling is required prior to preparing a new resource estimate   
The largely unexplored area has about a 10 km strike length  While historical drilling by GTK found multiple anomalous holes mineralized intersections along the entire strike  the higher grade shoots  pods were not targeted and no modern induced polarization  IP  survey has been done  
At Murtolampi  a recent surface sample returned 3 106 g t PGE  0 78  copper and 0 13  nickel  opening up the possibility of significantly higher grade the Kaukua mineralization extending north of Kaukua  or even east along strike where no drilling has been conducted  As mentioned the LK Project is in good company  located within Finland s Fennoscandia shield containing a number of large Cu Ni PGE deposits  But it s also fascinating to compare how PDM ranks among its peers  concerning other open pit palladium deposits  




The map below shows the extent of historic reconnaissance drilling proven mineralization along about the 38  25 13  kilometers of basal contact  drilled through shallow  widely spaced holes  Thus we know the area is mineralized  we just need to conduct IP and poke more drill holes at narrower intervals to better ascertain define where the higher grade stuff is  that would merit an open pit  or more likely  a series of open pits governed by pit constrained resources 
We already have a robust resource at Kaukua  with a decent very respectable 3 1 strip waste ore ratio that in future  would afford a low cost  open pit mine  




Now take a look at the table below  Palladium One has shored up 638 000 ounces of indicated Pd Eq ounces  and 519 000 inferred  at its Kaukua target  for a total of 1 16Moz  The important metric here is the first numbered column  palladium equivalent tonnes  PDM has the lowest tonnage among its peers in the table   10 985t measured and indicated   but remember  the company has had to do very little drilling at Kaukua  just 30 000 meters to get to a 1 16 Moz I I resource and there s 25km of mineralized trend to find more 
Consider that the Kaukua zone encompasses a very small part  red circle  of the 25 km of basal contact which we know  from historic drilling  is mineralized  ie  anomalous Cu Ni PGE mineralization along the entire 25 km of basal contact   




If over a million I I ounces were generated from just the one target  Kaukua  its fun to entertain  imagine how many prospective ounces might be sitting there  among the other identified zones at LK  waiting to be outlined and incorporated into new resources  
 This now is a drilling exercise to drill it out and build it up   CEO Derrick Weyrauch told us at Ahead of the Herd  upon release of the maiden resource at Kaukua  
We agree wholeheartedly 
Conclusion 
At AOTH we don t think it s a stretch to foresee a lot more PdEq rolled into a total resource at LK  perhaps incorporating three or four zones in open pits  We re not going to get ahead of ourselves  though  It s still early days  Geochemical and geophysical studies need to be done on these properties  to pinpoint the mineralization accurately  before they are drilled off  
Success at the drill bit is bound to interest a major  perhaps operating within the Fennoscandia shield  leading to a property purchase or company takeover  Big copper nickel PGE deposits are not common  and this looks to be one of them  
PDM investors can look forward to upcoming geochemical  geophysical studies and a 6 000 to 7 000m drill program  The company plans to drill three major zones not included in the historical resource estimate  Kaukua South  Murtolampi and Haukiaho s West Torkoaho Zone  
We are confident PDM can execute its exploration plans  The company has a lot going for it  including a robust maiden resource estimate  production of a saleable concentrate  and most importantly in our eyes  massive potential for expanding the resource through further exploration  A previously announced share consolidation cut the number of outstanding shares in half  and an oversubscribed private placement raised  1 352 million 




Palladium One has an excellent management team and board including CEO Weyrauch  VP Exploration Neil Pettigrew  Lawrence Roulston  former publisher of the acclaimed  Resource Opportunities  newsletter  and Dr  Peter Lightfoot  who literally wrote the book on nickel copper precious metal ore deposits  
We know that all metals at LK   palladium  platinum  gold  copper and nickel   are in demand for the foreseeable future  nickel for its use in batteries and stainless steel  copper for its myriad industrial applications  and palladium as a key ingredient of catalytic converters found in gas powered  hybrid vehicles and gold for investment and capital preservation purposes 
Finally  we see that PDM s 2 4 million market cap is grossly undervalued  considering the resource it has just delineated and the huge exploration upside to the project  Based solely of the Kauka resource and excluding any premium for exploration upside or the team  PDM estimates it currently trades at an average 60  discount to its peers  some of which have huge market caps therefore limited potential for stock appreciation  PDM is  in my opinion  the best palladium junior right now for investors wanting to get exposure to the red hot palladium sector

Trump told reporters at the White house that the U S  and China were  in the final throes of a very important deal   though he told Fox News later that he was holding up the agreement to ensure better terms for America  While some sort of pact would be positive  it may not do much to revive crude demand unless existing tariffs are rolled back

Bakkt Bitcoin Futures
Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  launched its bitcoin futures contracts late on Sunday  Commodities giant ICE operates multiple regulated exchanges including US ICE futures exchanges  the New York Stock Exchange and the Liffe futures exchanges in Europe  Bakkt  the Atlanta based firm behind the ICE bitcoin futures contract  aims to provide institutional and retail investors a secure  federally regulated place to trade the world s leading cryptocurrency 
ICE  NYSE ICE  bitcoin futures pay in bitcoin upon settlement  contrasting to CME Group bitcoin futures which payout in cash  Bitcoin bulls  hoping that the launch would add further legitimacy the digital asset  were disappointed by relatively low trading volumes  On Monday bitcoin fell below the key psychological level of  10 000 
Bitcoin Hash Rate Falls
Adding to the bearish scenario  Coin dance data showed that bitcoin hash rates by network rate fell sharply on Monday  The hash rate of cryptocurrency measures of the number of calculations that a network can perform each second 
A higher hash rate reflects miners piling in to validate new blocks and has been viewed as a bullish indicator  while conversely a lower hash rate could be seen as a bearish signal 
Bitcoin Halving
The next bitcoin  halving  is expected to take place in May of 2020  The halving describes a decrease in the number of new bitcoins awarded to miners for adding blocks to the blockchain  The supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million  Bitcoin bulls look to the event with anticipation since previous halvings boosted the price of bitcoin substantially in the months that followed 
Technical Outlook

145648,367163,ICE,Guide To 10 Most Heavily Traded ETFs,opinion,The ETF industry is seeing explosive growth in terms of both AUM and launches thanks to the rise in  thematic investing  and craze for  smart beta   The rapid growth can be traced back to unique strategies  creativity  transparency  diversification benefits  enhanced tax competences  low turnover and most importantly   low cost In particular  investors seek to trade in ETFs that can easily be purchased and sold on the market  suggesting that the funds should have enough liquidity  Volume  or the number of shares traded in a particular period  is definitely the most important consideration for determining the liquidity of a particular fund  A higher number of shares provides easy access to move in and out of the product  keeping the bid ask spreads tight Further  greater volume ensures easy creation and redemption of shares in the fund basket  which is a regular and vital mechanism in ETFs  This is especially true as authorized participants  AP  have the ability to create new baskets of ETF shares for underlying securities or redeem them when required  This phenomenon allows ETFs to trade in line with their net asset value  NAV   see    Nevertheless  assessing just the number of shares is not a profitable task  as a higher number of cheaper funds can be bought for a given amount of money  leading to increased volumes  As a result  honing in on dollar volume ETFs will reveal the true picture of liquidity  Dollar volume measures the number of shares traded multiplied by share price   That said  we

145652,367167,ICE,Derivatives industry asks regulators to clarify Libor phase out terms,news,"By Huw Jones
LONDON  Reuters    A global derivatives industry body said on Wednesday it would try again to find consensus on helping regulators ditch the tarnished Libor benchmark   but only after regulators spell out exactly what they have in mind 
Investment banks have been fined billions of dollars for trying to rig Libor  or the London Interbank Offered Rate  an interest rate benchmark used to price contracts worth about  300 trillion from home loans to credit cards 
Regulators like the Financial Conduct Authority in Britain want markets to stop using Libor by the end of 2021 and switch to  safer  or less easily rigged alternatives  like the Bank of England s Sonia rate  or Sofr compiled by the Federal Reserve 
Ditching Libor is one of the biggest changes ever undertaken by markets 
The Financial Stability Board  FSB  of regulators and central bankers from the world s main financial centers  wants the derivatives industry to insert a mandatory  fallback  clause into swaps contracts that still reference Libor 
This would mean a mandatory switch from Libor if Britain s Financial Conduct Authority ruled that it was no longer  representative  even though it was still being published  or if Libor permanently ceased to exist on or after the end of 2021 
The derivatives industry  however  lacks consensus on how to deal with Libor becoming unrepresentative 
Last month the FSB called on ISDA  a global derivatives industry body  to try again to find agreement on such a  fallback  to include in contracts and combine it with a fallback for a Libor ending permanently 
ISDA told the FSB in a letter on Wednesday that it would consult its members again  once the market has the benefit of appropriate clarity  from regulators and clearing houses on two points 
The letter to FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey and Federal Reserve of New York President John Williams  NYSE WMB  said industry wants the FCA and ICE  NYSE ICE  Benchmark  which compiles Libor  to confirm that an unrepresentative Libor would only be published for a minimal period  meaning a number of months and not years 
ISDA also wants  definitive confirmation  from clearing houses that if Libor becomes unrepresentative  they will change their entire portfolio of cleared derivatives to reference a safer rate 
ISDA made clear  however  it would still need a  strong majority  of market participants given that changing contractual terms is voluntary and needs the consent of both parties in the first place 
In the meantime  ISDA said it would press on with completing by the end of this year its fallback for dealing with a permanent cessation of Libor  with implementation in the first half of 2020 ",2019-12-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/derivatives-industry-asks-regulators-to-clarify-libor-phaseout-terms-2033295,2033295

145664,367179,ICE,Singapore proposes to regulate bitcoin futures,news,"HONG KONG  Reuters    Singapore s central bank plans to bring bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrency futures traded on approved exchanges under its regulation in response to interest from international institutional investors  it said on Wednesday 
Market watchdogs worldwide have been debating whether and how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry  Many have focused their attention initially on investor protection issues given concerns about market manipulation and cryptocurrencies  volatility 
In a consultation document  the Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  said that it had seen interest from institutional investors in trading  payment tokens  like bitcoin and ether  who  have a need for a regulated product to gain and hedge their exposure to the payment tokens  
The consultation will close on Dec  20 
Derivatives products are a particular concern for regulators looking to protect investors  and MAS said that it did not consider bitcoin and other similar derivatives to be suitable for trading by retail investors 
 The underlying payment tokens tend to exhibit high volatility and are intrinsically difficult to value      Losses also amplified due to the leveraged nature of derivatives  and investors may even lose more than the whole amount they had put in   MAS said 
Some U S  based exchanges including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures U S   already allow trading of bitcoin futures 
However  Hong Kong s Securities and Futures Commission said earlier this month that exchanges allowing trading of bitcoin futures  may well be conducting an illegal activity  
MAS only proposes to regulate futures traded on exchanges it already regulates  It warned investors it did not regulate token derivatives not traded on approved exchanges 




 The inclusion of these products in the approved exchanges will certainly provide new opportunities for all regulated exchanges  This may create liquidity for these products   David Gerald  president of the Securities Investors Association  Singapore   said in a statement  but warned retail investors of the high risk involved in investing in these products ",2019-11-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/singapore-proposes-to-regulate-bitcoin-futures-2024216,2024216

markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Hallmark Financial Services Inc    NASDAQ HALL    Chuy s Holdings Inc    NASDAQ CHUY    Southern  NYSE SO  First Bancshares Inc    NASDAQ SFST    Boot Barn Holdings Inc    NYSE BOOT   and Exantas Capital Corp    NYSE XAN   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Domestic Small Cap Stocks to Buy Amid Oil Supply ShockWall Street closed in the red on Sep 16 owing to a drone attack on the two most precious oil fields of Saudi Arabia on Sep 14  resulting in an immediate drop of around 5  in global crude oil supply per day  Consequently  oil prices skyrocketed  intensifying concerns of further worsening of the global economy Crude Prices SkyrocketOn Sep 16  the global benchmark Brent crude futures price surged 19 5  to  71 95 per barrel at the open  marking its all time biggest jump  However  Brent closed the day at  69 02 or up 14 6   Likewise  the U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate  WTI  futures soared 15 5  to  63 34 per barrel at opening  reflecting its largest jump since December 2008  Finally  WTI finished at  62 90  up 14 8  A massive hike in crude oil prices is likely to dampen global economic growth  especially in the emerging markets  A large amount of import bill of the majority of these countries consists of crude oil  A higher import bill will put pressure on the countries  exchequer and result in cost push inflation Safe Haven Assets GainConcerns about intensifying global economic slowdown compelled investors to shift to several safe haven instruments instead of investing in risky equities  On Sep 16  price of December gold futures in Comex gained  12 or 0 8  to settle at  1 511 50 per ounce  the highest daily gain since Sep 6  Notably  gold lost 1 1  in the previous week  In addition to gold  silver surged 2 6  The yield on the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury Note declined 5 8 basis points to 1 843   marking its biggest daily drop in three weeks  Likewise  yields on 2 year and 30 year noted dropped 3 6 basis points to 1 765  and 6 3 basis points to 2 311   respectively Moreover  the ICE  NYSE ICE  Dollar Index  which tracks the price of U S  dollar against a basket of six major currencies  gained 0 4  to close at  98 65 Why Domestic Small Cap Stocks Investors are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets  Domestic business oriented small cap companies are mostly immune to any external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market Notably  the United States has become a net exporter of oil and is no longer dependent on Middle East crude oil supply  Therefore  recent geopolitical tension in that region will have little impact on the United States Small cap companies generally benefit from a strong domestic economy  In order to fund expansion  small cap companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers making them less sensitive to the interest rate movement Additionally  reduction of corporate tax from 35  to 21  is a major catalyst for small cap companies  These companies book almost all of their revenues in the homeland  As a result  a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate is immediately accretive to their cash flow Our Top PicksAt this juncture  investment in domestic business focused small cap stocks will be fruitful  We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks that popped in the past three

145668,367183,ICE,Oil Prices Sink On Report Saudi Output Will Recover Quickly After Weekend Attack,opinion,"Oil futures dropped sharply on Tuesday  after registering one of the sharpest rallies on record a day earlier  following a report that output from Saudi Arabia will be quick to recover from weekend attacks on major crude facilities which disabled more than half of the kingdom s daily crude production level 
The Saudis are close to restoring 70  of the 5 7 million barrels per day production lost after the attacks  Reuters reported  citing a top Saudi source briefed on the latest developments  The source also said output will be fully back online in the next two to three weeks 
 The good news is production will be back on line  What he did not say is how they are going to stop these drone and missile attacks in the future   said Phil Flynn  senior market analyst at Price Futures Group 
The kingdom s energy minister Price Abdulaziz bin Salman will hold a news conference at around 8 p m  local time  1 p m  Eastern time  to provide an update on the situation with the oil facilities  Reuters report  citing the media ministry 
West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19   5 31  the U S  benchmark contract  was down  3 22  or 5 4   at  59 69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  after the largest daily gain for the most active contract since Sept  22  2008  according to Dow Jones Market Data  WTI finished Monday s session at its loftiest level since May 21  2019 
November Brent crude BRNX19   5 23  lost  3 22  or 4 7   to  65 0 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe  following the international benchmark contract s sharpest percentage gain on record and its biggest dollar rise since June 6  2008 
Monday s price spikes in both Brent and WTI crude oil came after a Saturday attack on Saudi Arabia s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field  which has thrown offline an estimated 5 7 million barrels of the kingdom s crude oil production a day  Saudi Arabia has enough oil in storage to make up the lost production for about 30 days  but it may take weeks or months to repair the damage to the processing plant and oil fields 
U S  intelligence on Monday said evidence points to Iran as the source of the Saudi attacks  which officials from Tehran have denied  However  a somewhat softening stance from the U S  and Saudi  in terms of military responses  may cool a run up in crude prices  even if it takes longer for Saudi production to return online 
 I don t want war with anybody   said President Donald Trump on Monday  in response to questions from reporters during a press conference in the White House with the Crown Prince of Bahrain 
Those comments were in contrast to statements on Monday from U S  Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  who both definitively pointed the finger at Iran for the attack on Saudi s energy infrastructure  Moreover  the Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that U S  intelligence indicated that the Saudi attack originated in Iran  with a combination of a drones and missiles  Saudi officials  however  have indicated that there isn t enough evidence to implicate Tehran definitively 
 The shock loss of 5  of global crude production has markets focused on how soon Saudi Aramco can bring back production and if we will see the US or other countries use their respective strategic reserves   wrote Edward Moya  senior market analyst at brokerage Oanda 
 The latest update shows Saudi Aramco s initial calculation on the damages may have been too optimistic and some customers expecting early October deliveries will likely see shipments later in the month   he wrote

145677,367192,ICE,Second Slice  Fed Cuts Rates Again  But Next Move Uncertain Amid Divided FOMC,opinion," Wednesday Post Fed  The Fed s not in the business of delivering surprises  That s why today s 25 basis point rate cut the second in less than two months after 10 years without one probably came as most investors expected 
The benchmark fed funds rate is now in the 1 75  to 2  range  back to where it was roughly a year ago  as the Fed pedals furiously to keep the long U S  expansion going even as economies in Europe and Asia seem to be slipping into slow motion  
The real question is what comes next  and that s why people are taking a close look at the Fed s latest statement and    to get a sense of whether this is the last cut of the year or if there s a chance of another  It may be an actual surprise to hear that the Fed itself doesn t agree on this  With that in mind  it looks like rate policy will remain a  meeting by meeting  decision based on data and the risk picture  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his press conference  
 We re not on a pre set course   said Powell  admitting that this is a  challenging  time 
Lack of a definitive promise for more rate cuts appears to have put stocks under pressure late in today s session  The dot plot shows five members thinking the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  should have held its previous range of 2  to 2 25   five approve of the 25 basis point cut but want to keep rates there through the rest of the year  and seven favor at least one more cut this year  CNBC noted 
There s really no easy landing spot  and it s more difficult because there s also a bit of a conundrum in the U S  economy now   Household spending has been rising at a strong pace   the Fed said in its statement today  but  business fixed investment and exports have weakened  
This could be a way of alluding to the trade situation  where tariffs are apparently starting to have an impact on company investment due to uncertainty about how they ll ultimately play out  Consumers have been keeping things going at home  as the Fed noted by putting stronger language around the spending dynamic this time around  but some analysts believe it s unclear if this can last beyond the holidays if there s no definitive outcome on trade 
Powell Notes Weakness Abroad

In his remarks after the decision  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted  weakness abroad   low U S  inflation  and U S  business uncertainty in the light of the trade situation  The Fed  he said  has dialed down its ideas of where  appropriate  rate policy should be  and has adjusted to take this into account 
 Global growth has weakened and political risks like Brexit remain unresolved   Powell said at his press conference   Uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged  companies  from investing in their businesses   
Powell said the FOMC still expects U S  gross domestic product  GDP  growth to remain  moderate  at near 2  this year and next  and unemployment to stay below 4   However  he noted that inflation expectations remain at the low end and inflation hasn t reached the Fed s 2  goal  He expects the 2  goal to be reached  but in the meantime   continued below target inflation could lead to an unwelcome slide in expectations  
Deflation can be a self reinforcing psychology  encouraging people to wait before making purchases on hopes prices will fall  That s the kind of deflationary spiral the Fed hopes to avoid 
Powell says the labor market remains strong  with wages rising  particularly for lower wage jobs   which is allowing more people to participate in the job market 
However   Global growth continues to weaken   even since the Fed s last meeting  a risk that the Fed sees as more heightened now  Powell said  
Growing Dissent on FOMC Could Make Next Meetings Tougher
It s also interesting to see a growing dichotomy among Fed voters  with three of them dissenting this time around  One wanted a 50 basis point cut  while two wanted no cut at all  Dissenters included some of the usual hawks and doves 
This is the second time in a row we ve seen people dissenting  which makes it seem like it could be tougher for the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  to reach consensus the next few meetings  What didn t change from the last statement back in July is the Fed saying it will continue monitoring the economy  a possible sign that FOMC members could simply decide to watch the economic data roll in before deciding on next steps  Last time out  the Fed didn t satisfy doves who wanted it to announce it s on a steady rate cut course  and it seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon 
Another question is where a so called  neutral  fed funds rate might be  Earlier this year  some analysts and economists thought it was somewhere around 3   Now  the Fed has taken rates back below 2  and there s still widespread belief  judging from the futures market  anyway  that it could move rates even lower   Does that mean a neutral interest rate is also edging down  or is the fed funds rate downshifting out of neutral and into low gear 
A  neutral  rate  by the way  is one that s supposed to neither encourage nor discourage borrowing  The European Central Bank is already offering a rate way below neutral levels  and well below zero  The benchmark U S  rate remains well above that  but we ve heard more chatter recently about possible negative rates here lately  with even former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan weighing in on the topic 
Another question mark going into this afternoon s press conference was the Fed s future plans for its balance sheet  see more below   Recall that the central bank recently wrapped up a balance sheet reduction program  and already there have been calls for a fresh round of expansion   It s certainly possible we ll have to resume organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we had thought   Powell said  noting this is going to be a discussion topic for the Fed 
Laying Out Arguments For and Against
In normal times  it might  be unlikely to see rates go down at a time like this  The economy grew nearly 3  last year and is running at around a 2  clip now  That s not outstanding  but it s not anything that would necessarily get people worrying about recession  either  Inflation  too  sent some signals last week  with both core producer and core consumer prices rising more than many analysts had expected  Inflation can be a sign of economic strength  
Meanwhile  unemployment remains at 50 year lows  Generally  low unemployment and a growing economy tend to argue against easing borrowing costs  out of fears that the economy could get  too hot   sparking inflation  
Another argument you could make against rate cuts now is that they re already ultra low  With the fed funds rate at just under 2 25  going into the meeting  the Fed doesn t have a lot of traction to make more cuts if the economy really runs into trouble  There may be some members of the FOMC who d like to keep the powder dry  so to speak  so they have ammunition to stimulate growth if times get tough  
Historically  the fed funds rate has been around 5   so it s about half its normal level  A 5  rate means the Fed could cut a bunch of times if recession hits  A 2  rate means you re back to zero again pretty quickly  The Fed only has so many bites at the apple before it has to consider more dramatic and less tried and true stimulus tools like quantitative easing or even negative rates 
The factors that had been pointing in the direction of a rate cut included the trade war between the U S  and China and continued negative rates and poor economic performance overseas  Though the benchmark German bund yield is up a bit from recent lows  it remains way under water  Chinese economic growth continues to sputter  and Argentina is also in tough shape  The Fed might not want U S  rates to be so far out of line with rates around the world  and the spread between the U S  10 year yield and the German 10 year yield is at long term highs

FIGURE 1  RESILIENT GREENBACK  In theory  lower domestic interest rates should lower the value of the local currency relative to other currencies  all else equal  Yet after the second cut in the fed funds rate in as many months  the U S  Dollar Index   DXY  has held steady and even rose a bit  As developed markets across the globe continue to slow  perhaps the market is saying that  despite the dovish moves by the Fed  dollar denominated investments remain in the words of one analyst the best house in a bad neighborhood  Data source  ICE  NYSE ICE  Chart source  The   For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Wages and Recessions  Looking back over the last few economic recoveries  research firm FactSet found that wage growth topped 4  year over year for long stretches during tight labor markets in the 1990s and 2000s  That hasn t happened over the last few years despite unemployment falling to 50 year lows  with wages barely rising 3  for many months now and only getting to 4  in one recent month  December 2018  Though you want to see people get paid more for their work  maybe the light wage growth could be a blessing in disguise  because periods of strong wage growth in the past were often followed by recessions  FactSet noted  
Why aren t wages rising faster  Economists offer all kinds of reasons  ranging from the  gig economy  to competition from internet companies that tends to keep prices from rising as much and might dampen demand for higher wages  There could also be more lingering uncertainty following the 10  unemployment seen a decade ago  making workers less forceful about trying to get a bigger paycheck  Even a striking GM  GM  worker  when asked by the media this week why he s on the picket lines  said it s about  jobs   He didn t mention pay 
The Almighty Dollar s Case for a Cut  It all comes down to dollars and cents  as the saying goes  Maybe today s Fed rate cut works into that old expression  because one argument for easing rates involves the strong dollar and how to get it back down  At this point  with the dollar index not far from recent highs above 99  it could be creating concerns about future U S  growth  A strong dollar combined with weakness in overseas markets could hurt the U S  economy from an export perspective by making its products cost more even as economies overseas grapple with possible recession 
The Fed has said it wants to keep the U S  expansion going and also wants to get inflation back to its 2  target  By lowering rates  it could conceivably weaken the dollar and spark some inflation by influencing companies and consumers to spend more  though that s just theoretical  The other problem is  no matter what the Fed does or says  the dollar hasn t budged much in recent months  It tends to be one of the places people go when there s a  flight to safety   meaning even if rates go down  theoretically creating a higher supply of greenbacks   people might still want to be long dollar for perceived protection  as the U S  economy still looks like the best house in a bad neighborhood 
Crude Rallies Don t Always Hurt Stocks  Consider this  Since bottoming at  26 a barrel in early 2016  U S  crude prices rose 111  by the end of last week  before spiking Monday after the attack on Saudi Arabia   In that period from early 2016 through mid September 2019  the S P 500 Index  SPX  rose roughly 60  and the economy has grown pretty steadily  with unemployment falling to 50 year lows and consumers in very good shape  So you could argue that stocks and the overall economy sometimes do just fine even as crude climbs  There s a limit  naturally  but even when crude was above  100 for a few years  the economy didn t stop growing  With Saudi Arabia now saying it might be back to normal oil output in just two to three weeks  crude prices stepped back Tuesday and Wednesday  but it s not prudent to get complacent  Crude is likely going to carry more of a risk premium than before  especially with the Gulf situation so volatile and the U S  threatening new sanctions against Iran

145678,367193,ICE,Fed Cuts Key Interest Rate A Quarter Point  Winners   Losers,opinion,The Fed trimmed target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time in just seven weeks  a widely expected move to sustain the decade long economic expansion amid trade war concerns However  the Fed officials gave divided opinions on further rate cuts for the rest of the year  leading to a volatile trading session  Even so  U S  stocks managed to climb back with the rate sensitive utility sector gaining the most  and bank stocks finishing in the green  In contrast  gold prices dropped as U S  dollar strengthened after the Fed cut rates Investors Digest Fed Rate CutThe Fed lowered interest rates to lend support to an economy which is facing trade tensions with China and other heightened geopolitical issues such as the attacks on Saudi Arabia s oil production facilities The Fed trimmed rates to a range of 1 75  to 2   Decline in business investments as well as exports coupled with persistently low level of inflation were cited as the primary reasons behind the rate cuts  If the trade war escalates and hurts growth  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank may lower rates further  Powell did say that  if the economy does turn down  a sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate  But  President Trump criticized the Fed statement  He tweeted that  Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again  No  guts   no sense  no vision   He expected the Fed to slash rates more aggressively  thanks to a record low unemployment level and confident consumers In fact  the Fed s policy statement showed that not all officials were in agreement over further rate cuts this year  Only seven of the 17 members are expecting additional rate cuts this year  What s more  Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren didn t want a rate cut  while St  Louis Fed President James Bullard wanted to trim rates by half a percentage point this time around U S  Stocks Wobble  Rate Sensitive Utilities GainInvestors were certainly disappointed after the Fed officials gave mixed signals about future rate cuts this year  But  stocks somehow chipped away their losses after Powell expressed confidence about the U S  economic outlook Most importantly  shares of rate sensitive utilities scaled north  with the Utilities Select Sector  XLU  increasing 0 4   the highest among all S P 500 sectors  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  an interest rate cut will help them pay off debts and book profits However  higher rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Given the buoyancy among rate sensitive stocks  investors can bet on energy company NRG Energy  Inc    NYSE NRG   and provider of water and electric services  American States Water Company   NYSE AWR   NRG Energy currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved up 2 6  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 61 4  compared with the  industry s projected rally of 4 3  Meanwhile  American States Water currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has advanced 6  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 22 7  compared with the  industry s estimated rally of 0 5  Rate Cut Fuels Banks  RallyGenerally when there is a rate hike  banks are definitely the go to rate trade  Higher interest rates boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  and shorter term liabilities But  the SPDR S P Bank ETF  NYSE KBE  managed to increase nearly 0 7  after the Fed approved a quarter point rate cut  with large banks including JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   and Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   registering a 1  and 0 9  increase  respectively And why not  As rightly pointed out by CNBC s Jim Cramer   people are buying the bank stocks because there s a chance Powell s rate cuts may put an end to the artificially inverted yield curve  and at the same time he s committed to prevent the economy from slipping into a credit ruining recession  This calls for investing in banks  And we have zeroed down to three   BCB Bancorp  Inc    NYSE C    Customers Bancorp  Inc    NYSE C   and First Bancorp   NYSE C    Here s why  BCB Community Bank has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has climbed 1 7  over the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17 8   more than the  industry s projected rally of 7  Customers Bancorp has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  now  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current quarter earnings has moved 1 4  north in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is 17 7  compared with the  industry s expected rally of 6 5   You can see  First Bancorp currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has increased 2 3  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is 8 1  compared with the Banks   Southeast industry s projected rally of 6 5  Dollar Strengthens  Gold FallsA Fed rate cut should have compelled investors to sell dollar denominated assets  eventually weakening the dollar s exchange rate  Still  the dollar firmed as Fed officials gave an uncertain outlook on further easing The ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  which measures dollar s strength against a basket of major currencies  increased nearly 0 4  in the last trading session to 98 60  While the euro fell to 1 1031 dollars in late New York trading  the British pound was down to 1 2463 dollars Gold prices  in the meanwhile  dropped below  1 500 oz following the FOMC meeting  Owing to the rise in the value of U S  dollar in relation to other

An oil ETF  originally named NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF  BOON   was also  by the name of Pickens  This fund was initially meant to focus on companies  the performance of which positively correlates with that of ICE  NYSE ICE  Brent Crude Oil Futures 
However  the fund now trades as the Pickens Morningstar Renewable Energy Response ETF  and tracks the Morningstar North America Renewable Energy Index rather than the NYSE Pickens Oil Response Index

Inside RENW
The underlying Morningstar North America Renewable Energy Index is a rules based  equal weighted index of U S  and Canadian listed common stocks of companies in North America that are leaders in the transition to a low carbon economy

The ECB cut its deposit rate further into negative territory  decreasing it by 10 basis points to negative 0 5   while also announcing it would restart its monthly bond buying program as it attempts to juice inflation and the eurozone economy 
The ECB will host a news conference to discuss its moves at 8 30 a m  Eastern Time 
A rally for gold comes as the U S  dollar also scored a post ECB gain along with U S  stock index futures and bond prices 
As measured by the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  a gauge of the greenback against a basket of a half dozen currencies  was 0 2  higher at 98896  heading into positive territory after Europe s central bank  A stronger dollar usually makes dollar pegged commodities like gold less attractive to buyers using other currencies 
However  expectations that the U S  Federal Reserve may be influenced by the ECB also helped to drive bond yields lower  offering support for bullion  which doesn t offer a yield  The 10 year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y   3 36  was down nearly 5 basis points to 1 684  early Thursday from 1 733  late Wednesday 
Policy measures implemented by the ECB come ahead of the Fed s monetary policy gathering  where policy makers are widely expected to cut U S  interest rates by 25 basis points on Sept  18 
Reductions to global interest rates and some  17 trillion dollars in government debt that offers a negative yield have helped to bolster appetite for alternatives assets like gold  considered a haven during times of economic uncertainty

145694,367209,ICE,U S  judge rules suspicionless searches of travelers  digital devices unconstitutional,news,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON  Reuters    A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that U S  border agents need  reasonable suspicion  but not a warrant to search travelers  smartphones and laptops at airports and other U S  ports of entry  a practice that has been growing in recent years 
U S  District Judge Denise Casper in Boston ruled in a lawsuit by 11 travelers that border officials need to be able to point to specific facts to justify searching someone s devices for contraband like child pornography and counterfeit media 
That is a higher standard than agents with the U S  Customs and Border Protection and the U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement under their current policies have been required to apply to conduct routine searches of electronic devices 
She said that while officials have a  paramount  interest in protecting the border  the privacy interests of travelers whose troves of personal information could be otherwise searched without cause had to balanced against it 
 This requirement reflects both the important privacy interests involved in searching electronic devices and the Defendant s governmental interests at the border   Casper wrote 
The judge said that to the extent CBP and ICE  NYSE ICE  policies allowed for such searches without cause  they violated the U S  Constitution s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures 
But Casper declined to force agents to have probable cause and secure warrants before searching devices  a higher standard sought by the plaintiffs  lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation 
Esha Bhandari  an attorney with the ACLU  said in a statement that the ruling  significantly advances Fourth Amendment protections for the millions of international travelers who enter the United States every year  
 By putting an end to the government s ability to conduct suspicionless fishing expeditions  the court reaffirms that the border is not a lawless place and that we don t lose our privacy rights when we travel   Bhandari said 
The CBP had no immediate comment 
The number of electronic device searches at the border has ballooned during Republican President Donald Trump s administration  rising on a fiscal year basis from about 8 500 in 2015 to more than 30 000 in 2018  according to the ACLU 
The civil liberties group and EFF filed the lawsuit in 2017 on behalf of 10 U S  citizens and one lawful resident whose devices were searched without a warrant 
Several were Muslim or minorities  The travelers included a military veteran  a National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineer  two journalists and a computer programmer ",2019-11-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/us-judge-rules-suspicionless-searches-of-travelers-digital-devices-unconstitutional-2019218,2019218
145695,367210,ICE,How To Profit From ETFs As Saudi Attack Unnerves Investors,opinion,An attack on Saudi Arabian refining facilities unnerved investors in the weekend  leading to risk off trade once again  This is because a drone strike at the heart of Saudi Arabia s oil production facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais  claimed by Yemen s Houthi rebels  disrupted about 5  of global oil supply and intensified Middle East tensions The explosion has not only disrupted global oil supply but also escalated geopolitical tensions between the countries  Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran for the disruption while the allegation was rejected by Tehran  President Donald Trump said the United States is  locked and loaded depending on verification  that Iran staged the attack  raising the specter of a military response  Any retaliatory action against Iran would escalate the tensions between the two countries  The relations between the two countries turned bitter after Trump pulled out of a global nuclear pact and imposed fresh sanctions against Iran The latest Saudi attack has resulted in increased geopolitical risk that will continue to curb global growth  which has been already under pressure due to the U S  China trade tariff war as well as bouts of weak data across the globe  read    Further  the latest bout of weak China data has sapped investors  appetite for riskier assets  Notably  industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed to the weakest in 17 and a half years at 4 4  in August from the year ago month  Retail sales and investment also worsened  indicating that the world s second largest economy is yet to stabilize As a result  the latest development has led to higher demand for safe haven avenues or lower risk securities  Below we have highlighted five ETFs where investors could stash their money amid the current market turmoil SPDR Gold Trust  P GLD  ETF   TSXV GLD  Gold is viewed as a safe haven in times of economic or political turmoil  Rising geopolitical tension has raised the appeal for the bullion as a store of value and hedge against market turmoil  As such  the ultra popular product tracking this bullion like GLD could be an interesting pick  The fund tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U S  dollars  and kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA  It is an ultra popular gold ETF with AUM of  42 2 billion

Treasury 20  Year Bond Index  It is one of the most popular and liquid ETFs in the bond space with AUM of  16 9 billion and average daily volume of 9 6 million shares  Expense ratio comes in at 0 15   The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 with a High risk outlook iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF Low volatility products have the potential to outpace the broader market in the event of turmoil  providing significant protection to the portfolio  These funds include more stable stocks that have experienced the least price movement in their portfolio  Further  these allocate more to defensive sectors that usually have a higher distribution yield than the broader markets  While there are several options  USMV with AUM of  33 9 billion and average daily volume of 4 1 million shares is the most popular ETF  The fund charges 15 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy  with a Medium risk outlook  read    Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF   ASX VIG  Dividend paying securities are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk  This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds   safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices  The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis  While the dividend space has been crowded  ETFs with stocks having a strong history of dividend growth like VIG seem to be good picks  The ETF has AUM of  38 4 billion and trades in volume of 856 000 shares a day on average  It charges 6 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a Medium risk outlook  read    Invesco Defensive Equity ETF   DE DEF     Investors could rotate into defensive sectors like utilities  healthcare and consumer staples  which generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty  DEF seems an excellent choice as this offers exposure to companies having potentially superior risk return profiles during periods of stock market weakness  while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength  The fund has accumulated  254 8 million in its asset base and sees lower volume of 17 000 shares per day on

145697,367212,ICE,Oil Ends up  Hitting 7 Week Highs on Elusive Trade Deal,news,"By Barani Krishnan
Investing com   The we ll have a trade deal soon mantra provided a floor for oil again Friday  pushing crude prices to seven week highs  even as Chinese media disputed Beijing s willingness to commit to the kind of U S  agricultural purchases 
Prices of U S  West Texas Intermediate and London s Brent rose by nearly 2  each  egged on by record highs for all the three major stock indexes on Wall Street  where the noise of a prospective trade deal was even greater 
NYME traded WTI settled up 95 cents  or 1 7   at  57 72 per barrel  after hitting a seven week high of  57 97 
ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures traded U K  Brent closed the regular U S  trading up  1 02  or 1 6   to  63 30  Earlier  it rose to a seven week peak of  63 64 
Both crude benchmarks showed weekly gains of about 1  
 It s the mindless cacophony of the trade deal making its rounds again and everyone on Wall Street to NYMEX is latching on to it for a ride  regardless of the fact that it s the same din we ve been hearing for two weeks now    that a deal is coming   said John Kilduff  partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital   And there s nothing on paper to prove the words  
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that the U S  and China were close to securing a trade deal  His comments come after a week of volatility after reports that the two sides had hit a snag over trade talks  Chinese media on Friday fleshed out arguments that Chinese demand for U S  farm products is nowhere near the level of purchases that Washington is insisting on in order to seal a partial phase one deal 
U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that U S  and Chinese officials would hold a call later in the day  but added that the U S  could still impose tariffs on Chinese goods  which are scheduled for Dec  15 
 We have been here so many times where the market gets its hopes up and then it gets crushed   Scott Brown  chief economist at Raymond James in St  Petersburg  Florida  said  expressing confidence that a deal might still happen 
Reuters  meanwhile  assisted the bullish theme in oil somewhat by reporting that the U S  shale industry plans another spending freeze next year  
The industry has seen a sharp slowdown in production growth  as prolific oil and natural gas output has pressured prices and squeezed profits  the report said 
Producers have already said they expect to spend about  4 billion less in 2019 than in 2018  according to U S  financial services firm Cowen   Co   quoted by Reuters  So far  21 exploration and production companies tracked by Cowen have released 2020 capex guidance with 15 projecting declines  five with increases and one unchanged  for a 13  year over year spending decline 
Yet  Investing com oil columnist Ellen R  Wald wrote on Thursday that traders needed to beware that shale oil companies were sometimes overly dramatic in expressing their growth concerns  
 These could be tactics designed to reduce analysts  expectations  so when these companies reveal their Q4 earnings  their share prices won t drop nearly as much   Wald wrote 
 With Chesapeake Energy s share price so low that it is about to be delisted from the stock exchange  it wouldn t be surprising to see similar oil producers actively trying to decrease expectations   she said 
Casting a further pall on the market  the International Energy Agency also said in its monthly report on Friday that OPEC and its allies face stiffening competition in 2020

The instant reaction to the oil price was huge   Brent prices grew more than 19  on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe to  71 95 a barrel  its biggest gain in percentage terms since 1991  Trading in WTI was frozen for a few minutes because of a so called circuit breaker  which is triggered by a gain of more than 7   When they finally opened  futures jumped as much as 15 5  to  63 34  the most since 2008    
Though the  how long production is disturbed  we can expect oil prices to remain elevated as of now  Yemen s Iran backed Houthi rebels took the responsibility for   The incident caused cessation of production of 5 7 million barrels of crude a day   more than half of  and more than 5  of the world s daily crude oil production  
Roberto Friedlander  Seaport Global s head of energy trading  expects   depending on the timing of a turnaround  as quoted on CNBC  And if Saudi resumes production sooner than expected   the impact is more likely to be  3 5 to Crude   Friedlander added 
How to Profit 
If you are a believer of a prolonged extension of supply disruption  you can definitely invest in regular and leveraged oil or energy exchange traded products for gains  at least for the short term 
Leveraged ETFs in Focus
ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF    provides a leveraged play to the crude oil segment of the commodities market  It seeks to deliver twice the return of the daily performance of the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex  which consists of futures contracts on crude oil  read

Any Caution 
As a caveat  investors should note that such products are suitable only for short term traders as these are rebalanced on a daily basis  see    
Clearly  a near term long could be intriguing for those with high risk tolerance  and a belief that the  trend is the friend  in this corner of the investing world  This is especially true given the news that Saudi Arabia intends to bring back a third of the lost output on Sep 16    So  a prolonged long term surge from this attack is less likely

concerned that a rising dollar will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets  Domestic business oriented small cap companies are mostly immune to any external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market Notably  the United States has become a net exporter of oil and is no longer dependent on Middle East crude oil supply  Therefore  recent geopolitical tension in that region will have little impact on the United States Small cap companies generally benefit from a strong domestic economy  In order to fund expansion  small cap companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers making them less sensitive to the interest rate movement Additionally  reduction of corporate tax from 35  to 21  is a major catalyst for small cap companies  These companies book almost all of their revenues in the homeland  As a result  a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate is immediately accretive to their cash flow Our Top PicksAt this juncture  investment in domestic business focused small cap stocks will be

The ebb and flow of trade talks between Washington and Beijing has weighed on oil prices  which have fallen around 15  from an April peak  While negotiators held  constructive discussions  over the weekend  CNBC reported on Monday that China is pessimistic about reaching a deal due to President Donald Trump s reluctance to roll back existing tariffs

145707,367222,ICE,Oil Plunges 3  as Market Catches up with Empty Trade Deal Talk,news,"By Barani Krishnan
Investing com   Oil is going down like a stone  falling its most in seven weeks  as the market wakes up to the hollow talk around the U S  China deal 
Prices of U S  West Texas Intermediate and London s Brent fell as much 3   sliding for a second straight day as President Donald Trump warned his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that Beijing had better sign a phase one pact with Washington by Dec  15 or face the wrath of more tariffs 
 
Adding to the weight on oil were indications that Russia was playing mind games again on whether it would support OPEC on production cuts  and analysts forecasts showing U S  crude inventories possibly spiked for a fourth straight week last week 
Having a smaller but  nevertheless  significant impact was the perception that Aramco  the Saudi oil company headed for its first public share sale  was struggling to raise the money it wanted from chosen investors 
NYME traded WTI plunged  1 79  or 3 1   to settle at  55 35 per barrel  It was WTI s sharpest one day fall since Sept 30   
On Monday  the U S  crude benchmark lost 1 2   breaking from last week s late week rally which came on suggestions by U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that negotiators were closing in on the phase one   
ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures traded U K  Brent tumbled  1 53  or 2 5   to settle Tuesday at  60 91  It slumped 1 4  on Monday 
Falling crude prices pushed energy shares lower  The energy sector was the weakest of the 11 S P 500 sectors for a second straight day 
The  market has lost its strength and is retracing after attempting a breakout above the 200 day moving average   Scott Shelton  energy futures broker at ICAP  in Durham  N C 
On Monday  CNBC quoted a Chinese government source as saying there was gloom in Beijing about prospects for a trade deal 
The long running dispute has hit economic growth prospects and clouded the outlook on oil demand 
Russia is unlikely to agree to deeper cuts in oil output at a meeting with fellow exporters next month  but could commit to extend existing curbs to support Saudi Arabia  Reuters reported  quoting three sources on Tuesday 
Russia is a key price support ally in the OPEC  group that groups Moscow with the 14 member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
Oil bulls  however  scoffed at the Russia story 
 Almost every time we get that headline  Russia goes to the OPEC meeting and is onboard with cuts   said Danny Flynn  a commodities broker at Price Futures Group in Chicago   That means we have the selloff that turns out to be a golden buy  
Aramco s pre listing woes also weighed after reports that Saudi Arabia had canceled the London leg of its initial public offering roadshow  scheduled for Wednesday 
While Aramco will be floated on the domestic Saudi bourse  it is trying to get some foreign participation as well in its IPO 
 In fact  most of the money in the IPO has been invested by some of the same Saudi princes that got an all expense paid vacation at the Saudi Ritz Carlton that shared the same motto as the Hotel California   you could check out anytime you want but you could never leave   said Phil Flynn  energy analyst at Price Futures Group 
He was referring to Riyadh s 2017 detention of many of its top businessmen at the Saudi Ritz Carlton on tax evasion accusations  releasing them only after the payment of huge settlements 
 For foreign investors  it is clear that it is hard to see top dollar valuation when the bulk of your investors had to be strong armed to invest in the deal in the first place   Flynn said ",2019-11-19,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-plunges-3-as-market-catches-up-with-empty-trade-deal-talk-2023778,2023778

The U S  and China both raised tariffs on goods imported from the other  with duties levied by Beijing also hitting some U S  crude  Bloomberg News on Monday reported that despite President Donald Trump indicating progress on the trade front  neither party has agreed on terms to officially restart negotiations and a date for a visit to the U S  by China officials hasn t been set

West Texas Intermediate crude for the October delivery CLV19   3 23  was down  1 88  or 3 4   to reach  53 22 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  In August  front month prices for the U S  benchmark suffered a 5 9  monthly decline  according to Dow Jones Market Data 
However  the front month WTI contract saw a 1 7  weekly rise on Friday after a large fall in U S  inventories

 This is a critical month for the U S  China trade war and if we don t see a major step in the right direction  oil could easily break below the summer lows   wrote Edward Moya  senior market analyst at brokerage Oanda  in a daily note  referring to trade tensions and the impact of September trade for crude 
Last Friday  data from a Reuters survey showed oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose in August for the first month this year  with members of the group pumping 29 61 million barrels a day  up 80 000 barrels a day from July s revised figure 
Oil inventory data due this week from the American Petroleum Institute and the U S  Energy Information Administration will be each delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday  respectively  because of the U S  Labor Day holiday on Monday  when most major U S  markets were closed 
Meanwhile  Hurricane Dorian  downgraded to a Category 3 storm  hovered over the northwestern Bahamas  and was expected to near Florida later Tuesday 
 The latest round of tit for tat tariffs by the Chinese included a 5  tariff on all Chinese imports of U S  crude oil  Hurricane Dorian is causing major demand issues and the cracks are responding accordingly   wrote Robert Yawger  director of energy at Mizuho Securities USA LLC  in a Tuesday research note 
However  reports indicated that two major petroleum stations in the Bahamas may not severely impact global supplies  According to Bloomberg News  Buckeye Partners LP operates a large crude and refined products terminal at Freeport  and Equinor ASA has a terminal in nearby South Riding Point  which have a combined capacity of more than 30 million barrels of crude and condensate

West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19   0 84  picked up 15 cents  or 0 3   to trade at  56 40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a 4 3  rally on Wednesday  which marked the biggest dollar and percentage gain since July 10  according to Dow Jones Market Data

The American Petroleum Institute reported U S  crude supplies rose by 401 000 barrels for the week ended Aug  30  according to sources  The API data  which were released a day later than usual because of the U S  Labor Day holiday  also reportedly showed a stockpile decline of 877 000 barrels in gasoline  while distillate supplies fell by 1 2 million barrels 
Any weakness in oil trading on Thursday may be mitigated by reports late Wednesday that the U S  and China had set a tentative date in early October to resume negotiations to resolve a yearlong dispute on import duties and intellectual property rights that have arguably provided the most severe headwind for oil prices rising  China is one of biggest consumers and importers of crude oil  and the tariff conflict has threatened to create a global slowdown  damaging demand for crude products 
 Oil did not see a significant rally following the Chinese announcement of trade progress  because the API report last night showed a surprise slight rise with crude inventories   wrote Edward Moya  senior market analyst at Oanda  in a Thursday research note 
 In order for trade headlines to positively impact oil prices  a removal of tariffs or the upcoming deadlines would need to take place to see energy traders get excited   he said

145715,367230,ICE,As Market Welcomes New Saudi Oil Minister  Analyst Touts Prince Abdulaziz  ,opinion,"Saudi Arabia appointed a new energy minister over the weekend  and the oil market appears to have welcomed Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman with open arms  touting King Salman s son as an energy ministry veteran who likely remains committed to production cuts 
Prince Abdulaziz replaces Khalid al Falih  who held the post for about three years and was removed last week as chairman of Saudi Arabia s state owned oil giant  Saudi Aramco  The country has never placed a member of the royal family in charge of the energy ministry before  according to The Wall Street Journal 
The replacement of al Falih comes ahead of Saudi Aramco s initial public offering  Plans for the IPO were put on hold last year  but the oil company has revived the initiative  which would create the world s largest publicly traded company  as soon as early next year  Barron s reported in early August  citing people familiar with the discussions 
 The change in the energy ministry was primarily done ahead of the Aramco IPO so as to have a member of the royal family in charge when the world s largest oil company goes public   said Marshall Steeves  energy markets analyst at IHS Markit 
Oil prices got a boost Monday following the weekend news  with global crude benchmark Brent for November delivery BRNX19   1 95  up  1 14  or 1 9   at  62 68 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe  October West Texas Intermediate crude CLV19   2 44  traded at  57 70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  up  1 18  or 2 1  
 When it comes to OPEC politics   Prince Abdulaziz  is a master at that   independent energy expert Anas Alhajji told MarketWatch 
Over the weekend  Alhajii tweeted that the new energy minister  comes to office with unprecedented experience  knowledge of oil market economics politics  He attended more OPEC meetings than any current OPEC official  
Alhajji also pointed out that the Prince has  participated in the making of the Saudi oil policy since the 1980s  He is the institutional memory of the Saudi oil policy and OPEC  
On Monday  Prince Abdulaziz said Saudi Arabia s policy would not change and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  deal with other major producers  including Russia  to cut production by 1 2 million barrels a day would continue  according to Reuters  He also said the alliance between OPEC and the non member oil producers would stay for the long term 
 No major changes are likely   IHS Markit s Steeves said  Prince Abdulaziz  already told the press the OPEC  production cuts are likely to continue and this affirmation helped firm up the market  into Monday trading 
And  since this change doesn t represent a major policy change  the implications for the market are likely minor aside from confirmation that the kingdom remains committed to the OPEC  alliance and to the cuts   said Steeves 
Still  the move comes ahead of a meeting of major oil producers  which is expected to take place this week on the sidelines of the World Energy Congress 
The change in leadership may offer a  signal that we could see a possible shift in strategy at the September 12th OPEC  strategy meeting in Abu Dhabi   said Edward Moya  senior market analyst at Oanda  in an email update 
Prince Abdulaziz is half brother to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  which Moya pointed out as suggesting there could be more pressure from the Saudis for OPEC  to stabilize prices with further cuts 
Aside from oil  the appointment of a new energy minister is  about vision 2030 and all the power generation  Saudi Arabia  needs to metalize   said Alhajji  referring to the Saudi plan to reduce the country s dependence on oil and diversity the economy 
 The Saudi oil policy is not expected to change  but he is the energy minister   Alhajji said of Prince Abdulaziz s appointment   His legacy could be in the power sector where Saudi Arabia is focusing on solar  wind  and nuclear   Alhajji told MarketWatch   Energy efficiency programs will get a boost under his leadership  ",2019-09-10,Ed Moya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-market-welcomes-new-saudi-oil-minister-analyst-touts-prince-abdulaziz-200463125,200463125

145721,367236,ICE,Guide To The 10 Most Popular Leveraged Inverse ETFs,opinion,With the ETF industry gaining in leaps and bounds in recent years  the use of leveraged inverse ETFs  often known as ultra short funds  has grown rapidly  These products occupy a small slice of the ETF space Leveraged inverse ETFs provide opposite exposure that is a multiple   2X or  3X  of the performance of the underlying index  These funds employ various investment strategies such as use of swaps  futures contracts and other derivative instruments to accomplish their objectives  Due to their compounding effect  investors can enjoy higher returns in a very short period of time  provided the trend remains a friend  read    Since most of these ETFs seek to attain their goals on a daily basis  their performance could vary significantly from the inverse performance of their underlying index or benchmark  over a longer period when compared to the short period  such as  weeks  months or years  due to their compounding effect  This phenomenon can be explained with an example below Imagine that an investor buys a leveraged inverse ETF for  100 that has two times  2X  exposure to the underlying index of say 10 000  If the index goes up by 1  to 10 100 on day 1  then the market price of the ETF moves down by 2  to  98 on the same day  Again  when the index goes up by another 1  to 10 201 on day 2  then the ETF value goes down by another 2  to  96 04  Over the last two days  the index is up by 2 01  while the ETF is down by 3 96   approximately two times as stated by the fund objective   As a result  the performance of the fund and index can vary as we take longer periods for consideration Investors should also note that leveraged inverse ETFs involve a great deal of risk when compared to the traditional funds  They are often more costly and can be less tax efficient  as they can see capital gains through the use of swaps and other derivatives instruments How to Play Still

145722,367237,ICE,Oil Dips After Bigger Than Expected U S  Crude Stockpile Build,news," Bloomberg     Oil fell after a U S  government reported showed a bigger than expected build in domestic crude supplies 
Futures fell as much as 1 6  in New York on Wednesday  The Energy Information Administration reported that American crude inventories rose by 5 7 million barrels last week  more than forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg survey  Supplies at the key Cushing  Oklahoma  storage hub rose for a fourth week while gasoline stockpiles tumbles to the lowest in two years 
 The build was a little bit surprising    we will see if that trend continues   said Brian Kessens  portfolio manager at Tortoise  a Kansas firm that oversees more than  21 billion in assets   It was good to see that both gasoline and distillates had a draw so our takeaway is that the economy will continue to function with a fairly healthy clip  
A deteriorating global economy weakened by the trade war has driven a 17  slump in crude since late April  That s put the onus on OPEC and its allies to extend output cuts  though there are questions over Russia s willingness  The Saudis may need to consider deeper curbs with other Gulf countries if Russia abstains   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   said 
WTI for December delivery slipped 55 cents to  54 99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 11 a m  The U S  benchmark was trading in a bearish contango structure  which indicates oversupply 
Brent for December fell 35 cents to  61 24 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe Exchange  The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of  6 41 to WTI

U S  markets were volatile in the quarter due to uncertainty around the U S  China trade spat  This helped exchange operators such as ICE  who make most of their money from clearing and settling trades

145725,367240,ICE,Futures Are Pulling Cryptocurrencies Out of the Dark,news," Bloomberg Opinion     People have a love hate relationship with the futures markets  Futures are either financial drivers of rapid economic growth  turbocharging small amounts of capital to outflank entrenched barriers to innovation  or   to a populist   they are demonic pits where speculators manipulate prices and corrupt honest real economic activity  Since people also love or hate cryptocurrency  the rise of Bitcoin futures trading in 2019 is controversy squared 
Looking past overheated rhetoric  Bitcoin futures exemplify the maturing of crypto markets  Futures trading has grown from almost nothing to about 50  of spot trading  according to data from 13 top exchanges  1   It has reduced both actual and implied volatility  increased liquidity  broadened the investor base  improved portfolio management and soothed regulatory concerns  We ll remember 2019 as the year the path to peaceful coexistence between crypto and established markets became clear 
Before going further  it s important to remember that the promise of crypto is in the real code base and real networks being built to support real activity  This is slow  technical and boring  What matters is how people use crypto and how that changes their lives  Crypto can be successful without rising coin prices  or even with no exchange of crypto for traditional currencies at any price  On the other hand  if crypto fails to deliver on its technical promises  then the coins are likely worthless  So all the drama of how many dollars people pay for Bitcoin or what regulators think is a sideshow to the disruptive innovation crypto promises 
There are two dimensions to the rise of crypto futures  The first is that in 2019 all the major crypto exchanges are offering futures trading along with crypto borrowing and lending  It s now easy for any crypto owner to earn interest usually around 10   very attractive for inflation proof currencies on their holdings  as well as to make leveraged bets for or against crypto for future delivery 
The second dimension is less dramatic  Part of the peak excitement in 2017 was the introduction of cash settled Bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  along with physical settled futures and options on LedgerX    all Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulated exchanges well known to institutions 
Despite the slow start  and the decision earlier this year for CBOE to drop their contract  regulated futures trading volume and open interest have followed Moore s law  doubling every 18 months  True  open interest is only 0 1  of total Bitcoin supply  but even small numbers attached to exponential growth rates are worth noticing  2 
Talking to traders and market makers in major exchange crypto futures suggests the open interest is real money investors   individuals and institutions transacting for their own accounts for long term exposure rather than levered intermediaries making bets that might reverse tomorrow   putting in new money 
At the moment  the  200 billion market capitalization of crypto probably represents only about  10 billion of real money invested the rest is paper profits  This is one source of instability that makes crypto prices volatile  If open interest in regulated futures continues doubling  it represents a steadily increasing source of real money to stabilize prices  That doesn t mean it will push prices up a point often missed by crypto enthusiasts but it does mean whatever prices result will be more reliable 
A popular misconception is futures trading on the less regulated crypto exchanges is undercapitalized day traders switching from spot to futures  This does not seem to be true  Futures trading seems dominated by solidly capitalized crypto entities miners  dealers  venture investors  issuers  lenders  businesses managing portfolio exposures  This adds a further stabilizing force 
Cryptocurrencies may or may not revolutionize everything  If it does  it may or may not shower spectacular profits on investors  The rise of Bitcoin futures in 2019 suggests that if the shower occurs  it will be more nuanced and rational than what we have seen in prior crypto booms fewer unexpected cases of instant riches to seemingly random individuals  more moderate additions to average portfolio returns of millions of diversified investors

145740,367255,ICE,Democrat Sanders vows to halt immigration raids  deportations if elected president,news,"By Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders said on Thursday he would put a moratorium on deportations from the United States and end raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   on his first day in office 
Sanders said in a statement he would overturn Republican President Donald Trump s border policies if elected and create a  humane  lawful process that protects families and respects human rights  
Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his presidency and accuses Democrats of supporting  open borders   ICE has stepped up its activities  arresting more than 2 300 people in the 2018 fiscal year  compared with just over 300 the year before 
 We will end the ICE raids that are terrorizing our communities   said Sanders   and on my first day as president  I will use my executive power to protect our immigrant communities and reverse every single horrific action implemented by Trump  
Other Democrats running for president have also proposed immigration reforms like raising the number of refugees the Unites States takes in  Some  including Sanders  have said they would repeal the law that criminalizes crossing the border and has been used to separate migrant children from their families 
The U S  senator from Vermont is among the top three candidates in the crowded field of Democrats competing to take on Trump in the November 2020 election  but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in most opinion polls 
Sanders suffered a heart attack last month but has bounced back with endorsements from high profile progressives and rallies of supporters enthusiastic about his agenda of taxing corporations and the wealthy to pay for measures like government run healthcare 
Sanders  78  whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland  has spoken about immigration on campaign stops  but had not published a set of detailed proposals on immigration until Thursday 
Among his plans are a raft of executive actions he would take on day one of his presidency  like a moratorium on deportations until an audit of deportation policies and practices has taken place 
The proposals also included longer term reforms  like passing legislation giving a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally and breaking up ICE and the Customs and Border Protection agency to  begin treating immigration outside the context of national security  ",2019-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/democrat-sanders-vows-to-halt-immigration-raids-deportations-if-elected-president-2014454,2014454

By comparison  Texas  which became the first state to outsource incarceration to private companies in 1985  had far more inmates than any other state in for profit facilities in 2017 at nearly 13 000  or 7 8 percent of its total  said Gotsch ",2019-10-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/california-bans-private-prisons-and-immigration-detention-centers-1995377,1995377
145759,367274,ICE, Broken system  starves U S  oil boom of immigrant workers,news,"By Andrew Hay HOBBS  N M   Reuters    New Mexico oil man Johnny Vega laid out his predicament as his crew hoisted pipes from a well during the biggest oil boom in U S  history  The son of a Mexican guestworker  Vega cannot find enough legal workers to meet demand for his oil well service rigs  There is no shortage of Hispanic and Latino immigrant workers without work permits he could hire in Lea County  New Mexico   the No 2 oil producing county in the United States   But Vega says he wants to play by the rules  not least because of a heightened risk of company audits by U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   under President Donald Trump  As a result  he has equipment that could be generating  700 000 a month standing idle in his yard    They re demanding more rigs  more swabbing units  but you don t have enough employees   said Vega  who runs Mico Services with around  17 million in annual revenues   It s a lack of a system to get legal workers  to have more of a workforce to pull from   Employers like Vega in the Permian Basin oilfields of New Mexico and Texas say they feel caught between Trump s support for their industry and his policies focused on tougher immigration enforcement  It s a dilemma faced in other sectors of the U S  economy that depend on foreign workers after ICE reported surges of between 300  to 750  in worksite investigations  audits and arrests in fiscal year 2018   Visas for temporary jobs in sectors like agriculture and hospitality have increased during the Trump administration  Oil companies complain of difficulties gaining work permits for immigrant oil workers  who do not qualify for these temporary visas   The Permian Basin  by far the most productive oil field in the United States  has helped make the country a net exporter of oil  Its output growth has recently slowed  but production is still at all time highs  The number of rigs drilling for oil in New Mexico hit a record 115 in early October and labor shortages are felt most keenly in service companies like Vega s that help keep the oil flowing  The Permian Basin is short 15 000 workers  with demand met by paying overtime and shipping workers in and out  according to data from the Permian Strategic Partnership alliance of 19 energy companies  DANGEROUS JOBS Thousands of immigrants  mainly from neighboring Mexico  have thronged to the decade long boom  They often fill the hardest and most dangerous jobs few Americans want  such as using heavy equipment to lift oil well tubing or lay pipeline  For Bob Reid  immigrants provide a solution to labor shortages and a chance for boom bust oil towns like Hobbs  New Mexico to build a more stable future   The problem is a broken system that s preventing them from coming in legally in a way that allows them to pursue a path to citizenship   said Reid  head of the JF Maddox Foundation  a Hobbs charity  In Lea County  Hispanics and Latinos now account for as much as 70 percent of the population  compared with 40 percent 20 years ago  based on county school enrollment and other data   About two years ago  ICE stepped up operations in the Permian area  according to Lea County employers   I know people  my peers  that have been hit by immigration audits  and they were told  specifically  that the Permian Basin was targeted because of the vast amount of workers that were coming here   said Finn Smith  president of Hobbs based Watson Hopper Inc  ICE did not respond to requests for comment on its Permian operations   Two companies in Hobbs  the largest city in Lea County  were recently audited  Mesa Well Services and paving contractor Ramirez   Sons  according to a person with knowledge of the situation and a Ramirez   Sons official   Mesa Well officials were not available for comment  Ramirez   Sons Senior Superintendent David Gallegos said the company was paying around  40 000 in legal fees to apply for work permits or U S  citizenship on behalf of five of the employees laid off after the audit   They re worth fighting for   said Gallegos  a Republican New Mexico state representative  of the  long term  employees who had bought homes in the area  ICE operations  and Trump s threats of raids  have left many immigrants in Lea County fearful  Some bolt from job sites at rumors of ICE activity  said Maria Romano of New Mexico based immigrant rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido   More companies are using the government s E Verify immigration background checks to vet new hires  said Romano  whose organization helps immigrants get on a pathway to citizenship    VERY DIFFICULT HERE   It s now getting very difficult here for anyone who isn t documented   said Juan  an unemployed pipeline worker who immigrated to the United States illegally 11 years ago  He asked that his last name not be used to protect his identity  About a third of all immigrants in New Mexico and Texas lack valid working papers  according to a Pew Research Center study based on 2016 U S  census data   Hobbs Mayor Sam Cobb says he is frustrated by the failure of political leaders at the national level to create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants he generally finds hardworking and law abiding   The very people who have suffered from that are the people who are here growing our community  adding to the economic welfare of the community   said Cobb  a Democrat  sitting in his office surrounded by paintings of oil wells and cowboys  Yet plenty of employers in Lea County still hire undocumented workers   What we do is we don t ask   said Lorena  a Mexican immigrant whose family has built up a small oil field services business  She estimated that more than 90  of her employees were Mexican immigrants and that only 5  to 10  had genuine working papers  Her last name was not used to protect her identity  Vega s labor woes are pushing him to reorient his oil

145761,367276,ICE,Global stocks  pound rise on cautious Brexit deal hopes,news,"By Stanley White
TOKYO  Reuters    Asian stocks and the pound gained on Tuesday as investors held out hope that Britain still had a chance of avoiding a messy exit from the European Union at key negotiations this week 
MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0 1   Australian shares  AXJO  were up 0 17   while Japan s Nikkei stock index  N225  was up 1 86  
The pan region Euro Stoxx 50 futures  STXEc1  rose 0 23   German DAX futures  FDXc1  were 0 16  higher  while FTSE futures  FFIc1  were up 0 12  
The pound rose against the dollar and the euro  reflecting the cautious optimism about talks between Britain and the EU 
Capping broader gains in equities  however  was a perceived lack of progress coming out of U S  China trade negotiations 
Reports of a  Phase 1  trade deal between the United States and China last week had earlier cheered markets but the dearth of details around the agreement has since curbed this enthusiasm with oil prices extending declines  Chinese stocks weaker and the safe haven yen holding gains versus dollar 
The focus has now shifted to Europe where officials from Britain and the EU will meet at a make or break summit on Thursday and Friday that will determine whether or not Britain is headed for a so called no deal Brexit 
 Given the parliamentary intervention  I would say the chance of a no deal Brexit is around 10  to 20    said Shane Oliver  head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney 
 If there is a deal  sterling would rally and risk assets would rally  but the reaction could be limited to a day  
U S  stock futures  ESc1  rose 0 27  on Tuesday in Asia after the S P 500 ended 0 14  lower 
Traders  however  cautioned that sentiment remains fragile because the outcome of Brexit talks is far from certain and the U S  China trade war remains a risk to global growth 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to strike an exit deal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly departure on Oct  31 
The main sticking point remains the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland  which belongs to the UK  Some EU politicians have expressed guarded optimism that a deal can be reached 
However  diplomats from the EU have indicated they are pessimistic about Johnson s proposed solution for the border and want more concessions 
In the currency market  sterling  rose 0 17  to  1 2632  approaching a three month high of  1 2708  The pound  EURGBP D3  also rose around 0 18  to 87 34 pence per euro 
The yen   often considered a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty  held steady at 108 33 versus the dollar 
China s trade war scorecard 
A perceived lack of progress in resolving a prolonged trade row between the United States and China also weighed on investor confidence 
Chinese stocks  CSI300  fell 0 44  on Tuesday  led by declines in the technology sector  In the onshore market  the yuan  traded at 7 0740 per dollar  pulling back from a two month high reached on Monday 
The United States agreed to delay an Oct  15 increase in tariffs on Chinese goods while Beijing said it would buy as much as  50 billion of U S  agricultural products after tense negotiations last week 
However  Washington has left in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods 
Trade experts and China market analysts say chances are high that Washington and Beijing will fail to agree on any specifics   as happened in May   in time for a mid November meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping 
U S  crude  CLc1  fell 0 71  to  53 21 per barrel following a 2  decline overnight due to worries that global energy demand will remain weak 
Brent crude  LCOc1  also fell 0 78  to  58 89 per barrel

145771,367286,ICE,Exclusive  Surprise Syria truce hinged on Turkey s deadline demand   top official,news,"By Orhan Coskun and Humeyra Pamuk ANKARA  Reuters    The surprise deal to suspend Turkey s military offensive against Kurdish led forces in Syria hinged on President Tayyip Erdogan s demand that Washington agree a time limit on any ceasefire  a senior Turkish official said on Friday  U S  Vice President Mike Pence announced the five day pause in Turkey s cross border assault after more than four hours of talks on Thursday at Erdogan s presidential palace in Ankara   a meeting that began inauspiciously with stony faces and few smiles  Despite the sombre start  officials from both sides say a draft accord had already been sketched out ahead of the meeting  but crucial obstacles remained ahead of a deal to halt the latest battle in Syria s ruinous eight year civil war  The goal was to stem a fresh humanitarian crisis which has put 200 000 civilians to flight in northeast Syria and ease a security scare over thousands of Islamic State captives guarded by the Kurdish militia targeted in Turkey s assault  Also in the balance were fractious ties between Turkey and the United States  two NATO allies whose disputes over Syria policy and Russia led U S  President Donald Trump to announce sanctions and threaten to  obliterate  Turkey s economy   It was obvious that Pence s talks in Turkey would not be easy   the official told Reuters  Even before his plane landed in Ankara  Turkey had rejected Pence s call for a ceasefire unless Kurdish YPG fighters  whom it considers terrorists because of their links to guerrillas waging a deadly insurgency in southeast Turkey  agreed to withdraw from a 20 mile deep  safe zone  along the border   There were many disagreements  in the talks  the senior official said  declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter  But the central issue was Turkey s insistence that there could be no open ended truce   The make or break point in the meeting was when Erdogan demanded a deadline if they wanted the operations to be paused   he said   Erdogan said it could be 24 or 48 hours  Pence said it was a very short frame and he couldn t make that decision by himself   With the Turkish president refusing to give ground  the issue was taken up in a second  expanded meeting   Following discussions  a deadline of 120 hours was agreed on  Once this was settled  there was fast progress on other issues   the official said  A senior U S  administration official said   At one point  Erdogan asked how long it would take  the  YPG to pull out and we  the U S  delegation  took that as a glimmer of hope that the Turks were open to a deal   BREAKING THE ICE  NYSE ICE  Pictures of the start of the meeting between the U S  vice president  an evangelical Christian  and the Turkish president who leads a party with Islamist roots  suggested an awkwardness between the two men  But early in the conversation Pence told Erdogan that Trump  liked  respected and valued  him  according to the Turkish official  an introduction which he said  warmed the atmosphere   At another point in the talks  when Turkish officials cited their battle casualties in the week old military operation  Pence told them there were military veterans in the U S  delegation and his own son was in military service  He conveyed U S  condolences to those killed and to their families  a gesture which the U S  official said appeared to move a Turkish general in the meeting  Those personal connections may have helped ease some of the tensions in a relationship frequently characterized by uncompromising rhetoric from both sides  The agreement has de escalated tensions in the north of Syria  but there are signs the temporary truce remains fragile  On Friday morning  shelling could be heard near the Syrian town of Ras al Ain close to the border with Turkey  although Reuters journalists in the area said the bombardment subsided by mid morning  And there was confusion over how big the  safe zone  is that Turkey intends to secure  Erdogan said the swathe of land ran 440 km from east to west  but U S  special envoy for Syria  James Jeffrey  said the accord covered a smaller area  On the eve of Thursday s talks  the White House released a letter Trump sent to Erdogan warning him on Oct  9   the day Turkish troops crossed into northeast Syria   Don t be a tough guy  and  Don t be a fool   and repeating a warning that Trump could destroy Turkey s economy   It s really strange to talk to somebody like Erdogan in this tone  and expect him to accept this   a second Turkish official said  The tone of the letter was a particular surprise in Ankara  since Turkish officials have repeatedly said that the two presidents have a strong personal bond

145773,367288,ICE,5 ETF Zones To Take Shelter From Trade War,opinion,Trade war is playing foul in the stock market over the past month  It took an ugly turn on Aug 23 with the tit for tat tariffs between the United States and China  China plans to impose new tariffs of 5  10  on  75 billion worth of imported goods from the United States The bulk of the Chinese tariffs will take effect on Sep 1  while the rest of the duties will be effective Dec 15  The increased duties will be levied on more than 5 000 U S  products including agricultural goods  aircraft and crude oil  Also  a 25  tariff on U S  automobiles and auto parts  which were suspended this year in the wake of trade talks  will be reinstated on Dec 15  China s move came in retaliation to President Donald Trump s proposed 10  tariff on an additional  300 billion in Chinese goods to be imposed on Sep 1 though some of these were delayed until December  read    In a counter attack  Trump raised tariffs on  550 billion worth of Chinese goods  Existing 25  tariffs are expected to increase to 30  effective Oct 1 and planned 10  tariffs on a further  300 billion in Chinese goods will be raised to 15  in two stages   Sep 1 and Dec 15  Additionally  Trump ordered U S  companies to look at alternative ways to make their products in the United States and close operations in China The tariff hike will hurt U S  consumers  pushing up the prices of goods  thereby curtailing spending  It will further impact worldwide economy and corporate profits  particularly at big U S  exporters  All these will continue to weigh on the stock market and could disrupt global supply chains  In fact  worsening trade spat between the two largest economies has sparked fears of an imminent recession Market ImpactThe Dow Jones and S P 500 dropped 2 4  and 2 6   respectively  while Nasdaq shed 3  Crude oil also dropped as additional China tariff will further weaken oil demand  As a result  the latest move in trade war led to higher demand for safe haven avenues or lower risk securities  Below we have highlighted five such zones and their popular ETFs where investors could stash their money in an escalating trade war Gold   SPDR Gold Trust  P GLD  ETF   TSXV GLD  Gold is viewed as a safe haven in times of economic or political turmoil  The escalating tension has raised the appeal for the bullion as a store of value and hedge against market turmoil  As such  the ultra popular product tracking this bullion like GLD could be an interesting pick  The fund tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U S  dollars  and kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA  It is an ultra popular gold ETF with AUM of  41 6 billion and heavy volume of nearly 9 million shares a day  It charges 40 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a Medium risk outlook  read    Long Dated Treasury   iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  ETF   NZ TLT  The products tracking the long end of

ETFs in the bond space with AUM of  16 billion and average daily volume of 9 6 million shares  Expense ratio comes in at 0 15   The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 with a High risk outlook  read    Low Volatility   iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF These products have the potential to outpace the broader market in the event of a turmoil  providing significant protection to the portfolio  These funds include more stable stocks that have experienced the least price movement in their portfolio  Further  these allocate more to defensive sectors that usually have a higher distribution yield than the broader markets  While there are several options  USMV with AUM of  32 2 billion and average daily volume of 3 9 million shares is the most popular ETF  The fund charges 15 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy  with a Medium risk outlook  read    Dividend   Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF   ASX VIG  The dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk  This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds   safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices  The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis  While the dividend space has been crowded  ETFs with stocks having a strong history of dividend growth like VIG seem to be good picks  The ETF has AUM of  36 3 million and trades in volume of 855 000 shares a day on average  It charges 6 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a Medium risk outlook  read    Defensive   Invesco Defensive Equity ETF   DE DEF      Investors could rotate into defensive sectors like utilities  healthcare and consumer staples  which generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty  DEF seems an excellent choice as this offers exposure to companies having potentially superior risk return profiles during periods of stock market weakness  while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength  The fund has accumulated  237 9 million in its asset base and sees lower volume of 15 000 shares per day on average  It charges 59

presidential nomination have been uniformly critical of the immigration policies of U S  President Donald Trump  who was elected after promising to crack down on illegal immigration and bolster enforcement along the U S  Mexico border  Since entering the White House in 2017  Trump has moved to end former President Barack Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  which protects immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children from deportation   He has also curtailed immigration from majority Muslim countries  as well as temporarily instituted a policy along the U S  Mexico border separating children from parents or guardians with whom they crossed the border and holding them in separate facilities  Democrats have largely condemned Trump s approach to immigration  and the candidates leading the field to take on Trump in November 2020 have sought to contrast their stances with that of the Republican president  Here is a look at the immigration positions of the leading Democratic candidates  JOE BIDEN Biden struggled in early presidential debates to defend some immigration measures taken by former President Barack Obama when Biden was his vice president  including the deportation of more than 3 million immigrants between 2009 and 2016  setting a record  Biden said Obama  did the best thing that was able to be done  and pointed to Obama s creation of DACA  which the Trump administration wants to end  At another debate  Biden said undocumented immigrants needed to  get in line  and that the United States has the authority to prioritize those with needed skills or advanced degrees  His campaign has said Biden supports working with the U S  Congress to make comprehensive immigration changes  including a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants  Biden has not released a detailed immigration plan  ELIZABETH WARREN Warren  a U S  senator from Massachusetts  has said she would decriminalize migration by immediately issuing guidance to federal prosecutors that they not pursue cases related to administrative immigration violations  She would also separate immigration and law enforcement agencies into separate entities  and reshape the U S  Customs and Border Patrol  CBP  and U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE    from top to bottom   Warren would eliminate privately owned immigration detention facilities and only detain those who are a flight risk  She would create an immigration court system independent from the U S  Department of Justice and increase the number of refugees allowed into the country  She would work with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation that would create a path to citizenship  BERNIE SANDERS Sanders  a U S  senator from Vermont  says he would work with Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that includes a pathway to citizenship  He favors providing immediate legal status for those eligible for DACA  Sanders voted against creating ICE and would seek to restructure it  Sanders has said the surge of migrants at the U S  Mexico border is a  serious problem  but criticized the Trump administration s detention policies  He has said he opposes open borders  which he believes would strain government resources and make it more difficult to enact other policies he champions such as universal healthcare and free college tuition  PETE BUTTIGIEG Buttigieg  the mayor of South Bend  Indiana  has said he supports the DACA program and immigration legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship  He has criticized the Trump administration s move to send troops to the U S  Mexico border as a waste of time  Buttigieg wants to evaluate ICE and CBP policies to ensure there will be no future family separations along the U S  Mexico border  He has also said he would aim to reduce backlogs in the immigration and asylum processes  KAMALA HARRIS Harris  a U S  senator from California and its former top prosecutor  has said that Congress must pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul but  given its inability to do so  her plan rests on the president s executive power  She would use that authority to create a path to citizenship for young immigrants  and expand the DACA program to cover parents of U S  citizens and legal permanent residents  veterans and undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States for many years  She has said she would support overhauling ICE  AMY KLOBUCHAR Klobuchar  a U S  senator from Minnesota  has supported efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul in Congress and says she believes that a pathway to citizenship should be created for all immigrants already in the U S  legally  She sponsored a bill that would have prevented the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  from sharing most DACA recipients  information with ICE  CBP or the Justice Department  She has argued that the families of active duty military members should be protected from deportation  ANDREW YANG Yang  a technology entrepreneur  supports legislation languishing in Congress known as the DREAM Act  which would permanently protect DACA youth from deportation and provide them with a pathway to citizenship  He favors increasing the guest worker program  while making sure workers leave when the approved time is up  He has said any pathway to citizenship created for undocumented immigrants should  reflect the fact that these individuals tried to circumvent our legal immigration system   CORY BOOKER Booker  a U S  senator from New Jersey  has said  we can t wait for Congress to act  on immigration and would  on his first day in office  use the president s executive power to make sweeping changes  He would restore DACA protections and end spending on the Trump administration s wall along the U S  Mexico border  Booker would direct DHS to require its immigration facilities to meet standards set by the American Bar Association and expand legal counsel for undocumented immigrants  Booker has said he would lift Trump administration restrictions on immigration from majority Muslim countries and phase out the use of privately owned prisons  BETO O ROURKE O Rourke  a former U S  representative from Texas  has said  on day one of his presidency  he would use the executive power of the office to protect  Dreamer  immigrants from deportation and reunite families that have been separated along the U S  Mexico border  He would lift Trump administration restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim countries  O Rourke would also take steps to increase staffing to expedite the asylum process  make immigration courts independent from the Department of Justice and deploy up to 2 000 lawyers to the U S  Mexico border to provide immigrants with legal counsel  JULIAN CASTRO Castro  a secretary of housing and urban development during the Obama administration  has made overhauling the U S  immigration system a centerpiece of his campaign  The former mayor of San Antonio  Texas  supports immigration legislation providing a pathway to citizenship and permanently protecting DACA recipients from deportation  He says he would reduce or eliminate a backlog of 4 4 million waiting for visas in part by allowing spouses and children of permanent residents to immediately reunite with their family members in the United States  He would eliminate per country visa limits  end Trump era restrictions on immigration from majority Muslim countries and increase the admission of refugees  He would end the practice of deporting veterans who had served in the U S  armed forces and allow those who have been deported to return  He would overhaul ICE and direct CBP to focus on human trafficking  TULSI GABBARD Gabbard  a U S  representative from Hawaii and combat veteran  supports permanently protecting DACA recipients from deportation  She backed legislation that would remove per country caps on employment based green cards  She joined with Republicans to support a 2015 bill that would have added extra vetting requirements for refugees from Syria and Iraq  TOM STEYER 
Billionaire climate activist Steyer has donated millions to legal aid groups helping immigrants facing deportation  He has praised the contributions immigrants make to U S  society  NextGen  a liberal advocacy group he founded  states that  a system that depends upon the labor of immigrants  but fails to offer a path to citizenship  is inherently unjust  ",2019-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/factbox-democratic-us-presidential-hopefuls-seek-contrast-with-trump-on-immigration-2002020,2002020

145784,367299,ICE,Trump Threatens New Tariff  5 ETF Buying Zones,opinion,The global stock market is once again threatened by renewed escalation in trade war  This is especially true as President Donald Trump tweeted that he plans to impose a new tariff of 10  on the remaining  300 billion of Chinese goods  The new duty  which is expected to hike beyond 25  later  will be effective from Sep 1 and will levied on a long list of goods including smartphones  laptop computers and children s clothing With this  the United States will effectively tax all Chinese imports as another  250 billion in Chinese goods are already subject to a 25  U S  tariff  The new tariffs came as China failed to accept the U S  terms of buying more U S  agricultural products  read    The rounds of fresh tariffs will hurt U S  consumers  driving up the prices of goods  thereby curtailing spending  It will further impact worldwide economy and corporate profits  particularly at big U S  exporters  All these will continue to weigh on the stock market and could disrupt global supply chains Market ImpactThe Dow Jones and S P 500 dropped nearly 1  each while Nasdaq lost 0 8  following the tariff announcement  Crude oil also recorded the biggest drop since February 2015 as new China tariff will further weaken oil demand  Meanwhile  the prospect of worsening trade dispute raised chances of the Federal Reserve s loosening monetary policy again in September  As such  10 year and 30 year Treasury yields dropped to the lowest level since Nov 2016  read    As the broad stock market and many other corners felt the pain  the proposed tariff triggered a flight to safety  Given this  investors should stash their cash in some safe investing zones  We have highlighted them below and their ETFs Gold

outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis  While the dividend space has been crowded  ETFs with stocks having a strong history of dividend growth like VIG seem to be good picks  The ETF

An oil ETF was also  in the name of Pickens  The fund   NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF    intended to track an index by the same name and focus on companies whose performance positively correlates with that of ICE  NYSE ICE  Brent Crude Oil Futures 
Traditional upstream energy producers  supply side  as well as energy consumers  demand side  were the primary focus of the index  On the supply side were the Exploration   Production  Oil Services  Refiners  and Renewables industries while the demand side industries are Aerospace   Defense  Chemicals  Homebuilding  Metal Fabrication  Transportation  and Water 
Name   Objective Change 
However  the fund now trades as the Pickens Morningstar Renewable Energy Response ETF  and tracks the Morningstar North America Renewable Energy Index rather than the NYSE Pickens Oil Response Index   
Why the Change 
Despite hitting the market in February 2018  the fund has amassed only about  2 9 million in assets  To generate more assets  the fund also underwent an expense ratio cut from 0 85  to 0 65  
The underlying new index is a  rules based  modified equal weighted  liquidity adjusted index of U S  and Canadian listed common stocks of companies in North America that are leaders in the transition to a low carbon economy  Index constituents either derive significant revenue directly from renewable energy or green transportation products or services  or they meet a significant portion of their energy needs from    The index makes up about 97  of North America equity market capitalization  including large   mid   and small capitalization companies

Competition 
There are lot of clean energy ETFs available in the market  Invesco Solar ETF   LON TAN    which charges 70 bps in fees  has amassed about  443 1 million in assets  Apart from this  iShares Global Clean Energy ETF  NYSE XLE    which charges 46 bps in fees  is another product in the space that has gathered sizable assets   305 2 million   The newly transformed fund RENW has to compete with these long standing products in the space  RENW charges competitively and its expense ratio falls in between that of the two popular funds  read

145798,367313,ICE,The Energy Report  Wake Me Up When The Recession Is Over,opinion,"Wake me up when the recession is over  Wait  did I sleep through it  What happened to the inverted yield curve fears and all of the recession talk  The stock market is coming back and maybe  just maybe  fears of a recession may be off a bit because of record low unemployment and the fact that the yield curve inversion is being driven by U S  economic strength rather than weakness  With negative rates and dimming economic prospects overseas  the rush to park money in the U S  says more about concerns in Europe and Asia than it does about the U S  Yes  the trade war may be taking its toll  but you also have Brexit as well as bad economic policies in the EU that may be exasperating the slowdown  Oil demand that is at record highs in the U S  are more questioning of the recession talk and might actually start pricing in a shortage  U S  futures are in contango  signaling a tight market 
At the same time geo political risk is still out there  The Wall Street Journal reported that Yemen s Houthi rebels struck Saudi Arabia s Shaybah oil field  one of the kingdom s largest  Saudi officials and the Houthis said  deepening tensions between Iran and its rivals that have engulfed the region s energy facilities  The Houthis said in a statement Saturday that they had targeted Shaybah with 10 drones  The Iran aligned rebels said the attack was their largest of its kind on Saudi Arabia  which they have been fighting for control in Yemen since 2014  The Saudi oil ministry confirmed what it called a terrorist attack on Shaybah  which is owned by Saudi Arabian Oil Co   or Aramco  and holds about 14 billion barrels of oil reserves  A military spokesman for the Saudi led coalition in Yemen didn t respond to a request for comment  In a statement  Aramco said it had controlled a fire at a natural gas production facility at Shaybah  The company said there were no injuries and no disruption to the field s production of about 1 million barrels a day  A Saudi oil official and an Aramco executive said the Houthis were exaggerating its size  Saudi energy minister Khalid al Falih said  the attack was part of a series launched against the kingdom s oil infrastructure  including sabotaged oil vessels in the Gulf of Oman and damaged pipelines  
Yet there are those that insist that the sky is falling  Even OPEC  Reuters reports that OPEC delivered a downbeat oil market outlook for the rest of 2019 on Friday as economic growth slows  and highlighted challenges in 2020 as rivals pump more  building a case to keep up an OPEC led pact to curb supply  In a monthly report  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2019 by 40 000 barrels per day  bpd  to 1 10 million bpd and indicated the market will be in slight surplus in 2020  The bearish outlook due to slowing economies amid the U S  China trade dispute and Brexit could press the case for OPEC and allies including Russia to maintain a policy of cutting output to support prices  Already  a Saudi official has hinted at further steps to support the market   While the outlook for market fundamentals seems somewhat bearish for the rest of the year  given softening economic growth  ongoing global trade issues and slowing oil demand growth  it remains critical to closely monitor the supply demand balance and assist market stability in the months ahead   OPEC said in the report  It is rare for OPEC to give a bearish forward view on the market outlook and ICE  NYSE ICE  Brent Crude pared an earlier gain after it was released  to trade below  59 a barrel  Despite the OPEC led cut  oil has tumbled from April s 2019 peak above  75 pressured by trade concerns and an economic slowdown 
Gas Prices should uptick ahead of the Labor Day weekend  AAA confirms what we have been saying about demand  AAA says that  New data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  reveals demand for gasoline hit a new all time high record at 9 93 million b d for the week ending August 9  From the previous week  demand grew by nearly 300 000 b d to hit the highest level recorded by EIA since it began recording the data in 1991  In comparison to last year at this time  the latest demand rate is approximately 400 000 b d higher  The high demand level contributed to total domestic stocks falling by 1 4 million bbl to 233 8 million bbl  If demand increases amid falling stock levels in the week ahead  American motorists could see pump prices increase moderately ahead of Labor Day

145801,367316,ICE,California set to end private prisons and immigrant detention camps,news,"By Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES  Reuters    America s largest state prison system is moving to quit the practice of farming out inmates to lockups run under contract by private companies  following a nationwide decline in the for profit incarceration business  California Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign legislation this week designed to effectively ban private  for profit corporations from running prisons or immigration detention facilities  Sponsors of the measure say it will end a brief but hapless experiment in privately outsourced incarceration begun as a means to ease overcrowding   an endeavor Newsom branded an outrage when he took office in January   Bill supporters say private prisons  driven to maximize shareholder profits  lack proper oversight or incentives to rehabilitate inmates  and have contributed to a culture of mass incarceration by making it cheaper to lock up people  They point to research cited in a 2016 U S  Justice Department Office of Inspector General report that found private prisons spend less on personnel  and are less safe  than public institutions   This is a total and complete failure  and it s hurting and abusing Californians   said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta  a chief author of the bill   The facilities at stake are low security lockups operated by one of two leading U S  private prison companies  Florida headquartered GEO Group  N GEO  or Tennessee based CoreCivic  N CXW   Defending their business model  the companies say they provided a vital service when detentions in California s prisons more than doubled the system s capacity  sparking lawsuits that led to court ordered cuts to inmate populations   For 10 years  we provided safe  secure housing and life changing re entry programing for inmates that had faced extreme overcrowding   CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said  Separately  GEO Group cited its record as  an innovator in the field of rehabilitative services  and said the bill worked against the state s goal of lowering inmate recidivism  SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLES Inmate advocacy groups say the legislation does not go far enough  pointing to what they call significant loopholes  including an exemption for facilities that provide  educational  vocational  medical or other ancillary services  to inmates   I cannot think of any prison that does not provide those services   said Kara Gotsch  director of strategic initiatives for the Sentencing Project  a criminal justice reform group   Several states  including New York  Illinois and Nevada  have adopted similar bans on private prisons  and nearly half of all states have no such facilities  Gotsch said  The bill sets the stage for the three remaining private prisons in California  collectively housing about 1 400 inmates  to close four years from now  when their contracts with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation expire  Perhaps more significantly  the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   agency stands to lose four privately run detention facilities in California next year that hold roughly 4 000 people  unless the ban is challenged in court  ICE has not taken a public position on the bill  But assuming the measure were adopted  detainees would simply be transferred to facilities outside California  the agency said in a statement  The impact  would be felt almost exclusively by residents of California  who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody   ICE said  The average daily population at issue in those facilities accounts for less than a tenth of the 52 000 ICE holds nationwide  it said  SMALL FRACTION The bill  which secured its final passage by the state legislature last month  bans any new or renewed California contracts with private  for profit prisons  starting in January   Four detention facilities privately operated for ICE would be put out of business even sooner  when their contracts with the federal government expire next year  Bonta said  California had already been moving in this direction  terminating in June its contact with a privately run correctional center in Arizona   the last of several such out of state facilities   followed by last month s closure of a 700 bed facility in McFarland  California  near Bakersfield  The state s share of inmates in private facilities is a small fraction of its total prison population of nearly 126 000

145813,367328,ICE,Importance Of Secure Digital Asset Custody Rises As Market Value Hits  258 Billion,opinion,"The market for the secure storage of digital assets has grown exponentially in the past few years as more and more institutional investors begin to get involved in the industry  While European legislators have been slow to develop a regulatory framework around the provision of secure digital asset storage  many companies in the U S  are forging ahead with necessary developments to meet regulatory requirements 
However  despite improvements to technology for the secure storage of digital assets being made on an almost weekly basis  there remain many risks related to third party storage  Thefts  hacks  and other cybersecurity issues are an ever present threat to companies that provide digital asset storage and seldom a month passes without a new weakness being exposed 
For this reason  reliable digital asset custody is now more pertinent than ever  
Advancements within the industry
Many U S  based digital asset service providers like BitGo and Coinbase have recently expanded the scope of their custody services to meet the growing demand for modern services like   Coinbase Custody recently  holdings of up to  1 billion worth of digital assets under management as of May this year 
Even traditional financial service providers like Wall Street giant Fidelity Investments have begun adding digital asset custody to their list of services  The newly launched digital asset exchange Bakkt   developed by NYSE parent company Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  NYSE ICE      the Digital Asset Custody Company  DACC  this past April in order to meet its regulatory requirements 
These developments have put a spotlight on the need for improved regulatory measures and compliance procedures that meet with the demands of government agencies like the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   Many traditional financial institutions don t have the expertise required to sufficiently manage custody of emerging asset classes  creating a need for bespoke solutions to serve hedge funds  mutual funds  and RIAs 
Nowadays  a growing body of institutional grade custody solution providers is developing high class processes that meet legal and regulatory requirements  These include air gapped cold storage and multi signature methods that ensure private keys are held by several different parties and secure against single points of failure 
South Dakota  a safe haven for custody solutions
The U S  state of South Dakota has become increasingly popular amongst custody solution providers due to its fine balance of strict regulatory procedures and progressive stance towards modern financial technology   The state benefits from an open minded and innovative approach towards trust and security within the emerging digital asset and fintech industry while still maintaining a conservative legal position  
Due to the South Dakota Trust Charter  companies working with SD regulators are able to conduct business on a national level  Chris Dixon  a partner at investment firm Andreeson Horowitz  recently spoke of the advantages of South Dakota in an regarding the launch of custody solution Anchorage Trust   South Dakota is a leader when it comes to thoughtful  forward looking regulation  The entire ecosystem benefits when rigorous regulation meets an open mind for new technology and industry   he said 
The new company is being overseen by the South Dakota Division of Banking  a regulatory body that is becoming increasingly popular within the custody solution industry  The organization also provides high quality regulatory and monitoring services to popular and long running alternative asset custody provider  Kingdom Trust   which is based in Kentucky   
Just this month  offshore digital banking hub EQIBank  a new strategic relationship with Kingdom Trust for the provision of custody services to its clients  Launched in October last year  EQIBank was one of the first licensed and regulated offshore banks to offer support for both traditional and digital currencies  now serving over 100 000 clients throughout 180 countries  In an official press release  EQIBank CEO Jason Blick spoke of his enthusiasm for the new relationship 
 We re proud of our growing operational and technology relationships  of which Kingdom Trust is a welcomed addition   stated Mr  Blick   We are constantly seeking ways to improve our services to clients  and a secure and transparent approach to digital asset exposure has been something funds and asset managers have demanded  
Looking Ahead
The digital asset market is currently worth an estimated US 258 billion  which is minimal when compared with the US 100 trillion worth of value held in traditional assets  Issues with compliance as a result of immature custody solutions are often cited as a reason for the reduced flow of capital into the market 
Many of those involved in the industry believe there is a considerable amount of capital waiting to enter the market if compliance can be met  The potential profit this represents is a huge driving factor in the improvement of technology  with many companies like Coinbase Custody and Gemini generating revenue through a percentage based fee structure  However  some providers like Prime Trust are able to offer zero fees by simply turning a profit through interest earned on the assets held 
As the provision of custody for digital assets improves  we will likely see an increasing interest from large financial bodies which require a higher degree of legal compliance in order to enter the market  Companies that offer mutual and insurance funds often have some of the strictest compliance procedures  so many custody providers are working hard to create a secure enough environment to support these services ",2019-07-29,David Cullinan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/importance-of-secure-digital-asset-custody-rises-as-market-value-hits-258-billion-200446235,200446235

US Fed and Bank of Mexico are going to cut rates  Will the EUR MXN quotations grow 

This movement occurs with the strengthening of the euro and the weakening of the Mexican peso  On July 31  2019  the Fed meeting will take place  at which the rate is expected to decrease by 0 25  to 2 25   Market participants believe that the US regulator will not stop at this and will continue easing monetary policy  The last time the Fed lowered the rate in November 2008  at the height of the global economic crisis  Recall that the current level of the American rate is 2 5  with annual inflation of 2 1   Its decline can weaken the dollar and strengthen the euro  The next meeting of the ECB will be held only on September 12  2019  Eurozone GDP data for the second quarter and preliminary inflation for July may affect the dynamics of the euro  They will be released July 31  2019  On the same day  Mexico s GDP for the 2nd quarter will be published  The next meeting of the Bank of Mexico will be held on August 15  Theoretically  it can reduce the rate  which is 8 25  with inflation of only 3 95  in annual terms  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that the Bank of Mexico needs not only to control inflation but also to accelerate GDP growth  In his opinion  low lending rates could support this process 

On the daily timeframe EUR MXN  D1 rose to the resistance line of the downward trend  Various technical analysis indicators formed signals for improvement  Further growth of quotations is possible in case of positive macroeconomic news in the EU and negative   in Mexico 
The Parabolic indicator shows a lower signal  It can be used as an additional resistance level that must be overcome before opening a buy position The Bolinger bands  narrowed  indicating low volatility  The bottom line of Bollinger has a slope up The RSI indicator is below 50  It has formed a divergence to the increase The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal The bullish momentum may develop if EUR MXN will exceed the upper Bollinger line  the Parabolic signal and its last upper fractal  21 6  This level can be used as an entry point  The initial stop lose may be placed below the last lower fractal and the lower Bollinger line  21  After opening the pending order  stop shall be moved following the signals from the Bollinger and Parabolic to the next fractal minimum  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  21  without reaching the order  21 6   we recommend to cancel the order  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ICE  which belongs to the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry  posted revenues of  1 30 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 44   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 25 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ICE shares have added about 16 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for ICE 
While ICE has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ICE was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

145816,367331,ICE,Oil s Rising Again as Iran s Warning of War Ratchets Up Tensions,news," Bloomberg     The threat of war in the Middle East is pushing oil prices higher again  capping one of the most dramatic ever weeks for crude in which 5  of the world s supplies were cut by attacks on Saudi production facilities 
While Saudi Arabia s efforts to restore output and assurances that the world has adequate supply have helped temper some of the unprecedented gains in the aftermath of the attacks  prices are still up almost 8  this week near  65 a barrel  The U S  and Saudis say evidence points to Iran s involvement and the threat of retaliatory action against the Islamic Republic is keeping oil elevated  Iran s foreign minister warned that any strike would lead to all out war  
The ratcheting up of instability in the world s most important oil producing region has raised the risk premium for prices  which are almost  5 a barrel higher than before last weekend s attacks on the Saudi facilities  There s also prevailing concern about how long it will take the kingdom to fully restore lost production  as it depletes reserves to meet supply commitments and operates without its usual buffer of spare capacity 
 The market has taken Saudi reassurances on restoration of full production by the end of this month with a grain of salt  given the estimated extent of damage at Abqaiq   said Vandana Hari  founder and chief executive officer of Vanda Insights in Singapore   The mounting rhetoric between the U S  and Iran adds to the market s nervousness  but I see less than a tail risk of military conflict in the region  
Options traders have become the most bullish on Brent crude in eight years due to concerns over security of oil supplies  The unprecedented strike and cross accusations involving Saudi Arabia and Iran in the past week have driven up the price of one month benchmark calls to their most expensive relative to puts since March 2011 
Brent crude for November settlement rose 26 cents  or 0 4   to  64 66 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe Exchange as of 8 07 a m  in London  The contract is up 7 4  this week  the biggest weekly increase since January 
West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained 48 cents  or 0 8   to  58 61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  The American benchmark up about 7  this week  the most since June 
The global benchmark crude was at a  6 05 premium to the U S  marker for the same month  while the cost of prompt supplies of the London grade against later shipments increased earlier this week to the highest level since late June 
 Given the level of uncertainty into the weekend  prices could remain skewed to the upside   Stephen Innes  Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader  said in an emailed note

Brent crude increased 0 5  after its biggest weekly advance since January  Iran s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif refused to rule out war following plans for increased American troops and weapons in Saudi Arabia following attacks this month  he said in an interview with CBS  While the Saudis reiterated they will bring back all the lost production by the end of this month  consultants Rystad Energy and FGE are skeptical  while the Wall Street Journal reported repairs at damaged plants may take many months 
Saudi Arabia has said Iran  unquestionably sponsored  the attacks and the U K  said the Islamic Republic was  very likely  behind the strikes which knocked out about 5  of global supply and led to the biggest price spike on record  The U S  on Friday slapped terror related sanctions on Iran s central bank  The Persian Gulf nation has denied it played a role 
 Repairs at Saudi processing plants will take longer than expected   said Ole Hansen  head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A S in Copenhagen   Increased U S  sanctions against Iran and deployment of a few troops to Saudi Arabia have further raised the rhetoric on the Iranian side

145824,367339,ICE,Adrift in Iraq  Deportees from U S  describe fear and isolation,news,"By Raya Jalabi
BAGHDAD  Reuters    Since being deported from the United States in January  Hani al Bazoni has spent most of the past eight months in a small room in the Iraqi city of Basra  waiting for his sister s daily visits 
Some days  he says  he struggles to get up from his mattress on the floor  On others  he looks at pictures of his wife and seven children  all U S  citizens  his eldest is a cadet in the U S  Marines  his youngest is three 
 I am too afraid to leave the house   Bazoni told Reuters   I don t know anyone here and I don t have any money  
Bazoni is one of dozens of people of Iraqi origin deported from the United States since 2017  when Iraq agreed to take back its citizens with criminal convictions as part of a deal to remove itself from President Donald Trump s travel ban targeting people from several Muslim majority countries 
U S  congressmen  lawyers and human rights activists say Iraq  still riven by sectarian divisions 16 years after the U S  led invasion  remains unsafe for such returnees 
As a refugee in the 1990s  Bazoni moved to the United States  where he spent time in jail on assault charges  He also worked as a translator for the military  That job leaves him vulnerable in Iraq  where influential Iranian backed militias oppose the presence of U S  troops 
His family won t let him go outside  scared that paramilitaries might round him up 
Prior to 2017  Baghdad had refused to allow such repatriations  citing political  logistical and human rights concerns 
 I never thought I d come back to Iraq   Bazoni said   I lost my job  I lost my family  I lost my kids  And maybe soon  I m going to lose my life  
Following the 2017 deal  the U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   arrested hundreds of the 1 400 Iraqis eligible for deportation because they had criminal convictions  which would have prevented them from gaining U S  citizenship 
It said at the time it was arresting people with convictions for violations from homicide to drug charges who had been ordered removed by an immigration judge 
The American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU  sued on their behalf  Though initially successful in stalling deportations  the case was overturned after appeals  and deportations picked up in April 
ICE said 61 Iraqis were deported in the year to Sept  30  2017  and 48 in the following 12 months  The ACLU said it had been told by ICE that 30 Iraqis have been deported so far in 2019  Many of the more than 370 arrested since 2017 now await deportation 
 Deportees are treated with immediate suspicion  simply caused by their association with America   said Daniel Smith  a human rights researcher who has been an expert witness in dozens of deportation cases 
Some arrive in a country they haven t seen in decades  with no network  no identity documents and little Arabic  Their vulnerability leaves them open to accusations of spying  kidnapping for ransom and harassment from militias  Smith said 
Neither the authorities in Baghdad nor the White House responded to requests for comment for this story  The State Department referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security  The DHS and ICE did not respond to requests for comment 
 PERSECUTION  TORTURE OR DEATH 
In interviews with Reuters  nine men sent back to Iraq described their struggle to reintegrate  Separated from families and jobs  they said they were depressed  suicidal and feared for their safety 
Several claim mistreatment by ICE  which they said coerced them into signing deportation orders or stole money they were arrested with  ICE did not comment 
One of the men  Nash  55  who asked Reuters not to use his full name  said he spent two days sleeping on a bench in Baghdad airport with nowhere to go after his deportation  until a stranger lent him a phone so he could find a place to stay 
He found a roommate  Jimmy Aldaoud  a fellow deportee from Michigan  Both were from minority Christian communities  which the Trump administration has said it wants to protect 
Aldaoud was born in a Greek refugee camp to Iraqi parents and had never been in Iraq before his deportation  The 41 year old had mental health issues and diabetes  He died last month because he couldn t get access to care in Iraq  his family has said  He was buried in Michigan two weeks ago 
 There will be more Jimmy Aldaouds if this continues   said Congressman Andy Levin  a Democrat from Michigan who says the deportations violate U S  law and is seeking bipartisan support for a bill to stall them 
Levin s district has the highest number of Iraqi born residents in the country  eight of whom have been deported since April  his office said  Most deportees committed their crimes young  and signed plea deals they hadn t understood would get their green cards revoked  Levin said 
 Most of these people they don t speak Arabic  they were never in Iraq or haven t been since childhood  They re totally Americanized   Levin said   You re basically sending them back to persecution  torture or death  Our policy doesn t allow that  
Nash  who worked as a roofer  was convicted in 1989 on a petty drug charge  An immigration court found him deportable in 1994  and his green card was revoked  He earned several stints in prison in the ensuing years for non violent  drug related charges 
 NO IDENTITY 
Levin  lawyers and human rights activists argue that if deportations can t be halted  the U S  and Iraqi governments should at least give deportees proper documents 
Most no longer have their original Iraqi papers and said their U S  documents were taken by ICE in detention  Iraq allows them to be deported on one way travel documents  which last six months 
 These are not considered by local authorities to be an adequate proof of identity   said Smith  which he said meant they were left vulnerable to arrest by Iraqi authorities 
Iraq s Embassy in Washington referred Reuters to the ministry of foreign affairs in Baghdad  which did not respond to requests for comment 
Obtaining Iraqi documents is difficult  Some deportees have waited weeks  months and in one case more than a year 
Nash has hit multiple dead ends in getting a new ID  The travel document that allowed his return to Iraq expired last month  and his birth certificate was stolen 40 years ago 
 According to Iraq  I have no identity   said Nash   But I was Iraqi enough to be deported  
He said his efforts to obtain documents had involved digging through the rubble of his childhood home in Baghdad  tracking down relatives around the world on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and trying to find his father s grave in Baghdad 
He s running out of options 
 I am 55 years old  I spent 40 years in Michigan  I never left  how much more American can I be   he said   I made a mistake when I was a kid  and I got locked up before I got citizenship  so fine I get it 
 But if I can t be an American  at least let me be Iraqi  ",2019-09-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/adrift-in-iraq-deportees-from-us-describe-fear-and-isolation-1984649,1984649
145826,367341,ICE,Oil Drops as Investors Weigh Saudi Recovery Against Trade Hope,news," Bloomberg     Oil fell as investors weighed Saudi Arabia s quicker than expected recovery from the biggest attacks ever on its energy industry against prospects of a thaw in the U S  China trade war 
Futures dipped 0 7  in New York after sliding 3 7  over the previous two sessions  Saudi Arabia has boosted production capacity to more than 11 million barrels a day  beating its own target by about a week  and raised output to above 8 million  according to people with knowledge of the matter  U S  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a deal with Beijing could happen  sooner than you think   offering a glimmer of hope for global oil demand 
The attacks on two oil installations in Saudi Arabia knocked out almost 5  of global supply and are driving crude to its biggest monthly advance since June  However  prices are almost back to where they were before the Sept  14 strikes as the kingdom is restoring production and demand continues to be a concern  The prolonged U S  China trade war has already almost halved oil consumption growth   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   said earlier this month 
 Less than two weeks after the attacks on Saudi Arabia  the oil market has returned to business as usual   said Norbert Ruecker  head of economics at Julius Baer   Saudi has seemingly restored supplies faster than anticipated  and the oil market is shifting its focus back to the soft economy and stagnant oil demand

Trump said there is a  good chance  a trade deal can be reached  adding that Beijing is starting to make big purchases of items such as beef and pork  The tone toward China was vastly different earlier this week  with Trump accusing the Asian nation of currency manipulation  theft of intellectual property and product dumping during his speech at the UN General Assembly ",2019-09-26,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-drops-as-investors-weigh-saudi-recovery-against-trade-hope-1986896,1986896

145837,367352,ICE,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For ICE  ICE ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE    This company  which is in the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 77  
For the last reported quarter  ICE came out with earnings of  0 92 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 89 per share  representing a surprise of 3 37   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 92 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 94 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 17  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for ICE  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
ICE has an Earnings ESP of  0 36  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 1  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-ice-ice-200443324,200443324

On July 25  2019  the next meeting of the Central Bank of Turkey will be held  at which the rate may be reduced  Will the Turkish lira rate continue weakening 
On the USD TRY chart  the weakening of the lira looks like a rise  The main rate of the Central Bank of Turkey is considered a week repo  Now its rate is 24   It has been operating since last September  The rate of the Turkish central bank is significantly higher than inflation  which amounted to 15 72  in June in annual terms  Accordingly  some participants in the foreign exchange market expect a rate cut on Thursday at 11 00 GMT  Moreover  the spread of the rate reduction is very large  from 23 75  to 21 25  already at the end of this meeting  A number of investors believe that the rate will continue to decline at the September and October meetings of the Central Bank of Turkey and eventually drop to 17 5   Theoretically  this may contribute to the weakening of the Turkish lira 

On the daily timeframe USD TRY  D1 is in a downtrend  but the decline slowed down and various technical analysis indicators formed signals to increase  The chart failed three times to break down the 200 day moving average line  Correction to the top and further growth of quotations is possible in case of an aggressive reduction in the rate of the Central Bank of Turkey 

The Parabolic indicator shows a signal to increase 
The Bolinger bands  narrowed  indicating a volatility decrease 
The RSI indicator is below 50  It has formed a divergence to increase 
The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal 

The bullish momentum may develop if USD TRY exceeds the last two upper fractals  5 78  This level can be used as an entry point  The initial stop lose may be placed below the last two lower fractals  the Parabolic signal and the 200 day moving average line  5 56  After the opening of a pending order  stop shall be moved following the signals of Bollinger and Parabolic to the next fractal minimum  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  5 56  without reaching the order  5 78   we recommend to cancel the order  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

145841,367356,ICE,IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 29 billion  up 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 09  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ICE 
For ICE  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 36  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that ICE will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ICE would post earnings of  0 89 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 92  delivering a surprise of  3 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ICE appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intercontinentalexchange-ice-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200445191,200445191

145852,367367,ICE,Oil Market Gripped With Uncertainty Over Lost Saudi Production,news," Bloomberg     Oil markets are grappling with uncertainty over how long it will take Saudi Arabia to restore output after the devastating attacks that knocked out 5  of global crude supply 
As state oil producer Saudi Aramco grows less optimistic that there will be a rapid recovery after the strikes that cut the nation s output by half  investors are looking for clarity on just how bad it could be  Initially  it was said significant volumes could begin to flow again within days but Saudi officials later told a foreign diplomat they face a  severe  disruption measured in weeks and months 
 There s been a real shift in understanding how quickly that lost production is going to come back online   Ann Berry  a partner at Cornell Capital LLC  said in an interview on Bloomberg TV   The original reaction was that 100  would come back very quickly  now the outlook is going to be a lot more conservative than that  
The worst ever sudden disruption to global oil supplies continues to reverberate as geopolitical risk premiums jump on concern over instability in the Middle East and a potential retaliation against Iran  which the U S  has blamed for the strikes  Traders may not have fully priced in the impact of the supply losses  according to  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C  
The attacks  which damaged one of the Saudis  flagship fields and a key processing complex  triggered one of the wildest bouts of trading seen in oil markets  with Brent crude futures rising 19  in a matter of seconds at the open on Monday before posting their biggest ever single day advance  It was a more subdued start to trading on Tuesday  with both Brent and West Texas Intermediate futures edging lower 
State run producer Saudi Aramco lost about 5 7 million barrels a day of output on Saturday after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles struck the Abqaiq facility and the kingdom s second largest oil field in Khurais  Full recovery might not happen before the end of the year  keeping 1 million to 2 5 million barrels a day offline  according to Citigroup  Saudi crude inventories are in  more critical situation  than initially thought  the bank said 
While Aramco is still assessing the state of the Abqaiq plant and the scope of repairs  it currently believes less than half of the plant s capacity can be restored quickly  said people familiar with the matter  who asked not to be identified because the information isn t public 
Saudi Aramco is firing up idle offshore oil fields    part of its cushion of spare capacity    to replace some of the lost production  one person said  Aramco customers are also being supplied using stockpiles  though some buyers are being asked to accept different grades of crude oil  The kingdom has enough domestic inventories to cover about 26 days of exports  according to consultant Rystad Energy A S 
Customers are also preparing to tap strategic reserves if needed  President Donald Trump authorized the release of oil from the U S  Strategic Petroleum Reserve  while the International Energy Agency  which helps coordinate industrialized countries  emergency fuel stockpiles  said it was monitoring the situation 
The Japanese government on Tuesday said it was ready to cooperate with the IEA to release reserves if necessary  following a similar statement from South Korea 
The disruption surpasses the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi petroleum output in August 1990  when Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbor  It also exceeds the loss of Iranian oil production in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution  according to the IEA 
The market was relatively calm on Tuesday after the previous day s fireworks  when Brent surged by almost  12 a barrel  before settling just above  69 for the biggest one day percentage gain since the contract began trading in 1988 
Brent futures lost 73 cents  or 1 1   to  68 29 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange as of 12 30 p m  in Singapore  while  WTI fell 1 4  to  62 03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Brent is trading at  6 50 premium to WTI for the same month

145853,367368,ICE,Someone s Stacking Bets a Hard Brexit Will Make BOE Slash Rates,news," Bloomberg     Should a traumatic no deal Brexit force the Bank of England to slash interest rates in the months ahead  at least one investor will be laughing 
Money market traders have quietly accumulated more than 1 million derivative contracts that will pay off if the U K  central bank cuts rates by 50 basis points by September next year  These are call options that grant the right to take a long position in short sterling futures    and after record volumes changed hands this week  the size of the holding is now more than seven times this year s average daily turnover of such contracts 
The position was last boosted on Monday  when 323 000 calls were bought as U K  Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated he won t request an extension to the Oct  31 Brexit deadline  The purchase was part of a so called butterfly strategy  which involves buying options with two different target prices and selling those with a strike in the middle 
Overnight indexed swaps  commonly used to gauge rate expectations  are currently pricing in just 17 basis points of U K  rate cuts by the end of 2020 
The bet on big monetary easing comes just before this week s BOE meeting  the last one before Britain s scheduled exit from the European Union  For now  the central bank is seen keeping policy unchanged as it awaits clarity on Brexit  With time running out for the U K  to secure a pact to ensure uninterrupted trade and business  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has warned that the risk of a no deal Brexit is now  palpable  
Brexit Uncertainty
 I have been very surprised by the market s lack of desire to position for BOE cuts with conviction   said Peter Chatwell  a strategist at Mizuho International Plc  Brexit related economic uncertainty remains high with a new U K  EU trade pact still distant  while a recent pound rally has tempered imported inflation risks    these factors are boosting rate cut odds  he said 
The buyers of short sterling calls initially took positions in August targeting a 25 basis point rate reduction by the BOE  after Johnson took over as leader of the U K  s ruling Conservative Party and vowed the nation will leave the EU in October with or without a deal 
More allocations were added later  moving the target to a half point cut  Most of the bets expire in December    a day before the BOE s final meeting of the year    while the rest mature over March  June and September 2020 
It s the midpoint of the butterfly structure    what traders call the body of the fly    that shows the trade aims at large rate cuts  In Monday s transaction  middle contracts due September 2020 were sold at implied yields more than 50 basis points below secondary market rates 
ICE  NYSE ICE  exchange data for Monday showed two butterfly trades in short sterling futures  involving purchases of 223 000 call options expiring March 2020 and 100 000 contracts due September next year  Total call option turnover on short sterling futures hit a record of almost 1 5 million for the day 
The U K  central bank s benchmark rate is currently at 0 75   after a 25 basis point increase in each of the last two years  It was last lowered in August 2016    by 25 basis points    in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum  The pound has slid about 6  in the past six months amid increasing investor anxiety about a no deal Brexit ",2019-09-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/someones-stacking-bets-a-hard-brexit-will-make-boe-slash-rates-1981392,1981392

Futures gained 2 1  in New York after paring around half of Monday s 15  surge over the past two days  The Saudis asked Iraq s national oil company for as much as 20 million barrels of crude to supply its domestic refineries  Dow Jones reported  The kingdom s damaged Abqaiq oil facility is operating at around 40  of its pre attack levels and output should be fully restored by the end of the month  according to Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser 
The market remains on edge over concerns that Saudi Arabia s recovery from the attack will take longer than expected even though the kingdom has said it will honor its export commitments  There are also worries hostilities may flare again in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia said Iran unquestionably sponsored the strikes and U S  President Donald Trump plans to add  some very significant sanctions  on the Persian nation this week 
 It s an exaggeration that calm has been restored in the oil market  despite Saudi Arabia s assurances on supply  said Tamas Varga  an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd

Palladium quotations again approached the historical maximum  Meanwhile  the car sales worldwide is decreasing  Is XPDUSD correction possible 
Approximately 80  of global palladium consumption is accounted for by the automotive industry and the production of catalysts to reduce harmful gasoline engine emissions  Another 5  is consumed by the global chemical industry  As environmental standards tightened  the demand for autocatalysts increased and the price of palladium soared 3 times in the last 3 years  Now it has reached the psychological level of   1600   ounce for the 2nd time  Meanwhile  according to the estimates of the Association of European Businesses  the Association of European Automobile Manufacturers and a number of consulting agencies  sales of automobiles in the world decreased by 7 4  in 1Q2019 compared to the same period of 2018  The data for the first half of the year may turn out to be even worse  since according to official data  the decline in car sales in China in January May 2019 was 15 2   Note that after 3 fold growth of palladium quotations  its consumption has decreased in the jewelry and electronics industry  in dental prosthetic and in the issue of investment coins and bars  Theoretically  it is possible to increase the dependence of quotations on the state of affairs in the global automotive industry and the chemical industry 

On the daily timeframe XPDUSD  D1 adjusted down from the historical maximum  It overcame the growing trend support line  Decrease in quotations is possible in the event of a decrease in global demand and a continuation of the decline in the Chinese automotive industry

145870,367385,ICE,Upbeat Retail Sales Lift Silver Prices,opinion,"Gold ended lower on Tuesday as a rise in U S  retail sales contributed to a stronger U S  dollar  pressuring prices for the precious metal 
The upbeat retail sales number  however  also lifted prices for silver  brightening the metal s industrial demand prospects 
August gold trading on Comex GCQ19   0 30  fell  2 30  or 0 2   to settle at  1 411 20 an ounce  On Monday  the yellow metal booked its highest most active contract settlement since July 3  which saw a finish at  1 420 90 the highest since May 2013  FactSet data show 
September silver SIU19   1 92  meanwhile  picked up 31 1 cents  or 2   to  15 678 an ounce  the highest finish for a most active contract since late February  FactSet data show 
 Silver behaved more like an industrial metal  on Tuesday  buoyed by hopes of a U S  China trade deal and better than expected U S  retail sales numbers  said Chintan Karnani  chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants 
The move for gold  however  comes as the dollar strengthened  advancing 0 5   as gauged by the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index DXY   0 46  A stronger dollar tends to be negative for commodities priced in the unit  making them relatively more expensive to users of other currencies 
U S  stock indexes  the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA   0 08  and the S P 500 SPX   0 38  traded lower as gold futures settled  though traded not far from all time highs after the main benchmarks finished at records on Monday 
Market participants say that the backdrop of a strengthening dollar and bullish moves in stocks was keeping gold prices in check but its uptrend remains in force 
Edward Moya  senior market analyst at Oanda  said  gold s bullish outlook remains intact with short term resistance resting at the  1 500 an ounce level   in a Tuesday research note 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  in testimony before House and Senate lawmakers over two days last week  offered no pushback to market expectations for a rate move when policymakers meet July 30 31  analysts said  Lower rates are bullish for gold because it diminishes the competition between investing in the perceived safety of sovereign debt and bullion 
Among economic data Tuesday  U S  retail sales data revealed a 0 4  rise in June  but the cost of imported goods in June fell by 0 9   the steepest amount in six months  while industrial production last month was flat

145880,367395,ICE,Trump administration taps disaster  cyber funds to cover immigration,news,"By Andy Sullivan
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration is shifting  271 million earmarked for disaster aid and cyber security to pay for immigration related facilities  the U S  Department of Homeland Security and a leading congressional Democrat said on Tuesday 
The money  which was also set aside for the U S  Coast Guard  will be used to pay for detention facilities and courts for migrants arriving at the U S  Mexico border  DHS officials say they have been overwhelmed by a surge of asylum seeking migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America 
The Trump administration is seeking to circumvent Congress to move money originally designated for other programs  This will allow the administration to continue to house immigrants arriving at the border  part of President Donald Trump s promise not to allow them to await hearings outside of custody 
The administration plans to take  115 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency s disaster relief fund just as hurricane season is heating up in the Atlantic Ocean  according to a letter from U S  Representative Lucille Roybal Allard  who chairs the congressional panel that oversees Department of Homeland Security  DHS  spending 
Money will be taken for planned upgrades to the National Cybersecurity Protection System and new equipment for the U S  Coast Guard  the letter said 
DHS said Congress did not provide enough money for U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   to detain single adults as they wait for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge 
Congress appropriated  2 8 billion to pay for 52 000 beds this year  but ICE is currently detaining more than 55 000 immigrants  a record high  according to agency statistics 
Roybal Allard said DHS was exceeding its authority to move money around to respond to emergencies 
 Once again  DHS has ignored the negotiated agreement with Congress by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations   she said in a statement 
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  urged the Trump administration to reconsider the shift in funds 
 Stealing from appropriated funds is always unacceptable  but to pick the pockets of disaster relief funding in order to fund an appalling  inhumane family incarceration plan is staggering   and to do so on the eve of hurricane season is stunningly reckless   Pelosi said in a statement 
FEMA spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow said the funding reduction will not impact readiness efforts or other functions for which the money was earmarked 
Trump has made cracking down on legal and illegal immigration a hallmark of his presidency after campaigning in 2016 on a promise  so far unfulfilled  that Mexico would pay for a border wall to keep migrants from entering the United States 
A record setting 42 000 families were apprehended along the U S  southern border in July  more than twice as many as in May

145882,367397,ICE,Facing criticism over deportations  U S  to look again at some deferral requests,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration  facing criticism over deportations from lawmakers and civil rights groups  said on Monday it would reopen consideration of some deferral requests for compelling circumstances such as medical conditions 
In August  the U S  Citizenship   Immigration Services  USCIS  said it was  no longer entertaining  such requests from people outside the U S  military  but on Monday said it would reopen and complete cases that were pending on Aug  7  the day the new policy took effect 
The agency said it still believed it was appropriate to hand over responsibility for such work to Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE    enabling its own staff to focus more efficiently on other legal immigration applications 
Nearly 130 Democratic U S  senators and members of Congress last week sent a letter Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and Ken Cuccinelli  director of USCIS  protesting what they called a  cruel  and  inhumane  move 
 Individuals requesting deferred action from USCIS are among the most vulnerable  Children and families submit such requests due to severe medical conditions like cancer  epilepsy  cerebral palsy  muscular dystrophy  and cystic fibrosis   the lawmakers wrote   In many cases  the treatments are life saving  
They said letters sent out by USCIS in early August summarily denying the requests gave people 33 days to leave the country  and said they face forcible removal and denial of future visas if they did not comply 
The decision caused fear and confusion  the lawmakers said  warning it could force people to return to countries where lack of necessary medical care threatened their lives  They asked DHS  USCIS and ICE to answer a list of 14 detailed questions about the policy shift 
The agency sent out letters in early August informing those who had requested deferred action about the new policy  but providing few details on how to submit requests with ICE 
Deferred action is a discretionary determination to temporarily postpone the removal from the United States of a person who is illegally present  and occurs on a case by case basis  factoring in medical conditions and other circumstances 
USCIS said those denied requests that were pending on Aug  7 did not have removal orders pending  and had not been targeted for deportation ",2019-09-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/facing-criticism-over-deportations-us-to-look-again-at-some-deferral-requests-1968420,1968420

145884,367399,ICE,Hedge funds sell oil as global economy deteriorates  Kemp,news," John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst  The views expressed are his own   By John Kemp LONDON  Reuters    Hedge funds are becoming more pessimistic about the outlook for oil prices as trade tensions between the United States and China remain unresolved and global economic growth grinds to a halt  Hedge funds and other money managers were net sellers of petroleum futures and options last week for the fifth time in seven weeks  according to an analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges  Fund managers sold a total of 26 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts in the week to Sept  3  bringing total sales to 148 million barrels since mid July     Portfolio managers held a net long position of just 499 million barrels last week  only fractionally above the long term  structural  long position of 491 million barrels  As a result  funds have cut their dynamic net long position to just 8 million barrels  down from a recent peak of 420 million in April  and the lowest since February  In the most recent week  funds were net sellers of U S  gasoline   19 million barrels   U S  heating oil   4 million  and European gasoil   3 million   reflecting the deteriorating outlook for fuel consumption  Position changes in crude were a wash  with net purchases of Brent   18 million barrels  offset by net sales of NYMEX and ICE  NYSE ICE  WTI   18 million   Overall  the hedge fund community s positioning across the petroleum complex is now neutral to bearish  with concerns about the deteriorating economy more than offsetting production cuts by Saudi Arabia and its allies

145904,367419,ICE,GBP USD Technicals  07 05 19,opinion,"Slowing Services Sector In UK Bearish For GBP USD
UK s service sector expansion slowed in June  Will the GBP USD continue declining 
Economic data from UK were negative after the unrevised final reading of Q1 GDP confirmed economic growth was at the strongest pace since the third quarter of 2017  Purchasing managers index data released on Tuesday showed that UK construction activity suffered its sharpest downturn in over a decade in June  And a speech by Bank of England Chairman Mark Carney late Tuesday suggested that the bank might loosen the tightening bias of its monetary policy  At the same time Markit s Service PMI index declined to 50 2 from 51 in May  showing a slowing of expansion in services sector  Readings above 50 0 indicate expansion  Weaker UK data are bearish for GBP USD

The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal  it is below the signal line and the gap is narrowing 
The RSI oscillator is below the 50 level and has not breached into oversold zone yet 

We believe the bearish momentum will continue after the price breaches below lower boundary of Donchian channel at 1 2556  This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to sell  The stop loss can be placed above the upper Donchian boundary at 1 2640  After placing the order  the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal high  following Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the expected profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  If the price meets the stop loss level  1 2640  without reaching the order  1 2556   we recommend cancelling the order  the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account

Recent economic data from Australia were positive  Australia s retail sales rose in May and trade surplus hit record high  Retail sales rose by 0 1  in May after 0 1  decline in April  driven by stronger spending in restaurants and on household goods  Australia s trade surplus rose to a record A 5 745 billion in May following A 4 820 billion surplus in April  as exports rose by 4   while imports rose by 1

145908,367423,ICE,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE    a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  IntercontinentalExchange currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ICE that show why this owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ICE  shares are up 4 17  over the past week while the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is up 4 48  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 87  compares favorably with the industry s 0 72  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of IntercontinentalExchange have risen 13 69   and are up 19 89  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 29  and 9 96   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ICE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ICE is currently averaging 1 802 546 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ICE 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ICE s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 74 to  3 76 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ICE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep IntercontinentalExchange on your short list ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-intercontinentalexchange-ice-is-a-great-choice-200438027,200438027

Futures fell as much as 1 7  earlier Tuesday after U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC that Huawei Technologies Co  and other Chinese companies pose national security threats to the U S  They gained before the close amid analyst forecasts that U S  crude stockpiles last week fell for the first time in three weeks  a positive sign for the market 
 This is normal intraday volatility   Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email  The fluctuations may have stemmed from a number of reasons  from forecasts about the Department of Energy s weekly inventory report Wednesday to news flows on geopolitics to shifting of funds in and out of the futures market  he added 
Crude prices have been whipsawed this month amid conflicting indicators of whether the trade war will move toward resolution  Germany is preparing fiscal stimulus measures to head off the chances of a deep recession in Europe s biggest economy  while more Federal Reserve rate cuts are expected to shore up American growth

Huawei Move
While the White House s move Monday to delay sanctions on Huawei was seen as encouraging for the prospects of a trade deal between the world s two largest economies  The U S  added more than 40 affiliates of the Chinese company to a trade blacklist  Huawei said in a statement the reprieve doesn t change the fact that it has been  treated unjustly  
 The outcome of the next U S  China trade meeting will be the true litmus test for oil markets   said Stephen Innes  managing partner at VM Markets Pte  in Singapore   Oil traders don t want to race too far ahead of the economic realities of the trade war narrative  so a bit of profit taking is in order  
The Federal Reserve will hold its annual symposium in Wyoming later in the week  where Chairman Jerome Powell s remarks will be closely watched

145922,367437,ICE,Trump or Europe  UK s Johnson to sample post Brexit reality at G7 summit,news,"By William James and John Chalmers LONDON BRUSSELS  Reuters    Boris Johnson is about to feel the pinch of Brexit Britain s new global status  squeezed on one side by Europeans in no mood to yield  and on the other by a United States driving a hard bargain for its economic support  With a deepening political crisis at home  Johnson makes his international debut at a gathering of G7 leaders in the French resort of Biarritz on Saturday  less than three months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union  With no sign of an exit deal being agreed by then  the world s fifth largest economy is on course for a messy divorce from its biggest trading partner and looking across the Atlantic to President Donald Trump for a new trade deal and support  The three day meeting in southwest France will lay bare the new realities for Britain  collapsing influence in Europe and growing dependency on the United States  Neither is a comfortable position for New York born Johnson  who took office with a swagger last month promising Brexit by Oct  31 no matter what   The UK risks being stuck uncomfortably between a United States it disagrees with and a Europe it will struggle to influence   said Thomas Raines  head of the Europe Programme at London based think tank Chatham House  Ever since World War Two  Britain has tried to temper Europe s drive for integration with a so called special relationship with the United States  Brexit forces a departure from that strategy  Britain s exit from the EU is not on the agenda for the meeting  attended by the leaders of the United States  Britain  France  Germany  Italy  Canada  Japan and the EU  but is expected to feature heavily in discussions on its sidelines  With Johnson insisting on re opening a previously negotiated exit agreement that the British parliament rejected three times and that Brussels says cannot be reopened  a no deal Brexit is seen as an increasingly likely outcome  Both sides say they do not want it to happen  but will be prepared for that outcome  The EU insists Britain will be hit hardest and leaked British government  worst case  planning documents show possible food  fuel  and medicine shortages  UK EU  ICE  NYSE ICE  AGE  Short term disruption aside  Guntram Wolff  director of the Brussels based think tank Bruegel  said the long term implications could be even more damaging  isolating Britain from its closest neighbor   The real danger of a no deal Brexit   is the political implications  and for a long while there will be an ice age between the EU and the UK   Wolff said   Then Trump says  to the UK    I m your buddy    and potentially drives a wedge between the EU and the UK    Ahead of the G7 meeting Johnson travels to Berlin and Paris  having failed to break the impasse with a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk  British government sources said they did not expect a breakthrough this week  or at the G7   In Biarritz  the EU side will hold its ground on Brexit   said one EU official dealing with Brexit   We don t expect much to be agreed on Brexit there  even if some interesting exchanges may take place   EU sources said Brussels was instead waiting to see if Britain s parliament  where a small majority is also opposed to leaving the bloc without a deal  could force Johnson into delaying or halting the exit process  U S  ALIGNMENT In contrast  Johnson s pre summit phone call on Monday with Trump prompted an enthusiastic response from the U S  leader   Great discussion with Prime Minister  BorisJohnson today  We talked about Brexit and how we can move rapidly on a US UK free trade deal  I look forward to meeting with Boris this weekend  at the  G7  in France   Trump said on Twitter  Earlier this month senior Trump aide John Bolton visited London carrying a message from his boss that the United States would set aside foreign policy differences and focus on doing whatever it could to help Britain through the Brexit process  But  even though Johnson and other pro Brexit advocates argue that the United States will be a crucial ally for a Britain unshackled from EU trade policy  Trump s support is likely to come at a price  Britain has long been the United States  closest military ally  but its status as an influential player in the EU has also given it clout to diverge from Washington when it disagrees   something it has frequently done since Trump came to power   At the point at which it is leaving the EU  it finds itself much closer to the European position on most big issues than to the Trump administration  on climate change  on international trade  on the Iran  nuclear  deal   Raines said  That leaves Johnson caught between European and U S  thinking  He will need to avoid angering a volatile Trump and risking trade ties  but also to be wary of alienating himself from other leaders who have a more multilateral approach to world politics    Boris should not attempt to corral his fellow heads of government into a common line on every issue  nor set himself up as the go between for the U S  and Europe   former British foreign minister William Hague wrote in the Telegraph newspaper   
 Such efforts would be doomed to fail  for now at least  and more likely to end in ridicule than renown  ",2019-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-or-europe-uks-johnson-to-sample-postbrexit-reality-at-g7-summit-1959857,1959857
145923,367438,ICE,How Brazil and Vietnam are tightening their grip on the world s coffee,news,"By Marcelo Teixeira  Phuong Nguyen and Julia Symmes Cobb SAO JOAO DA BOA VISTA  Brazil  Reuters    A towering machine rumbles through the fields of Julio Rinco s farm in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo  engulfing whole coffee trees and shaking free beans that are collected by conveyor belts in its depths   This automatic harvester is one of several innovations that have cut Rinco s production costs to a level that few who use traditional  labor intensive methods can match   With increasing use of mechanization and other new technologies  the world s top two coffee producers  Brazil and Vietnam  are achieving productivity growth that outstrips rivals in places such as Colombia  Central America and Africa  They are set to tighten their grip  A plunge in global coffee prices in recent months  to their lowest levels in 13 years  has begun to trigger a massive shake out in the market in which only the most efficient producers will thrive  according to coffee traders and analysts  Rival producers elsewhere in the world are increasingly likely to be driven to the margins  unable to make money from a crop they have grown for generations  Some are already turning to alternative crops while others are abandoning their farms completely   Such shifts are almost irreversible for perennial crops like coffee  as the decision to abandon or cut down trees can hit production for several years   Brazil and Vietnam have had consistent increases in productivity  other countries have not   said Jeffrey Sachs  director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University  citing advances in mechanization  selective crop breeding techniques and irrigation technology  In Colombia and Central America  coffee is typically grown on hillsides where mechanization is more difficult  and hand picking cherries has kept production costs relatively high  The African sector  meanwhile  is dominated by small scale farmers often unable to raise the capital needed for new techniques  Rinco bought his harvesting machine for around 600 000 reais   155 600  and is paying the agricultural supplies company with coffee  delivering 400 bags a year over four years  This kind of bartering is common in Brazilian farming  One such machine in Brazil replaces dozens of people in the field  Even with financing and fuel bills  farmers and machine manufacturers say there is a reduction of 40  to 60  on harvesting costs    Beyond the lower costs  it made my life less complicated   said Rinco  relieved at no longer having the grueling task of hiring suitable pickers every year for the harvest at his farm in the Sao Joao da Boa Vista area    People don t want to pick coffee anymore  they go to town to find something else to do    Brazil and Vietnam now produce more than half the world s coffee  up from less than a third 20 years ago  and the proportion is rising  U S  Department of Agriculture estimates show  Leading producer Brazil alone accounts for over a third of global supply  In a clear sign of increased efficiency  it reported a record crop of 62 million bags last year and is expected to produce another record in 2020  the next on year in the country s biennial production cycle   despite the fact the coffee planting area has been falling for the last six years  Vietnam is also regularly setting production records while  by contrast  in Colombia the largest ever crop was harvested in the early 1990s and in Guatemala nearly two decades ago  USDA data shows   In countries such as Guatemala and Honduras  growers who are increasingly abandoning farms are swelling the ranks of migrants trying to enter the United States  Share of World Coffee Production 2018 19    BOOM IN BRAZIL Average yields in Brazil have risen sharply over the last decade with figures from the U N  Food and Agriculture Organization showing an increase of more than 40  to about 1 5 tonnes per hectare  Vietnam has also seen yields rise from already strong levels  climbing about 18  to around 2 5 tonnes  Colombia did show some growth  about 12   but remains well behind at about 1 ton per hectare while in Central America there was a decline of around 3  to a meager 0 6 tonnes  Businessman Alexandre Gobbi and two partners decided to enter coffee farming in Brazil four years ago  They bought an area in Sao Sebasti o do Para so  in the main producing belt in Minas Gerais state  and sought out state of the art tech  Today  his farm has equipment including an underground dripping irrigation system with artificial intelligence  considered the world s most advanced   It does almost everything by itself  Reads humidity levels  tells me when to add water and fertilizer and by how much   he told Reuters  pointing to the digital panels in his control room   With the system  plus other equipment including harvesters  he has doubled average yields to around 60 bags per hectare  and can make a profit even with current low prices  Arabica coffee futures on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures U S   the most widely used global benchmark for coffee prices  fell in May to 87 60 cents per lb  the weakest level since September 2005  Prices have since recovered slightly but remain at a level where few producers outside Brazil and Vietnam can make money       VARIETY IN VIETNAM Arabica beans  which provide a smoother and sweeter taste  constitute nearly two thirds of the world s coffee  More bitter and stronger robusta beans largely make up the rest of global supply  much of them hailing from Vietnam   A warehouse owned by Vietnamese coffee exporter Simexco Dak Lak Ltd in the town of Di An  near Ho Chi Minh City  illustrates the scale of Vietnam s coffee operation  Coffee is stacked in neat piles several meters high  awaiting export to Europe  The warehouse has enough capacity to store 20 000 tonnes during the harvest season   At the height of the harvest  having enough space to create an aisle to walk through the warehouse becomes a luxury   said Thai Anh Tuan  who manages one of three warehouses for Simexco  which exports over 80 000 tonnes of robusta a year   Every tiny bit of space will be taken up by these little beans   Tuan added   We have to hire additional warehouses nearby for extra storage    Tuan also credited the steady increase of Vietnamese coffee exports over the last four to five years to an increase in innovative farming techniques  including intercropping   growing different crops together   and the use of better technology in irrigation and cultivation  Coffee is still the key cash crop for Dak Lak  Vietnam s largest coffee producing province  although durians  jack fruit  mangoes and avocado trees have all been intercropped with coffee trees to maximize income in recent years  farmers told Reuters  Ksor Tung  a coffee grower with a 10 hectare farm  said intercropping coffee with durian trees resulted in better protection from direct sunlight and pests    Farmers here have experimented with intercropping for nearly a decade   Tung told Reuters   Peppers used to be the most popular tree when it comes to intercropping but for the past three years  with the prices falling  almost all farmers have turned to fruit trees instead   said Tung  adding that farmers who intercrop can triple their income per hectare       CRISIS IN COLOMBIA  Farmers in Colombia face a far different future  Battered by low prices and high costs  some are contemplating switching to other crops or selling up  despite tens of millions of dollars in government aid  Jose Eliecer Sierra  53  has farmed coffee for three decades but low prices have forced him to look at alternatives   Hass avocados and cattle among them   Avocados are in high demand abroad and it s one of the options   he said  standing amid some of his 41 000 coffee trees on a mist shrouded mountainside near Pueblorrico  in Antioquia province    Another very tempting option that people are thinking about is cattle   knocking down coffee trees and planting grass for cows   said Sierra  It is not the first time Colombian coffee growers have looked to other crops for a better living  Many in the south   sometimes under pressure from armed groups   abandoned it for the more lucrative coca  the raw ingredient in cocaine  though coffee has since rebounded  For some growers  even switching crops may not save them  Uriel Posada  who worked for more than 30 years as a house painter in the United States  dreamed of coming home to Colombia to grow coffee  Now his land is up for sale   I m up to my neck in debt   the 52 year old said  gazing up the steep hill where his 30 000 coffee trees are planted   Brazil has a huge advantage over us   the land is flat and they have machinery   Posada said   Here I have to pay a human being to go tree by tree  branch by branch and pick the red berries   Avocados and cattle are good alternatives  Posada said  but require start up funds and transition time that many local growers do not have  
 I ll sell  pay what I owe and go  End my Colombian dream     Marcelo Teixeira reported from Sao Joao da Boa Vista in BRAZIL  Phuong Nguyen from Ho Chi Minh City in VIETNAM and Julia Symmes Cobb from Pueblorrico in COLOMBIA  Writing and additional reporting by Nigel Hunt in London  Editing by Veronica Brown and Pravin Char ",2019-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/how-brazil-and-vietnam-are-tightening-their-grip-on-the-worlds-coffee-1960838,1960838

145939,367454,ICE,Middle East Tensions Perk Up Oil Prices  Here s How To Profit,opinion,Wall Street has generally been apathetic to the issue of tension in the Middle East but flaring up tensions between the United States and Iran  as well as Saudi Arabia and Iran has driven oil prices higher  U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery rose  2 89  or 5 4   to settle at  56 65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  the biggest daily gain since December  Brent crude  the global benchmark  was up 4 3  at  64 45 a barrel on London s ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures exchange  the highest since May 31 and biggest one day jump since Jan 9 Iran s Revolutionary Guard has claimed that they recently shot down a U S  drone near the Strait of Hormuz  Iran alleged that the drone had entered Iranian airspace  even though U S  military is adamant that it was in the international airspace  Moreover  Iran s Revolutionary Guard s claim came after U S  military informed of missile hit on one of Saudi desalination plants and stated that it is likely to have come from Yemen It goes without saying that while the Saudis and the United States are on one side  the Houthi Yemenis and Iran make up the other one  The tensions between the Saudis and Iran can primarily be attributed to the U S  sanctions aimed at reducing Iranian oil exports to zero level  Iran made quite a few attempts to evade such sanctions and even threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz if sanctions aren t lifted However  tensions in the Middle East were escalating over the past few weeks following the damage of two tankers from Saudi Arabia  one vessel from Norway  and one from United Arab Emirates by sabotage attacks between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman It was wrong of everyone to play down the gravity of the Middle East issue  After all  almost 22 5 million barrels of oil pass through the Strait of Hormuz each day since the beginning of 2018  which is roughly 24  of the world s daily oil production  So  any disruption can lead to supply demand disparity  eventually leading to elevated oil prices Talking about supply demand disparity  the Energy Information Administration reports show that U S  crude supply fell by 3 1 million barrels for the week ended Jun 14  Notably  OPEC s decision to convene on Jul 1 2 to review its pledge to curb production was also another factor that aided the price surge How to Play Oil s Northward Journey From bigwig oil producers to rig operators to pipeline owners to refiners  all witnessed their shares rally  which resulted in the broader S P 500 to close at a record high  Energy shares in the S P 500 index  collectively  were up 2 2   Lest we forget  that energy shares have been one of the poorest performers so far this year  but now this growing turmoil in Middle East will surely lure investors back into energy players As crude oil prices move north  prices of essential goods and commodities increase  And value of gold rises when inflation picks up  After all  it acts as a hedge against inflation  In fact  theoretically  more than 60  of the time  gold and crude oil have a direct relationship  Thus  with oil prices

After Cboe Global Markets discontinued its Bitcoin futures trading derivative in March  are crypto markets ready for an onslaught of Bakkt products  spearheaded by a new futures trading vehicle for the most popular cryptocurrency by market cap 

With the price of a single Bitcoin  trading at  10 801 at time of writing  having jumped more than 213  since mid January when the digital currency was trading as low as  3447 5  the answer might just be yes 
There s certainly a lot of fundamental activity helping to revive the formerly declining token  Bitcoin s resurgence could be attributed to a variety of geopolitical headwinds  a slowing global economy  even last week s news that social media giant Facebook  NASDAQ FB  is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency  Libra 
Bitcoin futures allow investors to speculate on what the price of Bitcoin will be going forward  without actually having to own any BTC  Many believe the cryptocurrency market dynamic as well as its demographics have shifted since the Chicago Board Options Exchange  Cboe  as well as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME  initiated their BTC futures trading instrument in late 2017 
Kirill Bensonoff  CEO of OpenLTV says 

 The market is a lot more mature now  driven less by FOMO  fear of missing out  and more by long term  strategic investing  

Bensonoff points out that there are also more institutional players now  He believes some of the current momentum is driven by the possibility that Fidelity  Bakkt and others are loading up on inventory ahead of future crypto market launches  He adds that Bitcoin is maturing as a  digital gold  asset 
As well  the CME released data showing there s increased interest in Bitcoin futures  They tweeted the following graph on June 18 




 CME Bitcoin futures  BTC  shows growing signs of institutional interest  BTC open interest rose by a record 643 contracts in a single day  establishing a new all time high of 5 311 contracts on June 17  26 555 equivalent bitcoin    250M notional  

Springboard for Higher Prices 
Bitcoin was trading at an all time high of around  20 000 when both the CME and the Cboe launched their futures products  At the same time Initial Coin Offerings  ICOs  were on the ascent  The expectation then was for all of these developments to play a significant role in legitimizing crypto assets by driving demand and providing a less risky way for new investors both retail and institutional to participate 
That s not exactly how events played out  By 2018 cryptocurrencies were in the doldrums  too many ICOs were discredited  and the crypto winter set in  It was more than a year before prices finally began to pick up  Could the beta launch of ICE  NYSE ICE  s Bakkt be a springboard for even higher prices  That s a difficult call at this point 
A number of hurdles still need to be overcome  including all important government approval  Earlier this month  Reuters reported that Bakkt still must secure a regulatory endorsement of its  custody warehouse  where the digital assets will be stored   That s key  Unlike both CME and CBOE s cash settled cryptocurrency futures products  Bakkt s contracts will be physically settled  meaning Bitcoin will be delivered to the Bakkt warehouse when the contracts expire 
On the upside  the crypto community has come to recognize that failure of ICOs had much to do with the absence of proper regulatory oversight says David Williams  chief technologist at BlockRules 

 BTC futures  especially in the U S   are in a holding pattern until the CFTC gives its approval  Small technical advances  including Bakkt s platform  won t have a significant effect on the market without appropriate regulatory acceptance  

What will be different about Bakkt s derivative  According to reports  its CEO has said they ve  worked closely  with the U S Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CTFC  as the instrument was being developed  As well  the product is aimed at institutional investors  merchants and retail investors  with a sample group involved in the beta test beginning at the end of July 
A daily and monthly contract settlement will be offered   Compared with previous options for BTC futures  Bakkt s product will settle in Bitcoin rather than fiat   says Williams 

 As a result  Bakkt investors will be operating inside the Bitcoin market  rather than outside of it  In contrast  CBOE s and CME s futures settled in fiat and played against Bitcoin s speculative nature for a quick return  Bakkt s customers will be institutional investors interested in cryptocurrencies as long term investments  ",2019-06-24,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-test-launch-date-set-is-the-market-is-ready-200433887,200433887
145941,367456,ICE,Brent Futures Steady  Nikkei Lags Behind,opinion,"US exports of pork to Mexico is declining  Will the LHOG continue sliding 
US exports of pork to Mexico were 232 392 metric tons in the first four months of 2019  18  down compared to the same time period a year ago  according to the US Department of Agriculture  Lower export demand is bearish for pork prices  At the same time the flooding in Midwest is expected to negatively impact corn and soybean crops  which are main feed for pigs  And tighter feed supply is an upside risk for hog prices 

On the daily timeframe the LHOG  D1 is falling toward the 200 day moving average MA 200  

The Parabolic indicator gives a sell signal 
The Donchian channel indicates downtrend  it is widening down 
The MACD indicator gives a bearish signal  it is below the signal line and the gap is widening 
The RSI oscillator is falling but has not breached into the oversold zone 

We believe the bearish momentum will continue after the price breaches below the lower boundary of Donchian channel at 76 65  This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to sell  The stop loss can be placed above the upper Donchian boundary at 86 06  After placing the order  the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal high  following Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the probable profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  If the price meets the stop loss level  86 06  without reaching the order  76 65   we recommend cancelling the order  the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account

145942,367457,ICE,Technical Analysis  GAS RUB  2019 06 26,opinion,"Against the backdrop of heat in the United States may increase the demand for electricity for air conditioners
In this review  we suggest to consider the Personal Composite Instrument  PCI  Gas vs Ruble  It reflects the price dynamics of US natural gas versus Russian ruble  Will the   quotations increase  
Such movement indicates that natural gas in the United States becomes more expensive  and the ruble is weakened  The Bank of Russia lowered its key rate at a meeting on June 14  2019 to 7 5  from 7 75   At the same time  inflation in Russia is 5 1   which is significantly higher than the target level of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation  4    The Russian regulator reduces the rate in order to maintain very weak economic growth and prevent capital outflow  Against the background of relatively high inflation and actual stagnation in the economy  this may adversely affect the ruble exchange rate  In turn  the possible growth of quotations of natural gas in the United States can contribute to an increase in demand for electricity for air conditioners during the hot weather in the United States  The agency Refinitiv predicts an increase in gas consumption in the US next week to 87 2 billion cubic feet per day compared to 83 4 billion this week  Another factor in favor of the growth of quotations could be an increase in the capacity of terminals for the export of American liquefied natural gas from the current level of 5 7 billion cubic feet per day to 7 4 million by the end of 2019 and to 10 million by 2020  At the same time  U S  Energy Information Administration does not expect further significant growth in US gas production  According to its forecast  on average for the entire current year it will be 90 6 billion cubic feet per day  Whereas production this week has already reached 89 9 billion 

On the daily timeframe GAS RUB  D1 moved closer to the resistance line of the downtrend  It must be punched up before opening a buy position  Various technical analysis indicators have generated upside signals  Further growth of quotations is possible if the demand for gas in the United States increases and the Russian ruble weakens 

The Parabolic indicator indicates downtrend signal  It can be used as an additional resistance level that must be overcome before opening a buy position 
The Bolinger bands widened  indicating high volatility 
The RSI indicator is below 50  It has formed a divergence to increase 
The MACD indicator shows a weak uptrend signal 

The bullish momentum may develop in case if GAS RUB exceeds the Parabolic signal  close the price gap on the daily chart and overcome the resistance trend line of the downward trend  150  This level may serve as an entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed lower than the last lower fractal and the minimum since April 2016  135  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  135  without reaching the order  150   we recommend to cancel the order  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

145951,367466,ICE,Oil Reverses Loss After China s Yuan Fix Soothes Investor Nerves,news," Bloomberg     Oil reversed a decline as China s central bank set the yuan fixing stronger than expected  calming investors after the U S  escalated the trade war by labeling the Asian nation a currency manipulator 
Futures in New York rose as much as 0 9  after being down as much as 1 8  earlier  China s currency fixing was weaker than 7 per dollar  suggesting officials want to slow the pace of declines in the yuan  The U S  Treasury Department made the manipulator determination Monday after Beijing allowed the yuan to weaken to the lowest level in more than a decade 
While the yuan fix provided some relief to investors  the world s two largest economies are still locked in a tit for tat spiral with no end in sight  That s pushed oil down more than 6  this month and eclipsed the threat of supply disruptions from the Middle East  Iran could step up its operations against tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz  the world s most important oil chokepoint  Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in Tehran on Monday 
 The U S  China trade war is worsening in every conceivable way   said Satoru Yoshida  a commodities analyst at Rakuten Securities Inc  in Tokyo   Even if tensions ease in one area such as tariffs  sanctions on companies or currencies  they may find another point of conflict

The rout for London traded futures picked up speed as Tuesday s session drew to a close  with Brent ending the day down 1 5  The global benchmark has now fallen more than 20  since a late April peak  meeting the common definition of bear market 
Prices slumped despite a modest rally in equity markets after the People s Bank of China moved to strengthen the yuan on Tuesday  The Trump administration had earlier declared the Asian nation a currency manipulator  opening the potential for even harsher impacts on global trade 
 We shouldn t underestimate the potential impact of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies   said Bart Melek  head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities   This could very well mean we as a market significantly overestimated demand growth for oil and we could easily be in a surplus situation in 2020  
Brent crude prices are down more than 9  this month as global economic worries eclipse the rising threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East  Iran could step up its operations against tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz  the world s most important oil chokepoint  Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Monday 
Brent for October settlement fell 87 cents to settle at  58 94 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe Exchange 
West Texas Intermediate for September delivery lost  1 06  or 1 9   to  53 63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI for October traded at a discount of  5 35 to Brent for that month  a gap that s narrowed markedly in recent days as trade fears undercut the outlook for global oil prices 
While the U S  Treasury Department s labeling of China is largely symbolic  with only modest potential punishments compared with the steps President Donald Trump has already taken against the Asian nation  it underscores the rapidly deteriorating relationship between the two nations

and exploitation of its largely immigrant work force  according to a federal lawsuit  Last August  Illinois based poultry supplier Koch Foods settled a multi year lawsuit brought by the U S  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  EEOC  on behalf of more than 100 workers at the Morton  Mississippi  plant over claims the company knew   or should have known   of sexual and physical assaults against its Hispanic workers  Mark Kaminsky  chief operating officer at Koch  said the company admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and maintains  after fighting the matter in court for more than eight years  that all the allegations contained in the lawsuit are false  The workers  complaints spanned 2004 to 2008  when the plant employed more than 500 people  They alleged that a manager would grope women from behind while they were working  punch employees and throw chicken parts at them  Workers also alleged that supervisors coerced payments from them for everything from medical leave and promotions to bathroom breaks  Privately held Koch Foods  run by billionaire Joseph Grendys  in court filings called the claims of abuse and harassment  baffling  and  outrageous   Kaminsky said a third party review of 9 months of 24 hour video surveillance at the plant found  absolutely no evidence  of their veracity  Koch said the plaintiffs made uncorroborated claims against the company as a means to obtain U S  visas for crime victims who collaborate with U S  authorities that would allow them to stay legally in the United States  The company settled the allegations last year by paying  3 75 million and entering a three year consent decree to prevent future violations  It agreed to implement new policies such as creating a 24 hour complaint hotline and publicly posting anti discrimination policies  according to the EEOC  Some workers at the Mississippi plant who lacked legal immigration status alleged in court documents that supervisors threatened to turn them in to authorities if they spoke out about their concerns  Former federal officials and immigration attorneys said mass deportation operations like the ones conducted by the U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   on Wednesday in Mississippi can have a chilling effect on future labor complaints   If workers are being threatened with being turned over to ICE  and then here comes ICE and arrests workers   people could be more reluctant to speak up  said John Sandweg  a former acting ICE director during the Obama administration  In the EEOC lawsuit  one Koch Foods employee without legal immigration status alleged that a manager sexually harassed his wife and made him pay to use the bathroom  once waiting until he had soiled himself to give him permission to leave his spot on the production line    If he found out that I had talked about anything that he was doing  charging money  the way he mistreated us  the dirty words he used  he told me that if I went to complain in the office that he had contacts in immigration   the worker said in a 2012 deposition that was filed as part of the suit   And that he knew where I lived   Maria Cazorla  a Cuban immigrant and lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the company that was wrapped into the EEOC case  said in an interview on Thursday that a manager inappropriately touched her and hit her then husband  also a co worker  in the ribs while he was working  According to Cazorla s interview and court documents  her husband at the time was targeted by management and fired over his immigration status after she filed her lawsuit against the company in 2010  Cazorla  now a U S  citizen  left the company and Mississippi and now renovates houses in Florida  She said immigrants are often fearful of reporting abuse   People are afraid to come forward because they think   What will happen if I say something  I ll be separated from my family  I ll lose my job    Cazorla said   They prefer to say nothing and suffer    The EEOC enforces federal anti discrimination laws and can investigate employee complaints  The agency tries to settle the claims but  if unsuccessful  it can file a lawsuit against employers for workplace discrimination  Marsha Rucker  EEOC Regional Attorney based in Birmingham  Alabama  who oversaw the lawsuit  said she did not believe the ICE action this week was connected to the EEOC s civil complaint  SCENES OF MASS ARRESTS  The dramatic operation on Wednesday was the biggest workplace immigration sweep since December 2006  when ICE targeted meatpacking plants in six states and arrested almost 1 300 people  Some children of workers were left traumatized by their parents  detention on what was for many the first day of school  according to local media reports   Government  please   an 11 year old girl said on a CBS News segment  weeping in front of a community center where she and other children were sent to spend the night   My dad didn t do nothing  He s not a criminal   President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration and said on Friday that actions like the one this week served  as a very good deterrent  to those in the country illegally   When people see what they saw   he said   they know that they re not staying here    ICE officials told reporters on a call on Thursday that they had released 303 people for humanitarian reasons   if they were pregnant or a primary caretaker of children  for example  Among those released pending a hearing before an immigration judge were 18  juveniles  who had been working in the plants  including one 14 year old  ICE said  Koch Foods said in a statement on its website dated Thursday that it was cooperating with the government s ongoing investigation following the ICE arrests  Koch said the Morton  Mississippi  plant employs more than 1 000 people and that the company is  diligent about its compliance with state and federal employment eligibility laws   The company has been the target of ICE work site enforcement in the past  In August 2007  immigration agents arrested more than 160 employees of a Koch Foods chicken plant in Fairfield  Ohio  and was fined around a half a million dollars  At the time  ICE said Koch Foods was being investigated for federal crimes including encouraging  inducing or harboring immigrants in the United States illegally  Koch Foods  which according to its website is not affiliated with Koch Industries or the Koch brothers  started with 13 employees deboning and cutting up chicken in one room in 1985  It now counts more than 13 000 employees and bills itself as one of the biggest poultry processors in the United States  with facilities in Alabama  Georgia  Ohio  Tennessee and Illinois  as well as Mississippi  
In a letter to the White House  the National Chicken Council   a lobbying group   said the poultry industry  uses every tool available to verify the identify and legal immigration status of all prospective employees   But it said there was no government system available to  confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in the United States  ",2019-08-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/allegations-of-labor-abuses-dogged-mississippi-plant-years-before-immigration-raids-1951299,1951299

billion of Chinese goods  In retaliation  China seeks to impose as much as 25  tariff on U S  imports worth  60 billion  effective Jun 1  Additionally  Trump has banned Chinese firm Huawei Technologies and 26 of its affiliates from doing business with American companies  though it has provided a 90 day exemption If speculations are to be considered  China is planning to strike back by imposing a ban on rare earth minerals export to the United States  The effects of this can be catastrophic for America as its manufacturers in major industries like defense  oil refineries and

145972,367487,ICE,Oil Bears  Who Needs Them When You Have Russia s Sechin ,opinion,"Forget oil bears on NYMEX and ICE  Meet a more potent one  Rosneft s  OTC OJSCY  Igor Sechin 
The chief executive of Russia s giant oil producer  which also happens to be the world s largest publicly traded petroleum company  could singularly do more damage to OPEC now than any crude short seller in New York or London 
As the Saudis who head the 14 member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries work quietly to convince the Russians to stay in their production cutting agreement for a third straight year  Sechin is demanding Moscow walk out or compensate his company 
Putin s Powerful Ally Denounces OPEC Deal
That s quite a dare against the government of one of the world s most feared leaders  Vladimir Putin  But Sechin himself is a close ally of the Russian president  and is often described as his  de facto deputy   He is in the inner circle of Putin s most conservative counselors and is leader of the Kremlin s Siloviki faction  a lobby gathering former security services agents  And Sechin has made it clear that he couldn t care less about the fate of the other nine non OPEC countries that Russia leads in its pact with the Saudis  the alliance collectively known as OPEC 10  His focus is all about protecting the interests of Mother Russia  To that extent  what he says resonates well with his government and country 
Said Sechin  according to Russia s Interfax news service 

 Does it make sense  for Russia  to reduce  oil output  if the U S immediately takes  our  market share  We have to defend our market share  

U S  crude exports  which had retreated in April after hitting a record high of 3 6 million barrels per day earlier in the year  had climbed again to around 3 3 million bpd two weeks ago  data showed  The Saudis have  meanwhile  been cutting production by record levels and pressuring an increasingly reluctant Russia to do more export curbs 
Sechin wants all these to stop as he can see U S  crude filling any vacuum left in the world by Rosneft and other Russian oil exporters  He could also not see any logic in Moscow agreeing to further cuts with the Saudis when Russian oil production was already at 3 year lows from a pipeline contamination crisis that resulted in just 10 87 million bpd being pumped June 1 3  from a May average of 11 11 million bpd 
This is not the first time Sechin has poured scorn on OPEC 10  he wrote to Putin in December to criticize the pact in a letter that was famously leaked 
Should he be rebuffed again  he wants Rosneft to be compensated for its losses in cutting production 

To OPEC  demands from Rosneft s CEO could not come at a worse time  If his words gain traction in Moscow and Putin does hesitate in making another deal with the cartel  that could open up another rocky period for oil prices like in Q4 2018  Already  crude futures are at four month lows  with West Texas Intermediate on New York s NYMEX looking likely to crack the  50 per barrel support while global benchmark Brent teeters just above the  60 floor on ICE  NYSE ICE   WTI lost 16  in May and Brent 11   Losses amount to as much as 20  or more if observed from the highs of April  officially putting oil in bear market territory 
To save the market from further collapse  the Saudis need the Russians 
Media reports quoting unnamed Russian sources have been circulating over the past two weeks that the OPEC and OPEC 10 meetings  originally scheduled in Vienna for June 25 26  were being moved to unconfirmed dates in July  The speculation was distressing enough for Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih to issue a strong but calmly worded denial at the weekend through an Arab News interview that there will be no change in the dates  Yet  talk of a postponement has persisted  with Tehran officially feeding the rumor mill on Tuesday after Reuters cited a letter quoting Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh of indeed disagreeing to the original June meetings  If true  the Iranian decision wouldn t be surprising given that the Saudis have been tacitly working with the U S  to try and shut down Iranian oil exports under the Trump administration s sanctions 
Trade War Worries Might Nullify Positive Impact Of Cuts
Even if the Saudis get another deal going with Russia  there s no certainty that oil prices will rally as much as they did earlier this year  due to the trade wars the U S  has with China and Mexico 
With summer in the northern hemisphere beginning in less than three weeks  strong refiner demand for gasoline has been surprisingly absent  Typically  fuel pumps in the U S  will be reporting strong sales at this time of year as the U S  driving season kicks into high gear  Crude oil inventories decreased by just 0 28 million barrels in the week to May 24  compared to a forecast draw of 0 86 million barrels  They rose by an average of 5 million barrels in the previous two weeks due to weak refinery runs  Preliminary figures for the week to May 31  issued by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday  suggest more bearish numbers  with a crude build of 3 6 million barrels 
Bloomberg opinion columnist Leonid Bershidsky  commenting on the Saudi Russian pact back in December  said cutting production only made sense if big price increases could be sustained  While OPEC 10 cuts had produced nearly 40  in gains at their highs  now there were less than 20  of those left 
Added Bershidsky 

 Neither Saudi Arabia nor Russia are interested in cutting production so that the U S  keeps increasing its own and becomes a competitor in global markets  ",2019-06-05,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-bears-who-needs-them-when-you-have-russias-sechin-200428504,200428504

145984,367499,ICE,Exclusive  UAE plans oil trade overhaul to boost Middle Eastern clout,news,"By Rania El Gamal  Dmitry Zhdannikov and Julia Payne
DUBAI LONDON  Reuters    The United Arab Emirates  state run ADNOC  long seen as one of the most conservative oil firms in the Middle East  plans an overhaul for its trading operations as it seeks to emulate the success of rival oil majors and bolster its regional influence 
The company has splurged on hiring former employees of private sector peers and wants to launch a regional oil benchmark  possibly this year  similar to international markers Brent and WTI  four sources familiar with the plans said 
The plan is not yet finalised and still has to be approved by UAE authorities  such as the Abu Dhabi Supreme Petroleum Council  the sources said 
ADNOC did not respond to a request for comment 
 ADNOC hopes the benchmark will allow it to earn more money and gain bigger prestige in the region  This all fits into a drive by  Abu Dhabi Crown Prince  Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed to turn the UAE into a regional leader   one of the sources said 
The UAE  the third largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq  pumps around 3 million barrels per day  It plans to boost output to 4 million bpd by 2020  Most of that oil is produced by ADNOC  based in the country s capital  Abu Dhabi 
For many years it has traditionally sold oil directly to end users  mainly in Asia  based on a retroactive pricing system rather than the forward pricing used by Saudi Arabia  Kuwait and Iraq 
Now  the company wants to launch full  in house trading for refined products and crude as part of energy sector reforms under Sheikh Mohammed and ADNOC Chief Executive Sultan al Jaber 
The reforms will seek to go further than those at Saudi state oil giant Aramco  which is also seeking to expand its trading operations to capture added value  the sources said 
For now  Aramco trades only oil products and non Saudi crude 
ADNOC is considering dropping destination restrictions on all of its oil and allowing it to trade freely on the open market  as part of a broader transformation to become more proactive and adaptive to market changes  the sources said 
 The idea behind trading is simple   the UAE sells its crude to someone like  BP   LON BP   which then takes it to the UK  where it is refined into jet fuel which then goes to refuel the UAE s Etihad planes   one source said  referring to the Abu Dhabi airline 
 So why can t ADNOC capture some of the value of trading and the supply chain  
TRADING TEAM
ADNOC is venturing into oil trading as part of an international expansion aimed at securing new markets 
In January  it signed agreements worth  5 8 billion with Italy s Eni and Austria s OMV covering refining and a new trading venture to sell refined products jointly 
Over the past year  ADNOC has hired a raft of ex Total traders  led by executive vice president Philip Khoury  The others include ADNOC s head of crude  Emmanuel de Reynies  head of products Lionel Richardson  and Jean Marc Cordier  Francois Chupin and Aegidia Schnepp 
Traders from other oil majors and trading houses also joined  including Suzanne Mullen  previously of BP and Citi 
 These guys know how trading works  how benchmarking works   one of the sources said 
ADNOC has held talks with French energy company Total and trading house Vitol as part of its new crude oil pricing and trading overhaul  the sources said  while beefing up its in house trading team 
Total and Vitol declined to comment 
One of the options is for ADNOC to team up with a large player whose worldwide storage facilities it would use 
ADNOC is in talks for a stake in Vitol s storage business VTTI  two of the four sources said 
VTTI owns storage in the Netherlands  the United States  Asia and Africa  In the UAE  VTTI holds storage in Fujairah  a bunkering hub where ADNOC sends most of its crude  bypassing the often troublesome Strait of Hormuz  which is further north 
CHASING BENCHMARK STATUS
Around a fifth of global oil supply transits through the Strait of Hormuz  Tensions between Iran and the West have contributed to fears of disruption there  sparking price rallies 
Inside ADNOC  there are growing views that the company could turn its flagship crude Murban into a regional and possibly global benchmark more popular among foreign buyers by using its ability to export and store oil away from the strait 
Murban is exported from Fujairah and is relatively insulated from possible regional unrest  three of the sources noted 
The Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline  with a capacity of 1 5 million bpd  carries the bulk of the UAE s crude production to ADNOC s storage and loading facilities in Fujairah  ADNOC is also building oil storage under the mountains of Fujairah  with completion due next year 
So far  most Middle Eastern grades including those of Saudi Arabia are priced off the Dubai Oman benchmark for Asian exports  off Brent related indices for European exports and various U S  indices for U S  shipments 
ADNOC may announce plans to launch Murban as a benchmark as early as November and is talking to a number of exchanges including Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME   the three sources said 
ICE and CME declined to comment 
One source said ADNOC had made it clear during discussions that it was prepared to remove all restrictions on oil resales  a key condition for a crude grade to become a benchmark 
Other key conditions for the success of a benchmark are stable and fairly large oil flows and a developed derivatives market  allowing hedging and forward trading 
 The fact that ADNOC wants to turn Murban into a destination free grade shows they are serious about making it a benchmark   a source said 
Soaring U S  production of predominantly light crude could help Murban  also a light grade  become a benchmark even though most regional grades are heavier 
 The global crude slate is getting lighter and hence Murban s role will rise over time   one of the sources said ",2019-07-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-uae-plans-oil-trade-overhaul-to-boost-middle-eastern-clout-1924546,1924546

145988,367503,ICE,Huawei executive says  concerned  about Canadians held in China,news,"By Steve Scherer
OTTAWA  Reuters    The Canadian unit of China s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd sought to distance itself from the actions of the Chinese government on Monday  with a top local executive saying the company is worried about two Canadian men being held by Beijing 
Canada s arrest of Huawei s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou   the daughter of the company s founder   stands at the heart of months of tensions between the two countries 
After she was picked up in Vancouver on a U S  arrest warrant  China detained two Canadian men and later charged them with spying  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the arrests and several Canadian allies  including the United States  are calling for their release 
 Obviously we re concerned  like all Canadians are concerned  about their well being   Huawei Canada s Vice President of Corporate Affairs Alykhan Velshi said when asked about the two men being held in China 
 This is a time of real tension between Canada and China  and it can only be solved by governments   Velshi told reporters in Ottawa  after announcing a partnership to furnish high speed 4G Internet to isolated communities in Canada s Far North 
Huawei said it would partner with ICE  NYSE ICE  Wireless and Iristel to provide high speed internet to 20 communities in the Arctic and 70 in rural and remote areas of Quebec by 2025  potentially reaching some 200 000 people living in those areas 
No financial details were provided 
Huawei also said it would include residents of the Far North in its plans to train 1 000 Canadians to install and use its technology  and that it would launch a major advertising campaign in movie theaters across the country featuring short documentaries about how high speed Internet is helping people in the Far North 
The Huawei announcements come amid diplomatic tensions and as experts in Ottawa are reviewing the security implications of 5G networks  including Huawei s participation  The United States put Huawei  the world s largest telecommunications equipment maker  on a blacklist in May  citing national security concerns 
Last week  Reuters reported that Canada was likely to postpone a decision on whether to allow Huawei to supply 5G network equipment until after the October federal election due to increasingly strained relations with Beijing 
Velshi said the characterization of the company s Canadian offices as  Dr  Evil s lair  where they are  toiling away at the latest world ending scheme  is false  Instead the offices are filled with  a bunch of engineers solving engineering problems   he said 
Instead  he said  Huawei has been supplying network equipment in Canada since 2008  and had some 1 100 employees nationally 
Referring to the 5G decision  Velshi said   We would ask for the government to judge us on our record in Canada  and for decisions to be made based on technology and not politics  ",2019-07-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/huawei-executive-says-concerned-about-canadians-held-in-china-1930678,1930678

farmer from Honduras  crossed the U S  Mexico border with her two sons late last year  They had fled after her political organizing led to threats of violence  she said  and intended to claim asylum  They were released on one condition  that they show up to immigration court when called  Carin said she made sure to check the mailbox regularly at the apartment in Colorado where they were living  In February  the first official letter arrived  It was not a court hearing notice  It was a deportation order   I said   Oh my God  and just cried and cried and then my sons were crying because we were all so scared   Carin said  She asked that her family s surname not be used for fear of damaging their asylum claim  Clerical errors and lack of notice are common in the U S  immigration court system  say immigration lawyers and former judges  Clerks are juggling a backlog of more than 900 000 cases and rely on numerous people to log information based on quick interviews at the border   For migrants  such problems can bring dire consequences  A missed hearing can lead to an  in absentia  deportation order  issued by a judge when a migrant fails to appear  Especially vulnerable are recently arrived families like Carin s who are listed on the fast track deportation docket  known colloquially as the  rocket docket   The U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   agency targeted about 2 000 people on this docket for arrest and deportation in recent operations  although only 18 family members were actually taken into custody  Carin said she learned only after hiring a lawyer that her case file had errors  Court documents  which were reviewed by Reuters  indicated that she had been served with the court hearing notice a day before the notice was even issued   an impossibility  Regardless  she said  she never received any notice  The U S  Department of Justice s Executive Office for Immigration Review  which adjudicates immigration cases  declined to comment  President Donald Trump s administration has said that immigrants are abusing the asylum process to enter the U S  and then skip court proceedings  allowing many to live indefinitely in the country   The overwhelming majority of claims are rejected by the courts  but by that time  the alien has usually long since disappeared into our country   Trump said in a speech last November   They don t care because they re in the country and nobody knows where they are   Striving to speed up the cases and deportations of recently arrived families  most of them from Central America  the administration created the family unit  rocket docket  last year in 10 U S  immigration courts  Of the about 64 000 cases filed on the docket  about 17 000 have been completed  Of those completed  more than 13 000 resulted in an in absentia removal order  Deputy Assistant Attorney General Joseph Edlow told lawmakers on Thursday  Federal officials repeatedly have said that people with removal orders have had their chance at a day in court  But migrant attorneys and advocates say that is not always true  For instance  two families were brought to the ICE family detention center in Dilley  Texas  last week after being arrested by immigration agents  according to Katy Murdza  advocacy manager at the Dilley Pro Bono Project  which provides legal services to detained families  Both families said they did not receive notice of their court hearings and neither knew they had removal orders  Murdza said   In the Hamptons on Long Island in New York  a Central American mother who crossed the border in December returned to her relatives  house last week to learn that ICE agents had come looking for her  her lawyer  Ben Simpson said   After calling the immigration court  she found out she had been ordered removed in April because she hadn t attended her hearing  But she had never received notice  Simpson said  adding that the woman had an appointment to check in with ICE later this month in New York City and had planned to attend  ICE did not respond to a request for comment  Immigration attorneys have been scrambling to reopen cases in which notice was not properly served  As a result of the publicity around the recent ICE operations  migrant advocates said more people know now to check if they have a removal order and to find legal help  That could potentially add to delays the government was trying to avoid   There are so many points along the way where there can be typos  so many opportunities for human error  especially when you add the lack of language competency at the border   said Rebecca Jamil  who was an immigration judge in San Francisco from 2016 to 2018  She said in her experience  the vast majority of people who missed a hearing did show up when given a second chance   People are not coming here to hide   she said  PROBLEMS UNDER OBAMA In 2014  the administration of President Barack Obama also expedited cases to deal with an influx of families from Central America seeking asylum   In a 2018 study  two immigration advocacy groups   the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project and Catholic Legal Immigration Network   said they successfully challenged the in absentia orders of 44 of their 46 clients on the docket   Among the reasons for the challenges  lack of notice and incorrect information provided by the government  as well as immigrants  language barriers  severe trauma or disabilities  the groups wrote  This month  the organizations updated a guide for lawyers so that more can challenge the deportation orders in court  The Trump administration ended the Obama era case prioritization in January 2017  saying it did not produce significant results  Then officials brought back their own version in November  The Obama era family docket required the first hearings to be scheduled within a month of the charging document being filed  The same is true of current family unit cases  according to guidance sent to immigration judges last year and seen by Reuters  But now judges are under greater pressure  to move cases along quickly  and have less discretion to give people more time to receive a hearing notice  find an attorney or file a complicated asylum application  Meanwhile  the acting director of ICE  Matthew Albence  told reporters on Tuesday that agents would continue to pursue not just the 2 000 people targeted in recent weeks  but any family with a removal order issued after the surge of migrants in 2014  There are  tens of thousands  of such families  he said  Carin s attorney Laura Maggio has filed a motion to reopen her case based on the erroneous dates in the government s documentation  which stalls her deportation  Carin carries a copy of that motion  along with all of the other paperwork she has received  everywhere she goes  For now  Carin s priority is making sure her sons Bryan  13  and Alan  12  stay in school

146000,367515,ICE,Trump adviser says currency intervention off the table  Trump less clear,news,"By Makini Brice and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration has  ruled out  intervening in markets to lower the U S  dollar s value  even though President Donald Trump is concerned other countries are weakening their currencies to gain a trade advantage  a top White House adviser said on Friday 
 Just in the past week  we had a meeting with the president and the economic principals and we had ruled out any currency intervention   White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC 
White House adviser Peter Navarro  a trade hard liner  presented Trump on Tuesday with ideas on how to devalue the dollar as a way to pressure China in an ongoing trade fight  according to a source familiar with the matter  confirming a Politico report  which said the president quickly dismissed the proposals 
Asked why he had decided not to act on them  Trump told reporters at the White House   I didn t say I m not going to do something  
Trump has publicly complained about the strength of the dollar  saying it hurts American competitiveness  but Kudlow disputed an assertion that the president wanted a weaker greenback  Rather  he said  other currencies should be stronger 
 I don t agree with your assertion that the president wants a weak dollar   Kudlow said   What the president is concerned about is that foreign countries may be manipulating their own currencies lower to try to gain some short term  temporary trade advantage  
Kudlow told reporters later on Friday that the president wanted a steady dollar 
Trump  in his remarks to reporters  suggested he welcomed the dollar s strength in so far as it is an emblem of a strong economy  even though it curbs U S  exports 
 The dollar is very strong  The country is very strong   he said   It s a beautiful thing in one way but it makes it hard to compete  
 We have a very powerful dollar     It s really become  more than ever before  the currency of choice   Trump added  citing weakness in the euro  He also said China s yuan was  very low  
In a tweet on Monday  Trump complained that it was  very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies   He has blamed the U S  Federal Reserve s interest rate policy for much of the dollar s strength and has been jawboning the central bank to cut rates at its two day meeting next week 
 The Federal Reserve raised the rates too fast and too soon   Trump lamented on Friday 
The central bank had been raising rates through the end of last year  and the substantial gap between U S  borrowing costs and those in other developed economies has been seen as a contributor to the dollar s strength  But  in response partly to what it sees as headwinds from Trump s trade policies  the Fed is now expected to cut rates for the first time in more than a decade 
In the last 12 months  the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  dollar index  DXY  has gained about 3 5   largely due to gains against the euro  EUR    On Friday  the index touched the highest in two months and was less than 0 5  from its strongest levels in more than two years

Getting Ready For The Bank Of Mexico Meeting
In this review  we suggest to consider the Silver vs  MXN personal composite instrument  PCI   It reflects the price dynamics of silver against the Mexican peso  Will the XAG MXN quotations grow 
Such dynamics means the rise in silver prices and the weakening of the Mexican peso  May 16  2019 will be the next meeting of the Bank of Mexico  According to futures quotes  the probability of a rate reduction exceeds 75   This can have a negative effect on peso dynamics  Inflation in Mexico is 4 41  in annual terms  which is above the target range of the Bank of Mexico  3  plus or minus 1    However  the current rate is almost 2 times higher than this indicator and is now equal to 8 25   It is expected to decrease to 8   In turn  precious metals are becoming more expensive against the backdrop of increasing global political risks and another exacerbation of the US Chinese trade war 

On the daily timeframe  XAG MXN  D1 adjusted to the top of a 6 month low  It approached the resistance line of the downward trend  which needs to be pushed upward before opening a buy position  Most of the technical analysis indicators showed an uptrend signal  Further growth is possible if high demand for precious metals remains and the Bank of Mexico rate decreases 


The Parabolic indicator demonstrates the signal to decrease  It can be used as a resistance level that must be overcome before opening a buy position 


The Bollinger  bands narrowed  indicating volatility decrease  The bottom line of Bollinger has a slope up 


The RSI indicator is above the 50 mark  It has formed a divergence to the rise 


The MACD indicator indicates a signal to increase 


The bullish momentum may develop if XAG MXN will exceed its last two upper fractals  the Parabolic signal  the 200 day moving average line and the upper Bollinger line  288 This level may serve as an entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed below the last lower fractal  the bottom Bollinger line and the 6 month minimum  276  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals to the next fractal minimum  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  276  without reaching the order  288   we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

It all started with the Trump administration raising tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10  to 25  on May 10 and China announcing a retaliatory move    a tariff hike on  60 billion worth American goods to 25   starting   President Donald Trump is also considering additional tariffs on an incremental  325 billion of Chinese imports  read    
Not only this  Washington has prohibited U S  firms from doing business with Chinese giant Huawei  citing national security concerns  On May 23  the U S  Commerce Department said that  to implement anti subsidy duties on products from countries that undervalue their currencies against the U S  dollar  another move that could undermine Chinese trade 
Fears for a prolonged trade war have raised concerns about an already softening global economy  As a result  the bond market is sending signals of a recession  The 10 year yield fell below that of the one year  2 33  on May 24  
Since bond yields react negatively to the prices  treasury bond ETFs should rally ahead in anticipation of a slowing U S  economy  As such  long term Treasury bond ETFs are trending up in month and will likely continue to do so at least for the near term

146025,367540,ICE,When the U S  puts a border between migrant kids and their caretakers,news,"By Kristina Cooke  Reuters    On June 12  Gerardo  a 41 year old indigenous bricklayer from Guatemala  appeared before a U S  immigration judge in El Paso  Texas  Since crossing the U S  Mexico border illegally two months earlier with his 14 year old son  he had been separated from the boy and forced to wait in Mexico for his hearing  Now  he had only one question for the judge   Can you help me get my son back   After they crossed into the United States  a border patrol agent declared the boy s photocopied birth certificate to be fake  casting doubt on their father son relationship  Despite Gerardo s protestations in broken Spanish  officers took the boy  Walter  away   Gerardo was sent to Ciudad Juarez  Mexico  to wait out his immigration court proceedings  with no idea where Walter was taken and no instructions on how to find him  according to Gerardo and his attorneys  who recounted the court appearance and circumstances of his case to Reuters  They asked that his surname be withheld because Gerardo fears for his family s safety in Guatemala  In a phone call to a cousin in Arkansas  Gerardo said  he learned that Walter was at a large migrant children s shelter near Miami  Separated from his dad  Walter later recalled   I felt like the world was crashing down on me   As a new Trump administration policy rapidly expands  family separations increasingly are complicated by a formidable barrier  an international border   Started in January  the policy known as  Migrant Protection Protocols   MPP  requires some migrants to wait in Mexico for their immigration cases to be processed  while others   based largely on border authorities  discretion   are allowed to wait in the United States  Under MPP  about 18 500 migrants have been returned to Mexico  Mexican officials say   For a graphic on the program  see   When children are sent north of the border and caregivers south  communication and legal coordination suffer  kids  emotional health can deteriorate and simply finding one another again can take weeks  according to about two dozen interviews with migrant families  their attorneys and advocates  case workers and researchers  as well as courtroom observations  Although a court last year halted the widespread  zero tolerance  separations of migrant parents and children at the border  U S  officials still separate certain family members there  They separate children from parents if they believe documents to be fraudulent  the parent has a criminal record  they can t prove parentage  or the child appears to be at risk  Officials also routinely separate children from non parent relatives with whom they traveled  including aunts  siblings and grandparents   an approach also followed during the Obama administration that is meant to stem child trafficking  This year  under MPP  border officials in some locations have been given the option to send such adults to Mexico rather than detain or release them in the United States pending their court hearings  The separated children are sent to U S  based children s shelters   A U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  official said that parents are not being separated from children due to the MPP program  and did not respond when asked whether they track children separated from other family members they had traveled with  The department s Customs and Border Protection agency declined to comment on Gerardo s case  citing privacy concerns  In general  the Trump administration has said that it is cracking down on fraud at the border   We believe  smuggling organizations  have been coaching individuals by saying if you come to the border with a child and you purport to be a family unit  you will not get detained and you will be released into the interior   said Gregory Nevano  assistant director at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   agency s Homeland Security Investigations    We are trying to save and rescue children   Nevano said  ICE officials said they interviewed 2 475  family units   purported parents and children  on the southwest border who  presented indicia of fraud  between mid April and July 5  Of those  352 were found to be falsely claiming parent child relationships  Attorneys and children s caseworkers say that when the caretaking adults are sent to Mexico  it s more difficult to contact them because they often don t have a fixed address  It s also harder for the adults and children to connect  The 1 800 number available online to locate children in U S  shelters doesn t work from Mexico   Meanwhile  younger children may not know the details of their asylum case or even the location of family members who might help or sponsor them in the United States  And in cases like Gerardo s  the geographic boundary can make it harder to identify and rectify a separation apparently made in error     PLEADING WITH JUDGES On Monday in El Paso  a Nicaraguan woman told an immigration judge she had been separated from her 5 year old daughter in mid May and sent back to Mexico  according to her attorney  Taylor Levy   The woman explained that she had become pregnant with the girl after a rape when she was 13  and so authorities listed the grandparents as parents on the child s birth records  She has asked to take a DNA test  Levy said  On the same day in San Diego immigration court  Reuters observed a Guatemalan man tell a judge he had been separated from his 15 year old son on May 3 and sent over the border   I came here because of the love I feel for him   he said   I m very stressed because of this separation   It was not clear why they were separated   Advocates say the United States does not appear to keep records on family separations under MPP  Cases usually come to light only when migrants come to court  often weeks after the separations occur  Most migrants sent back to Mexico have not yet had hearings    As far as I m aware  the government does not have any systems in place for tracking the parents and children they separate under MPP   said Judy Rabinovitz  a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union  ACLU   which is challenging the MPP program in federal court  Leah Chavla  a policy advisor with the Women s Refugee Commission in Washington  D C   said she knows of at least six cases of children separated from parents who were returned to Mexico   I am positive we are scratching the tip of the iceberg   Chavla said  She and other advocates said that when the validity of a familial relationship is uncertain  it makes more sense to let parents stay in the United States while the matter is sorted out  Referring to Gerardo s case   It s just so shocking how easily they separated him and sent him across the border   Chavla said   You d think they d do a little due diligence before that   As the MPP program expanded  staff of Jewish Family Service of San Diego started to notice more people calling in to their hotline saying they had been separated from family members  so the nonprofit formally added a question about this to consultations  In the past four weeks  the nonprofit said  it has seen 10 cases involving a separated family out of 40 consultations  including a grandmother who was separated even though she reported having legal guardianship of her grandchild and documents to prove it  Most were separations from non parent relatives and non biological parents  Two months ago  Karla  24  from El Salvador  was separated from her 11 year old sister and 14 year old brother after they sought asylum at the U S  border in Tijuana  Since their mother was murdered two years ago  she said  she has been their primary caregiver  In May  authorities dropped her off in Tijuana  and her siblings were transferred to children s shelters in the United States  She asked to be identified by her first name only because she fears for her safety in Mexico   We are alone in this world  we don t have parents   she said   I pray to God that we can be together again    Gerardo might have waited much longer in Mexico but for a stroke of good luck  Lawyers Haiyun Damon Feng and Erin Carter were in El Paso immigration court on the day he asked about getting his son back  With the help of the ACLU  they contacted a Department of Justice official who immediately intervened  On June 15  Gerardo was released into the United States  under the immigration system s version of parole  Walter was released last week and reunited with his father in Arkansas   
Authorities had apparently verified their father son relationship  his attorneys said  using the same documentation declared fake at the border three months earlier ",2019-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/when-the-us-puts-a-border-between-migrant-kids-and-their-caretakers-1920671,1920671

146027,367542,ICE,Trump says immigrant deportations to start this weekend in 10 cities,news,"By Nandita Bose WASHINGTON  Reuters    A nationwide wave of arrests of immigrants facing deportation will commence over the weekend  U S  President Donald Trump said on Friday  confirming that the plan  intended to discourage a surge of Central American migrants  was on track after a delay  The operation is expected to target hundreds of families in 10 cities that have recently been ordered deported by an immigration court but have not yet left the country   Trump revealed the operation on Twitter last month and then postponed it  It is unusual for the government to announce deportation operations ahead of time   People are coming into this country illegally  we are taking them out legally   Trump told reporters on Friday  calling it a  major operation  that would mainly focus on removing criminals  In a typical week  U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   arrests thousands of immigrants who are staying in the country illegally  according to government data  Most of those arrests are made without any advance publicity  The president  speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday  said he was not concerned that the advance notice could help targeted immigrants evade arrest   If the word gets out  it gets out   he said  Since Trump first spoke of the plan  a number of city mayors  nearly all Democrats  have repeated their long standing policies of not cooperating with ICE officials on deportations and have advertised helplines people can call to understand their rights  Democratic lawmakers  among others  have also sought to inform immigrants of their rights  telling them not to open their door for ICE unless agents present a court issued warrant  and not to say or sign anything before speaking with a lawyer  DETERRING BORDER CROSSINGS Trump  a Republican who has made cracking down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his administration  is trying to deal with a surge of mostly Central American families crossing the U S  Mexico border  Many families are approaching border officials to seek asylum  The latest planned arrests would follow widespread criticism of the crowded  unsanitary conditions in which immigrants are being detained along the southwestern border and concerns about children being separated from adults by border officials  In a hearing on the subject on Friday at the U S  House of Representatives  some Democrats said they feared the forthcoming arrests could result in more immigrant children being separated from their families  Elijah Cummings  the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee  asked a federal watchdog about its recently issued report saying detention conditions were below standards  Jennifer Costello  the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security  told the congressional hearing that the government was falling short in terms of  crowding  the prolonged detention  some of the hygiene that the children are supposed to have   Costello said it would be  impossible  to meet required standards under  the conditions that we saw there     It s shocking   she said  REPORTERS TAKEN INSIDE  Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to visit some of the criticized detention facilities in McAllen  Texas  on Friday along with journalists  who have generally been denied access to detained immigrants  Pence visited one overcrowded and foul smelling facility where almost 400 men are detained behind metal fences  some sleeping on concrete  after being accused of crossing the U S  border illegally  The Trump administration has increased pressure on the governments of Mexico and several Central American countries to stem the flow of migrants reaching the U S  border  Trump is to meet with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales at the White House on Monday for talks on immigration and security  Morales may sign an agreement with Trump declaring Guatemala a safe destination for asylum seekers  which could prevent many from applying in the United States  according to officials in both governments  Alongside these international efforts  Trump has sought to deter border crossings with highly publicized crackdowns in the United States  The operation that Trump said would start on Sunday is an example  ICE is expected to target families whose immigration cases were handled through an expedited court process that began in 2018  The agency has notified about 2 000 of those people that they face deportation because they failed to appear in court  acting ICE Director Mark Morgan said last month   Immigration rights activists have complained that in many cases immigrants  especially those involved in expedited hearings  do not receive proper notice of their court dates  ICE has declined to discuss the weekend s operation  including whether those families are among those being targeted  The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups sued this week to stop the arrests going ahead  asking a court to prevent the deportation of asylum seeking families who missed their court dates until they at least get a hearing  Mexico s government said on Friday that it would step up consular assistance for its citizens living in the United States  who may be affected by the possible migratory operations   but did not give more details

Crude tests Long term support

Crude declined further this week  testing Long term support at 60 59  Confirmation of a sell signal lies beneath that level  The expected period of strength only lasted until Tuesday  Since this is an inversion  it may show strength on the downside 

 OilPrice  Brent Crude futures prices for later this year suggest that the oil market is undersupplied  despite recent rises in U S  crude oil inventories that sent spot oil prices plunging in the past two days  Reuters market analyst John Kemp argues 
Although U S  commercial crude oil inventories have been rising in recent weeks  they have been doing so less than normal for this time of the year although U S  refineries have been undergoing heavy spring maintenance to be ready to process fuel in the fall and winter of 2019  just ahead of the new low sulfur requirements for shipping fuels  Kemp writes 
Oil prices plunged on Thursday to the lowest in a month after U S  government data showed on Wednesday that inventories hit their highest since September 2017 and production soared to another record level last week

Preparing for the meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia
In this review  we suggest considering the personal composite instrument  PCI  XAG AUD  It reflects the price dynamics of silver against the Australian dollar  Is there a possibility for the XAG AUD to rise 
Such a dynamic is observed in case of the strengthening of silver and weakening of the Australian dollar  The next meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  will be held on Tuesday  August 7  The probability of a rate cut to 1 25  from the current level of 1 5  is 40   Let us recall that both the real decline  and the RBA s statements about the intention to lower it  can have a negative impact on the exchange rate of the Australian dollar  An additional factor may be the aggravation of trade relations between the US and China after US president Donald Trump s unexpected announcement of a possible increase in import duties on Chinese goods  Because of this  the next round of trade negotiations between the two countries  scheduled for May 8  may be even postponed  Concerning the growth prospects of silver prices  there can be noted a reduction in world production by 2  last year and a continuing global shortage of this metal  An additional factor may be the alignment of growth rates of silver prices after their strong lag in comparison with more expensive gold  The gold silver ratio reached the high from October 2008  Relatively cheap silver strongly attracts jewelry buyers  In 2018  silver consumption by the global jewelry industry increased by 6  to 61 1 million ounces

After more than 10 hours of meetings in Vienna  OPEC ministers confirmed their agreement to extend existing production curbs for nine months  The decision  which needs to be ratified by non OPEC allies on Tuesday  comes as the International Energy Agency and other market watchers peg back forecasts for demand amid sluggish growth in China and India  At the same time  American shale production has set fresh records  putting the U S  on the brink of becoming a net oil exporter 
Adding to bearish sentiment  the U S  added new products from the European Union to potentially target with retaliatory tariffs  diminishing economic optimism stemming from the trade truce between Washington and Beijing  The U S  dollar also jumped by the most in more than 2 months on Monday  diminishing the appeal of greenback denominated commodities such as oil

The anxieties blotted out optimism despite Tuesday s agreement by major oil exporters to extend production cuts for nine months  Divisions remained over Saudi Arabia s push to target even deeper reductions  with Russia expressing doubts at the end of a summit in Vienna 
 There are concerns that demand might slow to where it overpowers supply   Bart Melek  head of commodity strategy at Toronto s TD Securities  said in an interview  The  gloomy  data  especially from China   is very much part and parcel of what we re seeing

Brent for September settlement declined  2 66 to  62 40 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe Exchange 
The drop in crude prices on Tuesday was an  anomaly   OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told reporters in Vienna 
Saudi Arabia said it would keep its output below 10 million barrels a day  even lower than required under the so called OPEC  deal  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said he was  enthusiastic  about the outlook for oil demand 
Yet Russia  the other de facto leader of the group  questioned a Saudi proposal to use the average of 2010 to 2014 global oil inventories to set future production targets  That move  a change to current policy  would require deeper cuts but achieve the higher prices the Saudis need to balance their budget 
The OPEC pact leaves the door open for U S  shale producers to grab more market share  as the group will have to cut deeper to achieve inventory targets  according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   The decision creates a clearer downside risk to the bank s forecast for Brent to average  60 a barrel next year  even though it could result in some shorter term price spikes 
The structure of the Brent crude market suggests investors may be losing faith that the OPEC  extension will be enough to stave off an oversupply  The premium of front month futures over the next month reached as little as 17 cents on Tuesday  compared with 43 cents early on Monday  A shrinking premium  or backwardation  indicates a weakening near term market ",2019-07-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-plunges-in-worst-reaction-to-opec-since-2014-on-demand-woes-1913778,1913778

PHNOM PENH  Reuters    Thirty seven Cambodian deported by the United States arrived in Phnom Penh on Thursday  32 of them refugees who fled during the rule of the genocidal Khmer Rouge in the 1970s or war that followed their ouster  an aid group said 
Thousands of Cambodian refugees started new lives in the United States after fleeing the Khmer Rouge s 1975 1979 reign of terror  in which up to 2 million people are believed to have been killed or died of overwork and starvation  and subsequent chaos 
Some of them  after spending most of their lives in the United States  are sent back to a homeland they hardly know after running afoul of U S  law 
 They   their families  actually   fled the terrors of the Khmer Rouge era and post   Khmer Rouge chaos  Many were born in Thai refugee camps   said Bill Herod  spokesman for the Khmer Vulnerability Aid Organisation  KVAO   a group that helps Cambodian deportees adjust after being sent back from the United States 
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has in the past criticized the United States over the deportations and accused it of breaking up the families of those forced to leave 
Thirty five of the 37 deportees were convicted criminals who were sent back to Cambodia via a U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   flight from Dallas  ICE said in a statement on its website 
ICE said it had increased the number of Cambodian immigrants it had deported from 2017 to 2018 by 279   There are still about 1 900 Cambodians in the United States who are subject to deportation  of which 1 400 are convicted criminals  according to ICE 
 All of them have served time in prison for felony convictions  Some come directly from prison  but most completed their sentences long ago and were living freely at the time they were detained for deportation   Herod said of the deportees who arrived on Thursday 
U S  President Donald Trump s administration has already deported thousands of people from Vietnam and Cambodia with criminal records as part of broader attempts to limit immigration to the United States 
The United States has been seeking to send thousands of immigrants from Vietnam back to the communist ruled country despite a bilateral agreement that should protect most from deportation   L3N1RN51W

146058,367573,ICE,Earnings Preview  IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 27 billion  up 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 94  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ICE 
For ICE  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 15  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ICE will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ICE would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ICE doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-intercontinentalexchange-ice-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200410956,200410956
146059,367574,ICE,Junk Bonds Continue To Lead U S  Fixed Income Rally In 2019,opinion,"Bloomberg s Nir Kaissar is no fan of high yield bonds  He warns that this slice of fixed income  is likely to be a drag on growth  for the risk portion of portfolios  while including them in non risk undermines safety  Neither option is appealing   Even worse  junk bonds don t offer much diversification  because they re highly correlated with stocks   he charges 
The crowd  however  thinks differently  or so it seems  based on the recent love affair with junk  Or maybe the market is simply ignoring the caveats in pursuit of what s considered easy money  Whatever the explanation  there s no denying junk s bull market of late  Indeed  high yield securities continue to top this year s rally among the major slices of the bond market  based on a set of exchange traded funds through yesterday s close  Apr  26  
SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond  NYSE JNK  is up a sizzling 9 2  so far in 2019  as of Apr  25    far above the 2 8  year to date gain for the broadly defined investment grade market  based on Vanguard Total Bond Market  NYSE BND   The only slice of investment grade bonds that comes close to JNK s year to date surge at the moment  long term investment grade corporates via Vanguard Long Term Corporate Bond  NASDAQ VCLT   which is up 8 5  this year 

In other words  the next best thing to matching junk s rally this year has required going far out on the curve for maturities in corporates  Indeed  VCLT s average effective maturity is nearly 24 years  according to Morningstar com   far above JNK s roughly 6 year average 
Longer term  JNK s return premium holds up nicely  or at least it has for the current trailing three year window  An investment in SPDR Bloomberg Barclays  LON BARC  High Yield Bond three years ago would have popped 23   well ahead of VCLT s 15  and BND s 6  

In the longer term  it s true that US equities have beat junk  but there s room for debate about the diversification benefits for high yield bonds  For perspective  let s switch to a pair of mutual funds that offer 15 year track records   JNK  by comparison  was launched in 2007   Vanguard 500  VFINX   an S P 500 index fund  earned an annualized 8 6  over the trailing 15 year period  moderately higher than 6 3  for Vanguard High Yield Corporate  VWEHX   based on Morningstar data through yesterday  Apr  25  
The correlation comparison  on the other hand  looks encouraging  Based on 1 day returns since 1990 through Apr  25  2019  the correlation for junk  VWEHX  vs  US stocks  VFINX  is a low 0 20  Note  too  that the 1 day correlation between junk and investment grade bonds overall   via Vanguard Total Bond Market  VBMFX    is also quite low at 0 36   Perfect positive correlation is 1 0  no correlation is 0 0  perfect negative correlation is  1 0  

The correlations move up when we use rolling 1 year returns since 1990  but as the next table below suggests there s still a fair amount of potential diversification meat on the junk bond bone 

Minds may differ on the wisdom of using junk bonds in a broadly diversified portfolio  but one thing is clear  the crowd s appetite for high yield fixed income securities remains red hot this year  The future is uncertain  of course  but with the Federal Reserve expected to refrain from additional interest rate hikes for the near term  perhaps even cutting rates at some point  it s not inconceivable that the crowd s love affair with junk could roll on 
If there s a risk to worry about with junk it s probably the economy  But with U S  recession risk low  there s a case to be made that the high yield market faces no obvious threat  at least based on the numbers published to date  with one key exception  valuation 
The yield spread in junk bonds has fallen sharply in recent years  courtesy of the bull market in prices for these securities  As a result  the additional yield in this market is below four percentage points  based on the ICE  NYSE ICE  BofAML Option Adjusted Spreads Index  That s close to the lowest level on record  since 1997   In other words  junk is priced for perfection and so a future that delivers less than perfect results is a potential hazard 
For now  however  the party continues ",2019-04-26,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/junk-bonds-continue-to-lead-us-fixedincome-rally-in-2019-200411543,200411543
146061,367576,ICE,Trump says immigration raids starting  fairly soon ,news," Reuters    President Donald Trump said on Friday mass deportation roundups would begin  fairly soon  as U S  migrant advocates vowed their communities would be  ready  when immigration officers come 
Trump  who has made a hardline immigration stance a key issue of his presidency and his 2020 re election bid  postponed the operation last month after the planned date was leaked to the press  but on Monday he said the roundups would take place after the July 4 holiday 
 They ll be starting fairly soon  but I don t call them raids  we re removing people  all of these people who have come in over the years illegally   he told reporters at the White House on Friday 
U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   last month said raids would target undocumented migrants who had recently arrived in the United States so as to discourage a surge of Central American families at the southwest border 
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump s statement 
ICE operations are expected to involve  collateral arrests  in which undocumented migrants not directly targeted by officers are picked up in raids 
Government documents published this week by migrant rights groups showed some past ICE raids had more collateral arrests than apprehensions of targeted migrants  Migrant rights groups say this general  looming threat to undocumented migrants is harmful to communities and the U S  economy  as it forces adults to miss work and children to skip school out of fear they may be picked up and separated 
 We have to be ready  not just when Trump announces it  because there are arrests every day and they have been increasing   said Elsa Lopez  an organizer for New Mexico immigrant and workers  rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido 
Migrant apprehensions on the southwest border hit a 13 year high in May but eased in June as Mexico increased immigration enforcement 
An increasing number of migrants are coming from countries outside Central America  including India  Cuba and Africa  The Del Rio  Texas  Border Patrol sector on Friday reported the arrest of over 1 000 Haitians since June 10 
Democratic lawmakers visited an El Paso  Texas  Border Patrol station on Monday and said migrants were being held in atrocious conditions  with women told to drink out of a toilet 
To  dispel  what he called  the misinformation   Chief Border Patrol Agent Roy Villareal put out a video showing fresh water available from a cooler and a faucet in a cell at a Tucson  Arizona  sector migrant processing center 
 We re not forcing aliens to drink out of the toilet   said Villareal  head of an area that in May apprehended nearly six times fewer people than the El Paso sector  a stretch of border that has borne the brunt of the migrant surge ",2019-07-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-says-immigration-raids-starting-fairly-soon-1916488,1916488

US President Appeals to OPEC
Oil quotations fell by about 3 4  after US President Donald Trump called on OPEC to increase production  Will the correction of WTI quotations continue 
From its last low on December  it was up 56   The local maximum was set on Tuesday  April 23rd  The main reason for such rapid growth was the decision of OPEC and independent producers to limit production from the beginning of 2019 by 1 2 million barrels per day  BVD   as well as US economic sanctions against Iran and Venezuela  In addition to Trump s statement  the outlined correction in world oil prices was aided by rumors that the United States could soften its sanctions against Iran in order to increase supply in the oil market  The main factor of correction may be signals of a slowdown in the global economy  Therefore  oil quotations can respond to macroeconomic data and forecasts in the largest consumer countries 

On the daily timeframe  OIL  D1 broke through the support line of uptrend  Most of technical analysis indicators have formed downtrend signals  A drop in prices is possible in the event of a slowdown in the global economy and an increase in oil production 


The Parabolic indicator gives a bearish signal 


The Bollinger bands expanded  indicating volatility increase  The top line slopes down 


The RSI indicator is below 50  It has formed a divergence to a decrease 


The MACD indicator gives a bearish signal 


The bearish momentum may develop in case oil will drop below its last minimum  62  This level may serve as an entry point  The stop loss may be placed higher than the last upper fractal  the Parabolic signal and the maximum since October 2018  67  After opening a pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal maximum following Bollinger  Bands and Parabolic indicator  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  67  without reaching the order  62   we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

3  for this year  down 0 2 percentage points from the previous expectation  This is the third cut since October and marks the slowest expansion since 2016  More than two thirds of the expected

WTI Brent spread vs  US crude oil exports

Energy
WTI Brent discount narrows  The WTI Brent spread continued to narrow yesterday  with the discount reaching US 6 68 bbl  levels not seen since August  The relative strength in WTI comes somewhat as a surprise given that US crude oil inventories have remained stubbornly high  both total US commercial crude inventories and stocks in Cushing  For Brent  OPEC cuts have tightened up the market  evident in the steepening backwardation of the Brent forward curve  Growing tension in Libya only adds further uncertainty to supply moving forward  Much further strength will likely weigh on US crude oil exports  In fact  US exports have already fallen from their weekly high of 3 6MMbbls d in mid February  a time when the WTI Brent discount was around US 10 bbl  to around 2 7MMbbls d in the last EIA weekly report 
Later today  the API releases US inventory numbers and market expectations are that US crude oil stocks increased by 2 5MMbbls over the last week  according to a Bloomberg survey  On the products side  the market is expecting to see a 2MMbbls and 1 5MMbbls decline in gasoline and middle distillate inventories  respectively 
Pernis refinery strike  The products market in Europe could find some support with strike action at the 400Mbbls d Pernis refinery in the Netherlands starting on Monday  Shell  LON RDSa  has confirmed that production will be affected whilst the trade union has said that production will be reduced to 65  of capacity  Strike action is expected to last until Wednesday evening  The ICE  NYSE ICE  gasoil crack has been under pressure since early March  trading from US 18 bbl to just over US 13 bbl currently   with ARA inventories moving back towards the five year average  However  prolonged disruption at the refinery would be supportive for the crack 
Metals
China iron ore inventory  Latest data from Steelhome shows that iron ore inventories at Chinese ports increased by 1 3mt over the last week and as a result  stocks have reached a six month high of 148 9mt  The inventory build up   11 1mt over the past two months  comes despite lower supplies from Australia and Brazil and suggests that demand is likely under pressure  with relatively low margins for steel producers 
However for iron ore supply  disruptions continue to arise  Rio Tinto  LON RIO  has confirmed a fire broke out at its screening facility at East Intercourse Island  which is part of its Dampier port operations in Pilbara  Operations have partly restarted at the facility 
WASDE report
WASDE report  The USDA is set to release its latest WASDE report later today  Expectations from the market are for US 2018 19 ending stocks to be revised higher from the March report  Corn is expected to see the biggest percentage increase  with the market expecting ending stocks to increase by 8  from the March estimate to 1 99b bushels  For the global balance  it is a similar picture  with the market expecting the USDA to increase ending stocks for corn  soybeans and wheat

Soybean Reserves May Decline In The US
The U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  lowered the forecast for US soybean reserves at the end of the 2018 19 agricultural season by 5 million bushels  Will Soybean prices rise 
In the April USDA review  the forecast for US reserves was lowered to 895 million bushels from 900 million bushels in the March review  The world soybean consumption in the 2018 19 season will amount to 349 1 million tons  which is 3 1  more than in the 2017 18 season  At the same time  an increase in world production by 5 3  to 360 1 million tons is expected  The difference will go to world reserves  The largest increase in soybean crop is expected in Latin America  Accordingly  prices may strongly depend on the weather in the region  The main factor for the possible increase in soybean prices is the mitigation of trade disputes between the US and China  At the end of January  China agreed to purchase 5 million tons of American soybeans this year and can significantly increase this volume  The next round of the US China trade talks took place last week  US President Donald Trump stated that he asked China to abolish all duties on American agricultural products  Trump expects a conclusion of the trade agreement with China in the next 4 weeks 

On the daily timeframe  Soyb  D1 approached the resistance line of the downward channel  Before opening a buy position  it should be breached up  A number of technical analysis indicators formed buy signals  The further price increase is possible in case of a reduction in world harvest and resumption of US soybean imports to China 


The Parabolic Indicator gives a bullish signal 


The Bollinger  bands have narrowed  which indicates low volatility  Both Bollinger bands are titled upward 


The RSI indicator is below 50  It has formed a positive divergence 


The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal 


The bullish momentum may develop in case Soyb exceeds its three last fractals and the upper Bollinger band at 918  This level may serve as an entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed below the last fractal low  the lower Bollinger band  the 200 day moving average line and the Parabolic signal at 889  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  889  without reaching the order  918   we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

146092,367607,ICE,Oil Keeps Rising as More U S  Sanctions Worsen Tension in Gulf,news," Bloomberg     Crude kept rising following its biggest weekly gain since late 2016 after President Donald Trump said he would impose  major additional sanctions  on Iran  exacerbating tensions in the oil rich Middle East 
Futures in New York rose as much as 0 9  after surging 9 4  last week  Trump tweeted about the sanctions  days after he abruptly called off a plan for air strikes against the Islamic Republic in retaliation for the downing of a U S  Navy drone  He also said he s willing to hold talks with Iranian leaders with  no preconditions  to ensure the nation never acquires a nuclear weapon 
After falling to the lowest level in almost five months in mid June  oil has rallied as escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran threaten to disrupt crude flows  Hopes that China and the U S  will restart trade negotiations have also aided prices  with Trump set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G 20 summit in Japan this week  There are as yet no details on the new sanctions on Iran  although the nation has managed to keep exporting some energy despite a U S  imposed ban from early May 
 The arrow is pointing upwards at the moment   said Michael McCarthy  chief market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney   Neither side wants a war here but there is national pride at stake on both sides   he said  adding that technical indicators were also pointing to further gains

Trump s decision to abort the strike on Iran may have prevented a war  for now  but fresh sanctions will increase economic pressure on Iran  possibly leading to more incidents  An attack by Yemen s Iranian backed Houthi rebels on Saudi Arabia s Abha international airport on Sunday with an explosive laden drone killed at least one person  state run Saudi Press Agency reported

Meanwhile  the Federal Reserve s signal that it s ready to cut interest rates and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi nudging toward unleashing more monetary stimulus have been buoying financial markets and improving the demand outlook for oil

On the daily time frame  AUD CHF  D1 has left the downtrend and moved upward  A number of technical analysis indicators formed buy signals  The further price increase is possible in case of the publication of positive data in Australia and negative data in Switzerland 

The Parabolic Indicator gives a bullish signal 
The Bollinger  bands have started to widen  which indicates low volatility  Both Bollinger bands are titled upward 
The RSI indicator is above 50  No divergence 
The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal 

The bullish momentum may develop in case AUD CHF exceeds its last high at 0 721 0 722 This level may serve as an entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed below the two last fractal lows  the Parabolic signal and the lower Bollinger band at 0 703  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  0 703  without reaching the order  0 721 0 722   we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

Lawmakers hurried to pass legislation before taking a recess next week  Their action follows an outcry over conditions at the border  Attorneys last week found more than 300 migrant children in an overcrowded Texas border patrol station  where they said some had been held for weeks in squalid conditions   additional reporting by Richard Cowan  editing by Chris Reese  James Dalgleish and David Gregorio ",2019-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senate-to-try-to-pass-border-aid-wednesday-mcconnell-says-1908329,1908329
146106,367621,ICE,In victory for Trump  U S  House Democrats back down on border aid bill demands,news,"By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    Democratic leaders in the U S  House of Representatives backed down to President Donald Trump and passed a  4 6 billion aid package to address a migrant surge at the U S  Mexico border without the additional protections for migrant children that liberals had sought  Trump  the Republican controlled Senate and moderate Democrats insisted on finishing the emergency aid bill as soon as possible  without further haggling over demands for greater migrant safeguards and reduced immigration enforcement spending  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  the top Democrat in Congress  said shortly before the vote that her colleagues were giving up their fight for now over changes to the measure  which had already passed the Senate   At the end of the day  we have to make sure that the resources needed to protect the children are available   she said in a statement   In order to get resources to the children fastest  we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill   The House vote was 305 to 102  with 71 out of 235 House Democrats voting against the Senate bill  The measure was then sent to Republican Trump for signing into law  Trump welcomed House passage of the  Bipartisan Humanitarian Aid Bill for the Southern  NYSE SO  Border   saying   A great job done by all    He also credited the Mexican government with doing more to curtail the flow of Central American migrants to the U S  border  Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his administration  but officials are saying a renewed crush of migrants at the border has strained resources  TRAGIC PHOTO SPURS ACTION A photo of two drowned migrants and reports of horrendous conditions for detained children have spurred efforts to craft compromise legislation to send to Trump before Congress adjourns this week for the Fourth of July U S  holiday  Pelosi and liberal Democrats had earlier planned to amend the Senate bill to set health standards for facilities holding migrants  establish a three month limit for any child to spend at intake shelters and reduce spending for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   agency  But with Congress headed for a recess  moderate Democrats joined the White House and Senate Republicans in urging Pelosi to accept the bill that had cleared the Senate with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote  as good enough  Additional pressure came from administration officials who said the money was running out and Congress had to act now  In an apparent concession to help win over wavering Democrats  U S  Vice President Mike Pence agreed in a telephone conversation with Pelosi that lawmakers would be notified within 24 hours after the death of a child held in U S  custody at the border  a source familiar with the conversation said  Pence also agreed to a 90 day limit on how long children would be permitted to spend in a border intake facility  Those two aspects were not part of the bill and have no force of law  The episode was a blow to Pelosi and her leadership  and exposed the deep divide between moderates and liberals in her caucus   Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  wrote on Twitter that the bill was a  blank check for the border w NO accountability   She added   Trump is not to be trusted with protecting our immigrants  Why must that even be stated  We need hard lines of protection  in ink    Border apprehensions hit their highest level in more than a decade in May  creating chaotic scenes at overcrowded border patrol facilities  Many of the migrants are either children or families  mostly from Central America   The conditions of children entering the country alone has become an issue in the 2020 presidential race  During a debate on Wednesday night  many of the Democratic contenders called for an overhaul of U S  immigration laws  and about 12 candidates were set to visit a Florida facility this week  A photo of Salvadoran father Oscar Alberto Martinez and his toddler daughter Angie Valeria  who drowned together attempting to cross the Rio Grande  added urgency on both sides of the aisle to reach a funding deal   DEPLORABLE  CONDITIONS Lawyers and human rights workers said they found sick and hungry children when they visited the Border Patrol facility in Clint  Texas   Many had been detained for weeks  one even up to a month in really horrific conditions   said Clara Long  senior researcher at Human Rights Watch   Attorneys representing migrant children filed papers in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday asking that the U S  government be held in contempt of court for  flagrant and persistent  violations of the terms of a 1997 agreement that governs the treatment of children in immigration detention  They requested immediate action be taken to remedy the  deplorable  conditions  The renewed focus on conditions on the border has also galvanized opposition in recent days to a Trump administration policy that sends asylum seekers to some of Mexico s most violent cities  In an open letter to Trump and other political leaders  a coalition of evangelical churches said it was  deeply troubled  by the policy it said left children vulnerable to violence and trafficking  as well as by reports of  inhumane  conditions in U S  federal immigration facilities  The Catholic diocese of El Paso  Texas  separately denounced a critical lack of shelter  food  legal aid and basic services for asylum seekers returned to Mexico under the program and  distressing detention conditions  in the United States before they are returned

  Oil is truly at the edge of a coin toss   said Abhishek Deshpande  head oil market strategist at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    There are two pretty strong binary events ahead of us that could pull in either direction  
Growing gloom over the economy spurred by the U S  China trade war snuffed out oil s rally in late April  It pushed prices down more than 20  before attacks on tankers in the Middle East reversed the slide  While Trump has threatened to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods  the expectation is he may agree to another truce  Meanwhile  most analysts expect the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend output cuts through December 
Despite that optimism  prices slid 1 6  in New York on Friday  After U S  futures reached a five week high earlier this week  some investors may be locking in profits or limiting exposure in case the G20 or OPEC  gatherings disappoint  said Gene McGillian  vice president at Tradition Energy in Stamford  Connecticut

Libyan tensions build  Conflict in Libya has escalated once again  with Khalifa Haftar in the east of the country ordering his troops to move towards Tripoli  which is home to the internationally recognised government  As of yet  the fighting does not appear to have led to a disruption in oil output  However  current events certainly increase the risk of possible disruptions  and are thus supportive for oil prices 
That said  Bloomberg reports that oil production at the Sharara oil field has risen to 293Mbbls d  after restarting operations in early March  The country s largest oil field was taken over by local tribesmen in early December

Looking ahead to this week  speculators will likely focus on the EIA s Short Term Energy Outlook on Tuesday  followed by the OPEC monthly report on Wednesday  and finally the IEA monthly oil market report on Thursday

146134,367649,ICE,U S  farmers experimenting with hemp as China trade war drags on,news,"By Julie Ingwersen and David Randall HAYSVILLE  Kansas  Reuters    A growing number of U S  farmers battered by low grain prices and the threat of a prolonged trade war with China are seeking salvation in a plant that until recently was illegal  hemp  A cousin of cannabis plants that produce marijuana  hemp is used in products ranging from food to building materials and cannabidiol  or CBD oil  which is being touted as a treatment for everything from sleeplessness to acne to heart disease  Interest in hemp picked up with the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill in December  which removed hemp from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration s list of controlled substances and put it under the oversight of the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   Unlike marijuana  industrial hemp doesn t contain enough of the psychoactive chemical THC to give users a high  The new rules call for the USDA to award hemp planting licenses to farmers but the agency has not yet regulated the process  meaning individual states are still issuing the licenses   Industrial hemp plantings this year could double from the 78 176 acres seeded in 2018  said Eric Steenstra  president of advocacy group Vote Hemp  In 2017  25 713 acres were planted on pilot programs authorized under the 2014 farm bill  The U S  hemp market is growing along with supply  U S  sales of hemp reached  1 1 billion in 2018 and are projected to reach  1 9 billion by 2022  according to Vote Hemp and the Hemp Business Journal  a trade publication  The profit potential is high  A good yield of food grade hemp  for instance  can net farmers about  750 per acre  said Ken Anderson  founder of Prescott  Wisconsin based hemp processor Legacy Hemp  Hemp seeds can be baked in to bread or sprinkled onto cereal or salads   That s a profit that blows corn and wheat and everything else out of the water   he said   By comparison  soybeans bring in  150 or less per acre  and sales of the U S  crop to China have fallen sharply since the onset of the trade war last year  Before they can cash in on hemp  however  U S  farmers must learn the science of producing an unfamiliar crop and wrestle with shifting regulations and other uncertainties   Nobody has any experience whatsoever   said Rick Gash  46  a businessman in Augusta  Kansas  who plans to grow his first ever hemp crop on a horse pasture on his old family property  NEW FRONTIER FOR REGULATION CBD oil  which is concentrated in the hemp plant s flowers  made up an estimated 23 percent of hemp sales in 2017  according to the Hemp Business Journal  While the USDA oversees hemp planting  regulation of hemp products mostly falls to The Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Though the agency has not approved food and supplements containing CBD  such products are widely available and the agency has done little to curtail their sales  Furthermore  the FDA mainly has jurisdiction over commerce between states  meaning products developed and sold locally in states that have more tolerant laws for hemp products is legal   To date  the FDA has only gone after people making aggressive claims   cancer treatment claims  AIDS treatment claims and the like   said attorney Jonathan Havens  former FDA regulatory counsel and current co chair of cannabis law practice at Saul Ewing Arnstein   Lehr  Other CBD products with no health claims or  soft  claims have drawn no federal enforcement  he said   causing many people to confuse availability with legality   The FDA said in a statement to Reuters it had developed a strategy to evaluate existing CBD products and create lawful pathways for bringing them to market  The agency knows some companies are marketing products containing hemp derived compounds in ways that violate the law but has prioritized those making unwarranted health claims for enforcement action  the FDA said   Our biggest concern is the marketing of products that put the health and safety of consumers at greatest risk  such as those claiming to prevent  diagnose  treat  or cure serious diseases  such as cancer   the agency said in the statement  CBD ICE  NYSE ICE  CREAM  Despite the uncertainty  analysts at U S  financial services firm Cowen   Co estimate that products with CBD as an ingredient will generate  16 billion in retail sales for humans and animals in the U S  by 2025  Companies are also making big bets  Kroger  NYSE KR  Co  the nation s largest grocery chain  said on Tuesday it plans to sell CBD creams  balms and oils in nearly 1 000 stores across 17 states   Unilever   LON ULVR  Plc s Ben   Jerry s ice cream chain said in a May 30 statement it planned to debut CBD infused ice cream flavors as soon as consuming the oil is  legalized at the federal level    In Kentucky  which launched a pilot program for hemp in 2014  farmers who used to grow tobacco are finding hemp grown for CBD oil to be a profitable alternative with a better reputation   When I was growing tobacco  everyone said I was growing something that s bad for your health   said Brian Furnish  an eighth generation tobacco farmer   It s fun to grow something that is making people feel better   Farther west  in the U S  midsection where farmers are more familiar with commodity crops like corn and wheat and have been more scarred by the trade war  some see hemp as a rotational crop grown on a larger scale for seed and fiber  rather than for its labor intensive CBD oil  EXPENSIVE SEED  HARVESTING BY HAND The Kansas Department of Agriculture began issuing licenses to growers this spring  allowing the crop to be cultivated in the state this year for the first time in decades       Jason Griffin  a specialist at Kansas State University  remains skeptical of the crop s potential and cringes when he hears descriptions like  gold rush  to describe it  Beyond navigating changing regulations  expensive seed is one of many challenges that pioneering hemp farmers will face  Special equipment for harvesting hemp may also be required  although some growers have been able to re purpose the combines they already own  The hemp plant s flowers are typically harvested by hand  while hemp for fiber is grown in fields and must be cut mechanically and dried in the field before storage  Farmers are particularly dependent on the end buyers of hemp  as there are few third party brokers to sell it as there are for other cash crops    You can t just go to the local grain elevator and ask what s your cash price for hemp grain right now   said Legacy Hemp s Anderson   He often cautions farmers not to plant seeds until they have a contract with a buyer because prices vary widely  Legacy Hemp signs contracts with farmers before the planting season  Other farmers are concerned over the long term prospects  Montana wheat farmer Nathan Keane is growing female hemp plants exclusively for CBD oil  starting in a greenhouse and transplanting each plant later by hand   
 Honestly  I think the CBD thing is going to be a bubble   he said   I will ride the wave   but I m really hoping the sustainability of hemp is going to be in the grain and the fiber  ",2019-06-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-farmers-experimenting-with-hemp-as-china-trade-war-drags-on-1897681,1897681

Futures rose 0 6  in London after climbing 3 4  in the past two sessions  The OPEC  coalition will probably meet in  the first week of July and that will secure the rebalancing the market as we strive for it   Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said Sunday in Japan  Meanwhile  the kingdom s crown prince joined with the U S  to blame Iran for the latest attacks on tankers near the Strait of Hormuz  according to an interview with Asharq Al Awsat newspaper

 With the U S  administration pointing the finger at Iran for the recent tanker attacks  the risk of further supply disruption remains elevated and should support oil prices   said Stephen Innes  managing partner at Vanguard Markets Pte in Singapore  Saudi Arabia s statement on further cuts should assure some investors that a deal may be near  he said

Futures in New York rose as much as 4 6   taking off on word that OPEC had proposed a mid July gathering with Russia and other partners after weeks of uncertainty over their plans  Speaking at a forum in Portugal  ECB President Mario Draghi said  additional stimulus will be required  if the economic outlook doesn t improve 
The OPEC  coalition  which pumps more than half the world s crude  has been bickering for a month over the timing of their meeting  even as output curbs that helped resurrect prices earlier this year near expiration  A meeting by the U S  Federal Reserve on Wednesday could further improve the market s outlook  if it follows Europe s lead 
 Tomorrow s Fed announcement after a two day meeting may set the stage for oil for the rest of the month   said Phil Flynn  senior market analyst at Price Futures Group   If they come off very dovish than oil should rally hard  
Prices got a further boost after the U S  and China said their presidents will meet in Japan next week to relaunch trade talks after a month long stalemate  They gave back some of the gains after a report that the White House explored the legality of demoting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  raising worries about political interference with the central bank

146154,367669,ICE,With Central Banks Downbeat On Economies  Market Remains Subdued,opinion," Thursday Market Open  Now that this week s Fed meeting is out of the way and there s not too much on the corporate earnings front  investors will likely be looking for international catalysts for stock market direction  such as news on the U S  China trade front or Britain s exit from the European Union 
With just a little over a week before Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc  the Bank of England voted to leave a key interest rate unchanged  The decision comes after the bank sharply downgraded its 2019 forecast for economic growth and as Britain s prime minister has asked the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline 
It was a similar situation on this side of the pond yesterday as the Fed held its key interest rate steady and downgraded its estimate for 2019 gross domestic product  providing an initial jolt to the market that ended up fading away  with the subdued sentiment continuing this morning 
The downbeat tune comes after comments by President Trump earlier in the week that he s prepared to leave tariffs in place on Chinese goods for a  substantial amount of time  continue to weigh on the market 
Seesawing Sentiment
Although sectors like Communication Services and Energy did pretty well Wednesday  Financials dropped more than 2   helping bring the whole S P 500  SPX  down a touch  Despite an initial bounce after the Fed announcement  the broad market benchmark couldn t hold on to gains 
On the one hand  investors appeared to be broadly pleased with the Fed s more accommodative stance  which has helped the market rally this year after tumbling late last year in part on worries that the central bank would be too hawkish 
In reinforcing its dovish view Wednesday with rates staying unchanged  a new dot plot signaling the unlikelihood of a rate increase this year  and the Fed saying it would end its balance sheet reduction program in September after a slowdown the central bank gave the market more to cheer about 
But like doves that quickly fly away after being released at a wedding  the celebratory mood dispersed as the afternoon went on 
The central bank s dovishness comes with a sobering assessment of U S  economic growth  as the Fed cut its GDP estimate for 2019 to 2 1  from 2 3  
Worries about slowing growth at home also dovetail with concerns about the global economy if the U S  China trade war can t be resolved soon  as well as a faltering European economy facing sluggish manufacturing and a big political unknown in the form of Brexit 
In fact  before the Fed decision Wednesday  U S  stock indices were in the red because of concerns about the U S  China tariff situation 
According to media reports  Trump said Wednesday that the U S  could leave tariffs on Chinese goods for  a substantial period of time because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal   Before then  there was hope that a deal might soon mean an end to or at least a cut in U S  and Chinese tariffs on each others  goods 
Results from FedEx  NYSE FDX   which reported weaker than expected earnings and sales and reduced guidance as it cited a weak international trade situation  underscored the trade tensions  as did pressure on China sensitive stocks like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Deere  NYSE DE  and semiconductor companies after Trump s comments 
Financials Falter
But it wasn t just trade issues that weighed on the market  Bank shares tumbled at the prospect of no more rate hikes this year and as the Fed also indicated that rates could be 50 basis points lower by the end of 2020 than it had forecast just three months ago 
Treasury yields dropped sharply after the announcement  with the 10 year yield falling to its lowest point in more than a year  And the yield curve between the 10 year Treasury and the 3 month Treasury flattened 
Lower interest rate environments can make it harder for banks to earn money on loans  And a flattening yield curve can make for a shrinking profit margin between what banks earn on their longer term loans compared with what they pay in shorter term rates on deposits 
Energy Shines
Energy was a bright spot for bulls on Wednesday  Energy shares rose nearly 0 9  as crude oil prices rallied after government data showed U S  oil stockpiles plunged by 9 6 million barrels in the week through Friday  A Reuters survey of analysts had been expecting a build  CNBC reported  U S  crude oil inventories are about 2  below the five year average for this time of year  the government said  and gasoline inventories also fell pretty dramatically 
The U S  inventory decline comes amid production cuts by OPEC and U S  sanctions against Iran and Venezuela  A weakening in the U S  dollar also seems to be helping oil prices  Since oil is priced in dollars  a weakening greenback can help boost demand by making crude cheaper in terms of foreign currencies 

Dollar Down  The buck pulled back sharply against a basket of other currencies on Wednesday as the Fed doubled down on its dovish monetary policy stance and sounded pessimistic on U S  economic growth  Data Source  ICE  NYSE ICE   Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
The Dollar and the Fed  As the Fed solidified its dovish stance on Wednesday  one ripple in the global economy was a weakening U S  dollar  The buck sank sharply against a basket of other currencies on Wednesday after the Fed announcement   See chart above   Why might that be given that we re in a relatively low inflation environment that wouldn t seem to be a threat to the value of the buck  Well  for one  the Fed talked about slowing growth in the U S  economy  which would pressure the dollar by lessening demand for goods and services in the world s largest economy  Also  stagnant to lower interest rates can mean that foreign investors turn elsewhere for yield  It s possible that some dollar investors and traders had been holding back from selling to wait and see just how dovish the Fed might be  And with the central bank underscoring its commitment to easier policy  perhaps they decided now was a good time to unload some of their dollar holdings 
Digging Into Factory Orders  Although the headline figure for factory orders was slightly disappointing Tuesday  there were still some bright spots in the underlying data that point to decent economic activity  Overall  January factory orders rose 0 1   slightly below the Briefing com consensus expectation of a 0 2  gain  But new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 0 8   which according to Briefing com is evidence that business investment picked up  Shipments of those same type of goods also increased by 0 8   a boon for Q1 gross domestic product forecasts  Briefing com said 
Mortgages on Main Street  Even with all of Wall Street s focus on the global economy  it can be hard for the average Joe and Jill on Main Street to understand how all of that affects them here at home  One of the places where international high finance and hometown issues come to a crossroads is when it comes to borrowing money for a home  As Joel Kan  associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting with the Mortgage Bankers Association  put it in the group s press release accompanying its weekly mortgage application survey yesterday   Mortgage rates declined once again  as concerns about the slowing global economy and status of Brexit continued to drive investors  demand for U S  Treasuries  ultimately pushing yields lower

146177,367692,ICE,High yield junk market still attractive  top bond manager Margaret Patel,news,"By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK  Reuters    The gains in high yield junk bonds are not over  thanks to the Federal Reserve s supportive stance on monetary policy  Margaret Patel  one of the mutual fund industry s longest tenured and most well known bond managers  said on Tuesday 
 The risk taker will be rewarded   Patel  a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Asset Management  said at the New York headquarters of Reuters  The ICE  NYSE ICE  Merrill Lynch U S  high yield index has posted returns of 8 92  so far this year  Patel s Wells Fargo High Yield Bond fund is up 8 68  for the same period 
 I see a downward drift in yields in junk bonds   she said 
Patel  who has more than 40 years  experience in the business  said the Fed will not be cutting off liquidity and could  in fact  slash interest rates this year  The Fed s potential cuts will trigger another wave of gains and access to credit for high yield companies  which issue debt with less than stellar credit ratings called junk bonds 
 Why should junk bond spreads be 450 basis points over Treasuries if defaults are a needle in a haystack  Makes no sense   Patel said 
The economy is slowing down but not to the point of recessionary levels  Patel said  She characterizes the economic backdrop as marked by  low inflation  modest growth  low interest rates and low volatility  
As a result  junk bond returns will continue to be modest for a number of years  Patel said  She favors the industrial  healthcare and technology sectors 
For their part  U S  equities  could definitely move higher   she added

146179,367694,ICE,EUR GBP Technicals  03 12 2019,opinion,"Preparing For A New Brexit Vote
On Tuesday  March 12  2019  the House of Commons may vote on terms of the UK s exit from the European Union  Is there a possibility for a big EUR GBP change 
Such dynamics indicate the weakening of the euro and the strengthening of the British pound  On March 11  2019  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and British Prime Minister Theresa May had telephone negotiations  According to their results  Juncker declared that  the ball is now in UK s court   Theoretically  the European Parliament can ratify the version of the agreement for which the British parliament should vote now  Let us recall that the UK s exit from the EU is scheduled for March 29  2019  If the parliament does not agree with Brexit without an agreement with the European Union  then the actual release date can be postponed for several months  On Monday  the pound strengthened by almost 1  against the US dollar  as investors believe that either the Brexit date will be postponed  or the UK will enter into an agreement with the EU  Let us note that on March 12  significant macroeconomic statistics for January will come out in the UK  GDP  trade balance  industrial production  In turn  the euro shows a noticeable weakening after the ECB meeting held last week  In September 2019  the European regulator is going to launch a new asset purchase program TLTRO 3  which will last until March 2021  The purchase of assets will be conducted through the money emission  following the example of the US QE programs   The ECB explained the easing of its monetary policy by low Eurozone GDP growth and low inflation 

On the daily timeframe  EUR GBP  D1 has again fallen below the lower boundary of the long term neutral range  Before that  it tried to breached it up and return to the neutral range  The price decrease and the continuation of the downtrend is possible in case of the approval of the Brexit plan by the British Parliament  as well as in case of the publication of positive macroeconomic data in the UK and negative   in the Eurozone  Otherwise  the price increase is not excluded 


The Parabolic Indicator gives a bullish signal  It can be used as an additional support level that should be breached down before opening a sell position 


The Bollinger bands have widened  which indicates high volatility 


The RSI indicator is near 50  It has formed a weak  positive divergence 


The MACD indicator gives a bearish signal 


In our opinion  an impulse movement can be formed after the price rises and overcomes the last fractal high and the resistance line of the downtrend at 0 868 or  in case it falls below the two fractal lows and the Parabolic signal at 0 852  Let the market choose the movement scenario itself  Two or more positions can be placed in a symmetrical way  after opening one of the orders  the second order can be deleted   the market has chosen a direction  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal high  short position  or low  long position  every 4 hours following the Parabolic signal  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  If the price meets the stop level without reaching the order  we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account 
Position Sell
Sell stop Below 0 852
Stop loss Above 0 868
Position Buy
Buy stop Above 0 868
Stop loss Below 0 852

The  legally binding changes  in the Brexit deal are about the mechanism in the deal designed to keep an open border between Britain s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland  The mechanism  known as the backstop  is designed as a way to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU until a permanent new trading relationship is established  Today UK parliament votes on the newly amended Brexit plan to leave the EU  The first vote on Brexit deal rejected it in January  Brexit supporters are concerned the backstop could be used to bind the country to EU regulations indefinitely  At a joint news conference with May European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker warned British lawmakers  it is this deal or Brexit might not happen at all  and  there will be no new negotiations   In case of another  no  vote  UK lawmakers will vote over the following two days on whether to leave the EU without an agreement  which is likely to be rejected  or to ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond the scheduled March 29 departure date

146182,367697,ICE,Oil Set for Weekly Drop as Tanker Attacks Can t Dispel Trade Woe,news," Bloomberg     Oil headed for a weekly decline as the tanker attacks in the Middle East provided only a relatively small boost to prices that have been hammered by a deepening trade war and swelling U S  stockpiles 
Futures in New York edged lower after rising 2 2  Thursday  The White House blamed Iran for the attacks near the Strait of Hormuz  the biggest global choke point for oil flows  while Tehran rejected the allegations  Meanwhile  the U S  and China remained deadlocked on trade  with economic adviser Larry Kudlow warning Beijing may face consequences if President Xi Jinping declines an invitation to meet with President Donald Trump in Japan this month 
While a war in the Middle East would be very disruptive for energy flows  the region is less important for global crude markets than it was a couple of decades ago due to the rise of U S  shale production  Unless the situation escalates dramatically  the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the world s two biggest economies looks likely to remain the major price driver

In this review  we would like to draw your attention to the chart of the British pound vs the New Zealand dollar currency pair  Will the GBP NZD rise 
Such dynamics indicate the strengthening of the pound against the New Zealand dollar  The main positive factor for the British currency is the plan of Prime Minister Theresa May to postpone the UK s exit date from the EU for a few months  This event is scheduled for March 29  2019  The next vote on the postponement of Brexit will be held in the British Parliament on March 12  Investors believe that due to the postponement of the exit date  the UK will be able to negotiate with the EU over much more favorable conditions in comparison with the so called No deal Brexit  which currently exists  Good economic data on lower inflation and an increase in retail sales in the UK in January became positive factors for the pound  In turn  a negative factor for the New Zealand dollar may be the desire of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to tighten its capital requirements for local banks  Tier 1 Capital  

On the daily timeframe  GBP NZD  D1 is in a neutral trend  A number of technical analysis indicators formed buy signals  The further price increase is possible in case of the settlement of Brexit 


The Parabolic Indicator gives a bullish signal 


The Bollinger  bands have narrowed  which indicates low volatility  Both Bollinger bands are titled upward 


The RSI indicator is above 50  It has formed a positive divergence 


The MACD indicator gives a bullish signal 


The bullish momentum may develop in case GBP NZD exceeds the upper Bollinger band  the last fractal high and the 200 day moving average line at 1 93  This level may serve as an entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed below the last fractal low  the Parabolic signal and the lower Bollinger band at 1 86  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level  1 86  without reaching the order  1 93   we recommend to close the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

Brent has now clawed back more than half of its trade war induced tumble of more than 6  over Wednesday and Thursday even though there hasn t been any progress in resolving the conflict  A drop in working U S  rigs to the lowest in more than a year had aided prices  and the supply backdrop is still rife with risks from Russia to Venezuela 
 I think the bounce we have seen in the last couple of days has taken the market by surprise   said Michael McCarthy  chief market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney   While supply issues certainly remain  it s the demand picture that s unclear   he said  adding that oil traders have largely interpreted Trump s trade comments as a negotiating tactic

The deepening trade dispute is dominating investor sentiment even as the physical crude market remains tight amid multiple supply risks  from Iran to Venezuela to Libya  Output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies expire at the end of June  but the group s  wishy washy  stance on simply setting a new date is adding to uncertainty  said Michael Loewen  a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto 
 The macroeconomic overlay is affecting everything   he said   If China starts restricting that flow of rare earths  that will materially restrict economic growth

146223,367738,ICE,Oil Extends Drop as Trump s Mexico Tariffs Worsen Demand Worries,news," Bloomberg     Oil dropped to around  56 a barrel after President Donald Trump said the U S  would impose tariffs on all Mexican goods  opening up a new front in the trade war and further damping the demand outlook 
Futures in New York fell as much as 1 6  after Trump announced the 5  levies  which will be effective from June 10 and could go as high as 25  on Oct  1   that are aimed at getting Mexico to stop immigrants illegally entering the U S  That followed a 3 8  tumble Thursday that was driven by rising U S  gasoline stockpiles and a smaller than expected oil draw from storage facilities  which fueled worries about falling demand in the world s largest economy 
Trump s announcement on Mexico took markets by surprise  rattling investors already spooked by the worsening U S  China trade war and raising the prospect that the White House could impose levies on Europe  The deteriorating demand outlook has put oil on course for its biggest monthly drop since November  despite a tight supply environment and an increasingly tense situation in the Middle East

Futures in New York fell as much as 2 6  after slumping 5 5  Friday  China struck a combative tone in a white paper released Sunday  blaming the U S  for the collapse in trade talks and saying it won t be pressured into concessions  That came after the White House rattled markets Friday by announcing tariffs on Mexican goods and terminating India s designation as a developing nation  stopping it from exporting products to the U S  without duties 
Oil has now fallen around 20  from late April  wiping out about half of its rally in the earlier part of the year  mainly due to the increasingly fraught global trade environment  While a tense situation in the Middle East has been supporting prices somewhat  the White House indicated over the weekend that it would be willing to negotiate with Iran without preconditions  Meanwhile  whether Russia keeps cooperating with Saudi Arabia on production cuts is shaping up as an important price driver over the next few months 
 The oil market continues to trade with extremely high beta to risk as concerns over a global slowdown escalate   said Stephen Innes  managing partner at SPI Asset Management   The latest sell off should be a stark reminder of just how fragile the oil markets balancing act is  and should be enough to bring Russia back into the supply agreement fold

Oil has fallen almost 20  from a peak in late April  taking it to the brink of a bear market  as trade relations between Washington and Beijing soured and the White House announced tariffs on Mexican goods  Rising U S  inventories have also weighed on prices  while the likelihood that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers will extend their output curbs doesn t seem to be having much impact 
 That the Saudi energy minister s remarks failed to boost crude prices suggests investors are focusing on trade tensions and U S  oil   said Satoru Yoshida  a commodity analyst at Rakuten Securities Inc  in Tokyo  Unless there s a new geopolitical threat  such as a missile attack in the Middle East  West Texas Intermediate crude could drop below  50 a barrel before OPEC decides on whether to extend the production cuts  he said

Last month  Intercontinental Exchange Inc  ICE  NYSE ICE   was given permission from U S  regulators to introduce the first  speed bump   or Passive Order Protection feature   in the U S  futures markets  That followed complaints from some market players that hi tech traders had an unfair speed advantage forcing them to spend large sums on technology 
Thomas Book  chief executive of Germany s Eurex exchange  said on Tuesday it had launched a six month pilot scheme 
 I don t like the term speed bump   Book told the annual IDX derivatives industry conference in London

World Oil Demand In 2018  the estimate for world oil demand growth was revised lower by a slight 0 03 mb d from last month s report  This came as a result of slower than expected demand growth from OECD Europe and Asia Pacific as well as from non OECD Other Asia and the Middle East  Total world oil demand growth in 2018 is estimated at 1 47 mb d  for an average of 98 78 mb d for the year  For 2019  oil demand growth is forecast at around 1 24 mb d  slightly lower than the previous month s assessment by 0 05 mb d to reach an average of 100 00 mb d  The downward revision is mainly an outcome of lower economic expectations in 2019 for the OECD Americas and Europe  as well as Latin America and the Middle East 
World Oil Supply Non OPEC oil supply growth in 2018 was revised up by 0 11 mb d from the previous month s report  mainly due to adjustments for US  Canada  Malaysia  China and UK supply  and is now estimated at 2 72 mb d  with total supply averaging 62 17 mb d for the year  Key growth drivers in 2018 were the US with 2 24 mb d  along with Canada  Russia  Kazakhstan  Qatar  Ghana and the UK  while Mexico  Norway and Vietnam showed the largest declines  The non OPEC oil supply growth forecast for 2019 was also revised up by 0 08 mb d to 2 18 mb d  mainly due to a revised production forecast for the US Gulf of Mexico  Total nonOPEC supply for the year is projected to average 64 34 mb d  The US  Brazil  Russia  the UK  Australia  Kazakhstan and Ghana are expected to be the main drivers  while Mexico  Canada  Norway  Indonesia and Vietnam are projected to see the largest declines  OPEC NGLs and non conventional liquids are estimated to have grown by 0 04 mb d in 2018 to average 4 98 mb d  and forecast to grow by 0 09 mb d in 2019 to average 5 07 mb d  In January 2019  OPEC crude oil production decreased by 797 tb d to average 30 81 mb d  according to secondary sources 
Product Markets and Refining Operations Global product markets continued to lose ground in January for the second consecutive month  In the US  soaring gasoline stocks  along with poor fuel oil performance affected by lower FCC margins  offset support from strong heating oil demand  In Europe  product markets weakened across the barrel as arbitrage openings into the region pressured margins and outweighed support from a pick up in diesel and fuel oil demand  In Asia  weakening naphtha and jet kerosene markets dragged on margins  as a growing gasoline surplus reduced gasoline margins to a new multi year low

146245,367760,ICE,Can Libor Be Replaced  Alternatives So Far Haven t Convinced Markets,opinion,"Given the long wave of scandals that hit from 2008 to 2012  most of the derivatives industry  along with its regulators  have agreed that the London Interbank Offered Rate  Libor  ought to be replaced by a more tamper resistant mechanism 
Surely there must be an index that will measure the average of the most short term of private loans  if only because the drive to market completeness suggests there should be derivatives founded on such an index  If that index is not to be Libor  what should it be 
Libor is a forward looking three month rate on private debt  The Federal Reserve favors the Secured Overnight Funding Rate  SOFR  as an alternative though SOFR is a transaction based  and thus a backward looking  overnight rate 
In August 2018  Barclays  LON BARC  advanced the cause of SOFR by becoming the first bank to issue commercial paper tied to this rate 
Problems with SOFR 
But dealer banks don t like SOFR  Or  at least  they haven t warmed to it so far   That s a little interest rate nerd humor folks   One problem with it is that at times of crisis  SOFR falls relative to the actual cost of dealer bank money  squeezing their margins 
More important  SOFR hasn t gained general acceptance among traders  On Jan  29  the CME one month SOFR futures contract traded just 2 636 contracts  That is anemic  by way of comparison  the CME Eurodollar Futures Contract traded close to 3 7 million contracts that day 
Yes  SOFR contracts may be new  but if the market demanded them  the numbers would be higher  Steve Wunsch  of Wunsch Auction Associates LLC  said in a recent post in TabbFORUM that a changeover from Libor to SOFR  or anything else along the same lines  invites failure  The call market structure  was critical to Libor s success  its elimination will make it  an alternative  forever non viable  
Abandoning Eonia
Wunsch makes reference to the Eonia   Euro Overnight Index Average   another effort at replacing Libor  The Eonia failed simply because no one wants to trade it  Indeed  this September the European Union abandoned it  announcing a substitute for that substitute  the Ester  which will not be available until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest 
The problem  then  is this  Regulators won t accept a quote based system for indexing  because they believe that the quote based character of Libor was the heart of the problem  Without a quote based system  one is stuck with a backward looking or transactional system  and the dealers and the markets have established that they don t want that  Also  everybody does want an index of some sort and expects that derivatives on this index will be actively traded  Is there a way to get to  yes  
The ICE  NYSE ICE  Proposal
Intercontinental Exchange  on Jan  24  promoted a possible alternative to either Libor or SOFR  which it called the U S  Dollar ICE Bank Yield Index  This would be based on unsecured bank debt over one   three   and six month intervals  ICE is looking for responses to its idea by March 31  If the market response is positive it may launch the index as early as next year 
To quote another recent TabbFORUM piece  this one by Kurt Dew  an economist at Northeastern University  Boston  the ICE proposal is an effort to meet regulators half way  to provide a  vague selection criteria from multiple illiquid market sources  in such a way as to make the index transactional enough for the regulators  yet forward looking enough for the market 
As ICE itself puts the point  the idea is to  measure the average yields at which investors are willing to invest in the unsecured debt obligations of a broad set of large  internationally active banks for specified forward looking tenors   on the one hand  but to do this using  transaction data representing short term  unsecured bank investment yields on the other   A  solid transactional foundation should make the index robust   we are assured 
Final Thoughts
Will the ICE Bank Yield Index catch on  On the one hand  since the markets collectively include wisdom not available to any of us individually  the answer is   blowing in the wind 
On the other hand  what we can know is that given the huge volume and value of Libor legacy deals  the transition from the old system to a new one any new one was sure to be tricky even were there agreement on what the new one would look like  Since there plainly isn t  and since no broad consensus is in sight  there is some significant missing infrastructure for interest rate swaps  variable mortgages  student loans  etc  And that lacuna is going to be with us for a long time ",2019-02-13,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-libor-be-replaced-200387199,200387199
146253,367768,ICE,Oil Set for Biggest Weekly Gain Since Early April on Gulf Angst,news," Bloomberg     Oil headed for its biggest weekly gain since early April as flaring tension in the Middle East took precedence over an escalating trade war between the world s two biggest economies 
Futures in New York gained as much as 0 8  Friday and are up 2 7  so far this week  Saudi Arabia on Thursday accused Iran of ordering a drone attack on its fuel pumping stations this week  President Trump is wary of drawing the U S  into a war with Iran  although there s division in his administration over how to approach the Islamic Republic  according to people familiar with the matter 
The recent attacks on oil tankers and pumping stations have highlighted how disruptive a major war in the Middle East would be to crude flows  Supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies    which had been the big price driver earlier in the year    have taken a back seat to the crisis  although a meeting of the group this weekend will be closely watched for clues on whether they will be extended  On the demand side  an escalating U S  China trade war is jeopardizing global growth prospects 
 Oil prices are reacting positively to the possibility of additional supply from political tensions in the Gulf   said Ahn Yea Ha  an analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co  in Seoul   Supply fears are likely to counter demand concerns coming from the trade war  until there s a clearer sign from the OPEC  coalition on the output curbs  she said 
West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery rose 45 cents  or 0 7   to  63 32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10 34 a m  in Singapore  The contract settled 1 4  higher on Thursday and has advanced 2 7  since May 10  on track for the biggest gain since the week ending April 5

146254,367769,ICE,Crude Oil Poised for Biggest Weekly Advance Since Early April,news," Bloomberg     Brent crude is set for its biggest weekly advance since early April as tensions swirl in the Persian Gulf 
The global benchmark has risen more than 2  so far this week  while New York futures edged higher by 2 2   Tensions in the Middle East are increasing as Saudi Arabia accused Iran of being behind the attack on its pumping stations  That follows separate attacks to oil tankers in the area  Yet  Friday s rally remain limited as China s state media signaled a lack of interest in resuming trade talks with the U S 
Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have helped support crude prices  yet the market s reaction has been  pretty measured   said John Kilduff  partner at Again Capital LLC  a New York hedge fund focused on energy  That s as  the deterioration of the U S  China trade situation is a big negative for crude and a big negative for the Asian economy  
The recent attacks on oil tankers and pumping stations have highlighted how disruptive a major war in the Middle East would be to crude flows  Still  investors remain concerned that the escalation of the U S  China trade war will only hurt global oil demand 
 I think the market s going to tighten significantly   Amy Myers Jaffe  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York  said in a Bloomberg television interview   These acts of sabotage can be pretty destructive  and that s on top of news reports that Venezuelan output s been cut  and  you have the Iranian oil coming out of the market  
Brent for July settlement fell 11 cents to  72 51 a barrel at 9 58 a m  on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  This week s gain is the largest since April 5  The global crude benchmark traded at a  9 20 premium to West Texas Intermediate for the same month 
WTI crude for June delivery rose 25 cents to  63 13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Prices are poised for the biggest weekly gain since the beginning of April

Anxiety over the trade war is taking precedence over a supply backdrop ripe with risks including a tense Middle East  a steadily deteriorating situation in Venezuela and production risks in Libya and Nigeria  The drop in oil prices will also give the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies more incentive to extend their production cuts beyond June

146287,367802,ICE,Saudi Aramco Said to Give Extra Oil to Hungry Asian Buyers,news," Bloomberg     Saudi Arabia is set to supply more crude to oil starved Asian refiners  and extract a heavy price for it 
State run producer Saudi Aramco will sell additional cargoes to customers in the world s biggest oil consuming region for June loading  according to people with knowledge of the matter  The shipments will be on top of those scheduled under long term crude contracts  they said  asking not to be identified because the information is confidential 
While the extra supplies will alleviate a squeeze driven by U S  sanctions on Iran and Venezuela as well as unexpected disruptions from Russia to Nigeria  the refiners face a costly bill  Aramco raised its official selling price for June cargoes of its flagship Arab Light crude to the biggest premium to Middle East benchmark prices in 11 months  The cost of the Arab Medium variety was set at highest since December 2013  while Arab Heavy was increased to the most in over six years 
The higher costs aren t expected to deter Asian buyers  who had earlier this month asked OPEC s biggest producer for additional supplies even before the kingdom set its pricing for June cargoes  The scramble for shipments follows the May 2 expiry of U S  sanctions waivers for buyers of Iranian oil  which the White House decided not to renew as part of its campaign to squeeze Tehran s finances 
Global benchmark Brent crude fell as much as 1 1 percent a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange and traded down 67 cents at  70 57 at 11 10 a m  in London  Prices slipped 1 8 percent last week  after gaining in the previous five weeks 
Supply Uncertainty
Refiners in India  where oil demand is growing at the fastest pace in the world  are set to receive as much as 200 000 barrels a day of incremental supplies  the people said  Some refiners in China  the top crude importer  and Japan will also receive additional shipments  they said 
Aramco was willing to supply more volumes to meet the requests of a major Chinese refiner  said a person familiar with the company s procurement  although details on the type and quality of oil on offer remained unclear  The press office for Aramco  known officially as Saudi Arabian Oil Co   couldn t immediately comment 
Prices had seesawed previously on uncertainty over how Saudi Arabia would respond to the tighter U S  sanctions  as well as other unexpected supply disruptions across the globe  Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih has said the kingdom will keep the market balanced  but also signaled that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia could extend output curbs until the end of this year

Futures in New York rose as much as 1 3 percent to head for a weekly gain  President Donald Trump said Thursday that it was still possible to reach a trade deal this week but reiterated plans to raise tariffs on some  200 billion of Chinese goods as of 12 01 a m  in New York on Friday  In a sign that supply could be tighter than expected  Iran s oil shipments have tumbled this month with not a single ship seen leaving the nation s oil terminals for foreign ports  according to tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg 
Oil prices have had a volatile week as investors tried to assess if there was still a chance for a U S  China trade deal after the White House said it planned to raise tariffs on Chinese goods  Rising tension between Washington and Tehran and the likelihood of output from Venezuela continuing to drop are pointing toward a tighter supply situation and lending some support to prices 
 The sell off seen in the past few days was a bit overdone  and oil is likely seeing a little bit of pullback as investors look towards a potential agreement  from the trade negotiations  said Daniel Hynes  a senior commodity strategist at ANZ Banking Group Ltd  in Sydney  There are also underlying supply issues because of Iran and Venezuela  but at the moment the market is focused on the trade talks  he said

146290,367805,ICE,Saudi Arabia Says Oil Tankers Attacked as Iranian Tensions Rise,news," Bloomberg     Saudi Arabia said two of its oil tankers were attacked while sailing toward the Persian Gulf  adding to regional tensions as the U S  increases pressure on Iran  Crude rose as much as 2  
The tankers were damaged in  a sabotage attack  off the United Arab Emirates coast on Sunday  state run Saudi Press Agency reported  The vessels were approaching the Strait of Hormuz  the world s most important chokepoint for oil shipments 
The U A E  foreign ministry on Sunday reported an attack on four commercial ships  No one has claimed responsibility  Two of the targeted tankers were registered in Saudi Arabia  one was flagged in the U A E  and the other in Norway  according to a U A E  government official 
The precise nature of the incident remained unclear    neither Saudi Arabia nor the U A E  said exactly what happened or identified potential culprits  The U S  deployed an aircraft carrier  bomber planes and defense missiles to the region last week amid worsening friction with Iran  Saudi Arabia s regional rival  U A E  stock markets posted their steepest decline in more than three years 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said the incident aims  to undermine the freedom of maritime navigation  and the security of oil supplies to consumers all over the world   according to SPA  He urged the international community to ensure the security of oil tankers  to mitigate against the adverse consequences of such incidents on energy markets  and the danger they pose to the global economy  
Strait of Hormuz  the World s Most Important Chokepoint for Oil
Antagonism between the U S  and Iran intensified this month after President Trump ended exceptions to U S  sanctions on Iranian oil sales  The Islamic Republic has threatened to block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if the U S  halts Iranian energy exports and to scale back its obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal 
Crude Rises
Iran s Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi described the maritime incident as  concerning and regrettable  and called for efforts to shed light on what exactly happened  the semi official Tasnim News reported  He warned against  foreign seditious plots to upset the region s security and stability  
Global crude benchmark Brent for July settlement rose as much as  1 38 on Monday to  72 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  Oil had been losing ground since late last month on signs that Saudi Arabia would pump more to make up for lost Iranian barrels and a looming trade war between the world s two largest economies  the U S  and China 
Rising geopolitical tension has also weighed on stock markets in the Gulf this week  Dubai s benchmark dropped 4   the most among major gauges tracked by Bloomberg globally  Saudi Arabia s Tadawul All Share Index retreated 1 8   and shares of Bahri  the kingdom s biggest owner of oil tankers  dipped as much as 4 1  to their lowest value since 2013  Bahri owns the two Saudi tankers  according to data complied by Bloomberg 
Tanker War
The U A E  s foreign ministry said it s investigating the tanker incident with local and international parties  No one was hurt  and no fuel or chemicals were spilled  the state run WAM news agency quoted the ministry as saying  One of the two Saudi tankers was on its way to the port of Ras Tanura to load oil for shipment to the U S   according to SPA 
The targeted vessels were the Amjad  Al Marzoqah  A  Michel and Andrea Victory  according to the U A E  government official 
Attacks on oil tankers in the turbulent Gulf have been rare since 1991  Saudi Arabia continued shipping through the Strait of Hormuz during the so called tanker war  a phase of the 1981 88 conflict between Iraq and Iran when both foes attacked vessels in the Gulf  Oil exports flowed also during the first Gulf War in 1990 91 
A Japanese tanker  the M  Star  was damaged in a bomb attack in 2010 when it was docked about 14 miles  22 kilometers  off the U A E  coast near the port of Fujairah  The Brigades of Abdullah Azzam  a militant jihadist group  claimed responsibility 
The Strait of Hormuz connects the Gulf to the Indian Ocean  Iran lies to the north and the U A E  and Oman to the south  Hormuz is the single most important waterway for global oil shipments  with tankers hauling about 40  of all the crude traded internationally every day  All oil exports from Kuwait  Iran  Qatar and Bahrain  more than 90  of those from Saudi Arabia and Iraq  and 75  of shipments from the U A E  pass through the strait ",2019-05-13,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/saudi-arabia-says-oil-tankers-attacked-as-iranian-tensions-rise-1866000,1866000

146293,367808,ICE,5 Reasons Why We Expect Higher Oil Prices,opinion,"We see oil prices trending higher in 2019  with the view that OPEC  cuts are sufficient to return the market to balance over 1H19  Meanwhile  the current price environment offers little incentive to US producers to pick up activity  The obvious risk is the state of the global economy and concerns of a slowdown but here are five reasons why we see higher prices
ING oil price forecasts
1  OPEC  cutsIn December OPEC  finally agreed to cut output by 1 2MMbbls d for a six month period  starting 1 January  with the deal set to be reviewed in April  The aim of the cut is to bring the global market back into balance over the first half of 2019  something we believe will be achieved assuming members comply with the deal  Given the group s over compliance in the previous deal  there is little reason to believe that it won t comply this time around 
Saudi Arabia once again appears to be carrying the deal  and they have already made significant cuts  The Kingdom pushed output to a record 11MMbbls d over November  before falling to around 10 65MMbbls d in December  For January  the Saudi Oil Minister has insisted that output will fall to 10 2MMbbls d  Current price levels are putting pressure on the Saudi economy  the Kingdom has a fiscal breakeven oil price of above US 80 bbl  and Saudi s budget for 2019 certainly doesn t help  with plans to increase public spending by 7   We don t believe that this means the Saudis will try to push prices above US 80 bbl  given demand destruction concerns and political pressure  but they certainly would like prices higher than current levels 
Russia is certainly key to the deal  without them  one would have to question the viability of any deal  This is the very reason why in the lead up to any OPEC  meeting  there is plenty of focus on Russia and their willingness to cut output  Russia has a fiscal breakeven oil price estimated in the region of US 50 bbl  and so are not under as much pressure as other producers to cut  Although  had they not agreed to cut output at the end of last year  prices would have likely traded lower  If we look at Russian output  they produced a record 11 45MMbbls d over December  up from 11 38MMbbls d in November  Under the latest deal  Russia agreed to cut output by 228Mbbls d from October levels  a month where production averaged 11 42MMbbls d  The Russian Energy Minister has said that it will take a while to cut output but estimated that in January  production would be around 50Mbbls d lower than October levels  We don t think that this gradual reduction reflects Russia s unwillingness to comply with the deal  but more the fact that operationally they need time to reduce output  Under the previous deal  it took Russia five months to get close to their targeted cut  The issue this time around though  is that the deal is only for a six month period initially  so assuming there is no extension  and that Russia continues to take a while to fully reach its targets  then their compliance over the course of the deal could fall short 
We believe the risk of non compliance comes from Iraq  In the previous deal  Iraq failed to hit its target cut  with the exception of one month  Iraq s compliance over the two year deal came in under 40   the worst performer amongst OPEC members  Under the new deal  Iraq has agreed to cut output by 140Mbbls d from October s level of 4 65MMbbls d 
Saudi output set to fall 800Mbbls d from November highs
2  Canadian production costsThe province of Alberta in Canada took drastic action towards the end of last year  announcing mandatory production cuts for producers starting in January  Producers are cutting output by a combined 325Mbbls d until domestic inventories have returned to more normal levels  after which the cut would be reduced to 95Mbbls d through until the end of 2019  These cuts appear to be working well for the industry  with the WCS WTI differential narrowing from a discount of US 50 bbl in mid October 2018 to less than a US 7 bbl discount recently  the narrowest differential since 2009  In fact  WCS delivered to Cushing is not too far from parity with WTI  assuming logistical costs in the region of US 5 45 to US 6 85 bbl  Why is this interesting  Well this appears to highlight a broader issue in the global oil market  where the bulk of growth in supply we are seeing is in lighter crude oil  while medium heavy oils are facing supply issues  consistent declines in Venezuela  Canadian production cuts and the fact that under the OPEC  deal  members are likely to cut heavy crudes first 
WCS WTI differential narrows on the back of Canadian cuts  US  bbl 
3  A balanced global marketCuts implemented by OPEC   along with the mandatory cuts in Alberta  Canada  mean that the global oil market should be largely balanced over the first half of 2019  assuming that members of the deal comply with the agreement  We see little risk for upside surprises from other non OPEC producers such as the US  given the current price environment  Saying this though  it may take several months for the market to return to balance  1Q is seasonally the low point in oil demand  whilst Russia has said that it would gradually reduce output  much like we saw under the previous deal As we move into the latter part of the year  we do forecast marginal deficits for the market  How these deficits evolve between now and then will largely depend on OPEC policy  US production growth  and US sanctions on Iran  Current waivers for buyers of Iranian oil are set to expire in April  and the market will be watching closely if further waivers are granted  Although the US has recently said there are no plans to grant further waivers 
Oil market set to be largely balanced  MMbbls d 
4  Slowing US supply growthWe believe that a sustained period of weak oil prices will only mean higher prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020  There is no denying that the bulk of non OPEC supply has come from the US  and this is a trend that is only expected to continue into 2019  However  with WTI trading around US 50 bbl  and prices in the Permian at a US 5 bbl discount to WTI  some producers have already made clear their intentions to cut back on spending in 2019  Those who continue with planned projects have the option of building up DUC inventory  holding off for more attractive prices  Depressed prices are a risk to supply growth as we move through this year  and into 2020  This raises the possibility that the global market sees larger deficits over the second half of 2019 Currently  the EIA forecasts that US output will average 12 1MMbbls d in 2019  up from an estimated 10 9MMbbls d from 2018  While in their latest Short Term Energy Outlook  the EIA s first forecast for 2020 puts production at 12 9MMbbls d 
5  Speculative positioningSpeculators continue to hold a fairly neutral position in ICE  NYSE ICE  Brent  As of 8 January  the managed money net long stood at 158 146 lots  down from close to 500k lots at the end of September  All measures suggest that speculators hold a neutral position  the US dollar value of the net speculative long is under US 10 billion currently  compared to around US 41 billion in late September  and lower than the two year average of a little over US 27 billion  Meanwhile  the long short ratio also stands at 2 6 versus an average of 10 5 over 2018 However  speculators are likely to remain reluctant to enter the market until there is some clarity over the effectiveness of OPEC  cuts  Macro money is likely to make a return only when broader market sentiment improves  a catalyst for this would be something along the lines of a trade deal between the US and China  or failing that  effective stimulus programmes from China  Finally  assuming that OPEC is successful in bringing the market to balance  this should also mean a strengthening in time spreads  which should also make the market more attractive for speculative longs  given the roll yield

146298,367813,ICE,IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE   is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26  
Revenues are expected to be  1 28 billion  up 12  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 4  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ICE 
For ICE  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 47  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ICE will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ICE would post earnings of  0 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 85  delivering a surprise of  6 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ICE doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intercontinentalexchange-ice-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200381933,200381933

Shares of Verizon have gained  7 5  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s decline of  5 2  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Verizon remains poised to benefit from the upcoming 5G boom  driven by healthy traction in the wireless business  
The company is seeking a first mover advantage in the 5G race as it plans to launch commercial 5G smartphones in the market in the first half of 2019 in collaboration with Samsung  KS 005930   Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising should also drive future growth  However  the company continues to struggle in a competitive and saturated U S  wireless market  where spectrum crunch has become a major issue  hurting its profitability

Meanwhile  continued strength in NIKE Digital is driving the top line  However  higher SG A expenses due to increased demand creation expense and operating overheads are likely to remain a drag  Further  the unfavorable currency environment due to the global trade and geopolitical dynamics is likely to weigh on the company s sales

146315,367830,ICE,Why ICE  ICE  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider IntercontinentalExchange  ICE  NYSE ICE    This company  which is in the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other stock markets has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 69  
For the most recent quarter  ICE was expected to post earnings of  0 80 per share  but it reported  0 85 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 25   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 89 per share  while it actually produced  0 90 per share  a surprise of 1 12  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for ICE lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
ICE has an Earnings ESP of  4 15  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 6  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ice-ice-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200373700,200373700

Already  OPEC oil supply dropped in December by the biggest amount in almost two years    While Saudi and the United Arab Emirates posted large voluntary cuts  the third largest was an unintentional cut by Libya  where unrest caused the shutdown of the country s biggest oilfield  Output from Iran has also fallen due to U S  sanctions 
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast Brent to average  70 a barrel in 2019 as OPEC s output cut is put into effect and there are involuntary output losses in Venezuela and Iran  Also  oil prices have been on an uptrend of late on hopes of U S  Chinese trade truce  Officials from both countries are currently discussing in Beijing on trade negotiations

146317,367832,ICE,Canadian farm exports run into Chinese wall amid diplomatic dispute,news,By Rod Nickel and Hallie Gu WINNIPEG  Manitoba BEIJING  Reuters    An expanding list of Canadian farm exports is hitting obstacles at Chinese ports  leaving sellers of soybeans  peas and pork scrambling amid a bitter diplomatic dispute  China has already blocked Canadian canola from Richardson International and Viterra  two of Canada s biggest farm exporters  saying that shipments had pests  Other China bound canola cargoes have been canceled  forcing exporters to re sell elsewhere at discount   Canadian politicians have said the concerns are baseless  and noted that China detained two Canadians after Canada arrested an executive of Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in December at the United States  request  China has used nontariff barriers before during diplomatic tensions  most recently against Australian coal  Now traders say Canadian soybeans and peas face unusual obstacles  Ottawa also warned last week that China was holding up pork shipments over paperwork issues  Increasing tensions with China  a top buyer for most Canadian farm commodities  have forced farmers to plant other crops  such as wheat  that they hope will not face barriers  China bought C 2 7 billion   2 01 billion  worth of Canada s canola and C 514 million worth of its pork last year  To be sure  the spread of African swine fever through China s pig herd has reduced China s need for canola and soybeans to process into feed ingredients    YOU BUY FROM CANADA  WE RE GOING TO MAKE LIFE DIFFICULT  But since January  port soybean inspections that routinely take a few days now require three weeks  causing Chinese buyers to avoid Canadian products  said Dwight Gerling  president of Canadian exporter DG Global   They re basically sending out the signal   You buy from Canada  we re going to make your life difficult    Gerling said  Earlier this year  a Chinese buyer told Gerling that a government inspector had found ants in 34 containers  roughly 680 tonnes  of the Canadian soybeans he shipped there  Such a finding would be rare  since the soybeans were stored in concrete silos in Canada and shipped in sealed containers in late autumn  said Gerling  who concluded the buyer was trying to avoid the new hassles of buying from Canada   It s just them playing games   Beijing  is just going to keep putting the screws to us   China s General Administration of Customs did not reply to a fax seeking comment  Government officials have said their canola ban is a regular inspection and quarantine measure to protect China s farm production and ecological safety   In a statement  the Canadian agriculture department said it could not confirm that China had imposed stricter measures against farm goods other than canola  Ottawa said this month it hoped to send a delegation to China to discuss the issue   Gerling s company has halted soybean sales to China and found other buyers in Southeast Asia  An official at a state owned crusher in Southern  NYSE SO  China confirmed that port inspections have tightened on Canadian soybean cargoes   We don t have Canadian cargoes coming in as we can t blatantly commit such wrongdoing when the atmosphere is so intense   the official said on condition of anonymity   Another official in Northern China said his crushing plant scrapped plans to buy Canadian soybeans when the trade dispute flared  Canada shipped C 1 7 billion worth of soybeans to China in 2018  up sharply year over year  according to the Soy Canada industry group  as China and the United States fought a trade war  But sales have now slowed to a trickle  Canola has taken the brunt of China s measures  Chinese buyers have canceled at least 10 cargoes of Canadian canola in the last few weeks  said a Singapore based trader at a company that runs crushing facilities in China  Some cargoes  around 60 000 tonnes each  have been resold to buyers in Pakistan and Bangladesh at deep discounts  the trader said    It is devastating for exporters   the trader said   ICE  NYSE ICE  canola futures fell to a more than four year low on Tuesday as supplies piled up  Growers intend to sow the smallest crop in three years   On Monday of last week  Ottawa said some Canadian pork exporters used an outdated form to certify shipments to China  causing delays  Such issues arise regularly in commodity trading  but rarely with damaging consequences  said Canadian Pork Council spokesman Gary Stordy    VERY STRICT  WITH PEAS Canadian pea exporters fear they could be next  China imported C 718 million worth of Canadian peas in 2018  according to industry group Pulse Canada  but the pace has slowed  Chinese authorities have begun scrutinizing import documents and product samples more closely  said Taimy Cruz  director of logistics at Toronto based BroadGrain Commodities  China Inspection and Quarantine Authorities now tests samples of each pea shipment before authorizing it for import  They also restrict in some cases the number of soybean shipments allowed under one license  slowing the flow  Cruz said  Similarly  import authorities now require soybean shipments that change vessels in Singapore and Shanghai   a routine practice called trans shipping   to reach their destination on a single ship  she said  While BroadGrain has not seen its cargoes turned back  it has reduced sales to China to avoid risk  concentrating on the Indian subcontinent and South America  she said   We have to be extra careful   Cruz said   They are very strict now

146318,367833,ICE,Crude Wavers as  Unnerved  Market Watches Iranian Drama Unfold,news," Bloomberg     Crude flipped between gains and losses as a severe crackdown on Iranian oil exports ticked closer 
U S  and international oil prices ended Monday s trading session little changed from where they began the day  While London futures settled lower  the West Texas Intermediate contract traded in New York posted a small gain  Even so  WTI was on track to advance more than 5 percent for April  if that holds  American crude will post its best start to a year since 1999 
U S  exemptions that allowed China and several other major buyers to purchase Iranian oil will expire May 2  cutting off supplies from OPEC s No  4 producer  U S  President Donald Trump over the weekend renewed calls for Saudi Arabia and OPEC to pump more crude 
 Uncertainty about what eventually is going to happen with those sanctions is kind of keeping the market unnerved   said Gene McGillian  manager of market research at Tradition Energy   The Saudis said they are not going to immediately boost production levels and that s also adding to the uncertainty  
Oil touched a six month high last week after the White House announced the end of sanctions exemptions on Iranian crude  Investors are waiting to see whether Saudi Arabia will ramp up production to make up for any supply shortfalls after Trump said on Twitter he had spoken with suppliers about boosting oil flows and that  all are in agreement

Investors are trying to assess how OPEC and its allies will respond when U S  waivers that allowed buyers to continue importing Iranian oil expire on May 2  While the White House says other producers have pledged to make up for any shortfall  top exporter Saudi Arabia has been less emphatic  International Monetary Fund data show the kingdom needs crude at about  85 a barrel    well above current levels    to balance its budget this year 
Crude is losing momentum after surging to a six month high following Washington s announcement on the Iran waivers  There s a  good chance  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will choose to extend their supply curbs through the end of the year when they meet in June  though some changes may be made to the current deal  according to  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  SA  Meanwhile  U S  President Donald Trump has renewed calls on the group to pump more 
 Oil stayed out of the limelight overnight following the Trump induced sell off on Friday   Jeffrey Halley  senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Ltd  in Singapore  said in a note  Both WTI and Brent  have made a decent correction lower  and oil seems content to consolidate and adopt a wait and see attitude for now   he said 
West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was at  63 46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  down 4 cents  at 11 02 a m  in Singapore  The contract closed 0 3 percent higher at  63 50 on Monday  snapping a three session decline

146324,367839,ICE,Rights groups sue over U S  decision to hold asylum seekers without bond,news,"By Kristina Cooke  Reuters    Immigrant rights groups asked a U S  court on Thursday to reverse a Trump administration decision that allows asylum seekers who cross the border illegally to be held without bond  The groups  which include the American Civil Liberties Union  say an April 16 decision by U S  Attorney General William Barr violates the asylum seekers  rights under U S  law and puts thousands of people at risk of being detained for months or years while they wait for their cases to work their way through a backlogged immigration court system     This is about the Trump administration s agenda of locking up any asylum seeker they can to deter people from seeking protection under our laws   said Michael Tan  a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union  The ACLU filed the challenge with the American Immigration Council and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project   The administration cannot bypass the Constitution by arbitrarily locking people up   The Department of Justice declined to comment  The court challenge came in the form of an amended complaint to an existing lawsuit  Earlier in April  U S  federal judge Marsha Pechman had ordered the U S  government to provide faster bond hearings to asylum seekers who pass their initial screenings  Before that ruling could go into effect  the Attorney General reversed an immigration court precedent that had allowed asylum seekers who entered the country illegally to ask an immigration judge to release them on bond  Barr delayed the implementation of his decision by 90 days  and the rights groups are suing to stop it from going into effect  Without the possibility of a bond hearing before an immigration judge  asylum seekers would be reliant on Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   granting them parole

146328,367843,ICE,Coups  Sanctions  Tainted Pipelines   and Oil Just Keeps Falling,news," Bloomberg     From an attempted coup in Venezuela to tougher sanctions on Iran and disrupted flows from Russia  global oil markets have been roiled by a host of supply crises over the past week 
The surprising result is that prices have kept sliding 
Crude s indifference to the array of threats reflects that world markets remain comfortably supplied for the time being  largely thanks to the ongoing surge in American production  which hit a new record last week  Prices are also capped by worries about the global economy  with manufacturing data from China and the U S  showing that growth remains fragile 
Oil has retreated almost 3 percent in London this week to trade near  70 a barrel  leaving it about  5 a barrel below the five month high reached on April 25  Prices climbed 27 percent in the first quarter  their strongest in a decade  on production cutbacks by OPEC and its partners  but the rally has subsequently lost steam 
 It shows that in an age of OPEC led production restraint and geopolitical concerns  surging U S oil output is more than capable of stunting upward pricing pressures   said Stephen Brennock  an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd  in London 
Brent for July settlement fell 49 cents  or 0 7 percent  to  70 26 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange at 10 27 a m  local time  It fell to a three week low of  70 75 on Thursday  This week s loss would snap a five week run of gains 
Venezuela  Iran
There s been no shortage of catalysts to give the market a renewed boost 
In OPEC member Venezuela  opposition leader Juan Guaido launched an uprising against President Nicolas Maduro on April 30 with the backing of the U S  government  The country s oil output has already plummeted to the lowest in decades because of an economic meltdown  and is at risk of collapsing entirely if the political standoff escalates 
Fellow OPEC nation Iran suffered another blow on Thursday as the U S  tightened sanctions  ending a system of waivers that had allowed several countries to continue purchasing Iranian crude 
The crackdown could slash Iran s exports by as much as 900 000 barrels a day  according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS    or roughly two thirds  Saudi Arabia  the world s biggest oil exporter  has given mixed signals on how quickly it will heed President Donald Trump s call to fill the resulting supply gap 
Libya Unrest
The political situation in a third OPEC producer  Libya  remains fraught as militia commander Khalifa Haftar keeps up his campaign to wrest the capital  Tripoli  from government forces 
In addition to these impending and potential supply risks  there has also been interruption to current oil flows 
Supplies from Russia to eastern Europe along the country s biggest export pipeline have been disrupted since April 21 as a result of chemical contamination  Restoring normal flows may take months  a spokeswoman for Belarusian state petrochemical company Belneftekhim said April 30  though Russia s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak gave a more upbeat estimate of two weeks 
Despite the threats to supply  oil prices have continued to weaken  with U S  benchmark futures now heading for their first back to back weekly decline of the year 
West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery declined 29 cents to  61 52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  The contract has fallen almost 3 percent this week  on track for the biggest weekly loss since early March 
That s in large part due to the sustained gusher of new oil flooding in from the U S   as the nation s shale boom continues  Production reached a record 12 3 million barrels a day last week  and crude stockpiles swelled by 9 93 million barrels  according to the Energy Information Administration  That s more than four times what analysts had anticipated

West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose after plunging as much as 3 1 percent in New York to the lowest level in five weeks  China was said to be considering delaying a trip by its top trade negotiators to Washington this week after Trump threatened on Sunday to raise tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent 
Brent crude has retreated around 7 percent since late April on signs the global supply outlook may not be as tight as feared  The possibility that the world s two largest economies won t reach a trade deal threatens to weaken prices  However  the U S  s decision to dispatch an aircraft carrier strike group and bomber force to the Middle East in a warning to Iran highlights tensions between the two countries 
 There was a slightly higher risk at the margin for a more severe trade war between the U S  and China  but generally the sell off today was overblown   said Bjarne Schieldrop  Oslo based chief commodities analyst at Norwegian bank SEB AB

146340,367855,ICE,Bitcoin Recovers Slightly From Friday s Drop,opinion,"This past Friday  Bitcoin established a fresh leg down to  3 300  which sent the entire cryptocurrency markets tumbling  Over the weekend  Bitcoin was able to recover much of these losses  and is currently trading just a hair above its recently established 2018 low 
At the time of writing  Bitcoin  BTC  is trading down nearly 4  at its current price of  3 500  On Friday  Bitcoin set its latest 2018 low at just under  3 300  from which it has recovered slightly 
Despite there being increasing signs of institutional adoption occurring for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general  one analyst expects the bear market to continue on for the foreseeable future 
While speaking to MarketWatch  Stephen Innes  the head of Asia Pacific trading at Oanda  claimed that the lack of upwards momentum is the result from the lack of Bitcoin use cases 
 Bitcoins have gone well beyond the ridiculousness of tulip bulb mania  It has been a disastrous year for cryptos  and by all indication  the current bear market could go from bad to worse with no fundamental or underlying reasons     Innes said 
Despite his pessimism  he is incorrect to assume that Bitcoin is lacking adoption  as multiple major financial institutions are currently in the process of launching platforms and or products directly related to the cryptocurrency markets 
Bakkt  which is backed by NYSE parent company   ICE  NYSE ICE   is currently in the process of releasing a Bitcoin product aimed at corporations and institutions  with a focus on being fully compliant with US regulators  Fidelity Investments is another example of a major traditional finance company that is entering the cryptocurrency markets and is currently developing an exchange platform that caters specifically to high net worth individuals and institutional investors 
These institutional aimed products will be launching throughout 2019 and may help bolster the cryptocurrency markets by providing both an influx of funds and of overwhelmingly positive news from mainstream media outlets 
Altcoins Plunge Amidst Bitcoin VolatilityBitcoin s recent price action has led many altcoins to sink to fresh 2018 lows At the time of writing  XRP is trading down nearly 5  at its current price of just over  0 30  This price region appears to be a level of support for XRP  as it only briefly dipped below it during the time in which BTC fell to  3 300 
Ethereum  ETH  is currently trading down 6  at its current price of  91 4  This past Friday  ETH set a new 2018 low at  84  from which it is currently trading up nearly 9  
Bitcoin Cash  BCH  is one of today s better preforming altcoins and is currently trading down just over 3  at its current price of  107  BCH has solidified its lead by market cap over its hard forked version   Bitcoin SV   which is currently trading down a mere 1  at its current price of  96

Futures were steady in New York after closing up 0 5 percent on Monday  The U S  is sending an aircraft carrier strike group and bomber force to the oil rich region amid rising tensions with Iran  which has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz  That buoyed crude prices  which were down more than 3 percent at one point on Monday  and outweighed news that the White House will raise levies on Chinese goods on Friday  threatening the global growth outlook

146342,367857,ICE,U S  Dollar Hits 19 Month High  5 Top Domestic Picks ,opinion,The U S  dollar is currently hovering around a 19 month high  A robust U S  economy has compelled the Fed to adopt a hawkish stance policy with the strong likelihood of a fourth rate hike this year in December  At the same time  U S  products are losing competitiveness in the international market due to a strong dollar Moreover  weaker than expected economic data from China and the European Union and concerns about emerging markets  ability to service their external debt have raised the possibility of global slowdown  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in domestic business focused stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank US Dollar Index Hits 19 Month HighOn Dec 14  the ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  DXY   which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  touched 97 71  its highest level since May  2017 Demand for the dollar intensified after the Fed signaled a possible rate hike in December amid fears of a global economic slowdown  Moreover  geopolitical conflicts in the UK and Italy resulted in decline in the value of the pound and the euro compared with the U S  dollar Tepid Economic Outlook for China and EurozoneA series of weak economic reports  recently released by the Chinese authorities and several countries of the European Union have raised serious questions about an impending economic slowdown in these countries On Dec 14  National Bureau of Statistics of China reported that industrial output grew 5 4  year over year in November  its slowest pace in almost three years  Chinese retail sales rose 8 1  year over year in November  marking its weakest growth rate since 2003  Most of the economists think lingering trade related conflicts with the United States is the primary reason for slow pace of economic growth in China Meanwhile  the European Central Bank  ECB  has lowered its growth forecast for the European Union  EU  for both 2018 and 2019  The new growth rate of 2018 is now projected at 1 9  compared with 2  forecasted earlier  Similarly  2019 growth rate is now pegged at 1 8   down from 1 9  projected earlier  Notably  this is the second time in the past three months that the ECB has lowered growth forecast for the EU Concerns Relating to Emerging Markets Emerging markets are characterized as major borrowers of international debts  external commercial borrowing   Since the debts have to be repaid in dollar terms  servicing these debts while managing fiscal discipline becomes difficult for these countries Moreover  refinancing of debts  which are on the verge of maturity  becomes problematic owing to soaring interest costs  With the dollar continuing to surge  heavy debt servicing liabilities may lead to economic slowdown in emerging markets resulting in global economic slump Why Domestic Stocks Investors are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets  Notably  in 2017  S P 500 companies had derived 43 6  of their total revenues from international markets  Domestic business oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility Our

growth potential  You can see  The chart below shows price performance of our five picks year to date 1st Constitution Bancorp   NASDAQ FCCY   is one of New Jersey s few independent community banks in

146353,367868,ICE,Is A Decline In Cryptocurrency Mining Driving The Ongoing Price Collapse ,opinion,"This time last year  all markets could focus on was the breathtaking spike in cryptocurrency markets  Now  investors are watching breathlessly to see if Bitcoin will break below  3K and possibly sink further  taking alt currency peers along for the downward spiral 

What a difference a year can make 
As the value of digital currencies continues to sink  a less visible aspect of the asset class s decline is also taking place  The business model for cryptocurrency mining is changing rapidly as well  Could there be a correlation between mining output and depressed prices 
Grim News For Miners And Equipment Suppliers
Recent reports regarding crypto miners have also been grim  On Monday  November 19  news broke that US based mining firm Giga Watt filed for bankruptcy 
Earlier in November  NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  shares were hammered  falling almost 19   after the chipmaker missed Q3 revenue expectations and lowered its forward guidance because of unsold inventory resulting from the evaporation of the cryptocurrency mining boom 
One economist pointed out the following on Twitter 




As I warned before   BTC  BTCUSD crash  coupled w rising electricity tariffs on miners will force  Bitcoin Whales to dump their Mine   Hold BTCs to cash out  Norway  China  U S    all are rising electricity tariffs on miners   or cutting subsidies  bankrupting scores of miners   
  With markets for their fixed  capital   mining rigs  being utterly illiquid  prices of used mining rigs have collapsed  leaving miners only one option  sell their BTC hoards   run for the hills 

The price declines make sense says Frank Wagner  Frank Wagner  CEO and co founder of INVAO  Crypto prices are influenced by supply and demand 

 With mining on the decrease  fewer miners will be selling off coins  It is likely that this will decrease downside selling pressure in the market  and therefore may increase asset value  

David Tabachnikov  co founder and Blockchain Innovator at Jerusalem Chain says that as the economic incentive goes down  so does the amount of miners  However  there s still a structure in place that maintains economic incentives  albeit only for some miner  regardless of prices 

 With Bitcoin  the difficulty level is reevaluated roughly every 2 weeks  In 1 2 months the price of mining will fall down and adjust to the market price  And with it   the cost of mining  Let s say that the price drops below  3000  Miners from Germany or the US will probably drop out  But we didn t have that many miners from there in the first place  Large companies that went into debt to expand will go bankrupt  But the smaller miners in Belarus  Kuwait  Trinidad or Venezuela  where the cost of mining is less than  2000  will stay  

Tabachnikov believes that miners who invested in GPUs  graphics processing units  which are a more generic hardware  rather than Bitcoin specific ASICs  will adjust their activities to other blockchains  such as Ethereum or EOS  where the cost of mining is lower  He thinks they ll probably sell off whatever cryptocurrency is not profitable  thus driving the price even lower   But miners that invested in ASICs which can only mine Bitcoin will hold on to it as long as possible   he adds 
Shifting Approaches to Mining
Mining techniques are also coming into question   Proof of Work  PoW  mining is a fundamentally irrational economic proposition   says Seth Patinkin CEO of Ampersand Markets  The PoW protocol requires that each mining transaction or block is verified  making it expensive to carry out  Plus says Patinkin   the now proven unsustainable incentive structure is causing the integrity of PoW blockchains to darken  and seriously calls into question the utility of Bitcoin as a form of payment  
When a stock craters  explains Patinkin  shares can find support because the assets of the company imply a limit on the market capitalization  even if it s lower  This is not true for the crypto majors which generally have no physical back stop  They ve been in the crosshairs of a fatal long squeeze 

 The health of the crypto ecosystem  crypto prices  largely relies on the engagement of PoW miners who have been decimated by the recent deterioration of the price structure  

However  some crypto watchers are rejecting the notion there s a connection between crypto mining and sinking prices  Alex Mashinsky  CEO of Celsius says 

 The problems mining companies are facing do not impact BTC prices  The total production of new BTC coins will stay the same even if half of them go out of business  There would just be more BTC left for each of the remaining companies  

According to Mashinsky  what s driving the selling pressure is a continuous flood of bad news coupled with delays by larger institutions and mainstream exchanges such as ICE  NYSE ICE  in launching crypto focused services  It s his view there are currently a variety of factors driving the downturn  making it impossible to zero in on a single catalyst 

 You also have over 400 crypto hedge funds facing liquidations and withdrawals from their LPs  Some are down 50   On top of that exchanges such as BitMex  which allowed leverage of up to 100x  are seeing accelerated selling as they were forced to liquidate some of the larger leveraged long BTC positions  ",2018-11-27,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-decline-in-cryptocurrency-mining-driving-the-ongoing-price-collapse-200362578,200362578

146357,367872,ICE,Strong stock and bond markets at odds over global growth,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    It looks like something has to give in global markets   Stocks and bonds around the world have rallied atypically together since the start of the year  rewarding investors both bullish and bearish on the direction of global growth  The main catalyst for the gains was the Federal Reserve s surprise decision in early January to pause its tightening policy  after four interest rate increases in 2018 raised fears it was being too aggressive as the economy cooled and inflation remained minimal  Those fears helped send global markets into a tailspin in December  Yet with the U S  benchmark S P 500 near a record level and corporate junk bonds notching new highs  the question stock and bond investors are asking is whether the Fed s next move will be a rate cut that further propels risk assets or a rate hike that cuts into the stock market s momentum   A move by the Fed on interest rates or a communication misstep by the central bank would likely end either the rally in the stock market or in investment grade bonds by the end of the year  restoring the traditional give and take between risk and safety  investors say    The Fed is between a rock and a hard place   said Kathleen Gaffney  a portfolio manager at  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance Management in Boston   They can t go lower because there are signs that inflation is rising and they can t go higher because of global political uncertainty  It leaves the market on pause    The U S  central bank has said it will soon stop letting bonds bought during its  quantitative easing  period following the financial crisis roll off its balance sheet  which also helped push yields on safe havens like Treasuries lower and acted as a tailwind for riskier assets  Gaffney said the Fed will likely have to raise rates again because of rising wages and other forms of inflation by the end of the year  adding that such a move will  pierce  the high valuations in both the stocks and bond markets   TWIN RALLY The rolling four month percentage change in the price of the S P 500 and the 10 Year Treasury note have both been positive for three straight months  according to a Reuters analysis  That is the longest such streak since a five month run that ended in August 2017  it showed  In that same 2017 period  the S P 500 gained and 10 year Treasury yields fell as the market digested conflicting economic reports during the first year of the Trump administration  before the Federal Reserve in September began quantitative tightening that resulted in bond yields rising as the S P 500 continued to rally   Since January equity markets around the world have made up much of the ground they lost during a wrenching fourth quarter of 2018 that sent the U S  stock market to the brink of a bear market   The S P 500 and Europe s STOXX 600 are up almost 16  year to date  while stock indexes in China are up nearly 30   The ICE  NYSE ICE  Merrill Lynch U S  high yield index is up 8 6  year to date while the Merrill Lynch World sovereign bond index is up almost 1 5    World stocks vs bonds    A rally in benchmark 10 year Treasury notes  usually seen as a safe haven  undercuts the picture of a  risk on  market  Their yields have slid from 2 69  at the start of the year to as low as 2 34  in late March    At this point in the cycle  equity investors are trying to take any incremental news positively while fixed income investors are not   said Jen Robertson  a portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Asset Management in London   It s quite delicate at the moment and any negative news out of first quarter earnings could impact this sharp bounce    Further uncertainty due to the economic impact of the UK leaving the European Union  which has now been pushed back to Oct  31  or a deterioration in U S  China trade talks could be a  shock to the system  and derail both stocks and bonds  she said   The spread between U S  three month bills and 10 year notes turned negative for the first time since 2007 in March  a bearish sign as a yield curve inversion has signaled an upcoming economic recession in the past   The move initially boosted stock prices as investors predicted it would hem the Fed in from future interest rate hikes  But equities could fall soon if recession fears continue to grow  said Hiroaki Hayashi  managing director of Fukoku Capital Management in Tokyo   If you look at the past experiences  share prices have often rallied six to nine months after the yield curve initially inverted before entering a major correction  I believe we are exactly at such a phase now   Despite outsized gains this year  financial markets have not indicated investors have faith that the global economy can grow without historically low interest rates a decade after the end of the Great Recession  said Anwiti Bahuguna  head of multi asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle Investments    The bull market we ve had for the past 10 years is essentially because of really low interest rates   Bahuguna said   
 I don t think that equilibrium will last much longer   she added  saying rising inflation and low unemployment could soon test global markets  ability to cope with tighter monetary policy ",2019-04-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/strong-stock-and-bond-markets-at-odds-over-global-growth-1841160,1841160

146360,367875,ICE,Oil Extends Rally as U S  Ends Waivers Allowing Iranian Imports,news," Bloomberg     Oil extended gains after leaping to a six month high after the U S  said it ll no longer give any buyer of Iranian crude a waiver from sanctions aimed at cutting the OPEC producer s exports to zero 
Futures in London added as much as 0 6 percent  a day after U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said any nation that continues to buy Iranian oil will face American sanctions  In response  the Islamic Republic threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz  a key waterway for Middle East supplies  Meanwhile  Saudi Arabia said it will coordinate with other producers to ensure that adequate supplies are available 
Crude has rallied almost 40 percent this year as OPEC and its partners embarked on their mission to cut output and avert a global glut  Disruptions in Venezuela  Nigeria and Libya have further squeeze supplies  America s decision to end exemptions for purchasing oil from the group s fourth largest producer adds bullish sentiment  with RBC Capital Markets forecasting a loss of 700 000 to 800 000 barrels a day in Iranian exports 
 Oil quickly repriced higher on panic fears that markets could face an immediate supply crunch  adding more pressure to the already tenuous global supply squeeze   said Stephen Innes  head of trading and market strategy at SPI Asset Management   This suggests that  80 Brent under current market conditions    something we thought unlikely only days ago    should now be considered a possibility  
Brent for June settlement climbed as much as 46 cents to  74 50 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  and was at  74 34 a barrel at 11 10 a m  in Singapore  Prices rose  2 07 on Monday to  74 04  the highest close since Oct  31  The global benchmark crude was at a premium of  8 44 to U S  West Texas Intermediate 
 Appropriate Supply 
WTI for June delivery rose as much as 40 cents to  65 95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange before trading at  65 89 a barrel  The May contract expired on Monday at a six month high of  65 70 
Pompeo said he s confident that the oil market will remain stable and that Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates and the U S  will ensure an  appropriate supply  of oil  President Donald Trump s administration had last year granted six month exemptions to eight buyers allowing them to purchase limited amounts of Iranian oil  It won t renew the waivers after they expire on May 2 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said the kingdom and other suppliers will ensure the market doesn t go out of balance  The biggest member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U A E  can boost their combined output by about 1 5 million barrels per day within a short period  according to people who asked not to be identified as the information is private

146362,367877,ICE,Oil Rally Hits a Wall After Surprise Supply Surge in America,news," Bloomberg     For oil investors this week  the U S  giveth and the U S  taketh away 
Futures in New York hit a wall Wednesday after a surprisingly big jump in American crude inventories suggested global supplies may be less constrained than previously thought  That ended a two day run that had pushed prices to their highest since October  after the Trump administration vowed to tighten sanctions on Iran 
Prices in New York slipped 0 6 percent on Wednesday  The U S  Energy Information Administration said stockpiles swelled by 5 48 million barrels last week  topping even the highest estimates in a Bloomberg survey of oil analysts  American supplies grew for the fourth time in five weeks 
Oil had climbed after Monday s announcement that the U S  won t renew waivers allowing China and other major economies to buy 1 4 million barrels a day from Iran  While it s dangerous to read too much into one week of EIA data  the report may suggest to some that the impact won t be so severe  said Brian Kessens  a managing director at Kansas based money manager Tortoise 
 The market is trying to find its footing and make sense of the heightened geopolitical uncertainty  especially what OPEC is going to do   he said   That s going to be the larger driver of crude oil prices over the next few months than what we see in the weekly numbers  
Investors were already getting more bearish signals on how the market will react if the waivers expire May 2  Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said he sees no need for immediate action  while the International Energy Agency said  comfortable  levels of spare capacity remain 
West Texas Intermediate for June delivery declined 41 cents to  65 89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Prices had jumped  2 30 over the previous two sessions to reach the highest close since Oct  29 
Brent for June settlement added 6 cents to  74 57 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  The global benchmark crude was at a premium of  8 68 to WTI 
The surge in American stockpiles was driven partly by a rebound in imports  The increase was tempered somewhat by the 10th consecutive drawdown for gasoline supplies and a ramp up in refinery activity  which could increase demand for oil going forward 
Prices have rallied about 40 percent this year as the Saudis led output cuts by a coalition of producers  including Russia  to avoid a global glut  Unrest in Venezuela  Libya and Nigeria squeezed supplies further 
 The estimated gain in American inventories is pacing down the rally we ve seen earlier   said Sungchil Will Yun  a commodities analyst at HI Investment   Futures Corp  in Seoul   Oil s expected to stay steady until we see more details on how the Saudis and its allies will bump up their output  going a step further from just signaling a boost  ",2019-04-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-rally-hits-a-wall-after-surprise-supply-surge-in-america-1844914,1844914

Futures in London and New York both declined after the global benchmark breached the key level for the first time since October earlier in the session  U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate led the slide after rising above  66 a barrel  Earlier  prices had surged as the U S  decision to tighten Iran sanctions and contamination in Russian shipments fueled supply fears 
 It was technical in nature   said John Kilduff  partner at Again Capital LLC  a New York hedge fund focused on energy   Everyone was watching the  65  70 area and once we broke that support  it seemed to generate some follow through selling  There was a lot of length that came into this market here and we couldn t hold  66  
Brent is still set for a fifth straight week of gains  following the U S  announcement earlier in the week that it won t renew waivers for countries to import Iranian crude once they expire in May  Still  questions are piling up over the ultimate impact  with Iran threatening retaliation  China declaring its right to purchase and Saudi Arabia taking a cautious approach on raising its own output 
Brent for June settlement fell 22 cents to end the session at  74 35 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  The global benchmark was at a premium of  9 14 to WTI

Futures in New York are up 1 3 percent so far this week  heading for an eighth weekly advance  While the White House s announcement that it will end waivers allowing some buyers to import Iranian oil spurred a 3 6 percent jump over Monday and Tuesday  over half of that gain has since been lost  Brent crude spiked briefly above  75 a barrel Thursday as Russian flows were halted across Europe after customers complained of impurities

146375,367890,ICE,Oil Tumbles Most in Two Months as Trump Promises Lower Prices,news," Bloomberg     Oil slid by the most in two months as U S  President Donald Trump pressed OPEC to cut prices and doubts grew about the impact of supply squeezes from Russia and Iran 
Futures in New York sank 2 9 percent Friday  wiping away gains from earlier in the week that followed America s vow of tougher sanctions on Iran  Trump  speaking at the White House  said he d called the producer cartel and demanded they bring down gasoline prices  Reports of readily available replacements for contaminated Russian oil also sapped momentum 
Crude hit a six month high this week after the U S  said it wouldn t renew waivers allowing China and other major economies to import 1 4 million Iranian barrels a day  Yet how tight those sanctions will ultimately be remains in question  The market looked ready for a pullback anyway  with optimistic bets on prices far outweighing pessimistic ones  said Bob Yawger  futures director at Mizuho Securities USA 
 There were no shorts in the market  everybody was long   Yawger said by telephone   That s when you start to get in a dangerous situation  
West Texas Intermediate for June delivery slid  1 91 to  63 30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  its biggest daily loss since late February  The contract recorded its first weekly decline    1 1 percent    since March 1 
Brent for June settlement sank  2 20  or 3 percent  to  72 15 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  just a day after topping  75 
U S  sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have helped push oil prices up this year  along with orchestrated cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers  That s started to become apparent for American consumers at the pump  with retail gasoline prices rising 28 percent this year  according to AAA data 
 The gasoline prices are coming down   Trump told reporters at the White House   I called up OPEC and said you ve gotta bring em down  
OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo and officials in Saudi Arabia haven t spoken to Trump about cutting prices  Dow Jones reported on Friday  citing unidentified sources  The president said in a later tweet that he d discussed increasing oil flows with the Saudis and that  all are in agreement  
It remains unclear to what extent other nations will pump more to make up for lost Iranian barrels  The Saudis said earlier this week that they ll take a wait and see approach 
 Fears of a supply shock were greatly exaggerated  after the Russian outage  PVM Oil Associates analyst Stephen Brennock wrote in an emailed report   After all  refineries usually hold ample crude stockpiles to guard against such disruptions  Little wonder then that the initial knee jerk price reaction petered out  
A mixed report on the U S  economy also clouded the outlook for demand  Gross domestic product surpassed all analyst expectations in the first quarter  the government announced Friday  But more than half the gains came from volatile components like trade and inventory builds  and consumer spending cooled for a third straight quarter ",2019-04-26,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-tumbles-most-in-two-months-as-trump-promises-lower-prices-1848197,1848197

146395,367910,ICE,Exclusive  Saudi Arabia threatens to ditch dollar oil trades to stop  NOPEC    sources,news,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov  Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler LONDON DUBAI  Reuters    Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if Washington passes a bill exposing OPEC members to U S  antitrust lawsuits  three sources familiar with Saudi energy policy said  They said the option had been discussed internally by senior Saudi energy officials in recent months  Two of the sources said the plan had been discussed with OPEC members and one source briefed on Saudi oil policy said Riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior U S  energy officials  The chances of the U S  bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through  but the fact Riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom s annoyance about potential U S  legal challenges to OPEC  In the unlikely event Riyadh were to ditch the dollar  it would undermine the its status as the world s main reserve currency  reduce Washington s clout in global trade and weaken its ability to enforce sanctions on nation states   The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option   one of the sources familiar with the matter said   The Saudis say  let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the U S  economy that would fall apart   another source said  Saudi Arabia s energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment  A U S  state department official said   as a general matter  we don t comment on pending legislation    The U S  Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment  Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said that NOPEC could lead to unintended consequences  DOLLAR HEGEMONY NOPEC  or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act  was first introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from U S  antitrust law  paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for curbing output in a bid to raise oil prices  While the bill has never made it into law despite numerous attempts  the legislation has gained momentum since U S  President Donald Trump came to office  Trump said he backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before he was elected  though he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as president  Trump has instead stressed the importance of U S Saudi relations  including sales of U S  military equipment  even after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year  A move by Saudi Arabia to ditch the dollar would resonate well with big non OPEC oil producers such as Russia as well as major consumers China and the European Union  which have been calling for moves to diversify global trade away from the dollar to dilute U S  influence over the world economy  Russia  which is subject to U S  sanctions  has tried to sell oil in euros and China s yuan but the proportion of its sales in those currencies is not significant  Venezuela and Iran  which are also under U S  sanctions  sell most of their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the dollar s hegemony in the oil market  However  if a long standing U S  ally such as Saudi Arabia joined the club of non dollar oil sellers it would be a far more significant move likely to gain traction within the industry  WHAT IF  Saudi Arabia controls a 10th of global oil production  roughly on par with its main rivals   the United States and Russia  Its oil firm Saudi Aramco holds the crown of the world s biggest oil exporter with sales of  356 billion last year   Depending on prices  oil is estimated to represent 2 percent to 3 percent of global gross domestic product  At the current price of  70 per barrel  the annual value of global oil output is  2 5 trillion   Not all of those oil volumes are traded in the U S  currency but at least 60 percent is traded via tankers and international pipelines with the majority of those deals done in dollars  Trading in derivatives such as oil futures and options is mainly dollar denominated  The top two global energy exchanges  ICE  NYSE ICE  and CME  traded a billion lots of oil derivatives in 2018 with a nominal value of about  5 trillion  Just the prospect of NOPEC has already had implications for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  Qatar  one of the core Gulf OPEC members  quit the group in December because of the risk NOPEC could harm its U S  expansion plans  Two sources said that despite raising the dollar threat  Saudi Arabia did not believe it would need to follow through   I don t think the NOPEC bill will pass but the Saudis have  what if  scenarios   one of the sources said  ASSET SALES In the event of such a drastic Saudi move  the impact would take some time to play out given the industry s decades old practices built around the U S  dollar   from lending to exchange clearing  Other potential threats raised in Saudi discussions about retaliation against NOPEC included liquidating the kingdom s holdings in the United States  the sources said  The kingdom has nearly  1 trillion invested in the United States and holds some  160 billion in U S  Treasuries  If it did carry out its threat  Riyadh would also have to ditch the Saudi riyal s peg to the dollar  which has been exchanged at a fixed rate since 1986  the sources said  The United States  the world s largest oil consumer  relied heavily on Saudi and OPEC supplies for decades   while supporting Riyadh militarily against its arch foe Iran  But soaring shale oil production at home has made Washington less dependant on OPEC  allowing it to be more forceful in the way it deals with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations

Futures gained 4 9 percent for the week  joining a U S  stock market rally that approached an all time high on Friday  Already boosted by fresh signs of OPEC production cuts  crude was further buoyed by a monthly employment report that topped estimates

Friday s optimism was enough for traders to shrug off the biggest jump in American drilling activity since May 2018 
West Texas Intermediate crude has climbed almost 40 percent this year as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies trimmed production to prevent a glut  Escalating tensions in Libya and Venezuela have also supported prices  with worries about economic growth and booming U S  shale output providing the only checks on the rally

been DHS secretary since December 2017  Her departure had been repeatedly rumored over the past year  particularly after a wave of anger over the administration s 2018 family separation policy at the border with Mexico and most recently as U S  border officials estimated that 100 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border in March  the highest level in a decade  Another senior administration official said Trump s national security adviser  John Bolton  after a blowup with Nielsen late last year  also recommended to Trump that she should go  Trump has made a clampdown on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his two year old presidency  leading chants of  Build that wall  at his rallies as he has sought to cut back on the number of newcomers entering the United States without proper documentation  Many of the migrants picked up last month were Central Americans seeking U S  asylum  Trump was so frustrated about the increase that he announced he would cut off U S  aid to Guatemala  Honduras and El Salvador  He also threatened to close the border with Mexico  although he later backed off that proposal with a threat to impose tariffs on auto imports  In her resignation letter  Nielsen asked for more from Congress and the courts  which have opposed such Trump administration initiatives as his effort to limit immigration from Muslim nations and the border wall   I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation s discourse   she wrote to Trump  Trump also took aim at Congress in another tweet later on Sunday  saying   Country is FULL   and saying Democrats in Congress must  fix loopholes  and repeating his threats to close the border or impose tariffs if Mexico does not do more   Nielsen s resignation was the latest high profile departure from the Trump administration  and leaves just four women in his Cabinet  Among others  Trump currently lacks a permanent secretary of defense or chief of staff  LIGHTNING ROD Nielsen s departure was announced two days after the Republican president abruptly said on Friday he was dumping his nominee to be the top official at U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE    Ronald Vitiello  saying he wanted someone  tougher   ICE is under the jurisdiction of DHS  which was formed following the Sept  11  2001  attacks on New York and Washington  Repeatedly subjected to tough questioning by Democrats at congressional hearings  Nielsen became a lightning rod for criticism of Trump s policies  She was confronted by protesters last year at a Mexican restaurant in Washington  Last year  Nielsen came under increasing pressure by critics to step aside after the Trump administration adopted the policy of separating migrant children from their parents as part of its  zero tolerance  approach intended to deter families from leaving home in the hope of entering the United States  After criticism as pictures of children in cages were spread across the world  Trump signed an executive order in June ending family separations and requiring that families be held together in federal custody while the adults awaited prosecution for illegally crossing the border  But the government reported that at least 245 children were taken from their families between that time and the first months of 2019  Trump insists that the arrival of immigrants across the southern U S  border constitutes a national emergency so important that he sidestepped Congress  refusal to provide him with billions of dollars he requested to build the border wall  Representative Bennie Thompson  the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee  said Nielsen s tenure at DHS  was a disaster from the start   He said in a statement  however  that she should not serve as a scapegoat  blasting Trump for  terrible and cruel policies   Noting that the department now has neither a permanent secretary nor deputy secretary  Thompson called on the administration to work with Congress  in good faith   Before she was nominated as secretary  Nielsen worked as a deputy to former Marine General John Kelly  who headed DHS before becoming White House chief of staff   Kelly resigned as chief of staff on Jan  2 amid reports of a strained relationship with Trump

146409,367924,ICE,Trump attorney general s ruling expands indefinite detention for asylum seekers,news,"By Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The U S  Attorney General on Tuesday struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge  in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard  The first immigration court ruling from President Donald Trump s newly appointed Attorney General William Barr is in keeping with the administration s moves to clamp down on the asylum process as tens of thousands of mostly Central Americans cross into the United States asking for refuge  U S  immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the Attorney General can rule in cases to set legal precedent  Barr s ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration  This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts  a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuit   Several top officials at the Department of Homeland Security were forced out this month over Trump s frustrations with an influx of migrants seeking refuge at the U S  southern border  Barr s decision applies to migrants who crossed illegally into the United States  Typically  those migrants are placed in  expedited removal  proceedings   a faster form of deportation reserved for people who illegally entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles  160 km  of a land border  Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond  But before Barr s ruling  those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond  once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution   I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond  whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States   Barr wrote   Barr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude  or if the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  decides to release them by granting them  parole   DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons  Barr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days  so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions   The decision s full impact is not yet clear  because it will in large part depend on DHS  ability to expand detention  said Steve Vladeck  a law professor at the University of Texas    The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHS s detention capacity  and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention   Vladeck said  DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision  The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have  an immediate and significant impact on   detention operations   In early March  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE    the DHS agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country illegally  said the average daily population of immigrants in detention topped 46 000 for the 2019 fiscal year  the highest level since the agency was created in 2003  Last year  Reuters reported that ICE had modified a tool officers have been using since 2013 when deciding whether an immigrant should be detained or released on bond  making the process more restrictive   The decision will have no impact on unaccompanied migrant children  who are exempt from expedited removal  Most families are also paroled because of a lack of facilities to hold parents and children together   Michael Tan  from the American Civil Liberties Union  said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision  and immigrant advocates decried the decision  
Barr s decision came after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to review the case in October  Sessions resigned from his position in November  leaving the case to Barr to decide ",2019-04-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-attorney-generals-ruling-expands-indefinite-detention-for-asylum-seekers-1838113,1838113

Last week  the word on the street was that some new player should appear in the cryptocurrency market  AMarkets  analysts checked this information and came to the conclusion that Bitcom has finally got a decent fundamental reference point  which can reboot the market moods and bring back positive sentiment  In other words  Bitcoin is really on the verge of a new bullish rally  The reason for that is that Intercontinental Exchange  NYSE ICE   the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE   is reportedly planning to launch its own online trading platform to trade Bitcoins 
To recap  the Intercontinental Exchange   is the world s leading network of exchanges and clearing houses for financial and commodity markets in the US  Canada and Europe  as well as the world s largest operator of the derivatives market  where futures contracts for all types of underlying assets are traded  energy  currencies  precious metals  AMarkets  experts believe that such apparent interest towards cryptocurrency is simply pragmatic  ICE is not willing to miss out on profits that are now accumulating in much less liquid platforms  Indeed  it s hard to name a more attractive asset than a digital currency  The hype and mania around Bitcoin is driving it up and down  it s incredibly volatile and traded 24 hours a day  7 days a week 
It s worth noting that ICE plans to enter the market with a very promising product   Bitcoin swap contracts  This instrument will be traded as a classic swap   a transaction with the simultaneous conclusion of counter transaction on the reverse sale purchase of the same asset after a certain period  The main feature of this contract is that it implies physically settled swaps  Today Bitcoin futures traded on CME and CBOE exchanges don t offer such a possibility 
The introduction of swap contracts may result in customer outflow from CME and CBOE Chicago based exchanges  Besides  bitcoin will become available to a much more influential and wealthy audience of the ICE itself  Don t forget about the US largest mutual funds  for which Bitcoin swaps can become a long wished for instrument to handle transactions with the cryptocurrency  Rumors are circulating  that the infrastructure base for new trading instruments will be ready by the fall of 2018  We recommend you make up your mind quicker  the BTC USD is gradually creeping to  10K and we have all reasons to assume that the expectations alone may be enough for a staging recovery above   15 K ",2018-05-11,AMarkets Company,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-ices-cryptocurrency-ambitions-spur-bitcons-gains-200315433,200315433

146415,367930,ICE,LIBOR Is Dead    Long Live LIBOR ,opinion,"A week ago  we read an interesting piece in Bloomberg   Readers may be familiar with the LIBOR    the  London Interbank Offered Rate   If you bear with the discussion that follows  we ll explain why this matters for your investments 
LIBOR is perhaps the most important benchmark interest rate in the world  with more than  370 trillion worth of assets tied to it  About six years ago  it was discovered that the rate was being manipulated by employees of many globally significant financial institutions  The scandal resulted in billions of dollars  worth of fines being levied against Barclays  UBS  Rabobank  Deutsche Bank  and others  The administration of the benchmark was transferred from the British Bankers  Association  and it is now administered by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  NYSE ICE 
Many regulators have not liked LIBOR and would like it to go away  In its pre scandal form  LIBOR was a measure of  inter bank  rates  that is  the rates that banks participating in the benchmark would expect to charge one another for short term lending  The trouble was that such lending had sharply declined in the years following the financial crisis  as new financial regulations came into force  So the quoted rates that went into the calculation were based on less and less real  reliable  verifiable data    which was what opened a window for traders to collude and game the rate to boost their gains 

Now that LIBOR is being administered by ICE  the benchmark rate s new managers have made reforms to the way in which participating banks derive and submit the rate quotes that are its basis 
Regulators would like there to be a LIBOR alternative  In 2014  the U S  Federal Reserve began working on an alternative called SOFR  the  Secured Overnight Financing Rate   which was recently rolled out  with a few hiccups  
The Bloomberg article mentioned above was interesting because it pointed out that in spite of regulators  dislike of LIBOR  there continues to be a market for it    that is  financial institutions want there to be a LIBOR quote on which to base their products 
Indeed  LIBOR  in its new incarnation as administered more transparently by ICE  is getting more popular  not less  Why would this be so  if it is based on an increasingly scanty data pool  The reason is essentially that the LIBOR competitors such as SOFR will more closely reflect the Fed funds rate in a crisis    that is  in a time of financial stress  LIBOR will likely rise  while SOFR and other similar benchmarks will fall as central banks lower interest rates to stem the crisis  The continued existence of floating rate debt instruments based on LIBOR also affords more opportunity and flexibility to major players in the financial system to structure debt offerings in ways that will benefit them under a variety of future scenarios 
Therefore  there will continue to be demand for floating rate debt based on LIBOR  and what there is demand for  there will be supply for  Financial conditions currently remain stress free  and there are no imminent problems  But we have noted several ways in which the first signs of excess are beginning to become visible    for example  the expansion of leveraged corporate debt funds being used by pensions to satisfy otherwise unattainable needs for returns to meet their actuarial assumptions  The continued preference of many financial actors for LIBOR based products is another manifestation  and it reflects the ways in which post crisis regulation has in fact served to encourage activities still more opaque than the ones it set out to suppress 
Investment implications  We do not believe the next crisis is imminent  and still foresee a significant period of strong economic growth  healthy financial markets  and good stock returns  However  we see early signs of financial excess  for example  in leveraged debt markets  The apparently ineradicable popularity of LIBOR as a benchmark also helps makes complex  opaque  and leveraged financing more flexible and available  It is early  but important enough for investors to be aware of as a barometer for any coming storms ",2018-05-21,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/libor-is-dead--long-live-libor-200317658,200317658

146417,367932,ICE,US Stocks Appear Set To Take A Breather,opinion," Thursday Market Open  Upbeat U S  stock market sentiment on Wednesday appears to be ebbing today as earnings season rolls on  tensions over trade seem to be weighing and investors are perhaps consolidating yesterday s gains 
In earnings news  Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  reported earnings before the open today that were largely in line with expectations  but shares fell this morning  The bank s shares had risen when other big bank earnings were released  Earnings were solid  but not necessarily stellar  Shares of American Express  NYSE AXP  and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  were also under pressure after earnings disappointments 
Financials And Industrials Jump
The financials sector  up 1 53   and the industrials sector  up 1 13   were shining spots of green Wednesday amid all the other S P 500  SPX  sectors  which were either lower or essentially flat  
Financials got a boost after Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  became the latest big bank to notch an earnings beat as the season is off to a mostly positive start  MS easily exceeded Wall Street analysts  expectations  Shares rose more than 2 8  
The results capped a solid quarter for the big banks  Results from the financial sector can help set the tone for market sentiment during earnings season  Entering bank earnings season  the financial sector had been lagging the SPX so far in 2018  The major story apparently weighing on the big banks has been the flattening yield curve 
Meanwhile  the industrials sector also shined Wednesday  helped by earnings results from transportation companies CSX Corp   NASDAQ CSX  and United Continental  NYSE UAL   The airline s shares rose nearly 8 8  while shares of rail company CSX  NASDAQ CSX  jumped more than 7  after both reported stronger than expected earnings 
Dollar Strength
The dollar has shown significant strength in recent days  not only against other major currencies such as the Brexit weak British pound  which has fallen over 10  since April  but also against gold  another traditional store of value  China s currency  too  has fallen over 4  over the past month  more on that below   The U S  Dollar Index  DXY  jumped above the mid 95 level today  eclipsing a mark from April  to its highest level since July of last year  see figure 1 below   As the U S  economy hums along  as has the pace of interest rate hikes by the Fed  dollar denominated assets have seen strength 
Looking East  Seeing Weakness
Speaking of weakness vs  the dollar  China s yuan has fallen more than 4  over the past month  and last night fell to its lowest level in a year as its central bank  the People s Bank of China  PBOC  weakened its currency fix beyond 6 7 to the dollar  The PBOC looks to be easing its currency in response to signs of economic weakness  Though the Chinese government reported earlier this week that its economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  over the past few months  other data show weakening infrastructure investment and a possible uptick in loan defaults  according to a New York Times report 
China s stock market has shown weakness as well  with the benchmark Shanghai Composite down nearly 5  over the past month  and down over 14  over the past 12 months  A strained trading relationship with the U S  has certainly not helped the world s largest export economy  Weakening its currency might help China counter the effect of tariffs assessed on its goods by the U S 
While it s too early to suggest long term weakness is in the offing  or that weakness might spread throughout the Asia Pacific region seasoned investors will recall the  Asian Contagion  of 1997 98 that hit the region hard and eventually spread across the globe it might be worth keeping an eye on China 

FIGURE 1  DOLLAR AT 1 YEAR HIGH  The U S  Dollar Index rose to a level not seen since last July on weakness in European currencies  especially the British pound  which has fallen 10  since April  Currencies such as the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar have also fallen along with weakness in commodities markets  Data source  ICE  NYSE ICE   Chart Source  The thinkorswim platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Tariff Worries  Economic Expansion  The latest Federal Reserve beige book was a bit of a mixed bag  Manufacturers in all Fed districts expressed concern about tariffs and in many districts attributed higher prices and supply disruptions to new trade policies  And many districts said that the inability to find workers in a tight labor market constrained growth  Still  employment continued to rise at a modest to moderate pace in most districts  and overall economic activity continued to expand across the United States  Prices were on the rise in all districts  with gains coming in at a modest to moderate average pace  The report could give ammunition to both hawks and doves  Moderately rising prices could argue for keeping the status quo view that interest rate hikes might continue in a slow and steady fashion  But trade  and labor related constraints to growth could argue for spacing out rate raises even more 
Housing Starts Stumble  The tight labor market may be pressuring the housing market to the downside  The latest housing starts data  from June  showed a decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 173 million units  well under the 1 318 million units expected by economists  according to a Briefing com consensus   The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects weakness at a time when there should be strength   according to Briefing com   The assumption embedded in the weak starts figure is that it likely reflects the difficulty builders are having finding labor  as well as the constraints they are facing with higher land  labor and material costs

146426,367941,ICE,Bakkt bogged down in regulatory disputes,news,"Bitcoin futures launch may be delayed once again 
No one knows how to regulate the new financial products 

Intercontinental Exchange Inc   ICE  NYSE ICE  hit a brick wall with its Bakkt project that is supposed to become a platform for Bitcoin futures trading   
The company planned to launch Bakkt platform in November 2018  however  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  is in no hurry to give the project a green light   
Initially  the company planned to store customers  bitcoins to allow for physical delivery  But according to CFTC  in this case ICE will have to disclose its business plan and undergo a public comment period  which would delay the approval process  the Wall Street Journal reports citing people familiar with the matter  
An ICE spokesman said that the company is working through the approval process  but declined to provide any further details  
Physical delivery means that traders would have to accept bitcoins or deliver them to Bakkt digital storage for cryptocurrency assets at the end of each trading day in accordance with future contracts specifications  
Under this structure  Bakkt would be responsible for customers  assets  which raises regulatory questions   

 There remains a great deal of skepticism among some regulators  It s still very much crypto winter   John Collins  a partner at FS Vector  a fintech advisory firm commented  

Thus  CFTC is concerned with the issues potential issues that may arise in conjunction of cryptocurrencies being used as a collateral ",2019-03-22,FX Street,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bakkt-bogged-down-in-regulatory-disputes-1815043,1815043

146434,367949,ICE,China Cancels Glencore Canada Canola Permit Amid Trade Spat,news," Bloomberg     Pest infestation is the reason China cited for revoking the license of a  Glencore   LON GLEN  Plc s unit to ship Canadian canola to the Asian nation  the world s biggest oilseed buyer 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his country s canola is  top quality   and plans to use  diplomatic channels  to resolve the ruckus amid increasing political tensions following the arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co  executive in Vancouver 
China on Tuesday canceled Glencore s Viterra s registration to ship canola  On March 1  the same fate befell Richardson International  Canada s largest exporter of the oilseed  and a company official said the move may be linked to the escalating row over the arrest  Earlier in March  canola futures touched a 31 month low 
The Canola Council of Canada said it isn t sure whether the licenses were scrapped because of the political tensions  Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December at the request of the U S 
 What we know is that it s very important that trade with China is based on science   Brian Innes  a vice president of public affairs at the council  said in a telephone interview  China is the biggest buyer of Canada s canola  and trade equals the amount of the next three markets combined   so we must find a solution   he said 
China s Canola Imports From Canada Slump by a Third in February
China represents a C 3 6 billion   2 7 billion  market for Canadian producers of canola  The seeds are crushed for oil used in everything from salad dressing to deep frying  Canola is also used as livestock feed 
China probably is trying to apply political pressure to the Canadian government over the Huawei arrest  Neil Townsend  a senior analyst at FarmLink in Winnipeg  Manitoba  said in a phone interview 
 If you look hard enough in any cargo of any grain from any country on the face of the Earth  you re going to find something that probably shouldn t be there   he said  China has balked at meeting with Canadian officials to examine the pest evidence  he said 
Trudeau said on Tuesday in Winnipeg that he is considering sending a delegation to China to discuss the issue 
 We re continuing to work very hard to try and resolve this issue   he said at a press conference   We are taking this very seriously  
The Canadian council said on March 21 that China had stopped buying canola from all of the nation s exporters 
Viterra said in a statement it is working closely with the government and council to get more information   We take quality concerns seriously and support a sound  science based approach in the testing of our exports   the Regina  Saskatchewan based company said   Trading giant Glencore bought Viterra in 2012

146447,367962,ICE,Some Texas drillers can t give away natgas with prices at negative all time lows,news," Reuters    Next day natural gas prices for Wednesday at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged to record negative levels as a result of pipeline constraints stranding gas in the Permian basin 
Spot prices at the Waha hub fell to minus  3 38 per million British thermal units for Wednesday from minus 2 cents for Tuesday  according to data from the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  NYSE ICE    That easily beat the prior all time next day low of minus  1 99 for March 29 
Prices have been negative in the real time or next day market since March 22  meaning drillers have had to pay those with pipeline capacity to take the gas 
The negative prices started soon after El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline declared a force majeure on March 18 because of equipment problems at its Lordsburg and Florida compressor stations in New Mexico  which cut the amount of gas that could flow west from the Permian 
Waha prices  however  have remained negative even after El Paso  a unit of  Kinder Morgan  Inc  NYSE KMI   returned the Florida compressor by March 31  El Paso expects to return the Lordsburg compressor on April 5 
The Permian is the biggest U S  oil producing shale basin and since much of that oil comes out of the ground with gas  it is also the nation s second biggest shale gas producing region  behind Appalachia in Pennsylvania  West Virginia and Ohio 
With production of both oil and gas more than doubling to record highs over the past five years  pipeline infrastructure in the Permian has not been able to keep up with rapid output growth 
That caused the basin s existing oil and gas pipes to become constrained and forced some producers to burn or flare off some of the gas associated with oil production 
Those gas constraints have trapped gas in the Permian and depressed Waha prices  boosting the discount Waha trades at to the U S  Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana to a record high 
That spread reached  6 14 mmBtu for Wednesday  which topped the prior all time high of  5 85 in February 1996  according to ICE and Refinitiv Eikon data 
That compares with an average discount of  1 06 in 2018 and a five year  2014 2018  average of 34 cents 
Several new pipelines   such as Kinder Morgan s Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway   are in the works to move more gas out of the Permian  but drillers will have to wait until late 2019 and beyond for those projects to enter service ",2019-04-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/some-texas-drillers-cant-give-away-natgas-with-prices-at-negative-alltime-lows-1826200,1826200

146468,367983,ICE,Exclusive  SEC scrutinizes fairness of stock exchange pricing,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the multi tiered pricing system used by stock exchanges favors large brokers at the expense of small ones  according to a person familiar with the matter  Under the current system  Wall Street banks and other massive traders get hefty rebates based on how much business they funnel to exchanges  The result of this complex and often opaque system is that big users can end up trading for free  or even get paid to trade  while small brokers pay substantial fees   Most exchange operators  including New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc  Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets  have embraced the system in at least some of their exchanges to help boost volumes and fatten their bottom lines   While the SEC has not launched a formal civil investigation  it is seeking information from the exchanges on the pricing system  If the SEC were to determine that the tiered structure is unfair  exchanges could be forced to simplify their pricing models  potentially costing them millions of dollars in fees   SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment  NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment on the SEC probe into multi tiered pricing  Cboe said it offers different types of pricing tiers catering to all of its clients and that the tiers are the result of years of intense competition among exchanges    At this point  we do not have plans to change our pricing schedules   said Bryan Harkins  who co heads Cboe s markets division  More generally  exchanges say that fierce competition in the industry has resulted in tighter bid ask spreads that benefit all investors   The regulatory scrutiny is part of a broader effort by the SEC under Chairman Jay Clayton to improve transparency around exchange pricing and ensure it is fair and equitable as required under the Exchange Act   The SEC has thrown the gauntlet down   said Chester Spatt  a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief economist at SEC  Tiered pricing will likely emerge as a central issue in the debate  said Spatt  who has a working paper on the topic  The regulator has also ordered exchanges to justify recent fee hikes for market data  and has mandated a pilot program to test banning rebate payments that exchanges make to brokers for liquidity adding stock orders   ICE  NYSE ICE   Nasdaq and Cboe have filed lawsuits or appeals challenging the SEC s authority on those two mandates   Tackling U S  exchanges is one of the few areas where Republicans and Democrats agree  Republicans believe the current rules are anti competitive  while Democrats worry existing exchange structures and incentives could hurt small and large investors   For graphic comparing number of small brokers to mid  and large sized brokers  see    HARD TO COMPETE Tensions between Wall Street and the exchanges  which were once member owned  not for profit utilities  have risen over the past decade and a half as the bourses have become public companies  Some brokers say the exchanges have used their essential position in the market to maximize profits  often to the detriment of smaller brokers   Joe Wald  chief executive of brokerage Clearpool Group  said tiered pricing makes it harder for smaller brokers to compete for customer orders against bigger firms  which get significant discounts on trading costs    It discriminates against smaller broker dealers who end up almost perversely subsidizing the cost of the whole exchange relationship for the largest firms   he said  Clearpool executes more than 2 percent of U S  stock trades on an average day  but comes nowhere near hitting the higher volume exchange tiers  which allow the biggest brokers to reap rebates nearly 60 percent higher than those that qualify for base rates  Wald said  When factoring in rebate payments from the exchanges  five of the top 10 customers at both Nasdaq and Cboe by volume actually receive checks from the exchanges at the end of the month  net of fees  according recent comments by a Cboe executive and a Nasdaq report  PRICING PATHS The current fee schedule was approved by the SEC  and exchange pricing lists are publicly available  But they can be dozens of pages long and it is impossible to know which brokers qualify for which tiers  An analysis by RBC Capital Markets in October found at least 1 023  pricing paths  across exchanges  made up of 3 762 variables  meaning that there are dozens of possible net prices for execution   These 3 762 variables strongly suggest that exchange prices are tailored and offered on a bespoke basis   the report said  Exchanges have credited pricing tiers for helping boost revenues  Bats  an exchange operator that has since been sold to Cboe  said the introduction of tiered pricing for its markets in July 2011 helped increase revenues by  14 6 million over the rest of that year  Large brokers  which include investment banks and high frequency trading firms  can also profit from tiered pricing by offering smaller brokers that funnel their orders through them a portion of their steeper discounts  while keeping the remainder  
Cboe s Harkins said that this  sponsored access  allows smaller firms to share in the savings with big brokers ",2019-03-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-us-sec-scrutinizes-fairness-of-stock-exchange-pricing-1801109,1801109
146469,367984,ICE,More than 2 000 migrants quarantined in U S  detention centers due to disease outbreaks,news,"By Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke
 Reuters    Christian Mejia thought he had a shot at getting out of immigration detention in rural Louisiana after he d found a lawyer to help him seek asylum 
Then he was quarantined 
In early January  a mumps outbreak at the privately run Pine Prairie U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   Processing Center put Mejia and hundreds of other detainees on lockdown   When there is just one person who is sick  everybody pays   Mejia  19  said in a phone interview from the Pine Prairie center describing weeks without visits and access to the library and dining hall 
His attorney wasn t allowed in  but his immigration court case continued anyway   over a video conference line  On Feb  12  the judge ordered Mejia deported back to Honduras 
The number of people amassed in immigration detention under the Trump administration has reached record highs  raising concerns among migrant advocates about disease outbreaks and resulting quarantines that limit access to legal services 
As of March 6  more than 50 000 migrants were in detention  according to ICE data 
Internal emails reviewed by Reuters reveal the complications of managing outbreaks like the one at Pine Prairie  since immigrant detainees often are transferred around the country and infected people don t necessarily show symptoms of viral diseases even when they are contagious 
ICE health officials have been notified of 236 confirmed or probable cases of mumps among detainees in 51 facilities in the past 12 months  compared to no cases detected between January 2016 and February 2018  Last year  423 detainees were determined to have influenza and 461 to have chicken pox  All three diseases are largely preventable by vaccine 
As of March 7  a total of 2 287 detainees were quarantined around the country  an ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters 
Ten Democratic members of Congress sent a letter on Feb  28 to ICE acting director Ronald Vitiello seeking more information about viral diseases at immigration detention centers in Colorado  Arizona and Texas  Lawmakers did not mention the Pine Prairie outbreak 
Pablo Paez  a spokesman for The GEO Group  the private prison operator that runs Pine Prairie under government contract  said its medical professionals follow standards set by ICE and health authorities  He said medical care provided to detainees allows the company  to detect  treat and follow appropriate medical protocols to manage an infectious outbreak  
 UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS 
The first cases at Pine Prairie were detected in January in four migrants who had been recently transferred from the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi  according to internal emails 
Tallahatchie  run by private detention company CoreCivic  has had five confirmed cases of mumps and 18 cases of chicken pox since January  according to company spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist  She said no one who was diagnosed was transferred out of the facility while the disease was active 
Tallahatchie houses hundreds of migrants recently apprehended along the U S   Mexico border  ICE officials said 
On Tuesday  U S  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters that changing demographics on the southwest border  with more immigrants from Central America traveling long distances  overwhelmed border officials and raised health concerns 
 We are seeing migrants arrive with illnesses and medical conditions in unprecedented numbers   McAleenan said at a press conference 
However  vaccination rates in the countries of El Salvador  Guatemala and Honduras are above 90 percent  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  ICE detainees come from countries all over the world  with varying degrees of vaccination coverage 
 HIGH PROFILE REMOVAL 
At Pine Prairie  staff members were at times at odds with the warden about how to manage the mumps outbreak  internal emails show  The warden decided not to quarantine 40 new arrivals from Tallahatchie in February despite concerns raised by the medical staff  one email showed 
The warden  Indalecio Ramos  who referred questions about the outbreak to ICE and The GEO Group  argued that quarantining the transfers would keep them from attending their court hearings  the facility s health service administrator wrote in a Feb  7 email 
In a Feb  21 email  ICE requested that medical staff members at Pine Prairie clear a detainee quarantined for chicken pox and mumps for travel  calling him a  high profile removal scheduled for deport   In an email to staff later that day  warden Ramos wrote that medical staff had wanted to exclude the detainee from transfer but  ICE wants him to travel out of the country anyway     Please ensure he leaves  
The ICE spokesman said that travel is restricted for people who are known to be contagious but those exposed to diseases who are asymptomatic can travel 
Since January  the 1 094 bed Pine Prairie facility has had 18 detainees with confirmed or probable cases of mumps compared to no cases in 2018  according to ICE  As of mid February  288 people were under quarantine at Pine Prairie  Mejia said his quarantine ended on Feb  25 
Detention centers in other states also have seen a rise in outbreaks 
There have been 186 mumps cases in immigration detention facilities in Texas since October  the largest outbreak in centers there in recent years  said Lara Anton  the press officer for the Texas Department of State Health Services 
In Colorado  at the Aurora Contract Detention Facility near Denver  run by The GEO Group  357 people have been quarantined following eight confirmed and five suspected cases of mumps detected since February  as well as six cases of chicken pox diagnosed since the beginning of January  said Dr  Bernadette Albanese from the Tri County Health Department in Colorado 
Civil rights attorney Danielle Jefferis said court hearings for quarantined immigrants at Aurora were largely canceled 
At Pine Prairie on Feb  12  Mejia said he felt confused and hopeless during his video hearing  with no attorney by his side 
After Mejia s lawyers complained  attorneys were allowed to visit quarantined detainees on Feb  13   one day too late for Mejia 
While he is appealing his case  his lawyers say he could be deported at any time ",2019-03-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/more-than-2000-migrants-quarantined-in-us-detention-centers-due-to-disease-outbreaks-1802927,1802927

 This will keep production well below 10 million bpd in April   the official said  The kingdom agreed to a ceiling of 10 311 million bpd under an OPEC led supply cut agreement at the end of last year

The group will meet in Vienna on April 17 18  with another gathering scheduled for June 25 26  to discuss supply policy

146479,367994,ICE,Oil Prices Rise to 4 Month High on OPEC Supply Cuts  Drop in U S  Output  ,news,"Investing com   Oil prices rose to four month highs on Thursday  pushed up by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and as data showed U S  output slowed last week  boosting optimism that a global surplus is shrinking 
U S  West Texas Intermediate crude futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 30 cents  or around 0 5   to  58 56 a barrel by 9 05AM ET  13 05 GMT   after going as high as  58 67 earlier  the most since Nov  13 
Elsewhere  Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Exchange in London rose 31 cents  or about 0 45   to  67 86 a barrel 
In its closely watched monthly oil market report  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  said its crude output had fallen by 221 000 barrels per day  bpd  in February from January  to average 30 55 million bpd 
The bulk of OPEC s cuts in February came from Venezuela  which is facing an economic and political crisis and is currently subject to U S  oil sanctions 
 Tighter global inventories from OPEC led supply cuts and     U S  sanctions on Venezuelan petroleum products have cemented support for oil prices   said Benjamin Lu of Singapore based brokerage Phillip Futures 
Oil s gains also came as data showed U S  crude production fell by 100 000 barrels last week  the first decline in three months 
The rally was limited by uncertainty over U S  China trade talks and weak data out of China 
Bloomberg reported that a meeting between President Donald Trump and China s Xi Jinping to sign an agreement to end their trade dispute won t occur this month and is more likely to happen in April at the earliest 
Meanwhile  growth in China s industrial output fell to a 17 year low in the first two months of the year  pointing to further weakness in the world s second biggest economy 
Pressured by weak demand at home and abroad  China s industrial output rose 5 3  in January February  less than expected and the slowest pace since early 2002

146485,368000,ICE,Oil s Rally Stalls Near  59 as U S  China Trade Jitters Return,news," Bloomberg     Oil s rally stuttered as uncertainty over the status of trade negotiations between the U S  and China stoked concerns over global economic growth 
Futures for May fell as much as 0 4 percent in New York after closing 0 2 percent lower on Tuesday  China was said to be pushing back against American demands  raising speculation that trade tensions between the world s biggest economies will persist  Still  the price drop was cushioned by an American Petroleum Institute report that was said to show U S  crude stockpiles declined 2 13 million barrels last week before government data due Wednesday 
Crude has surged nearly 30 percent this year on Saudi led output cuts by the OPEC  coalition that seeks to avert a global glut  and as American sanctions have also squeezed supplies from Venezuela and Iran  Meanwhile  a measure of oil volatility has risen 10 percent this week after Russia pressured the producer group to delay extending its curbs at a time when hopes are dimming over a trade deal between the U S  and China

146487,368002,ICE,Trading The Currency Basket  The USD s DXY Index,opinion,"The US Dollar Index  DXY  is an index of the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies  The index itself is tradable on the Intercontinental Exchange Inc  NYSE ICE  Futures exchanges and is available as an ETF but this means for most currency traders it s off limits  meaning your forex broker probably doesn t offer the instrument  However  this shouldn t take away from its importance or the potential for you to trade it by allocating a percentage of your funds for buying selling USD pairs in correlation to the index s allocation  The allocation is as follows 

Euro  EUR   57 6  weight
Japanese yen  JPY  13 6  weight
Pound sterling  GBP   11 9  weight
Canadian dollar  CAD   9 1  weight
Swedish krona  SEK   4 2  weight
Swiss franc  CHF  3 6  weight

The US Dollar Index originally was developed by the US Federal Reserve in 1973 to provide an external bilateral trade weighted average value of the US dollar as it freely floated against global currencies  The index composition is ripe for revision as the allocation was initially calculated based on the volume of USD exchanged for global currencies  However  with economies rising and falling  the dollar basket should be composed of other currencies such as the Aussie dollar and the Chinese Yuan  Nevertheless  the DXY is considered the benchmark by which to judge US dollar weakness or strength  If a trader generally thought the USD will strengthen or weaken and wanted to speculate by taking a position for or against it  buying or selling pairs according to the allocation above is an ideal way to diversify a risky proposition 
The DXY is useful if a trader wishes to enter or exit a position or buy or sell the USD against any specific currency  For example  if the Australian dollar is consolidating against the USD  demonstrating a degree of inertia  but the EUR USD is showing strong appreciating momentum along with the DXY  then it could be assessed that the AUD will soon continue to appreciate against the USD and that the current inertia is transient  In this case buying the AUD is worthwhile as US dollar weakness is assessed to be the real driver 
Another way the DXY is useful to traders is through a technical analysis of its chart  For example  if the DXY has fallen  the US dollar has depreciated  to a level of technical support  then this could be a good method to ascertain a level at which to go long on the greenback  especially if an oversold indicator confirms this  Let s look at the chart below  The price has fallen to a level of support going back to March 2015  Secondly  the RSI indicator tells us the price is now over oversold  The MACD is also deeply bearish  At this level  in the context of a tightening monetary policy  I d say the US dollar might be ready to retrace after a prolonged period of bearishness  On the other hand  you could argue the USD is just taking a breather before falling further and therefore  any long position should also incorporate stop loss orders below the indicated support level ",2018-01-30,Amram Margalit,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-the-currency-basket-the-usd-index-200284772,200284772

U S  West Texas Intermediate crude futures for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped 52 cents  or around 0 9   to  56 78 a barrel by 7 15AM ET  12 15 GMT  
Elsewhere  Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Exchange in London shed 67 cents  or about 1   to  66 58 a barrel 
Both benchmarks reached their highest levels of the year on Friday 
After ending 2018 in freefall  oil prices have rallied approximately 25  to start the year  boosted by efforts by global producers to cut supply 
In December  OPEC and a group of 10 producers outside the cartel  led by Russia  agreed to collectively cut production by a total of 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  during the first six months of 2019 
Top exporter and OPEC s de facto leader Saudi Arabia recently pledged to cut even more production than the deal called for 
Trump s call comes after he announced U S  sanctions against Iran and Venezuela that have caused output to fall in both countries  Output from Libya is also running below traditional levels because of the country s civil war 
Crude futures were also generally supported by hopes that the U S  and China would soon resolve their trade disputes  which have dragged on global economic growth 
President Trump said on Sunday that he would delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods that had been scheduled for Friday  citing  substantial progress  in U S  China trade talks over the weekend  Crude prices had risen on the back of that news because of the reduced likelihood of a further economic slowdown in China  the world s biggest importer ",2019-02-25,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-prices-pull-back-after-trump-rails-against-opec-on-twitter-1789269,1789269

Crude had fallen sharply Monday after Trump warned OPEC not to cut supply to the global market  saying the world economy was too  fragile  to withstand higher prices 
 Trump has never been shy about voicing his opinions on oil prices  but this particular tweet came at a time when the market was quite overextended to the upside  having enjoyed a very good run since late last year   said Craig Erlam  senior market analyst with Oanda 
After falling by over 3  at one stage  prices have recovered  helped by a string of more bullish speeches from industry executives at the International Petroleum Week conference in London 
Traders are now looking ahead to the American Petroleum Institute s weekly report that is due for release at 4 30PM ET  21 30 GMT  
The U S  Energy Information Administration s weekly report will be released on Wednesday

146517,368032,ICE,Oil Prices Turn Higher After U S  GDP Report  ,news,"Investing com   Oil prices were higher during U S  morning hours on Thursday  erasing earlier losses after data showed the U S  economy remained on a solid footing as 2018 came to a close 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis said that gross domestic product registered a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  growth in the final three months of 2018  in line with expectations and down from a rate of 3 4  in the third quarter 
While the GDP report was only preliminary  it would mean average growth for the year was 3 1   the first yearly print above 3  since 2005 



U S  West Texas Intermediate crude futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 17 cents  or around 0 3   to  57 12 a barrel by 9 10AM ET  14 10 GMT   It fell to a low of  56 44 in overnight trade 
Elsewhere  Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Exchange in London was at  66 52 a barrel  well off session lows of  65 91 
Both benchmarks were on the back foot earlier in the day after data showed factory activity in China shrank to a three year low in February  underscoring deepening cracks in the world s second largest economy 
 Further evidence of a slowdown in China hit risk sentiment   said Jasper Lawler  head of research at futures brokerage London Capital Group 
Prices were also dragged down by the fact that U S  crude oil production continues to rise  It has risen by more than 2 million barrels per day  bpd  over the last year  to an unprecedented 12 1 million bpd  according to EIA data released this week  
Still  oil markets remain relatively well supported by supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  which  together with non affiliated producers like Russia  agreed late last year to reduce output by 1 2 million bpd to prop up prices  However  the EIA expects the rise in U S  output will more than offset the barrels taken off the market by the so called  OPEC   agreement 
In other energy trading  gasoline futures dipped 0 1  to  1 759 a gallon  while heating oil inched up 0 1  to  2 025 a gallon 
Natural gas futures advanced 1 1  to  2 830 per million British thermal units  as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day amid expectations for a withdrawal of 171 billion cubic feet

146518,368033,ICE,Centrist Democrats stray on votes  roiling House majority party,news,By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    Freshman Democrats determined to walk a centrist path in the U S  House of Representatives are testing party harmony between moderates and liberals  just as work on major issues including gun control and healthcare policy is getting underway  Democrats took control of the House from President Donald Trump s fellow Republicans in January thanks in part to party moderates who won seats formerly held by Republicans in November s midterm elections  But these centrists already have upset some Democratic elders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party s liberal wing by voting on occasion with the Republicans during their first couple of months in office  Republicans are in the minority in the House  but control the Senate   Tensions flared this week after House Republicans managed to successfully amend a gun control bill with votes from 26 Democrats  Many of the Democrats who broke with the party line on Wednesday represent swing districts that had voted for Trump in 2016   How did Nancy Pelosi let this happen   Justice Democrats  a liberal political action committee that helped elect new Democratic star Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York in November  asked on Twitter after the vote  The episode highlights the political tightrope being walked by several dozen freshman who helped to clinch the House majority for Democrats in November by expanding into Republican territory  There currently are 235 Democrats  197 Republicans and three vacancies in the 435 seat House  The centrists have not gotten as much attention as Ocasio Cortez during their first months in office  and their differing positions from the party s liberals on policies such as government run healthcare have at times put them at odds  They also already have Republicans on their backs for the next election in 2020  Many of the 55 seats Republicans plan to target next year are held by freshman Democratic lawmakers who captured a previously Republican held seat last year or prevailed in districts Trump won in 2016  Representative Joe Cunningham  36  did both when he won a South Carolina district in November that had not elected a Democrat to the House since before he was born  Cunningham defeated Republican rival Katie Arrington by less than 2 percentage points in a district Trump won by 13 percentage points in 2016   On Wednesday  Cunningham was among the Democrats who supported the Republican amendment calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE    an agency criticized by liberals like Ocasio Cortez  to be notified when an illegal immigrant in caught trying to buy a gun  Cunningham  a gun owner  said the next day he saw the amendment as minor  He added that it should not detract from the fact that the House had passed a gun control measure for the first time in two decades  calling for universal background checks on gun purchases  In an interview on Tuesday  Cunningham was unapologetic for sometimes siding with Republicans  He has done it around a dozen times since January  mostly on procedural votes   I will be an independent check and not toe the party line whenever I disagree   Cunningham told Reuters   I m not going to let the national party or the national message drive my message at home   Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey  another Democratic freshman  said   I just do what I think is right   after straying from his party s line on a previous Democratic proposal banning funding for Trump s U S  Mexico border wall  Van Drew also supported the Republican gun amendment   JUST VOTE NO   The House Democratic leadership was divided this week on members breaking with the party line  Pelosi told reporters on Thursday she did not approve  even on procedural votes   Just vote no  because the fact is  a vote yes is to give leverage to the other side   Pelosi said  Other Democratic leaders took a more relaxed view   It s OK to vote your district   said Representative James Clyburn  a member of the House Democratic leadership who  like Cunningham  represents a South Carolina district   We have a very diverse caucus   Clyburn added   I wish people would not compare us to the Republicans  where everybody looks alike  We ve got varied backgrounds and experiences that we have to take into account   Ocasio Cortez s communications director  Corbin Trent  said the congresswoman believes Democrats who have broken with the party on such votes  are putting themselves on a list for Republicans  to divide the party   At a closed door party meeting on Thursday  Ocasio Cortez  who describes herself as a  democratic socialist   said Democrats who voted for the Republican gun amendment had put her in a difficult spot because the measure endangered some in her community  Trent said  Despite the ongoing debate  the party has said it will work hard to defend Democrats in swing districts  Representative Cheri Bustos  who chairs the committee that works to elect Democrats to the House  has announced a list of 44 lawmakers including Cunningham in the party s  frontline  program that helps the most vulnerable Democrats with fundraising and campaign guidance  The list includes 41 first term House members   We want to make sure that our members come back   Bustos  a fourth term congresswoman who represents an Illinois district won by Trump in 2016  said in an interview   We want them to be successful  and they ve got to do what they ve got to do to be successful  ,2019-03-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/centrist-democrats-stray-on-votes-roiling-house-majority-party-1795694,1795694

Democratic Senator Jon Tester played down any breakdown in talks   It is a negotiation  Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through   he told the Fox program  Tester  one of 17 negotiators  said he was hopeful a deal could be reached 
But Shelby put the chances of reaching a deal by Monday at 50 50  No further talks were scheduled  a source told Reuters on condition of anonymity 
The lawmakers hoped to have an agreement by Monday to allow time for the legislation to pass the U S  House of Representatives and Senate and get signed by President Donald Trump by Friday  when funding for the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies expires 
Trump agreed on Jan  25 to end a 35 day partial U S  government shutdown without getting the  5 7 billion he had demanded from Congress for a wall along the border with Mexico  handing a political victory to Democrats 
Instead  a three week spending deal was reached with congressional leaders to give lawmakers time to resolve their disagreements about how to address security along the border 
One sticking point has been the Democrats  demand for funding fewer detention beds for people arrested by U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   agents  Republicans want to increase the number as part of their drive to speed immigrant deportations 
Since he ran for president in 2016  Trump has pledged to stop the influx of undocumented immigrants by building a wall on the border and crack down on immigrants living in the United States illegally by aggressively conducting more deportations 
 DESPERATELY NEEDED 
Democrats proposed lowering the cap on detention beds to 35 520 from the current 40 520 in return for giving Republicans some of the money they want for physical barriers  the source familiar with negotiations said 
But Democrats would create a limit within that cap of 16 500 beds at detention facilities for undocumented immigrants apprehended in the interior of the country  The remainder would be at border detention centers 
By having the interior cap  ICE agents would be forced to focus on arresting and deporting serious criminals  not law abiding immigrants  a House Democratic aide said on Sunday 
Republicans balked at the Democrats  sub cap offer  the source said 
Trump weighed in Sunday  saying the Democratic proposal would protect felons   They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall   now  out of the blue  want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention   Trump said on Twitter 
 Claims that this proposal would allow violent criminals to be released are false   the Democratic aide said 
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  who is close to Trump  warned against limiting beds   Donald Trump is not going to sign any legislation that reduces the bed spaces  You can take that to the bank   he said on Fox News   Sunday Morning Futures  
Lawmakers working on a border deal also have not yet nailed down the amount of money to go for physical barriers along the southern U S  border  the source said 
While a growing number of Republicans in Congress have made it clear they would not embrace another shutdown  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said he could not rule it out 
 You absolutely cannot   Mulvaney  who is also Trump s acting chief of staff  told NBC s  Meet the Press  on Sunday   Is a shutdown entirely off the table  The answer is no  
Lawmakers  however  were working to avoid it 

On Friday  some of the negotiators said that if Congress could not pass a border security bill by Friday  they would move to pass another stop gap funding bill to avert a shutdown and allow more time to reach a border deal ",2019-02-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/talks-to-avert-shutdown-break-down-over-detention-policies-senator-1775098,1775098

146589,368104,ICE,EU antitrust policy under fire after Siemens Alstom deal blocked,news,"By Foo Yun Chee and John Revill
BRUSSELS ZURICH  Reuters    Siemens and  Alstom  s plan to create a European rail champion collapsed on Wednesday after EU regulators blocked the deal  prompting Germany and France to call for an overhaul of EU competition policy to better meet global challenges 
The European Commission also rejected a bid by German copper company Wieland Werke AG to buy a business unit from Aurubis  Europe s biggest copper smelter  similarly arguing the deal could have pushed up prices for consumers 
The two vetoes are likely to spur efforts by France and Germany to loosen EU competition rules so as to take a more global than solely European view of mergers and potentially to allow EU ministers to have a say 
Shortly after the Commission s announcements  German economy minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules to facilitate large cross border mergers 
France s Alstom  PA ALSO  said the veto was a clear set back for industry in Europe  while Joe Kaeser  the chief executive of Germany s Siemens  said Europe urgently needed to reform its industrial policy to help its companies compete 
 Protecting customer interests locally must not mean that Europe cannot be on a level playing field with leading nations like China  the United States and others   Kaeser said in a statement 
Proponents of the bloc s strict merger regime  however  argue such changes could lead to opaque and unpredictable rules  The Commission has approved over 3 000 mergers in the past 10 years and blocked only nine  including those on Wednesday 
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Siemens and Alstom s argument about merging to compete with their bigger Chinese state owned rival CRRC in the European market 
 We don t see the Chinese coming  The Chinese are nowhere  not at all in Europe   she told a news conference 
Shares in Siemens were little changed by the announcement  which was widely expected  However  Alstom stock gained more than 4 percent  Broker Berenberg said the market had been overly focused on the potential benefits of the rail merger  and ignoring that Alstom s earnings could double by 2025 
Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart Lafarge told reporters the company was looking into new avenues for expansion  saying future growth would be  more organic  
 Graphic  Alstom and Siemens shares    
INSUFFICIENT CONCESSIONS
Siemens and Alstom had wanted to combine their rail operations to compete more effectively with CRRC globally  backed by the French and German governments  which favor creating industrial champions 
However  Vestager said she blocked the deal to protect competition in the European railway industry 
 Without sufficient remedies  this merger would have resulted in higher prices for the signaling systems that keep passengers safe and for the next generations of very high speed trains   she said 
In the copper case  Vestager said rolled copper would become even more important in an age of electrical vehicles 
She said the companies in both deals were not willing adequately to address the regulator s competition concerns and their concessions fell short 
The rail deal also triggered criticism from national competition agencies in Germany  Britain  Spain  Belgium and the Netherlands 
Siemens makes the ICE  NYSE ICE  trains for Deutsche Bahn and also builds units for Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar  Alstom is the manufacturer of France s signature bullet train  locally known as the TGV  The rolling stock maker also sells urban and suburban trains as well as signaling systems 
Canadian rival Bombardier welcomed the Commission s decision 
 It would have severely undermined the health and competitiveness of the whole European rail market  leaving European consumers  both as rail users and tax payers  to pay the price   said Daniel Desjardins  Bombardier general counsel and company secretary 

Bombardier  which sources say also held talks with Siemens in 2017  would have faced a rival with operations more than double its size in the European market  even though the merged group  in revenue terms  would only have been half the size of CRRC ",2019-02-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eu-rejects-siemens-and-alstom-aurubis-and-wieland-mergers-1770643,1770643

agreement with the bloc to ensure an orderly departure  London is Europe s biggest financial center  with the EU its top export market  meaning that without contingency arrangements markets  banking  asset management and insurance across Europe would be left in chaos   But preparations are underway on both sides of the Channel to avoid the worst effects of any no deal Brexit  TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDS Britain is approving a law that would allow branches of EU banks and insurers in Britain to continue serving UK customers  giving them time to apply for permanent authorization  After the EU refused to reciprocate to cover British banks doing business with European clients  EU states have begun taking unilateral action  Germany  Italy  France  the Netherlands  Sweden  Luxembourg  Ireland and Norway are planning to allow UK financial firms to keep undertaking limited business for a fixed period of time after March if there is no deal  giving breathing space for new EU banking and insurance hubs to get bedded down  British and EU regulators have agreed pacts to exchange information and cooperate on supervision in the event of a no deal Brexit to avoid immediate disruption to cross border activity in derivatives clearing  credit ratings agencies  trade reporting venues and asset management  WHAT ARE THE BANKS UP TO  Many international banks use London as their European base but with the possibility of a hard Brexit in the short term  and the likelihood of patchy EU access from Britain in future  they are moving to open hubs in the bloc by March 29  The banks  which trade stocks  bonds  repos and derivatives  are moving 800 billion pounds of assets to make their new hubs in Frankfurt and Paris operational by next month  according to consultancy EY  The new hubs will be allowed to continue booking some trades centrally in London for now  on condition they build up activities and staffing within their new operations over the next few years  LLOYD S OF BRUSSELS Lloyd s of London insurance market has opened a Brussels subsidiary to write European policies and avoid potential disruption to EU customers  Insurers like AIG  NYSE AIG  are shifting blocks of policies from EU customers to new hubs in the EU to become Brexit proof by March  EU insurance watchdog EIOPA has calculated there are 9 million customers across Europe still facing potential disruption to policies worth a collective 7 4 billion euros if there is a no deal Brexit  but say that is not likely to threaten financial stability and require EU contingency action  DERIVATIVES ON ICE  ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures in London is one of Europe s two main derivatives exchanges   the other is Eurex in Frankfurt   Unlike stock and bond trading platforms  ICE has no plans to shift trading to the continent  Instead it is obtaining permission from individual EU states like Germany and the Netherlands to allow customers there to continue trading on ICE in London  Banks are shifting some outstanding derivatives contracts for EU customers from London to new hubs in the bloc  DELEGATION WINS A REPRIEVE Asset managers in Britain feared that a no deal Brexit would stop them from managing funds listed in Luxembourg  Dublin and elsewhere in Europe  a cross border activity known as delegation  But regulators from Britain and the EU agreed a pact this month to share information in the event of a no deal Brexit to allow delegation to continue  triggering a huge sigh of relief in the sector   nL5N1ZV5A7  SHARES GOING DUTCH London based Cboe Europe  the biggest pan European stock exchange  is opening a new hub in Amsterdam to which its trading in euro denominated shares will move from the start of April  irrespective of what sort of Brexit is agreed  London Stock Exchange s pan European Turquoise platform is also opening a hub in Amsterdam by the end of March and could move trading in euro denominated shares there   Aquis is opening a new hub in Paris to which it will move its euro denominated share trading  Shifting trading could be followed by a similar relocation in some clearing to EuroCCP in the Netherlands  Cutting off Britain would  however  disrupt the operation of EU rules that ensure transparency in share trading   EURO BONDS AND REPOS RETURN TO THEIR ROOTS CME owned BrokerTec  a bond and repurchase agreement  repo  trading platform  is moving its 210 billion a day euro denominated trading to a new Amsterdam hub by March 18 to avoid splitting liquidity  even if there is a Brexit deal  Likewise  MTS will shift Italian bond trading from London to Italy  SPOT STAYS BUT FORWARDS FLEE Spot forex trading is set to stay in London even if there is a no deal Brexit  But CME unit EBS is moving foreign exchange forwards and swaps trading from London to Amsterdam by March 18  even if there is a Brexit deal   Likewise  Refinitiv is transferring its  300 billion a day forex derivatives trading to Dublin from London  while leaving its  100 billion a day spot trading in London  METALS IN FINE FETTLE FOR NOW The London Metal Exchange has applied to German and Dutch regulators for dispensation from the requirement to be licensed as a foreign trading venue so that customers in those two countries can continue using the UK based platform for trading copper  aluminum and other metals   No such license is required in France  Cyprus  Ireland or Norway  The EU has said if there is no deal  customers in the bloc could continue clearing their metals trades on LME for up to a year  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EURO CLEARING EXODUS  London dominates euro denominated derivatives clearing but it would be impossible to shift trillions of euros of contracts to the continent by March to avoid disruption from a no deal Brexit that could threaten financial stability  Brussels has acknowledged this by saying that in the event of a hard Brexit it would allow EU customers to continue using UK based clearing houses like LCH until the end of 2020 to give more time to shift positions  and for rival clearers like Eurex in Frankfurt to build up capacity

146634,368149,ICE,Oil Holds Near  54 as China Factory Data Reignites Growth Worry,news," Bloomberg     Oil held near  54 a barrel in New York as weak Chinese manufacturing data and persistent uncertainty over U S  China trade talks stoked concerns that slowing growth could hurt demand 
West Texas Intermediate futures were steady after rising more than 18 percent last month  A Chinese factory purchasing managers index for January fell to the lowest level in almost three years  showing the damage the trade war is doing to Asia s largest economy  The White House said progress had been made in talks  though didn t detail any new commitments from either side 
Oil is stuck below  55 a barrel even as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies cut production in an effort to bolster prices that sank almost 40 percent last quarter  Gains over the past month have been capped by continued uncertainty over whether the U S  and China can tamp down their trade conflict 
 We are seeing quite a bit of disappointment creeping into the market with the failure to move higher   said Ole Hansen  head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A S   For now the market seems to be adopting a wait and see approach on the demand side  which has yet to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown witnessed in recent months  
WTI crude for March delivery slipped 22 cents to  53 57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 8 35 a m  New York time  It dropped 44 cents to  53 79 on Thursday 
Brent for April settlement rose 13 cents to  60 97 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  and traded at a  6 95 premium to WTI for the same month  The March contract expired Thursday after climbing 24 cents to  61 89 
Weakening Sentiment
The Chinese manufacturing PMI fell more than expected to 48 3 last month  the latest evidence of a slump in factory sentiment across Asia  While the U S  Federal Reserve provided a reprieve to global markets this week by signaling a pause in interest rate hikes  it failed to assuage investor worries about the disruption to business orders and investment plans as the trade war drags on   
The U S  and China plan further discussions before a March 1 deadline when new tariffs kick in   Much work remains to be done   the White House said in a statement in which it reiterated its threat to raise levies on Chinese goods 
In Venezuela  the U S  moved to block state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA and its customers from using the U S  financial system in updated guidance on its sanctions  Any transactions with PDVSA  or any entity in which it has a controlling stake  involving U S  citizens or passing through the country s financial system must be wound down by April 28  the Treasury said 
The sanctions could directly halt 500 000 barrels a day of Venezuelan oil exports to the U S    Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   analyst Ed Morse wrote in a report  There s a 50 percent chance that the losses could near 1 million barrels a day  he said ",2019-02-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-holds-near-54-as-china-factory-data-reignites-growth-worry-1766541,1766541
146635,368150,ICE,Crude Oil Prices   Weekly Outlook  Feb  4   8,news,"Investing com   Oil traders will continue to monitor global crude supplies and the outlook for energy demand in the week ahead 
Futures rallied around 3  on Friday on signs that U S  sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply  while upbeat U S  jobs data strengthened expectations for higher fuel demand 
Data showing a weekly fall in the U S  rig count also contributed to gains  Drillers cut 15 oil rigs in the week to Feb  1  bringing the total count down to 847  the lowest since May 2018  according to energy services firm Baker Hughes 
It was the fourth time in the past five weeks that U S  energy firms had reduced the rig count  implying a potential slowdown in domestic production activity 
U S  West Texas Intermediate crude ended Friday s session up  1 47  or 2 7   at  55 26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  WTI earlier rose to its best level since Nov  21 at  55 66 
For the week  the U S  benchmark rose about 2 9   its fourth weekly gain in the past five weeks 
Meanwhile  international Brent crude on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange rallied  1 91  or around 3 2   to settle at  62 75 a barrel  It rose 1 8  for the week 
After ending 2018 in freefall  oil prices have gained roughly 15  since the start of the year 
Overall  the recent advance for the energy complex has been powered by evidence of a decline in global output 
Saudi Arabia led OPEC and its non member allies led by Russia agreed to collectively cut production by a total of 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  during the first six months of 2019 in an effort to stave off a global glut in supplies 
Venezuela is likely to stay in the headlines in the coming week  after the U S  Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state owned oil firm PDVSA  keeping tankers stuck at ports 
Fresh data on U S  commercial crude inventories and production activity will also capture the market s attention this week 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the main events likely to affect the oil market

The American Petroleum Institute is to publish its weekly update on U S  oil supplies 
Wednesday  Feb  6

146638,368153,ICE,Oil Holds Gains on Signs of Shale Slowdown as OPEC Output Falls,news," Bloomberg     Oil held gains near a two month high after data showed U S  production growth slowing at a time when OPEC cuts and American sanctions on Venezuela have already eased concerns over a supply glut 
Futures in New York edged lower after rising 2 7 percent on Friday  The number of active oil rigs in the U S  dropped to the lowest level in almost nine months  data released Friday by oilfield services provider Baker Hughes show  Crude output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries fell the most in two years in January  according to a Bloomberg survey of officials  analysts and ship tracking data 
Oil has rebounded this year as OPEC s production cuts have taken effect  clawing back more than half of its 40 percent slump last quarter  The rally has seen hedge funds slash bearish bets on crude  although gains are being capped by slowing global growth and uncertainty over the U S  China trade war  Venezuela has become the wildcard in the supply demand equation as its deepening political crisis threatens to weigh further on production 
 Rigs won t dramatically increase if crude prices continue to be in the  50s without a clear direction   said Jun Inoue  a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute Ltd   in Tokyo  While U S  sanctions on Venezuela  could support crude prices in the short run  supply from others may be able to compensate for the loss in the long term   he said 
Traders are watching how much Venezuelan production    at 1 27 million barrels a day in January  according to data compiled by Bloomberg    will be removed from the market after the U S  announced sanctions on the nation s state oil company last week  The U S  penalties could cut Venezuelan output by nearly 1 million barrels a day   Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   said in a Jan  31 note 
West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery fell 10 cents to  55 16 on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12 52 p m  in Tokyo  The contract increased  1 47 to  55 26 on Friday

Output from OPEC s 14 current members fell by 930 000 barrels a day last month to 31 02 million  according to the Bloomberg survey  Top exporter Saudi Arabia cut deeper than pledged  while its close allies the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait also made sizable reductions 
In the U S   working rigs drilling for oil fell by 15 to 847  the least since May  Baker Hughes said  The data showed the biggest drop in rigs among major U S  shale plays came from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  where the count dropped by three to 481 
The Trump administration moved to block Petroleos de Venezuela SA and its customers from using the U S  financial system in updated guidance on its sanctions  Any transactions with PDVSA  or any entity in which it has a controlling stake  involving U S  citizens  or passing through the country s financial system  must be wound down by April 28  the Treasury said ",2019-02-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-holds-gains-on-signs-of-shale-slowdown-as-opec-output-falls-1767847,1767847

Antonelli thinks we are in a middle of a cyclical bear market but that the economy is not heading into a recession  pointing out strong car sales 
 The market is slowly churning  as investors rotate from one sector to another  When we see that transports banks rebound decisively  and defensive sectors stop seeing continued flows  that will mean the market is on the way higher   he said

The surprise rise in the fourth quarter GDP growth in Canada sent the loonie nearly to 75 cent against the US dollar  The loonie has been steadily gaining since the end of January  and the recovery in oil prices explains an important part of the current appreciation  Should WTI take over the  35 level  there will be little reason to pull the loonie back from appreciating over 75 cents against the US dollar  aiming for a rise toward the 80 cent level

In the US  Donald Trump won seven Super Tuesday states  whilst Ted Cruz got two victories  and Hillary Clinton moved closer to securing her place as the likely Democratic presidential candidate  Back on Wall Street  and US manufacturing data showed slight expansion in February and revived expectations that the US economy may still be in better shape than many think

146664,368179,ICE,Oil Prices Tumble 2  as U S  Crude Output Hits All Time High,news,"Investing com   Oil prices tumbled on Thursday  as news of U S  crude production rising to an all time high added to worries of a new glut forming 
U S  West Texas Intermediate crude futures for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell  1 15  or around 2 2   to  51 16 a barrel by 8 20AM ET  13 20 GMT  
Elsewhere  Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Exchange in London slumped  1 16  or about 1 9   to  60 16 a barrel 
Prices weakened after the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported Wednesday that U S  crude oil production reached a record 11 9 million barrels per day in the week ending Jan  11  up from 11 7 million bpd a week earlier 
That increase threatens to nullify most of the effect of output cuts led by OPEC and Russia that were announced at the end of last year 
OPEC s monthly report released earlier suggested that output from outside the group   notably from U S  shale operators   will rise so much this year that the production cuts OPEC agreed recently with Russia and others will scarcely be enough to keep the global market in balance  OPEC s own oil output fell by 751 000 bpd to 31 6 million bpd in December  driven by a large decline in Saudi output and by supply disruptions in Libya and Iran  
Worries over a global economic slowdown  which some analysts believe will turn into a recession  also weighed on prices Thursday

146665,368180,ICE,Shutdown is starting to hurt Trump s financial deregulation agenda,news,"By Pete Schroeder  Suzanne Barlyn and Michelle Price WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government shutdown over President Donald Trump s call for Congress to fund a wall he promised to build on the U S   Mexican border is threatening another campaign pledge to make rules easier to navigate for banks and corporations   The partial shutdown  sparked by a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over how to address Trump s demand  is already the longest ever  entering its 27th day on Thursday with no signs of a resolution  The Trump administration has outlined plans to ease bank rules  overhaul corporate governance  and boost financial innovation  sparking hopes among executives that they would already start to feel the benefits this year  Yet with Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the 2020 presidential campaign expected to stymie policymaking  industry lobbyists worry the shutdown will further limit the narrow window for the new rules to kick in  Of particular concern is the fate of rules being penned by regulators to implement changes  passed by the Republican Congress last May  that relaxed restraints imposed on banks after the financial crisis  said lobbyists and regulatory sources  Republican lawmakers had expected many of those changes would be close to the finish line by now  but several have yet to be put to public comment  This step  among others  is part of a strict rule changing process dictated by federal law that cannot be easily expedited once the government reopens   Given many of the changes face opposition from consumer groups  lawyers say any hiccups in their implementation could expose them to litigation and delay them indefinitely   While there is an image of folks coming in and cutting red tape  for better or worse that is not the way our legal process works and the government shutdown really impedes that process   said Ben Olson  a lawyer with Buckley Sandler who previously worked for several agencies including the Federal Reserve  At the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC   whose budgets are set by Congress  less than a tenth of staff continue to work in areas such as law enforcement  market surveillance and investor protection while all non emergency rule making is suspended  The CFTC  for example  was scheduled to agree rules that would pave the way for Intercontinental Exchange  N ICE  to begin trading digital currency futures in coming weeks  but that timeline is now unrealistic  according to a person familiar with the CFTC s original plan  With no SEC staff available to approve paperwork  initial public offerings are getting backed up  said lawyers  Brokers are also unable to get critical guidance on whether some trades are compliant  said Marlon Paz  a Washington based lawyer who advises financial firms   I fear there is little oversight in tumultuous times   Although the three banking regulators are funded independently  lobbyists say the shutdown may derail their work on rule changes overseen jointly with the SEC

Futures rallied around 3  on Friday following reports suggesting both countries were considering concessions ahead of a Washington visit from Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Jan  30 and 31 for talks aimed at resolving the ongoing U S  China trade standoff 
The biggest weekly decline in the U S  oil rig count in nearly three years  based on Baker Hughes data  also contributed to oil s gains on Friday

It was the third straight weekly decline in the rig count and the largest weekly drop since February 2016  suggesting a slowdown in domestic crude production 
That followed a report Thursday from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  which revealed that the group s output fell by 751 000 barrels to 31 6 million barrels a day in December 
The decline was driven by a large voluntary reduction in Saudi output  as well as supply disruptions from Libya and Iran

146685,368201,ICE,Oil Heads for Biggest Weekly Gain Since 2017 as Saudis Pump Less,news," Bloomberg     Brent crude headed for its biggest weekly gain since July 2017 as hints that OPEC s production cuts outweighed concerns over the health of the global economy 
The global benchmark is on track for an 9 3 percent advance this week after rebounding Friday from earlier losses  Prices have rallied on speculation that Saudi Arabia slowed pumping even before OPEC s deal to reduce output went into effect  That s added to bullish sentiment from progress in trade talks between the world s biggest economies and helped offset wider stock market turmoil driven by fears of a slowdown in China 
Oil s positive start to 2019 follows its worst quarter in four years and a 20 percent annual loss driven by panic over a growing glut of crude  While OPEC s output plunged by the most in almost two years last month and producers have pledged to curb supplies through the first half of 2019  concerns about the oversupply prevail as stockpiles at America s main storage hub show signs of swelling 
 While crude seemed to have bottomed out and is expected to edge higher  there s a possibility for additional drops along the way  driven by seasonal factors and risks from wider financial markets   said Hong Sungki  a commodities trader at NH Investment   Securities Co  in Seoul   Still  oil rebounded yesterday  shaking off the slump in equities  which is an encouraging sign  
Brent for March settlement rose as much as  1 11  or 2 percent  to  57 06 a barrel on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  after earlier falling as much as 1 1 percent  The benchmark crude was at  57 a barrel at 8 13 a m  in London

146687,368203,ICE,Oil Set for Biggest Weekly Gain in Two Years as Rebound Persists,news," Bloomberg     Oil headed for its biggest weekly gain in over two years on hopes that OPEC will manage to shrink a glut and trade tensions between the U S  and China will ease 
Futures in New York have advanced 9 5 percent this week  as Saudi Arabia pledged that a producer coalition it s leading will keep the market in balance  Still  prices are about 30 percent lower than their highs in October even after a rebound since Christmas Eve thrust crude back into a bull market  That signals investors need reassurance that the group will curb supply sufficiently and demand will hold up 
Crude s direction in coming weeks may be determined by whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia implement output cuts they have promised for the first six months of 2019  Also crucial will be the outcome of trade negotiations between the U S  and China    the world s two biggest economies  A deal between the nations could boost flagging global growth that underpins oil demand 
 Oil has had a good rally as Saudi Arabia s willingness to move forward with cutting output was clearly delivered to the market   said Hong Sungki  a commodities trader at NH Investment   Securities Co  in Seoul   But the trade negotiations between the U S  and China still add some uncertainty to global financial and oil markets  possibly leading to corrections in prices in the shorter term

Saudi Arabia attempted to assure the market that the production curbs by the OPEC  coalition will be in place  stating that the world s top oil exporter has already curtailed its output  The Middle Eastern producer s energy minister  Khalid Al Falih  also said that the pledged reductions of 1 2 million barrels a day are  more than sufficient to balance the market  
While recent progress seen in U S  China talks has lifted investor sentiment  global financial markets are still struggling to decipher what exactly may have been promised in their negotiations this week  China s Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday that the talks between the two sides were  extensive  in depth and detailed  and laid foundation for a resolution  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is likely to travel to the U S  later this month to meet with U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

146738,368254,ICE,Oil Surges on Saudi Russia Agreement  Alberta Production Curb,news," Bloomberg     Oil rebounded from the biggest monthly loss in a decade after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to extend their deal to manage the oil market into 2019 and Canada s largest oil producing province ordered an unprecedented output cut 
Brent rose as much as 5 3 percent in London  after prices collapsed more than 20 percent last month  Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the extension after a meeting Saturday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 with Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  though Moscow and Riyadh have yet to confirm any fresh output cuts  Oil also gained after Alberta ordered curbs of 325 000 barrels a day in an effort to ease a crisis in the nation s energy industry and after the U S  and China agreed to pause new tariffs 
Crude collapsed into a bear market last month on fears over a supply glut after America granted waivers to some nations to keep importing Iranian oil  Traders have been watching closely if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners will curb output at their meeting this week in Vienna to stabilize prices  While OPEC delegates said the leaders have given their political blessing for an agreement  plenty of work is left  including on the size of any potential output cut 
 While we still need to know by how much OPEC will curb its production  Putin s comment does clear a barrier for OPEC in stabilizing prices as Russia has been ambiguous about its stance   Ahn Yea Ha  a commodities analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co   said by phone from Seoul   At the same time  oil s being supported by easing trade tensions between the U S  and China as it s improving investor sentiment for risk assets  
Brent for February settlement gained as much as  3 14 to  62 60 a barrel on London s ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  and traded at  62 51 at 11 38 a m  in Seoul  The global benchmark crude was at an  8 64 premium to West Texas Intermediate for the same month  The January contract expired on Friday after declining 1 3 percent

 This might be the critical breakthrough for OPEC and non OPEC to cut   said Derek Brower  a director at consultant RS Energy Group   But the details are now what matter    how much will be cut  from when  for how long and  crucially  from what baselines  
Saudi Arabia said through its state owned press agency that Riyadh and Moscow had held talks in Buenos Aires about  rebalancing  the oil market  While both talked about progress and extension of the cooperation  neither the Russians nor Saudis made any formal declaration about output volumes 
Further Boost
Meanwhile  Alberta s decision to curtail output gave a further boost to prices  The unprecedented step  announced Sunday  will reduce production of raw crude and bitumen by 8 7 percent starting in January until the levels of excess oil in storage are drawn down  The reduction would then drop to 95 000 barrels a day until the end of next year at the latest 
The amount being cut is more than the total production of each of OPEC s three smallest members  Equatorial Guinea  Gabon and the Republic of Congo

146742,368258,ICE,Brexit Derivatives Brinkmanship Pits U K  Firms Against Brussels,news," Bloomberg     U K  derivatives clearing giants including a unit of  London Stock Exchange  Group  LON LSE  Plc are pushing the European Union to guarantee that they ll be able to continue serving the bloc s biggest banks in the event of a no deal Brexit  according to people with knowledge of the firms  positions 
The European Commission  the EU s executive arm  has to provide legal certainty on the clearing of trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts before Christmas or the U K  firms will have to notify their EU members to close out their positions  two of the people said  That echoes the Bank of England s call for the EU to spell out its plans by mid December 
The commission wrote to LSE  Intercontinental Exchange Inc  and the London Metal Exchange last week to assure them that all the necessary measures will be in place and effective on March 30  the U K  s first day outside the EU   These efforts adequately address the identified potential risks  and  remove any legal argument  about the need for clearing members to close out positions  according to one of the emails seen by Bloomberg 
The emails didn t provide the legal certainty that the the U K  clearinghouses need  the people said  Ideally  they d like to have an official decision on the books this month  the people said  requesting anonymity to discuss the private talks with the commission

Spokespeople for LSE  ICE  NYSE ICE   LME  the European Commission and the BOE  which supervises the clearinghouses  all declined to comment 
Clearinghouses such as LSE s LCH Ltd  stand between the two sides of derivatives trades and hold collateral from both in case a member defaults  LCH s dominance of euro derivatives clearing made the issue a flash point in the Brexit talks  as EU politicians said more of that lucrative activity should take place within the single market 
The clearinghouses say they need an ironclad guarantee because their own rules require them to give three months  notice to members before they stop providing services  Since Brexit is scheduled for March 29  the firms  real deadline comes at the end of this month 
 Clearinghouses are in a difficult situation   said Pauline Ashall  a partner at Linklaters   U K  clearinghouses will put as much pressure on to ensure the process is expedited  It s in no one s interest for EU clearing members to be kicked off  U K  clearinghouses  she said 
Legal Risk
EU clearing members have over the counter derivative contracts with U K  clearinghouses with a gross notional value of 60 trillion pounds   76 trillion   45 trillion pounds of which will mature after March  according to the BOE  For example   Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  connects to LCH and LME Clear in this way  said two of the people  A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment 
Without a fix  EU banks won t legally be able to clear contracts in London after a disorderly divorce  the central bank has said 
In the letters to clearinghouse executives  the commission said an equivalence decision covering U K  clearing  will be adopted in time to apply from the date of the U K  s withdrawal from the EU   The letter explains that this is the  first date  on which equivalence could be formally granted  since the procedure only applies to non EU countries 
Equivalence    a judgment that a non EU country s rules and supervision are as robust as the EU s    is part of the procedure the bloc uses to grant foreign firms access to the single market  Firms must also gain  recognition  from the EU markets regulator  In the letters  the commission said these recognition decisions will also be ready for Brexit day ",2018-12-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brexit-derivatives-brinkmanship-pits-uk-firms-against-brussels-1709170,1709170

146749,368265,ICE,OPEC Cut Throws Wrench Into Record Short Selling Streak for Oil,news," Bloomberg     OPEC s surprise output reduction has wrong footed short sellers 
Hedge funds increased wagers against rising Brent crude prices for a 10th straight week in the period that ended last Tuesday and cut bullish bets on West Texas Intermediate oil to the lowest in almost six years  Then on Friday  OPEC and its allies surprised the market with a bigger than expected cut  leaving money managers to wonder if they d made a costly error 
 Now that we ve seen this fundamental shift in the market  I would expect there to be good support down at these prices levels and lead those newly established shorts to start covering   said Ryan Fitzmaurice  an energy strategist at Rabobank 
On Monday at least  short sellers didn t seem to suffer for their pessimism  Brent futures fell 2 8 percent to  59 97 a barrel in London trading while WTI closed down 3 1 percent  Traders wondered how quickly Russia and other signatories to the deal would cut  while new spending plans from  Hess Corp   NYSE HES   and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  underscored the resilience of U S  production 
 It s going to take the Russians quite some time to get their reductions done and U S  production is still scheduled to rise   said Thomas Finlon  director at Energy Analytics Group Ltd  in Florida   It doesn t paint a helpful picture  
After much back and forth between producers in Vienna  OPEC and allies agreed to collectively cut production by 1 2 million barrels a day  with the cartel shouldering 800 000 barrels a day  Saudi Arabia had previously said a 1 million barrel a day cut was the likely scenario  The agreement will be reviewed in April 
Hedge funds  net long position    the difference between bets on higher Brent prices and wagers on a drop    declined 19 percent to 136 466 contracts  ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe data show for the week ended Dec 4  That s the least bullish since August 2015  Longs slid 6 6 percent  while shorts jumped 14 percent to the highest since July 2017 
Net long bets on WTI slid 17 percent  the U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday  Long only wagers were down 6 6 percent to the lowest level since March 2013  while bearish bets climbed 15 percent for the week 
After OPEC s announcement   people will start to be a little more comfortable deploying net length into the sector   said Chris Kettenmann  chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC   OPEC has basically said  we ve got you  we re going to take down production  
Ahead of OPEC s deal  observers were also focusing on how tense the market has been  Implied volatility for second month West Texas Intermediate futures hit a 2016 high late last month before slowly creeping lower 
Volatility at these levels is  untenable for not only market participants  but industry participants needing to deploy capex into next year   said Kettenmann   OPEC is doing what they should do  managing volatility to attract capital back to the sector  
But  some remain skeptical that the deal is enough to make a dramatic change in the oil market 
 A fair question the market has to ask now is  will this be enough   said Rob Haworth  who helps oversee about  151 billion at U S  Bank Wealth Management in Seattle   Are there enough signs that this  50  55 price range is low enough to limit the growth of U S  shale production so 1 2 million barrels is enough  and will it be enough in the face of what we see as a slowing global economic environment

Global oil prices are down by around 20  since early October  buffeted by signs of growing output from key producers  mainly the U S   Saudi Arabia and Russia  and indications of a global economic slowdown 
The drop marks a stunning reversal from last month  when oil prices hit nearly four year highs as the market braced for potential shortages ahead of the restoration of sanctions against Iran  the third largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   on Nov  5 
The sanctions  however  are unlikely to cut as much oil out of the market as initially expected as Washington has granted exemptions to Iran s biggest buyers which will allow them to continue buying limited amounts of crude for at least another six months

The Saudis are taking the lead to counter a price rout  which has put pressure on OPEC and its allies including Russia to cut output as signs of a supply glut emerge in the U S     which is pumping at a record  Oil collapsed into a bear market as fears of a crunch eased after America granted waivers for some nations to continue buying Iranian crude even after the Trump administration hit the Middle East nation with sanctions 
Prices are gaining on rising expectations that OPEC producers including Saudi Arabia and allies will discuss and decide measures at their next meeting in December  said Takayuki Nogami  chief economist at Japan Oil  Gas and Metals National Corp  in Tokyo   A big factor is that Iran s supply isn t falling as much as expected at a time when other countries are pumping more  A risk of a supply glut is rising

Saudi Arabia may also struggle to convince other producers to follow its lead  Iraq has successfully boosted production to a record  and its more fragile economy may make it loathe to reverse course  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak showed no sign he was ready to act immediately  and said the market should be balanced by the middle of next year  though there are forecasts for a surplus of 1 million to 1 4 million barrels a day  he said ",2018-11-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-pares-bear-market-collapse-on-prospect-of-opec-curbs-in-2019-1683553,1683553
146818,368334,ICE,Oil s Collapse Deepens as Supply and Demand Concerns Roil Market,news," Bloomberg     Oil showed little sign of recovering from its unprecedented decline as investors flee a market hammered by swelling supplies and a darkening demand outlook 
Futures in New York held losses after plunging 7 1 percent in the previous session in the biggest one day drop in more than three years  OPEC warned demand for its crude is falling faster than expected  underlining why Saudi Arabia and some other members are signaling output cuts  Still  President Donald Trump s exhorting that the group shouldn t cut output is stoking concerns producers may not change course to prevent a glut 
Oil s record 12 session slide that s taken it into a bear market has been exacerbated by a U S  decision to grant some nations waivers from its sanctions  allowing them to continue buying some Iranian crude  Meanwhile  rising American output and inventories are pointing to an emerging glut and speculation is swirling over whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia to stem the price slump 
 President Trump will likely continue to keep OPEC in check  making it more difficult for OPEC and non OPEC nations to agree on production cuts   said Satoru Yoshida  a commodity analyst at Rakuten Securities Inc  in Tokyo  Meanwhile   as a prolonged U S  China trade war is now more likely  a slower demand growth scenario is not surprising  It was apparently factored into OPEC s monthly report  
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery declined as much as 55 cents to  55 14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  before trading unchanged at  55 69 at 12 26 p m  in Tokyo  The contract fell  4 24 on Tuesday  Total volume traded was more than double the 100 day average 
Brent for January settlement edged up 18 cents to  65 65 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  The contract slumped  4 65 to  65 47 a barrel on Tuesday  The global benchmark crude traded at a  9 79 premium to WTI for the same month 
Global demand for OPEC s oil will be about 31 5 million barrels a day next year  the group said in its monthly report  That s 500 000 barrels a day lower than its forecast just two months ago and about 1 4 million below current production  OPEC also cut its forecast for overall global oil demand growth by 70 000 barrel a day 
The group reported the worsening outlook as traders assess mixed signals on its next step  Following a closely watched meeting of OPEC and its allies in Abu Dhabi over the weekend that yielded no formal change in production policy  a producer committee warned that they may need  new strategies  
Top group member Saudi Arabia said output needs to curbed by about 1 million barrels a day from October levels  Still  OPEC secondary source data suggests the kingdom fully abandoned cuts for the first time in October  Meanwhile  another key producer Russia signaled it s not ready to act immediately  with Energy Minister Alexander Novak highlighting the need to wait and see how the market develops

146819,368335,ICE,Crude Treads Water as Saudi Sanctions Counter Stockpile Gains,news," Bloomberg     Oil prices rose slightly as tension over U S  sanctions against Saudi Arabia countered a jump in American crude stockpiles 
Futures in New York rose 0 4 percent after the Trump administration issued financial penalties against 17 top Saudi officials over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi  hours after the kingdom charged 11 people for the murder  The geopolitical strife outweighed a government report showing the biggest weekly crude storage increase since February 2017 
 These massive crude oil builds that we ve seen week after week in the U S  sucked all of the geopolitical risk out of the crude oil price   said Rob Thummel  managing director at Tortoise  which manages  16 billion in energy related assets  The announcement on sanctions  puts some risk back into the market  
Among the sanctioned officials was Saud al Qahtani  a former senior adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  The penalties freezing assets and limiting access to the U S  financial system came shortly after the U S  announced plans to end air refueling flights for the Saudi led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen 
Also boosting the price of crude oil is speculation of renewed OPEC supply cuts  The cartel and its partners are considering reducing output by more than the 1 million barrels a day that Saudi Arabia proposed earlier this week  people familiar with the matter said  Nonetheless  Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is happy with current prices 
Russia aims to continue cooperation with OPEC to stabilize the oil market  with existing efforts having shown  positive results   Putin said 
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 21 cents to  56 46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Total volume traded Thursday was about 12 percent above the 100 day average 
Brent for January settlement climbed 50 cents to  66 62 a barrel on the London based ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  The global benchmark crude was at a  9 94 premium to WTI for the same month

Global oil prices have lost roughly a quarter of their value since early October in what has become one of the biggest declines since a price collapse in 2014  with surging supply and the specter of faltering demand scaring off investors 
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  meet on Dec  6 in Vienna to decide on production policy for the next six months 
OPEC officials have been making increasingly frequent public statements that the cartel and its partners would start withholding crude in 2019 to tighten supply and prop up prices 
Saudi Arabia  OPEC s de facto leader  wants the cartel to slash production by about 1 4 million barrels per day  bpd   according to recent reports

Meanwhile  the global benchmark  Brent crude for January delivery on the ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe exchange  tacked on 14 cents to end at  66 76 a barrel 
It lost about 4 8  for the week 
Looking ahead  fresh weekly data on U S  commercial crude inventories to gauge the strength of demand in the world s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise will capture the market s attention

146852,368368,ICE,U S  House within Democrats  grasp  Senate a long shot,news,"By Tim Reid and Ginger Gibson  Reuters    After two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington  the Democratic Party faces a strong chance of winning control of the U S  House of Representatives in next week s election  with Republicans likely to keep the Senate  Taking a majority in even one of the chambers in the Nov  6 elections would give Democrats a chance to more effectively oppose Republican President Donald Trump s agenda  as well as potentially launch investigations into his administration  Republicans hold a 23 seat majority in the 435 seat House  far wider than their two seat majority in the 100 seat Senate  but are more vulnerable in the lower chamber where they are defending 41 seats without an incumbent on the ballot  the most since 1930  In the Senate  which gives more voice to the rural voters who make up an important part of the Republican base  Democrats are defending 10 seats in states that Trump won in 2016  some by huge margins  That favors Republicans  Several states have experienced unusually high levels of early voting  according to data from the University of Florida  WHAT ARE THE PARTIES FOCUSED ON  Democrats have focused their closing messaging on defending the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  and its protection of insurance coverage for people with pre existing conditions  Republicans have played up the Senate s recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh  Trump s second nominee to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court  which cemented a 5 4 conservative majority  Trump has also focused attention on immigration issues  including a caravan of migrants from Central America headed through Mexico toward the U S  border   They  Democrats  misread the electorate in many areas  especially when it comes to the Senate   said Marc Lotter  a former top aide to Vice President Mike Pence   You have seen a big shift toward Republicans in many states that the president carried   WHY DO REPUBLICANS HAVE AN SENATE EDGE      Democrats  who last controlled the Senate in 2014  are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to protect five critical seats where incumbents are particularly vulnerable this year  Losing just one of the seats in West Virginia  Indiana  North Dakota  Montana and Missouri   all won by Trump in 2016   could doom any shot of taking the Senate  Opinion polls show toss up races in Indiana and Missouri  In Montana  which Trump carried by 20 percentage points  incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Tester leads recent polls by more than 4 points  In West Virginia  which Trump carried by over 40 percentage points  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin led by as much as 16 points in one recent poll  But in North Dakota  Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp has fallen far behind challenger Republican U S  Representative Kevin Cramer in recent polls  Republicans have sought to play up calls by some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  better known as ICE  NYSE ICE   and the angry crowds of protesters who swarmed the Capitol to object to the Supreme Court nomination of Kavanaugh  who was accused of a decades old sexual assault  While straining to hold all the states Trump won  Democrats are also focused on Florida  Arizona and Nevada  which strategists said would be crucial pickups for the party  HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN RAISED  One measure of the intensity of interest in this campaign season is fundraising  This year s congressional campaigns were on pace to break fundraising records for midterm elections  when Congress but not the White House is on the line  according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance disclosures  Democrats collectively out fundraised Republicans  Senate Democrats raised at least  551 million  while Republicans raised at least  368 million  House Democratic candidates raised at least  680 million  while Republicans raised at least  540 million  The total fundraising in each chamber topped what had been raised at the same point in the 2010 campaign cycle          WHICH PARTY HAS THE ADVANTAGE IN HOUSE RACES  In the House  Democrats are hoping they will overcome a disadvantage built into gerrymandered maps and capture seats designed to elect Republicans  Many of the seats in play are in suburban or urban districts that Trump lost in 2016      Internal Democratic polling shows that healthcare and the Republican tax cuts that some voters view as a giveaway to wealthy Americans and corporations are winning issues for Democrats this November  Healthcare has proven a particularly potent issue in the House  which had repeatedly voted to repeal Obamacare over the past eight years  Republicans have not given up their focus on the tax cut and continued economic recovery  Doug Thornell  a former spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  said that in tight Senate and House races  Republicans who have tried to rally Trump s base of supporters by aligning themselves with the president were paying a price with independent voters     Republicans  really don t have much of a choice  They have to embrace him  or they suffer the consequences   Thornell said   When they embrace him  it turns off a whole bunch of voters they need to win

146854,368370,ICE,Trump hardens stance on Mexico border  says 15 000 troops could be sent,news,"By Jeff Mason and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States could send as many as 15 000 troops to the border with Mexico  as he hardens his stance against a caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America 
The numbers cited by Trump are significantly higher than defense officials have disclosed  The Pentagon said on Monday it was deploying more than 5 200 troops to the border but that the number would rise  On Wednesday  it said more than 7 000 troops would support the Department of Homeland Security along the border 
Several groups  including the American Civil Liberties Union  have accused Trump of politicizing the military ahead of next week s congressional elections with his plans to use active military personnel to buttress border patrol efforts 
 As far as the caravan is concerned  our military is out     We ll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15 000 military personnel  on top of Border Patrol  ICE  NYSE ICE  and everybody else at the border   Trump told reporters at the White House 
Trump did not say how many of those 15 000 would be National Guard  There are already 2 100 U S  National Guard forces at the border  sent after a previous Trump request in April  and they are authorized to go up to 4 000 
If 15 000 troops were drawn into the effort  it would mean there would be more U S  troops on the border with Mexico than there are in Afghanistan  which has become America s longest conflict 
Trump has sought to use immigration as an issue to motivate Republican voters ahead of the Nov  6 elections  where Republicans will seek to maintain control of both congressional chambers 
As a presidential candidate before the U S  election in 2016  Trump promised to harden immigration laws and build a wall along the southern border with Mexico  but implementation of his signature campaign promise has been slow 
A caravan of Central American migrants estimated to number at least 3 500 people left Honduras in mid October and is now in southern Mexico on its way to the U S  border 
 WE DON T DO STUNTS 
Before Trump s comments  U S  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday rejected criticism that deploying thousands of troops to the border with Mexico was a political stunt 
 The support that we provide to the secretary for homeland security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police  so we don t do stunts in this department   Mattis said after a meeting with his South Korean counterpart at the Pentagon 
Republican lawmakers and other Trump supporters have applauded the deployment  But critics argue Trump has manufactured a crisis to drive Republican voters to the polls 
 The move to send 5 200 active duty troops to the southern border is a craven political stunt that sets a bad precedent and is arguably an abuse of power   said Kelly Magsamen  a former senior Pentagon official who is currently with the Center for American Progress left leaning think tank 
Trump s decision to call in the military appears to be a departure from past practice  In recent years  such operations have been carried out by National Guard forces  largely part time military members often called upon to respond to domestic emergencies 
A U S  official told Reuters that as of Wednesday the Pentagon had identified more than 7 000 active duty troops  which included about 2 000 on standby  that could be deployed to the border with Mexico if needed 

Many basic questions remained unanswered days after the Pentagon announcement  including the scope of the mission as well as the Pentagon s assessment of any threat posed by arriving migrants ",2018-10-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-hardens-stance-on-mexico-border-says-15000-troops-could-be-sent-1668639,1668639

147021,368537,ICE,U S  SEC approves request to list quadruple leveraged ETFs,news,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK  Reuters    The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday approved a request to trade quadruple leveraged exchange traded funds  marking a first for the growing market for such products in the United States 
The request to list ForceShares Daily 4X US Market Futures Long Fund  under the ticker UP  and ForceShares Daily 4X US Market Futures Short Fund  under the ticker DOWN  was filed by Intercontinental Exchange Inc s  N ICE  NYSE Arca exchange 
One of the funds is designed to deliver 400 percent of the daily performance of S P 500  SPX  stock index futures  while another fund will aim to deliver four times the inverse of that benchmark  That means a fund could go up 8 percent on a day the index it tracks falls by 2 percent 
ETFs offering three times leverage already trade in the United States  but more reactive products have been limited to listing in Europe 
 We re excited about it   said Sam Masucci  chief executive officer at Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC  which is distributing the product  though he said the product is  not going to be for everybody 
 But for those people that are looking for the leveraged exposure to the S P and they re not looking to do it by way of a futures product here you have a publicly listed security   Masucci said 
Regulators  move to approve the products comes after a difficult time for sponsors of more exotic ETFs 
Last year  the SEC presented draft rules that would restrict the use of derivatives  which was seen crimping some fund managers  ability to keep highly leveraged products on the market 
In March  the agency ruled against an application by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to bring the first Bitcoin ETF to market  although the SEC recently said it would review that decision 
The U S  Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the SEC  a change in leadership that could prompt a change in tack by the agency through which investment products come to market 
Douglas Yones  a top NYSE ETF official  said in an emailed statement that he hopes the approval  paves the way for us to work with other leveraged product issuers over the rest of the year

147042,368558,ICE,New City of London group to help government with Brexit talks,news,"By Huw Jones
LONDON  Reuters    Veterans of the City of London s financial services industry are setting up a forum to help the British government in Brexit talks with the European Union  people involved in the project said on Thursday 
Britain s shock vote to leave the bloc has forced financial firms to rethink their business strategy which has until now depended on having an EU  passport  to operate across the region from a base in London 
Daniel Hodson  a former chief executive of London derivatives exchange LIFFE which is now part of ICE  N ICE   said the new group   initially known as City United   aimed to bring together under one roof those in the financial sector who backed and opposed Brexit 
Hodson was director of Vote Leave which campaigned for Brexit in last month s referendum 
He said other members of the group included another City of London veteran  Anthony Belchambers  a former head of the Futures and Options Association  Graham Bishop  a pro EU consultant who has advised EU institutions  is also a member 
 There is a need to bring those who supported both sides together in an effective way that recognizes the political reality of the situation   Hodson told Reuters 
The group  which will be renamed the Financial Services Negotiation Forum  will have a formal launch in September 
The City of London Corporation  which administers the capital s  Square  NYSE SQ  Mile  financial district had backed staying in the EU  TheCityUK  which promotes Britain s financial sector  had warned that Brexit could damage competitiveness 
Hodson said it was clear from government statements that continued full membership of the EU s single market was not on the table and therefore the financial sector must come up with a common position to help the government with trade talks 
 We will be independent and fact based     TheCityUK will play a very important part and we will be working with them   Hodson said 
Other supporters of the new group spoke of  bitterness and angst flying around the City  and the need to get coherence around what needs to be done between the leave and remain camps 
Richard Tice  chief executive of Quidnet Capital and who co chaired the referendum campaign group Leave EU  said the referendum result was clear and bodies like the City of London should get on with making it work 
The City of London Corporation and TheCityUK had no comment 
The Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment  CISI  said on Tuesday that since the referendum  financial sector had lacked a loud and visible champion communicator at a time of great uncertainty 
 There have been a number of discussions beneath the radar  but that s not good enough   CISI Chief Executive Simon Culhane said in a statement 
 Instead there has been almost total silence and zero direction or reassurance   Culhane said ",2016-07-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/new-city-of-london-group-to-help-government-with-brexit-talks-415837,415837

147070,368586,ICE,ICE may have more time to consider bid for London bourse,news,"By Sophie Sassard and Huw Jones LONDON  Reuters     London Stock Exchange  Group  LON LSE  and Deutsche Boerse  DE DB1Gn  may have to delay a vote on their proposed merger until after Britain s EU referendum  handing more time to Intercontinental Exchange  N ICE  to decide whether to make a counter bid for the British bourse   LSEG had been expected to hold a special shareholder meeting to approve the merger with Deutsche Boerse before Britain votes on June 23 on whether to quit the EU  ICE would have to file any counterbid seven days before that meeting   with Britain s future in the European Union still very much in doubt  For American ICE  the London Stock Exchange would be a more attractive target within the European Union   Deutsche Boerse still needs to file a full set of merger documents with its German regulators  a convoluted process that probably cannot be done now before the referendum date   Sources familiar with the matter say LSEG may delay its shareholder meeting until this process is completed to ensure regulators are happy  though no decision has been taken and LSEG may still move early  The London bourse could also risk a backlash among its investors by asking them to vote on the Deutsche Boerse deal before a possible Brexit  even though the two European exchanges have presented their proposed deal as  Brexit  proof given their combination would straddle the EU and Britain  should it leave   If the pair wait until after the referendum to try to seal their all share  merger of equals   uncertainty over Britain s future will have been removed  ICE will have more time to come up with a rival bid and win the backing of its shareholders   Departure from the bloc would create upheaval for London  Europe s biggest financial center where trillions of pounds of day to day business runs on EU rules   One person familiar with ICE said any counter bid would likely be a straightforward takeover in the form of shares and some cash  and at a premium that is  reasonably higher than Deutsche Boerse s    This would put pressure on Deutsche Boerse to sweeten its deal   which currently offers LSEG shareholders 0 4421 shares in the combined group per LSEG share they own   by including a cash element or extra dividend   LSEG  ICE and Deutsche Boerse did not comment for this article  LEVERAGE QUESTION A takeover by ICE would create the world s biggest trading to clearing exchange group  crossing the Atlantic and trading and clearing stocks  derivatives  energy and commodities  ICE is a known quantity to UK regulators  It bought the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001 and later became owner of London based LIFFE derivatives exchange  rival of Deutsche Boerse s Eurex platform  as part of ICE s takeover of New York Stock Exchange Euronext in 2013  ICE  however  faces some thorny questions  could a combined business still be regionally attractive under a Brexit  can it afford a knock out offer  and would EU competition regulators approve a deal  Supporters of Deutsche Boerse s all share deal say ICE is too indebted to make a killer bid after paying  5 2 billion in December for data firm IDC  a view those close to ICE dismiss  ICE had a consolidated debt of  7 3 billion at the end of 2015  according to its annual report  But leaking news that ICE has lined up a group of banks to help finance a possible deal was a handy trial balloon to test the reaction of ICE shareholders  analysts said  It had no major negative impact on ICE s shares   They are very conscious of their own stock price  that they are a growth company  If they had not done the IDC deal  you would see this move a little quicker   said Richard Daniels  senior analyst of TABB Group in New York   In any case  ICE would have a year or so to reduce its debt to core earnings ratio before it had to write a check for LSEG  ICE s supporters say  A banker not advising ICE said the company has the capacity to fund a takeover while repaying debt thanks to its high margins and proven record of creating value through acquisitions  ICE  however  is seen as having less scope than Deutsche Boerse to trumpet a big headline figure for synergies   Most Deutsche Boerse synergies would come from cuts in high tech jobs in Frankfurt  Half of the synergies will come from IT  ICE is leaner   a person familiar with ICE said  BREXIT PROOF  A combined ICE LSEG group would have operations in continental Europe and London to ease the impact of a Brexit  LSEG owns Borsa Italiana in Milan and LCH Clearnet  a clearing house based in Paris and London  However  to get round possible competition concerns and sweeten France  ICE could offload Borsa Italiana and the French Clearnet half of LCH Clearnet to Paris based exchange Euronext  TABB s Daniels said  Proceeds from such sales would also help ICE pay down debt while still leaving a combined LSEG ICE Group with ICE s existing euro zone trading and clearing operation in the Netherlands  Others are more skeptical that this would be enough   ICE faces the same antitrust concerns as Deutsche Boerse  which I feel are insurmountable when it comes to clearing in European derivatives   said Patrick Young  publisher of industry daily Exchange Invest  Under a Brexit  the European Central Bank would be expected to put pressure on market participants to shift euro denominated trading and clearing  currently a major chunk of London s business  to the single currency area  ICE s euro zone based operations are seen as too small and specialist for now to handle such large volumes in a short period  Deutsche Boerse has said its deal is Brexit proof  though some analysts doubt any deal can be and question whether the German exchange s shareholders would fall in line if Britain left the EU  
 If Brexit happened  that would likely prove a major issue and most likely a deal breaker for both deals   a banker close to exchanges said ",2016-05-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ice-may-have-more-time-to-consider-bid-for-london-bourse-399201,399201

147160,368676,ICE,Goldman  BASF  HSBC accused of metals price fixing  U S  lawsuit,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    Goldman Sachs Group Inc  N GS   Germany s BASF SE  DE BASFn  and two other big platinum and palladium dealers have been sued in the United States in what the plaintiff s law firm called the first nationwide class action over alleged price fixing of the metals 
In a complaint filed on Tuesday in the U S  District Court in Manhattan  units of Goldman  BASF  HSBC Holdings Plc  L HSBA  and South Africa s Standard Bank Group Ltd  J SBKJ  were accused of having conspired since 2007 to rig the twice daily platinum and palladium  fixings  and the prices of futures and options based on those fixings 
The plaintiff  Modern Settings LLC  a Florida based maker of jewelry and police badges  claimed metals purchasers lost millions of dollars 
The defendants illegally shared customer data  used that information to engage in  front running  of expected price moves  and manufactured phantom  spoof  orders  according to the plaintiff 
Platinum and palladium are used in catalytic converters to curb vehicle emissions  and are also used in dentistry and jewelry 
On Oct  16  the London Metal Exchange said it will on Dec  1 take charge of platinum and palladium price fixing  and use a new electronic platform 
The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd  HK 0388  unit said the platform would replace a benchmark system established in 1989  and run by Goldman  BASF  HSBC and Standard 
The complaint said such changes  have come too late  for Modern Settings and other prospective class members  The complaint seeks unspecified damages for the defendants  alleged violations of U S  antitrust and commodities laws 
Regulators around the world have tightened scrutiny of pricing benchmarks in recent years after uncovering evidence of rigging in currencies and the London Interbank Offered Rate 
The more stringent regulation has spawned new price setting platforms for gold  silver  platinum and palladium  Metals purchasers have filed similar lawsuits this year accusing banks of gold and silver price fixing 
Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally and HSBC spokeswoman Juanita Gutierrez declined to comment  Standard Bank declined to comment 
A spokeswoman for BASF  the world s largest chemicals maker  said the group could not comment because it had not been notified of a complaint 
BASF generated 2 36 billion euros   2 95 billion  in precious metals trading revenue last year  The London based trading business is part of BASF s Catalysts division  which is the world s largest maker of catalytic converters 
The law firm Labaton Sucharow represents Modern Settings 

The case is Modern Settings LLC v  BASF Metals Ltd et al  U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  No  14 09391
