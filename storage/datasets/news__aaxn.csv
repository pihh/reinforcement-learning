109219,330734,AAXN,Why Axon Enterprise Stock Dropped 10  This Morning,news,"What happened
Shares of police body camera and Taser maker Axon Enterprise  NASDAQ AAXN  stock tumbled more than 10  in early trading Friday before abruptly reversing course and clawing their way back to about a 4 6  loss as of 10 50 a m  EST 
Why 
This morning  Axon revealed that it has filed a suit against the US Federal Trade Commission  FTC  in federal court  alleging that the federal agency s structure and administrative procedures are unconstitutional  In effect  Axon has just sued one of its biggest customers  the United States government 

So what
Ordinarily that would be considered bad customer service  So why is Axon braving this move 
As the company explains in its press release  the FTC has challenged Axon s May 2018 acquisition of rival body camera maker Vievu for  7 million  According to the FTC  and others   the removal of Vievu from competition means that there is now  no one to effectively challenge  Axon s dominance of the body camera market in the U S  The FTC  charged with ensuring free competition  doesn t like that  and has told Axon that it must not only  divest the assets  it paid  7 million for two years ago but also  surrender its independently created intellectual property as part of a  blank check  to create a competing spin off  
Unless Axon complies  it says the FTC will start an administrative procedure  in which the FTC serves the simultaneous roles of prosecutor  judge and jury   and Axon argues this would be  an unconstitutional proceeding  depriving it of due process of law  Instead of that  Axon says it wants the opportunity to argue its case  in a fair and impartial court of law  
Now what
In addition to alleging violations of due process  under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution   Axon is also citing Articles II and III of the Constitution  which read in relevant parts that  the executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America   and  the judicial Power of the United States  shall be vested in one supreme Court  and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish   The implication here is that the FTC s taking on the roles of both prosecutor and judge jury violates the separation of executive and judicial powers 
It s hard to say whether these challenges will succeed  If they do  though  this lawsuit has the potential to remake  and significantly restrict  the FTC s powers    and give Axon a free ticket to the U S  Supreme Court before the matter is finally decided ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd72d,2052035

109222,330737,AAXN,Police body camera maker Axon sues U S  FTC over antitrust litigation,news,By Stephen Nellis  Reuters    Axon Enterprise Inc  O AAXN  on Friday sued the U S  Federal Trade Commission in a bid to have antitrust proceedings over an acquisition heard in a federal court and not in an internal FTC process  claiming that the FTC s ability to both prosecute and judge cases deprives companies of their constitutional rights  Axon  the manufacturer of Taser stun guns and body camera systems for police departments  said in its complaint that it has been cooperating with an FTC probe of its acquisition of Vievu for more than 18 months  Vievu was a smaller player in the market for body cameras and online storage and management of the footage they generate   In the complaint  filed in U S  District Court in Arizona  Axon denied that the Vievu deal was anticompetitive and said it  is eager to prove its case in any federal court in this country   But Axon cannot   and will not   accept the FTC s attempts to extort an irrational  settlement  through a biased adjudicative process that vests the Commission with the powers of prosecutor  judge  and jury in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees of the U S  Constitution   it said  Last month  Axon alleges  FTC officials told the company it would have to unwind the Vievu acquisition by divesting the assets and offering patent licenses to any potential acquirer  According to Axon  in a December 2019 face to face meeting with its attorney  the FTC threatened to start an internal administrative law proceeding this month to unwind the Vievu deal if Axon would not agree to the settlement  The FTC  in an administrative complaint filed late Friday afternoon  said the Vievu deal had reduced competition in the market for supplying body cameras to large police departments    The Commission is taking action to ensure that police officers have access to the cutting edge products they need to do their job  and police departments benefit from the lower prices and innovative products that competition had provided before the acquisition   Ian Conner  director of the FTC s Bureau of Competition  said in a statement  Axon Chief Executive Rick Smith responded that the company would stand by its effort to block an  unconstitutional  administrative process with the FTC  The FTC can choose to file antitrust actions either in a federal court or via an internal administrative law procedure  Axon alleges that FTC s internal administrative proceedings are unfair because they can only be appealed to the full FTC commission  While an FTC decision can be appealed to a federal appeals court  no new facts or evidence can be introduced  making it harder to overturn the case  Axon argued ,2020-01-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/taser-maker-axon-sues-us-federal-trade-commission-amid-antitrust-probe-2051790,2051790
109224,330739,AAXN,Why Shares of Axon Enterprise Gained 67  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Axon Enterprise  NASDAQ AAXN  climbed 67 5  in 2019  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  but investors had to stomach a good deal of volatility before it reached those highs  The company  formerly known as TASER International  has long been a target of skeptic bears  but by the end of 2019 Axon had gone a long way toward proving its bona fides as a growth stock 

AAXN vs  S P 500 data by YCharts
So what
Axon for years has been trying to pivot from simply offering nonlethal Taser weapons to law enforcement to a range of products and services including body cameras  cloud storage  and records management under brand names such as Evidence com  The company charges upward of  199 per month per officer for those services  providing steady and recurring subscription services instead of one time sales 
Axon reached its highs for the year after reporting third quarter earnings in November  disclosing recurring revenue up 39  year over year to  141 5 million and software seats up 32  to 428 600  Axon s hope is that by locking local police forces into its ecosystem  including its evidence storage products  the company s products will be sticky and hard to swap out for a rival s 

The company also increased full year revenue guidance by  15 million to  500 million  510 million 
The third quarter results also helped ease investor concerns over a second quarter miss that Axon said was due to about  6 million worth of Tasers and cartridges that couldn t be delivered because of production issues 
Now what
Axon started the new year off with more volatility  with shares falling more than 10  on Jan  3 after the company filed suit against the U S  Federal Trade Commission over FTC concerns about Axon s 2018 acquisition of body camera maker Vievu 
Distractions and volatility have become standard issue for Axon shareholders  but the potential for this business is undeniable  and the company still has a large  untapped market to grow into  If you can look past the drama  this is a stock with exciting long term potential ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pg0is,2056261
109229,330744,AAXN,Axon Enterprise Clashes With FTC Over Vievu Acquisition,news,"Although Axon Enterprise  NASDAQ AAXN  purchased body camera maker Vievu nearly two years ago  the Federal Trade Commission only recently alleged that the acquisition reduced competition in the marketplace  Now  it wants Axon to divest certain assets to restore equity to the marketplace 
Axon sees it differently  though  In an extraordinary turn of events  it s suing the regulatory agency  claiming the FTC s actions are unconstitutional because it s trying to deprive it of its property without due process 

Reining in an agency run amok
In June 2018  a month after the deal closed  the FTC notified Axon it was investigating the transaction for anti competitive behavior  The complaint it ended up filing against Axon on Jan  3  2020  contends the acquisition reduced competition in what was already a highly concentrated market  All five FTC commissioners voted in favor of suing Axon over the Vievu case  and a trial is slated to begin on May 19 
Axon had been cooperating with the regulatory agency  but negotiations apparently fell apart around Christmas  when the stun gun maker says the FTC told it the only to avoid getting sued  was to surrender a  blank check  divestiture   If that were to happen  the agency alone would decide which customers  contracts  employees  and services Axon would be allowed to keep 
The extreme move would essentially allow the FTC to create a competitor out of Axon s own assets  give it complete access to its technology  and do so without any recourse  And the agency has apparently never lost a case    even when an administrative judge has ruled against the FTC  the commissioners have always voted to overrule the decision 
Thick as thieves
Axon apparently believes the FTC has gone unchecked for too long and is suing the agency in federal court for violating its rights to due process and equal protection  Moreover  Axon contends the FTC is just plain wrong  
While no one suggests Axon isn t the dominant player in the body cam market  or that Vievu was its primary competitor at the time  there are numerous competitors it goes up against  such as Motorola Solutions    which acquired camera maker WatchGuard last July     as well as Panasonic  Coban  and many others  
There are also non traditional cameras coming onto the market that could be a potent competitive force  Samsung has had some success selling its Galaxy smartphones as a body camera alternative  Other smartphone makers are similarly working to use their cameras and wireless networks as competing systems 
Standing on the brink
Also  Axon has some other reasonable arguments  In its view  Vievu should have been treated as a  failing firm   making the acquisition different from an antitrust perspective  Axon contends Vievu was  effectively insolvent  at the time of the deal and it struggled at a significant competitive disadvantage because it had failed to invest in dashboard camera options  There were also no other competing bids for the firm  so it likely would have gone under if Axon hadn t bought it 
While Vievu had won a major contract with the New York City Police Dept   beating out Axon to supply the law enforcement agency with body cams  it also hadn t won a major contract in nearly two years prior to the acquisition  and its technology was deficient 
There were numerous reports at the time that Vievu s cameras  and those of numerous other manufacturers  were subject to security flaws that could allow hackers to gain access to the systems and tamper with evidence  and one of Vievu s NYPD cameras caught fire  leading the department to remove 3 000 of the cameras from use 
Tipping the scales of justice
Axon Enterprise asserts that the FTC can t operate as a law unto itself  CEO Rick Smith says   If the FTC believes it has a strong case against us  it should prove it in federal court before a neutral judge  Our action today seeks to ensure that will happen  
While Axon makes a strong case that the FTC is running roughshod over its rights and exceeding its authority  the lawsuit the body camera maker has filed against the agency is fraught with risk  There s a saying in policing that it s better to be tried by 12 than carried by six  but juries    and the judges who preside over them    are unpredictable 
If Axon loses  it will likely be stripped of valuable assets  The resulting company would then be able to use the technology Axon has spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars developing against it  The stakes are extremely high for Axon Enterprise in its lawsuit against regulatory overreach ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phdgl,2057997

109262,330777,AAXN,U S  fund managers brace for trade war with focus on pricing power,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors  fears of an all out trade war between the United States and China is prompting U S  stock fund managers to hunt for companies that can easily pass on higher costs to their consumers   So far  domestic small to mid cap companies that get most of their revenues at home have weathered prospects of higher trade costs the best  with the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies up 2 8 percent for the year  nearly double the 1 5 percent gain in the larger cap and more internationally exposed S P 500 index over the same time   Yet fund managers from firms including Villere   Co  Hodges Capital and BMO Global Asset Management say that a trade war would likely push inflation higher  eating into the margins of even those domestic companies that get no revenues overseas  Instead of focusing on the geographic source of revenues  these managers say that they are targeting firms that have dominant niches or intellectual property that will allow them to protect or even expand their margins at a time of rising costs    We re focusing on the companies that regardless of the type of inflation   whether it s commodities or trade or something else   can pass on those costs because they have some sort of structural advantage   said Eric Marshall  a portfolio manager at Dallas based Hodges Capital   Marshall has been adding to his position in Texas Instruments Inc  O TXN   for example  because the firm s chips are used in high end  high demand products such as iPhones and self driving cars  Shares of the company are flat for the year after its most recent earnings report failed to beat Wall Street estimates for the first time in two years  but Marshall said that he expects its revenue to continue to grow at above market rates    They have the better mousetrap and if there are additional tariffs to bring its products back then they will be well positioned to pass those costs on   he said   U S  President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on  150 billion in Chinese imports to the United States to punish China for what government officials regard as Beijing s predatory industrial policies and abuse of U S  intellectual property  Beijing has vowed to retaliate  A trade war between the two countries would lop 0 7 percent off of the U S  GDP and push inflation up 0 1 percent  according to estimates from MSCI  That  in turn  would sink U S  stocks by about 5 percent  the firm estimates  a fall it says may already be priced into the market  Should other countries also raise tariffs  then U S  stocks could drop by another 10 percent  In the  Beige Book   a survey of current U S  economic conditions released Wednesday  the Federal Reserve noted that it had received scattered reports of companies successfully passing on prices in the manufacturing  information technology  transportation  and construction industries  DOMESTIC NICHE  Lamar Villere  a portfolio manager at New Orleans based Villere   Co  said that he has been reducing his exposure of small and mid cap companies with international revenues and is focusing more on those that dominate their domestic niche in order to offer protection from the effects of tariffs   He has been adding to his position in companies such as  Pool Corp   O POOL   the country s largest supplier of residential pool supplies  in large part because it has few competitors that will be able to undercut it on prices  he said  Shares of the company are up 12 5 percent for the year to date   He also has been adding to online higher education company  2U Inc   O TWOU  and Axon Enterprise Inc  O AAXN   the parent company behind the Taser brand of non lethal weapons and body cameras used by police departments  because both are dominant players that also have recurring revenue streams from long term contracts   Shares of 2U are up 34 8 percent for the year  while shares of Axon are up 63 percent for the year to date    The companies that are going to be able to withstand this are the ones that have a sort of moat around their businesses   he said  Not all fund managers are as convinced that the Trump administration s threats  which pushed the benchmark S P 500 down more than 10 percent to enter a correction in February  will become a reality   Margie Patel  a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Funds  said that she expects to see little to no effect from trade tariffs and has been adding to companies such as PNC Finiancial Services Group Inc  N PNC  that have sold off in the market downturn

109520,331035,AAXN,Factors Likely To Impact Axon Enterprise s  AAXN  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Axon Enterprise  Inc    NASDAQ AAXN   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on Feb 26  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings of 20 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents  The bottom line also improved substantially from the prior year quarter s figure of 5 cents  The company has delivered better than expected results in the trailing four quarters  recording a positive earnings surprise of 391 67   Let us see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement  Axon Enterprise  Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Earnings Whisper Our proven model does not conclusively show that Axon Enterprises is likely to beat estimates this earnings season  This is because the stock needs to have the right combination of a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you can see below  Earnings ESP  Axon Enterprise has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 11 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our   Zacks Rank  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  1  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Conversely  we caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions  Factors to Influence Q4 Results The company s strategic growth areas include TASER weapons  Sensors hardware including on officer body cameras and Axon Fleet in car video systems  Evidence com connected software network  and Axon Records and Computer Aided Dispatch software  These value streams have an estimated total addressable market of  7 7 billion  comprising TASER weapons   1 5 billion   hardware sensors   0 7 billion   and cloud based public safety software   5 5 billion   The company continues to expand product offerings and introduce multiple software service solutions  Axon Enterprise will continue to benefit in the fourth quarter from its expanded product offerings and strong execution  The company s TASER Weapons segment will continue to gain from the increased sales of products  and improved sales under the Officer Safety Plan and TASER 60 purchase programs  At the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in early October  Axon Enterprise introduced TASER 7  its most effective TASER weapon with improved performance across all key metrics  This in turn will lead to increased effectiveness  reduced size and ease of use  This will serve as a material catalyst for customers to replace the old TASER weapons  It started shipping in the fourth quarter  The Software and Sensors segment will gain as the company continues to add users to its network resulting in steady product revenues  It will also benefit from increased aggregate users which resulted in improved Evidence com and extended warranty revenues  Continued adoption of Axon Cloud  drove year over year revenue growth of 47  in the third quarter  It is anticipated to drive segment revenues in the fourth quarter 2018 as well  Further  Axon Fleet will contribute to the top line in the to be reported quarter  Notably  bookings related to the company s Software and Sensors segment were  93 million in the third quarter  up 19  year over year  As of Sep 30  2018  Software   Sensors backlog was approximately  700 million  This bodes well for fourth quarter performance  In May  Axon Enterprise closed the acquisition of VIEVU  a public safety camera provider  The buyout led to the addition of five major U S  cities  police departments and also added Mexico City and Mexico s Federal Police  However  there was an issue regarding a VIEVU LE5 camera overheating with a major customer  The issue has been resolved and the customer will accelerate their transition from VIEVU cameras to Axon Body 2 cameras and Axon Evidence  The transition may result in some incremental expense in the fourth quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for fourth quarter 2018 is pegged at  104 7 million  projecting year over year growth of 10 6   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 11 cents for the to be reported quarter  down 38 9  from 18 cents per share reported in the

 decelerating from improvement of 10  witnessed in December and 16  in November  The company s global machine sales growth rate chart has been moving south for eight straight months  It has now entered single digits   at levels last witnessed in 2017  Nevertheless  Resource Industries  Construction Industries  and Energy   Transportation continue to report positive gains for the 19th  24th and 17th consecutive months  respectively  North America Holds Ground  Asia Pacific Disappoints In January  growth was mainly led by North America which logged an increase of 20   EAME and Latin

the Latin America  Asia Pacific disappointed with a decline of 10  in sales mainly due to the slowdown in demand in China Sales growth improved in North America and Latin America compared with December while EAME and Asia Pacific lagged December performances   Sales in the Energy   Transportation segment rose 8   lower than growth of 13  registered in December  Sales growth in the Transportation sector was 23   followed by the Power Generation which reported sales growth of 16   The Oil   Gas sector reported sales growth of 4    Sales in the Industrial sector declined 4   The Transportation sector was the only sector which delivered an improved performance in December  Cost Discipline  Investment in Expanded Offerings to Fuel Growth Though Caterpillar s sales growth rate has been on a downward trend  it remains in the positive territory  As a reminder  the company witnessed a rise of 1  in machine retail sales in March 2017  which put an end to its unprecedented 51 month long stretch of declining sales  The company has reported positive sales growth ever since  delivering average retail sales growth of 10 3  in 2017 and 23 5  thereafter in 2018  Further  in fourth quarter 2018  Caterpillar delivered adjusted earnings per share of  2 55  up 18  year over year driven by continued strength in many of its end markets and incessant focus on cost control

performances for four years  At the end of 2018  Caterpillar s backlog was at  16 5 billion  a year over year improvement  700 million aided by increase in Energy   Transportation and Construction Industries  partially offset by a lower backlog at Resource Industries  For 2019  Caterpillar expects earnings per share to range between  11 75 and  12 75  The mid point of the guidance depicts year over year growth of 9  over the adjusted earnings per share of  11 22 in fiscal 2018  However  the company stated that it expects  modest  sales growth for the year based on the fundamentals of its diverse end markets as well as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  The company will nevertheless continue to focus on cost discipline and investment in expanded offerings and services to drive growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in fiscal 2019 is pegged at  12 23  projecting year over year growth of 9   The estimate for revenues for the fiscal is at  57 49 billion  reflecting growth of 5     Caterpillar has decreased 16 8  over the past year  against the  s decline of 17 6   The recent slowdown in retail sales seems to be weighing on the stock  Further  the company has to contend with raw material cost inflation owing to the imposition of tariffs and supply chain challenges  However  the company plans to negate these impacts through price increases  utilizing the Operating   Execution Model to drive operational excellence  and structural cost discipline  Further  additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth

million reported in the year ago quarter  Segment Performance Agriculture   Turf segment s sales were up 10  year over year to  4 7 billion  primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization offset by unfavorable currency translation impact and higher warranty related expenses  Operating profit at the segment declined 10  year over year to  348 million  owing to higher production costs  improved warranty related expenses  less favorable product mix  and higher research and development expenses  These were partially mitigated by price realization and higher shipment volumes  Construction   Forestry sales increased 31  year over year to  2 26 billion from the prior year quarter  aided by the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volumes and price realization  somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign exchange  This segment reported operating profit of  229 million  a significant improvement from the prior year quarter figure of  32 million  The Wirtgen acquisition contributed operating profit of  14 million in the reported quarter  Apart from it  price realization  partially offset by higher production costs and a less favorable product mix  led to the improvement in profit  Net revenues at Deere s Financial Services division totaled  855 million in the reported quarter  up 10  year over year  The segment s operating profit came in at  192 million  a decrease of 12  year over year  Financial Update Deere reported cash and cash equivalents of  3 6 billion at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with  3 9 billion at the

borrowing was approximately  28 billion  up from  26 billion at the end of prior year quarter  Fiscal 2019 Outlook  Deere maintained its expectation of equipment sales to rise 7  in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018  The Wirtgen acquisition will contribute about 1  to net sales for the fiscal  The forecast also factors an unfavorable impact of 2  for foreign currency translation for fiscal  The company expects cost pressures to likely lessen through fiscal 2019  For fiscal 2019  Deere anticipates net sales to increase about 7  year over year and projects net income of about  3 6 billion  For the Agriculture   Turf segment  Deere projects industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada to be flat to up 5  in fiscal 2019  This will be propelled by continued demand for both large and small equipment  Industry sales in the EU28 member nations are forecast to be flat as a result of drought conditions in key markets  South American industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5  aided by strength in Brazil  Sales in Asia are likely to be flat to down slightly  Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the United States and Canada are expected to be flat to up 5  for 2019  The Construction   Forestry segment s results will benefit from the addition of a full year of Wirtgen sales compared with 10 months in fiscal 2018  The two additional months will add about 4  to the division s sales in the fiscal  The company anticipates generally positive fundamentals and economic growth worldwide  In forestry  global industry sales are expected to be up 5 to 10  mainly driven by higher demand in EU28 countries and Russia  For the Financial Services segment  results are expected to benefit from a higher average portfolio

Daqo New Energy Corp ADR  NYSE DQ  formed a bear flag back in June  rolled over from the mid 40 s to the low 20 s  bounced around and formed a big wedge  and on Tuesday  it was down 1 53  or 5 77   to 24 97  on 138 245 shares traded  If it breaks down look for 21  and 18 are targets 
IntriCon Corporation  NASDAQ IIN  dropped 1 00  or 2 83   to 34 34  on 261 414 shares traded  The top on this was just too compelling  I gave the short around 52  it made it down to around 31  formed a bear flag  and on Tuesday it had a nasty reversal bar  after spiking up right to the channel top  it reversed and closed with a loss for the day  That s what we call an engulfing bearish bar  I can see this going to at least 31  and it wouldn t shock me if it went to the mid 20 s 
Polaris Industries Inc  NYSE PII  we put out as a swing not too long ago  It broke support  and then rallied right back to it  It fell hard on Tuesday  dropping another 9 99  or 10   to 91 63 from 101 62  on 719 606 shares traded  This one looks like it s headed to 79 80

Stocks on the Long Side  
The Direxion Daily Jr Gld Mnrs Bull 3X ETF  NYSE JNUG  was up 1 01  or 11   to 10 30  on over 14 million shares traded  on Thursday  It broke out of the base  and now looks like gold is finally making its major move  The long term declining topline will be tested as early as Friday up around 10 85  95  If it gets up there and backs off  that would be normal  If it blows through it  we could see 11 3 4 
VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term linked to SP 500 VIX Short Fut Exp 4 Dec 2030  NASDAQ TVIX  jumped 6 09  or 9   to 72 81  also over 14 million shares  on Thursday  It made a 3 wave corrective move  and then ran up in a 4 wave channel move  The pullback from lateral price resistance at the top of the short term channel is best for a pullback  but if it gets one more wave down in this market  just having pulled back for a week and consolidated  it could explode into the 110 112 range  or more  Keep an eye on it  Stop underneath 66 
Veracyte  Inc   NASDAQ VCYT  is another biotech that is acting great  it popped above the declining topsline on Thursday  gaining 1 09  or 9   to 13 09  on 466 720 shares traded  The volume picked up some  It looks pretty interesting  and if it can get up through the 13 65 area as early as Friday  we may get a test quickly at 15 1 2  Ultimately  it will make it up to my swing target at 19 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Axon Enterprise  Inc   NASDAQ AAXN  formed another bear flag  and it s a tight one  which usually means it s bearish or that it s going lower  It popped out of the flag on Thursday  dropping 1 82  or 4   to 43 29  on nearly 4 million shares traded  The bottom line is that the next target is about 36 1 2 
Swing trade IntriCon Corporation  NASDAQ IIN   with a head and shoulder top  broke down a couple times  formed two bear flags  and on Thursday  it dropped another 1 18  or 5   to 24 63  on 201 251 shares traded  This is a stock that was up around 66 67 just three months ago  I wouldn t be surprised if at some point it makes it all the way down to the 17 18 range 
Weight Watchers International  Inc   NASDAQ WTW  is a long standing Tech Trader short swing  It dropped precipitately from 100 all the way down to 36  and doesn t look done  quite frankly  On Thursday  it was down 3 34  or 8 37   to 36 55  on 3 4 million shares  The next target is 34 1 2 33  It might get down to the high 20 s before it s over  if it gets a full fledged wave five  bear phase

109643,331158,AAXN,Zacks com Highlights  Medifast  Axon Enterprise  Delek US Holdings And HollyFrontier,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 12  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Medifast  Inc    NYSE MED    Axon Enterprise  Inc    NASDAQ AAXN    Delek US Holdings  Inc    NYSE DK   and HollyFrontier Corp    NYSE HFC   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Leverage the Price Momentum of These 4 StocksIt has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we call today the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead  works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Why Does the Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are human There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reasons why momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back  Conversely  some investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends and thus  open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time which exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum Versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes Nonetheless  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining

My sense is that TASR has more work to do on the downside in the 22 50 21 50 support zone  which must contain additional price pressure  as the momentum gauges begin to bottom out  Only two closes above 23 75 will begin to neutralize the current negative set up  Stand Aside  Last is 23 09 15 ",2017-03-05,Mike Paulenoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tasr-drops-out-of-8-month-sideways-digestion-pattern-200177730,200177730
109819,331334,AAXN,Hot Stocks  Taser Pivots To Cameras  Changes Name To Axon  Buy ,opinion,"Short answer  yes  I think GE Dimitriou SA  AT TASr  Axon Enterprise Inc  NASDAQ AAXN  has excellent long term growth potential  This change speaks of a company that s aware of current trends and aims to be on the right side of history 
 has long been known for their eponymous product  the Taser nonlethal electric weapon used by police  More recently  the company has been expanding into police body cams   a notably different side of law enforcement technology 
Axon is their body cam wing  but the sub brand has been so successful that it is becoming the company s new brand identity 
Taser s recent product offerings  like   have been focused on police accountability and harm reduction  This is a marked sea change from the days when  taser  was synonymous with police  excessive   force 
The Sidearm Sidekick is a sensor that s fitted into police gun holsters  Whenever a gun is drawn  the sensor turns on all police body cameras within 30 feet  The intention is to automatically record each police encounter of any severity  often from multiple angles 
Axon has other sensors that work when police activate sirens  or open the door of their vehicles  It s an attempt to add redundancy and reliability to the body cam recording process  which is necessary to add clarity to the kind of events which have typified  in recent years 
Why is AAXN a Good Bet 
I like AAXN for a lot of reasons  Their place in the narrative laid out above places them on the right side of history  socially politically  But it s also a deft financial move by Taser  The Body Cams that Axon sells aren t a one and done transaction  Axon also runs the system and software that powers the body cams  When a police force goes with Axon  they re buying a monthly subscription in addition to the hardware purchase 
What s more  municipal police forces pretty much have to buy this stuff  Department of Justice investigations into the Baltimore police department make it politically necessary for the city to outfit every officer with body cams  Axon has a corner on the market  and more municipalities are making body cams standard 
Body cams are a young product  The technology will improve  and successive generations of body cams will be replaced by newer  better units  Axon is an established company  with relationships with police forces around the world  meaning that when these systems need updating  Axon will get those sales 
Finally  cameras are a great business to be in right now  It s conceivable that Axon would develop civilian focused products  Tasers  the product  are already popular among civvies  Small  automated cameras have many real world applications  and it s only a matter of time before Axon figures out how to exploit this 
Should You Buy AAXN 
I see no reason not to  Great company  locked in customers  huge expansion potential  There s not much left to say  If you re looking for growth and reliability  AAXN ticks all the boxes in my opinion

109849,331364,AAXN,3 Undervalued Firearms Stocks Are Worth Considering Now,opinion,"Successful stockpicking is all about identifying profitable inefficiencies in consensus expectations for a given company or industry and as much as I hate to say it  the mind numbing spate of violence we have been living through this year probably makes the gun business one of the most undervalued sectors in the market today 
Tragically  I suspect the motivations behind many of the recent terrorist attacks abroad will lead to more violence  The philosophy ISIS offers is highly appealing to many young  often poorly educated homegrown European Muslims  and it is highly likely that more of them will choose the perceived martyrdom that follows killing  infidels  versus living on the financial  social  and cultural outskirts of their societies  That means more events like Nice  and Paris and Brussels   Meanwhile  here at home  recent assaults on law enforcement in Dallas and Baton Rouge might produce copycat attacks  despite the increased efforts by law enforcement to better serve inner city communities 
After each tragedy in the US  many pundits and some politicians are quick to blame our lax gun laws and easy access to firearms  Right or wrong  these public calls for a crackdown always cause a sharp spike in gun sales  Even though Americans already own more than 300 million guns  people fear legislation will soon limit their ability to purchase arms  so they rush out to acquire more  These buying sprees  in turn  trigger rallies in the stocks of two publicly traded gun companies  Sturm  Ruger  NYSE RGR  and Smith   Wesson  NASDAQ SWHC   Yet  despite this oft repeated pattern  the firearms makers sell at a below market price earnings ratio of 15x and 18x estimated 2016 earnings  respectively 
These relatively low valuations are probably a sign that  like gun buyers  institutional and retail investors believe there is a chance  however slight  that gun sales will be constricted by the government at some point in the future  They might also reflect a negative association between gun manufacturers and other  sin  stocks like tobacco companies  But unlike cancer stick producers  whose revenues have been flattish for years  as a shrinking percentage of Americans smoke   gun industry revenues have been growing  and will likely continue to do so 
Over the years I  too  have been wary of investing in firearms companies  I have never owned Smith   Wesson or Sturm  Ruger and I ve never traveled to meet with their managements  This gun shyness has cost me a chance to earn some spectacular returns in recent months  Smith   Wesson is up 30 percent year to date  Sturm is up 13 percent  Thankfully  I have not missed out on another personal defense related stock  Taser  NASDAQ TASR   I have interviewed Taser s chief financial officer on multiple occasions at its Scottsdale  Arizona headquarters and I purchased shares in the company several months ago  The stock is up 50 percent this year and  with its dominant position in the body camera market for law enforcement agencies  I expect it to continue rising 
I am strongly considering stocking up on Smith   Wesson and Sturm  Ruger  too  The other night  a politically liberal friend of mine confessed that he was about to purchase a handgun  The constant news of violence had convinced him to put aside his qualms  I suspect he is far from alone  Furthermore  investor concerns about possible gun control legislation are likely overblown  Just as it was when Barack Obama was sworn into office  the industry will probably be helped  not harmed  if Democrats win the presidency  While gun sales will almost certainly spike again as consumers worry about the prospect of new gun control laws  the actual chances of legislation getting through Congress and onto Hillary Clinton s desk are slim  Barring an electoral tsunami  the House will remain in Republican hands  and  rhetoric aside  Democrats have not shown a strong willingness to act on the issue  Bernie Sanders  who leans left on every social and economic issue  refused to speak out against gun ownership  And most congressional Democrats from Red State America know their constituents love guns  and love the Second Amendment  meaning opposing either would be a quick way to lose reelection 
Additionally  more ISIS related attacks will almost certainly occur overseas in the coming weeks and months  Europe is facing a bleak future  both economically and culturally  Job creation and economic growth are nil  so the large and growing ethnic populations across the Continent many of whom are Islamic have little hope for upward mobility  On top of that  many are dismayed and repulsed by what they view as increasingly secular  morally decadent European lifestyles  That s why it is homegrown Muslims not first generation immigrants who will probably carry out more atrocities in the months to come  That s terrible news for the world  but it will boost the profits of American gun makers even more 
When people feel vulnerable  they ll spend whatever it takes to regain a sense of control  And if the last half of 2016 is as chaotic as the first  companies offering that comfort even if it is merely psychological will do a very brisk business ",2016-07-21,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-year-of-the-gun-200143190,200143190

109898,331413,AAXN,Allegion  ALLE  Q1 Earnings  Can the Stock Pull a Surprise ,opinion,"Allegion plc   NYSE ALLE     a security solution provider for homes and businesses   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results on Apr 28  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  Allegion posted a positive earnings surprise of 20 27   In fact  the company has surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 12 07  

Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement 
Factors to Consider
Allegion stands to benefit from its strategic acquisitions  collaborations and investment in new technology  as demand for electronic security products is growing by leaps and bounds  The Sep 2015 acquisitions of Axa Stenman  a European residential and portable security provider  and SimonsVoss  a leading lock manufacturer based in Europe  should boost revenues from the continent  Moreover  its takeover of South Korea based producer of innovative electronic door locks  Milre Systek Co   Ltd  last year  will continue to add to its top line 
Additionally  we expect margin expansion to be supported by prudent cost control and productivity initiatives  specific customer and market pricing actions  and the elimination of unprofitable businesses 
On the flip side  the company s sales are primarily dependent on the U S  commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets  Thus  the company will likely be hurt seeing that the U S  housing market recovery stalled toward the beginning of 2016 due to a slowdown in overall economic growth 
Further  we are concerned about the economic slowdown in certain pockets of the world where Allegion has a considerable presence  The prevailing economic sluggishness in the Eurozone and the persistent recession in China are likely to keep Allegion s international profits under pressure in the to be reported quarter  Moreover  owing to the company s substantial international presence  a strong dollar could prove to be a significant headwind for the company 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Allegion is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Allegion is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 64 cents 
Zacks Rank  Allegion s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks in the broader industrial products sector that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
TASER International Inc    NASDAQ TASR    with an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Tetra Tech  Inc    NASDAQ TTEK    with an Earnings ESP of  5 88 and a Zacks Rank  3

TASER s recent momentum has a lot to do with the company s most recent earnings report  Less than two weeks ago  the less lethal weapons manufacturer reported first quarter earnings of six cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of three cents 
The impressive beat was propelled by the company s body camera segments  AXON And EVIDENCE com  which saw revenues grow by over 50   Bookings in the segment also grew 16 5  from the previous quarter and 126 8  year over year 
TASR has also seen some positive earnings estimate revision activity recently  Within the past 30 days  we have seen three positive revisions for the company s annual earnings  as well as two positive revisions for its next quarter earnings 
Nevertheless  TASR remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Part of this is due to the Zack Rank system s emphasis on revision agreement  While there has been positive revision activity recently  we have all seen some negative revision activity  For example  we have seen one negative revision for the company s current quarter earnings  Furthermore  we have seen two negative revisions for TASER s 2017 earnings  indicating that some analysts don t think the company s momentum will maintain in the long term 
Additionally  it is important to consider that  although TASER posted an earnings beat  the six cents per share number represents a year over year decrease of 53 8   This is because TASER has experienced much higher operating expenses as it expands its newer segments 
Finally  despite TASER s  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  the stock only holds a  C  grade in the weighted average VGM category  In short  while TASER may have just crossed an important mark  it doesn t necessarily make the stock a must buy right now ",2016-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tasr-crosses-200-day-moving-average:-should-you-buy-now-200130522,200130522

109924,331439,AAXN,Top Trades For Next Month,opinion,"How interesting the markets have been 

These are  for the most part  short term trades but we ve been layering in some longer term trade ideas   using our profits to invest in trades that will generate steady monthly gains over time  rather than only focusing on  quickies  
Our Top Trade Ideas  generally  tend to be longer term trades and we don t have a portfolio that tracks them specifically  They are generally selected trades from the ones that we are adding to PSW s Short Term Portfolio or Long Term Portfolio and tend to be of the  set and forget  variety  while our OOP trades require a bit more active management 

While 30 of our first 45  66   Top Trade ideas were winners  4 of our 15 losers were Lumber Liquidators  NYSE LL  trade ideas   all of which are now coming back as LL pops back to  20  Hopefully it can break over  20 and we can put all that silliness behind us 
Getting two out of three trades right is plenty to move the investing ball towards the goal line  Combine that with sensible portfolio management techniques  diversification  managing losses  hedging  and you ll beat the S P by a mile with no sweat  Generally  with our Top Trades  we re simply picking stocks we feel are underpriced and we re using our various options techniques to give ourselves even better discounts and hedged entries but these are patience plays   that do take time to get going  though we did call for a cash out of our winners in July  so August was kind of a fresh start 
Without further ado  here s the next month of trades for review   some are still good for new entries 

On Aug 4th we saw a news article that Windstream  NASDAQ WIN  won a contract for  450M to build out wireless services for the VA  As WIN was a company we had played in the past  this was a trigger for us to jump in with a new play  which was 

In the STP  let s go for 40 WIN Sept  5 calls for 0 50   2 000  and let s do 10 in the  25KP   500   

As you can see  WIN popped nicely right off the bat and finished Sept 18th  expiration day  at  6 92  with the calls at  1 92   up 284   Well  they can t all be long term trades    

Aug 11th was a double Alert  in addition to a play on Terex  NYSE TEX   we also included a long oil Futures trade idea 

You can still sell the TEX 2017  23 puts for  3 and that s net  19  which is very fair  even if the merger fails   I like that and you can add the  20   7 60   25   4 30  bull call spread at  3 30 for net 0 30 on the  5 spread but that s betting the merger does go through just to make another  1 70   not really worth the risk 

Our timing on that one was good  but then bad as people first loved  then hated the merger deal and now they are warming up to it again  Nonetheless  since we were fairly conservative in our play  the short puts are still just  3 30  down 10   and the additional spread I said was not worth the risk is now net  1 50  down 50  and NOW it s worth the risk 

A much better trade that day was my Futures pick on oil   CL  to go long at  43  we pretty much caught the dead bottom there and  as you can see  we popped all the way to  55 before the rally failed   up  12 000 per contract  Of course we don t just get in and ride them out   but  if you are still in this trade back at  52 50  up  9 500    it s time to stop out as we re short again 
August 24th was our next trade  we didn t like anything enough in the prior week  and our trade idea that Monday was for our Stock of the Decade  Taser  NASDAQ TASR   as it fell back to the  20 line  We liked this one so much that  not only was it a top trade but it was the first long term trade idea added to our Options Opportunity Portfolio as well 


Buy 20 TASR 2017  20 calls at  6 20   12 400  
Sell 20 TASR 2017  25 calls at  4 15   8 300  
Sell 20 TASR 2017  15 puts at  2 40   4 800  

Our net on the spread was a  700 credit and  as you can see  this is another one we caught a nice bottom on and they are now back to testing the  25 level  which is all our very conservative target is looking for to make the full  10 700  At the moment  the net on the spread is  2 500  so already net  3 200 off our original  700 credit is up 457  in just over a month and only just getting started 
Aug 26th we got very busy indeed as we reviewed Goldman Sach s 25 most oversold stock list to see which ones we thought were playable  Our trade ideas were 


Cheap food costs tip the scales for me on this one and sure  I don t like paying 18 8 for a grocery store but I do like paying 12x earnings and that would be  22 and you can sell the 2017  23 puts for  1 55 to net in at  21 45  30  off  and we can play that with the  30   5 50   35   3 45  bull call spread at  2 05 to net into the  5 spread for 0 50  Margin on 10 short puts is a negligible  2 300 and I REALLY would like to own  46 000 worth of WFM at  23 so let s do 20 of those in the LTP 

Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM  just took off and headed back to the  35 line and the net on the spread has gone from  500 to  1 470  which is up  970  194   but merely on trace to the full  5 000 we expect if they can get above  35 and hold it through Jan 2017 

Good time to make a note that you don t HAVE to make short term trades to get great short term returns on your cash  This trade was a very sensible entry on 8 24 and it s only 10 10 and already we re up 194    that s enough to satisfy all but the greediest of short term trades yet we took no particular short term risk because we are BEING THE HOUSE and selling more premium than we bought 



10 2017  35 puts can be sold for  3 20   3 200  and  35 is already another 20  off and we can use that money to buy 10 of the  40   9 40  50   5 50  bull call spreads for  3 90 for net 0 70 on the  10 spreads that are  4 77 in the money to start  I fully expect these to get cheaper and we ll spend  4 50 more to roll down to the  30 calls  now  17  when and if we have the opportunity  For the LTP  

Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  was one we put our foot down on as they tested the  45 line and  as we are supposed to do   we took advantage of the OPPORTUNITY to buy low and we took up an option spread that would give us an entry even lower   35 70 in this case  in our worst case  As it happens  we nailed the bottom and already this  700 spread is netting  3 300 for a  2 600  371   gain in just over 30 days  Again   you do not need to take big risks to make big rewards   even in the short run 



Buy 10 April  40 puts for  2   2 000 
Buy 10 April  50 calls for  4   4 000  
Sell 10 Oct  50 calls for  1 55   1 550 
Sell 10 Oct  45 puts for  2   2 000  


This Lincoln National  NYSE LNC  spread was for our Butterfly Portfolio and that s one that needs managing  The long puts and calls are still net  4 900  down  1 100  but the short puts and calls are down to  560 already  expire next Friday  for a  2 990 gain and that s an overall net gain of  1 890   77   off our  2 450 investment in just over a month   not bad for a well hedged Butterfly 

The way our Butterfly plays work is we simply make our next target sale once the first one runs down so  for example  we expect LNC to be around  52 50 into the end of the year and the November options don t pay well so we can sell the Jan  47 puts for  1 90   1 900  and the Jan  53 50 calls for  1 50   1 500  and drop another  3 400 in our pocket for the next 3 months 


On Sept 2nd  we reiterated our long call on TASR  above  and added this one on Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS  

As we re always looking for our monthly  4 000 ish  in the LTP  let s sell 5 of the SWKS 2017  60 puts for  7   3 500  as that s certainly a stock we don t mind owning way down from here  

While that one got off to a good start  we re right back where we started  a bit below  at  8 20 for a  1 200  34   loss  For the purpose of our LTP  we really do want to own the stock for net  53  so we don t care what the PRICE  not value  of the option is at  79 60  but this is a patience play for sure 
September 4th we reiterated our warning to cash out winning positions and we reviewed all of our Portfolio Positions  As I ve noted  we don t have a Top Trade Portfolio as these trades are mainly picks from other portfolio plays  but the same rules apple   mainly cash and well hedged is our current position in all 4 of our Member Portfolios  

Since we had plenty of cash  we were free to add more trades and on Sept 9th we added Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  with the following spread 


Sell 10 2017  30 puts for  3 80   3 800  
Buy 10 2017  25 calls for  8 50   8 500  
Sell 10 2017  38 calls for  2 20   2 200 


YHOO is really only back to where it was on that day after a nasty dip but once again our  Be the House  strategy pays off and the net  2 500 entry is already at  3 240 for a  740 gain  which is only  29  but that s on a stock that s gone nowhere in 30 days  Isn t that a trading style that s worth learning 

Our 2nd Top Trade on the 9th was for the only Chinese company we like  China Mobile  NYSE CHL  with the following trade idea 

While we re on the top of positions   CHL is up 0 86 today but still cheap at  60 22 and we can sell 5 2017  50 puts for  3 90 and that drops  1 950 into the LTP and keeps our eye on it 

That one has improved since we called it  though off the highs as China is having a very rough ride  and we knew that but we still like CHL down here   The  50 puts are now  3 83 or  1 915 on 5 contracts vs the  1 950 we collected is up a not very exciting  35  2   but it s on track and still great for a new entry ",2015-10-11,Philip Davis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-10-banks-in-the-us-267716,267716

109928,331443,AAXN,Are Small Caps Your Best Bet ,opinion,"Fourth quarter earnings have  in a word  has been underwhelming  The S P 500 index reported a decline in profits of 1 8   with revenues down 3 5   Those figures make it the worst earnings season since 2009  and firmly put us in a revenue recession  with the last four quarters recording negative sales growth  We also just marked our first down quarter for EPS since the recession  with the next few quarters also predicting negative numbers  Only 55  of companies were able to surpass the Estimize EPS consensus during the fourth quarter  with a much lower 41  beating on the top line  While the large caps were not able to perform  fundamentals for many of the small caps remained strong 

Small caps  those companies with a market cap under  2B  often don t have the global exposure that large caps do  Close to 50  of S P 500 revenues come from overseas  These multinationals have been under severe pressure lately as the global economy weakens  and the strong dollar negatively impacts repatriation of sales from outside the US  Some of the smaller  under the radar stocks  specifically in tech sector  have been a better bet in the current environment  These names often get buried and have limited analyst coverage  but the Estimize Screener accurately identified several companies that were likely to be beats this quarter  and with only a couple of weeks left in the season  there are others with that carry that same bullish signal 
A lot of the wins this quarter were in small cap tech companies  Some of our favorites include those in the enterprise tech space  such as Zendesk  N ZEN   Companies are continually investing in the cloud and in their own growth  and Zendesk offers customer service tools and products that are becoming critical for business efficiency  While the company only reported EPS in line with the Street  revenues beat by a lofty  2 5M  resulting in YoY sales growth of 63  and the eighth consecutive quarter above the 60  mark 

Lesser known cybersecurity names such as Cyberark Software  O CYBR  and Imperva  N IMPV  also had a great season  both beating on the top and bottom line  and putting up 40   YoY growth for both of those metrics  In many ways they looked much stronger than some of their larger competitors 

This trend has not been limited to the tech space  even some small cap industrials saw strength this quarter  a sector that has otherwise been lagging  TASER International  O TASR   the maker of body worn cameras  beat the higher Estimize consensus by 45  on the bottom line  and by  5 8 million on the top line  The company confirmed they were receiving massive orders for their Axon body cameras and their digital evidence management system  Even domestically focused consumer discretionary names have been looking strong  with Zoes Kitchen  N ZOES  growing 32  on the top line  receiving an extra boost from Chipotle s food safety scare 
Even though this season is almost finished there are still some of these small names that look like good opportunities ahead of Q4 earnings releases  In tech  names like Everyday Health  N EVDY  and Pure Storage  N PSTG  are both showing an EPS consensus that is trending higher into the report  and at least a 10  positive delta between Estimize and Wall Street  Restaurants also have a presence next week  with Shake Shack  N SHAK  and El Pollo Loco  O LOCO  reporting  The Estimize community currently expects both of those names to beat on EPS and revenues 

However not all small caps are winners  and we ve seen some rough guidance pull down estimates leading into reports  Many of these instances can be found within the consumer discretionary sector as US consumers have become incredibly choosy with how they will spend their money  and more value driven than ever  This has lead to stiff competition in the space  One such name getting a bearish signal from the Estimize community ahead of earnings is Skullcandy  O SKUL   maker of headphones  speakers and other accessories  which is expected to post a 1 cent miss on the bottom line and a  1M miss on the top line when they report next week  Other small cap consumer names feeling the pinch include Jamba  O JMBA  and Restoration Hardware  N RH   both have seen estimates come down leading into their reports and currently have an Estimize consensus that predicts a miss ",2016-03-01,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-small-caps-your-best-bet-200120035,200120035

Eagle Pharm  NASDAQ EGRX  continues its move  up 3 67 to 59 11  or 6 6   on nearly 370 000 shares  After five waves up  I m not sure how far it will extend  but if it breaks out above 59 11  it could see 70  Keep an eye on this one 

Paycom Soft  NYSE PAYC  popped 2 09 to 32 20  or nearly 7   on 378 000 shares traded  It has a pattern of five waves up and then a consolidation  which could possibly be a topping pattern  or coils being broken out  So far  with Monday s moves  it looks like it s coils being broken out  It could see some more volume  If it gets over 35 90  or so  it could be a 40 dollar stock 

TASER International Inc  NASDAQ TASR  had another big day on Monday  up 1 97 to 30 37 or nearly 7   on 4 1 million shares  That s good volume  Still looking for it to get up to the 32 zone short term  The secondary target is in the 35 range  maybe even as high as 39 40

 While the 24 hour news cycle has certainly hyped many stories  these issues still exist  and remain a detriment to society and the world as a whole  But sadly  these issues highlight the need for protective products and services in this day and age   Appropriately  there are companies out there that specialize in some sort of personal protection  or personal services during emergencies  Typically  these services are targeted to individual consumers  and or government agencies  Currently  the Protection Safety segment holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 39 out of 258  top 15  of all industries   If you watch the news you will easily understand why this industry is ranked so highly Stocks To ConsiderLakeland Industries Inc  NASDAQ LAKE  which carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  manufactures and sells a large range of safety garments and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market in the United States and Internationally  The companies produces a wide array of items including  lab coats  high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting and heat protective apparel  electrostatic dissipative apparel used in pharma and automotive industries  clean room apparel  and extrication suits for emergency responders to name a few protective items   Lakeland recently reported Q1 16 earnings results  which revealed that their core business grew by 8  in the quarter  and sales increased 14  year over year  The MERS outbreak in South Korea and the Avian Flu in the Midwest United States drove demand for the company s ChemMax protective suits   Further  the exceptional effectiveness of their Ebola related suits has generated new business in the pharma and medical segments  These organic sales enabled Lakeland to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate with a  11 11  positive earnings surprise   As you can see from the chart below  expectations for Lakeland have significantly increased in the last quarter

Century Aluminum Co   NASDAQ CENX  is acting well  On Tuesday it had a nice pop out of a consolidation across the tops  It didn t close above the tops  but it was up 1 66  or 6   on 2 4 million shares  I m looking to see that if it gets a follow through  and blows through this zone  this stock could move into the mid to high 30 s 
Exact Sciences Corporation  NASDAQ EXAS  broke out of a coil  This coil is going on six weeks  Actually  it broke out two days ago  and has been following through for two days now  It was up 63 cents  or 2 55   on 2 million shares on Tuesday  What it needs now is a test to take out 26 80  and then it s on its way up to 30 31 
Lakeland Industries Inc   NASDAQ LAKE  had a big day on Tuesday  Over that last couple weeks  It had a falling wedge  a one day pop  and a four week declining channel  It took out some lows and some support  It had a beautiful reversal day on Tuesday  That reversal day did the following  It took out the 10  21  and 50 day moving averages on its way to a phenomenal run up  3 65  or 36 7   on 8 1 million shares  That s huge volume for this stock  It s a big short position  and that was a big short covering rally on Tuesday  I m looking for a retest of the 16 16 1 2 zone coming up 
TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR  had a very good day on Tuesday and is in an explosive move  It s in a long term rising channel  and has an internal trendline connecting several stops  Once the stop is in the bottom section of a trend channel  and blows through the top  it usually runs up to the top of the channel  If you take a look at the long term pattern  the highs are up in the 32 33 range  Technically  my secondary swing target is up in that range  So the targets are 25 first  and then 30 32

Cypress Semiconductor Corporation  NASDAQ CY  has been great since we first mentioned it  and since the gap and merger with CODE  It gapped up and has been running up a nice tight channel for two weeks and it s still moving up  It didn t get into the 12 range like I wanted  but here it is up to 14 28 on Tuesday  There is some later resistance in this zone  It has a beautiful base pattern in the course of the last couple years  The breakout here could be significant  We may see this stock eventually move in the high teens  Look for it at 19 20 on an intermediate basis  Short term  though  I would love to see a pullback set up 
Flamel Technologies SA  NASDAQ FLML    one of our swing trades  is acting great  It had a big reversal day recently  Note  though  that it s having a difficult time getting through 17 40  That s what we are going to look for here  If it gets through there  the next targets are 19 and 21 
Oasis Petroleum Inc   NYSE OAS  is an oil stock that I know pretty well  and I wasn t surprised to see it roll over  It went from 57  all the way down to 11  and change  The reason I put a swing trade on it late on Tuesday is that when I looked at the total volume of 16 1 2 million shares  bigger than all the down days  it s had recently  perhaps a key reversal day  The next target is 17 1 2 18  which is a swing trade target  but it could very well make it up to 20 22 1 2  First things first  Let s get a follow through and get it up towards 17 17 1 4 1 2  and then we ll go forward 
TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR  has an interesting way that it s forming  a little wedge on lower volume within the confines of a rising channel  In afterhours it has a little bit of a tick up  It closed at 22 85  and traded up to 23 50  Something may be brewing there  We ll have to see  But in any case  there s a possibility of a strong opening on Wednesday  I m still looking for that 28 level  maybe as high as 32 33 on an intermediate basis  It still has good momentum as far as I am concerned

Achillion Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ACHN 
Had an amazing day yesterday  This stock reached 25 80 premarket  Looking at the one minute chart  the pop premarket went straight up  and then plunged and went sideways  It did bounce five times  but could not get through resistance up near 16 70  It did get the drug approval  or results  but for some reason  it popped  and then backed off quite a bit  I m going to be watching resistance that it broke through on Monday up around the 14 90 15 25 zone 
I want to see if that holds or not  If we do get a follow through day to the upside with big volume  maybe it will extend  I have confidence that we could still see 18 19  but today  I just don t want to see yesterday s low at 14 1 2 taken out  That s why I put my stop in  It was up 1 28  or 9   on a whopping 45 5 million shares  That s the biggest volume I ve ever seen on this stock

Broke through a key resistance level yesterday  up 27 cents or 3   on nearly a million shares  We put a swing on it and it moved up over 9 00 on Monday  closing at 9 19  The target should be 9 1 2 short term  and then 10 1 4 intermediate term going forward

109981,331496,AAXN,A Stock Market That Won t Quit,opinion,"The stock market just won t quit  Until it does we ve got to keep playing the momentum plays  Let s take a look at some of the stocks we ve liked  traded  and are good swing trades 
1 800 Flowers com Inc   NASDAQ FLWS  definitely has a pattern after the 5 wave advance that went into multi week consolidation  It broke out on Tuesday  Three days in a row it s been up  and increased in volume to almost 800 000 shares  That s the biggest volume since the breakout on Sept 2  At this point  I m looking for more upside  closer to 10 on the current target  Beyond that look for 13 1 2 
Groupon  Inc   NASDAQ GRPN  is looking and acting well  It has a nice base  The 4 day move  including the breakaway gap  had run up to over 8 00 at 8 06  then a 4 day pullback on Tuesday morning  reaching the breakout point  and the 10 day moving average near the 7 1 4 range  where the spike up towards 7 88  and close at 7 80  up 37 cents  or 5   on 18 5 million shares  That volume indicates to me that possibly that the base breakout and retest are over  I ll be looking to see whether it can take out the 8 06 area  If it can  the next target is 8 3 4  and beyond that look for something around 9 3 4 
TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR   on multiple contracts  this stock is running  It was up 58 cents  or 3   on 3 3 million shares  It closed just under 20 on Tuesday at 19 51  The high up in this zone back in February was 20 83  I think it s going to test that  and maybe get to 20 22 1 2 short term 
Vimicro International Corp   NASDAQ VIMC  has a consolidation taking place  I like the reversal on Tuesday  Look at the low  right on the 50 day  right on the trendline  and it reversed from 8 55 to 9 50  and closed at 9 38  It was up only 3 cents  but the positive day on Tuesday was important  Look at the resistance on this one over the last three weeks  If it can get above 9 70  I think it will start to run and retest the 52 week highs at the 11 3 4 range  and beyond that 14
