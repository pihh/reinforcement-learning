153750,375266,HRL,U S  farmers face devastation following Midwest floods,news,"By Humeyra Pamuk  P J  Huffstutter and Tom Polansek WINSLOW  Neb  CHICAGO  Reuters    Midwestern farmers have been gambling they could ride out the U S  China trade war by storing their corn and soybeans anywhere they could   in bins  plastic tubes  in barns or even outside   Now  the unthinkable has happened  Record floods have devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt across Iowa  Nebraska  South Dakota and several other states  Early estimates of lost crops and livestock are approaching  1 billion in Nebraska alone  With more flooding expected  damages are expected to climb much higher for the region   As river levels rose  spilling over levees and swallowing up townships  farmers watched helplessly as the waters consumed not only their fields  but their stockpiles of grain  the one thing that can stand between them and financial ruin    I ve never seen anything like this in my life   said Tom Geisler  a farmer in Winslow  Nebraska  who said he lost two full storage bins of corn   We had been depending on the income from our livestock  but now all of our feed is gone  so that is going to be even more difficult  We haven t been making any money from our grain farming because of trade issues and low prices   The pain does not end there  As the waters began to recede in parts of Nebraska  the damage to the rural roads  bridges and rail lines was just beginning to emerge  This infrastructure is critical for the U S  agricultural sector to move products from farms to processing plants and shipping hubs   The damage to roads means it will be harder for trucks to deliver seed to farmers for the coming planting season  but in some areas  the flooding on fields will render them all but impossible to use  The deluge is the latest blow for the Farm Belt  which has faced several crises in the last five years  as farm incomes have fallen by more than 50 percent due to a global grain glut  President Donald Trump s trade policies cut off exports of soybeans and other products  making the situation worse  Soybeans were the single most valuable U S  agricultural export crop and until the trade war  China bought  12 billion worth a year from American farmers  But Chinese tariffs have almost halted the trade  leaving farmers with crops they are struggling to sell for a profit  CORN AND SOYBEANS DESTROYED  As prices plummeted last year amid the ongoing trade fight  growers  faced with selling crops at a loss  stuffed a historic volume of grain into winding plastic tubes and steel bins  Some cash strapped families piled crops inside their barns or outside on the ground  Farmers say they are now finding storage bags torn and bins burst open  grain washed away or contaminated  Jeff Jorgenson  a farmer and regional director for the Iowa Soybean Association  said he has seen at least a dozen bins that burst after grains swelled when they became wet   Under U S  Food and Drug Administration policy  flood soaked grain is considered adulterated and must be destroyed  according to Iowa State University   Some farmers had been waiting for corn prices to rise just 10 cents a bushel more before making sales  which would earn them a few extra thousand dollars  Jorgenson said    That s the toughest pill to swallow   Jorgenson said   This could end their career of farming and the legacy of the family farm   As of Dec  1  producers in states with flooding   including South Dakota  Nebraska  Kansas  Minnesota  Iowa  Missouri  Wisconsin and Illinois   had 6 75 billion bushels of corn  soybeans and wheat stored on their farms   38 percent of the total U S  supplies available at that time  according to U S  Department of Agriculture data  Iowa suffered at least  150 million in damage to agricultural buildings and machinery  and 100 000 acres of farm land are under water  said Keely Coppess  a spokeswoman for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship  Jorgenson surveyed more than two dozen local farmers to assess the damage and tallied about 1 25 million bushels of corn and 390 000 bushels of soybeans lost just in Fremont County  Iowa  worth an estimated  7 3 million   EXTENT OF DAMAGE UNCLEAR The record flooding has killed at least four people in the Midwest and left one person missing  The extent of damage is unknown as meteorologists expect more flooding in coming weeks   Early estimates put flood damage at  400 million in losses for Nebraska s cow calf industry and another  440 million in crop losses  Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts told a news conference on Wednesday    The water came so fast   said John Hansen  president of the Nebraska Farmers Union   We know our farmers didn t have enough time to move all the cattle or empty all their grain bins   Multiple washouts and high water on BNSF Railway Co s main lines have caused major disruption across parts of the Midwest  the company warned on its website  The flooding also has disrupted part of Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL  Corp s supply chain  the company told Reuters  The roads are so bad that Nebraska s National Guard on Wednesday will push hay out of a military helicopter to feed cattle in Colfax County stranded by floodwaters  Major General Daryl Bohac said  It is the first time in at least half a century that such an air drop has been conducted  he said  Cattle carcasses have been found tangled in debris or rotting in trees  while tractors and other expensive machinery are stuck in mud  unable to be moved  At Geisler s farm in Winslow  Nebraska  two trucks and a tractor were seen buried in mud in wooden barns where water pooled  
 We should have been getting into planting for next season  but now all of our equipment is flooded and it s going to take at least three to four weeks to bring back that equipment into shape   said Geisler ",2019-03-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-farmers-face-devastation-following-midwest-floods-1813694,1813694
153751,375267,HRL,Locked out of China  U S  pork producers sniff out new buyers,news,"By Tom Polansek CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  hog farmers lost hundreds of millions of dollars in export sales to China and Mexico after President Donald Trump launched his trade wars last year  But the sector has largely offset those massive losses by cobbling together new customers in smaller markets from Colombia to Vietnam  according a Reuters analysis of data from the U S  Meat Export Federation and the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   As American farmers pin their hopes for a trade deal on Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping s agreement to restart talks at last week s G20 summit  the pork industry stands out for its success in avoiding the sharp sales reductions that have slammed other U S  farm sectors  such as soybeans and sorghum  Overall  U S  pork exports fell 3 9  by volume and 8 4  by value from May 2018 to April 2019  compared to a year earlier  according to data compiled by the U S  Meat Export Federation  China increased its tariff on U S  pork in April of last year and again in July  when it imposed tariffs on soybeans  By comparison  total U S  soybean exports dropped 13 7  by volume and 19 2  by value during the same period  while total sorghum exports dropped 72 8  by volume and 73 6  by value  according to the USDA  The boom in small market sales has  been a savior for the pork industry   Iowa hog farmer Dean Meyer said  The industry s salvation has roots in global marketing efforts that began more than a decade before the U S China trade dispute  as American hog farmers and their trade groups sought to take advantage of a boom in protein demand linked rising incomes in emerging markets   They visited importers and grocery stores in developing countries  taught buyers how U S  pork is produced and touted its quality to chefs and bloggers around the world  according to participants in the trade trips  Those efforts took years to pay off  As China and Mexico reduced their purchases last year  a subsequent drop in U S  pork prices helped encourage alternative buyers to ramp up purchases   particularly from smaller markets that had trade agreements with the United States  such as Colombia and South Korea  The sector s ability to avoid a sharper decline in total exports underscores the importance of developing a diversified customer base to guard against any trade disruptions with major importers  The soy industry had grown so heavily dependent on China   which before the trade war purchased 60  of U S  soy exports  worth about  12 billion   that its more recent efforts to find new markets couldn t make up for the business it lost in the trade war  Sorghum  a much smaller crop  is even more dependent on China  which had accounted for 80  of U S  exports  By contrast  the U S  pork industry relied on China and Hong Kong for about 20  of exports by volume in the  6 billion market before the trade war  Hog farmers started to worry years ago about the risk of a decline in demand from China  which previously blocked some U S  pork over the use of a drug that helps fatten hogs  U S  pork sales to China and Hong Kong sank about 30  by volume and value to about 326 726 metric tons and  737 million in the 12 months ending in April  after Beijing increased its tariff to 62  from 12  last year  Sales to Mexico over the same period dropped 11  by volume and 25  by value  to about 726 859 metric tons and  1 2 billion  after Mexico imposed 20  tariffs on U S  pork imports in retaliation for U S  duties on metals imports last year  Replacement buyers in smaller markets   many of which already had relationships with U S  meat producers   quickly stepped in to snap up much of the pork industry s surplus  U S  exports to Colombia  the Dominican Republic  Australia  Philippines  Vietnam and South Korea climbed by 24  by volume   to more than 530 000 metric tons   in the 12 months ending in April  compared to a year earlier  according to data from the U S  Meat Export Federation   GRAPHIC     YEARS OF SALES PITCHES Meyer and other hog farmers like him have trekked across the globe on trade missions seeking new buyers for U S  pork  He visited Colombia in 2015 and Peru in 2017  efforts that are now showing results  Meyer said  Colombia s imports of U S  pork rose by 34  to more than 103 000 metric tons in the 12 months ending in April 2019  aided by the U S  Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement  Exports to South Korea jumped 14  to more than 230 000 metric tons in the 12 months ending in April  boosted by the United States Korea Free Trade Agreement  U S  pork sales to Vietnam climbed by 334  by volume  to more than 16 500 metric tons  over the same period    I think it s a result of doing these trade missions  hitting these markets hard   said Meyer  who also serves on the executive committee for the U S  Meat Export Federation  This spring  the U S  Meat Export Federation organized a pork cook off in Ho Chi Minh City and afterward held an educational session and reception for about 300 chefs  U S  farmers on a separate trade trip to Vietnam visited food manufacturer Vissan  HNO VSN  last autumn  said Nebraska hog farmer Bill Luckey  who took part in the trip and is a director for the National Pork Board   As a result  the Vietnamese company sent a delegation to tour U S  meat processing plants  opening the door for potential deals  he said   We are out there trying to look at opportunities around the world   Luckey said  Vissan is now considering importing frozen U S  pork for the first time  the company said  In a bid to increase international meat sales   Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  added staff last year to include South America  Philippines  and the Middle East   Hormel Foods Corp   N HRL  also added staff  focusing on Asia and South America  MISSED OPPORTUNITIES While the pork sector has limited its losses  it might make great gains in sales to China were it not for the trade war  An epidemic of a fatal hog disease  African swine fever  ASF   has decimated millions of pigs in China s domestic herd  increasing its reliance on pork imports  China is the world s top hog producer and pork consumer   This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in China because of ASF   said Nick Giordano  vice president and global government affairs counsel for the National Pork Producers Council   We can t fully capitalize on it because we have a 50  punitive tariff    
The U S  industry did benefit from the epidemic  however  Expectations that the disease will push China to increase pork imports lifted U S  hog futures  LHc1  by 78  from a four month low in February to a five year high in May  Prices have since dropped  but the gains allowed some farmers to lock in profits through 2020 ",2019-07-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/locked-out-of-china-us-pork-producers-sniff-out-new-buyers-1912899,1912899
153752,375268,HRL,Pork producers win dismissal of price fixing lawsuits   U S  court ruling,news," Reuters    A federal judge on Thursday dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing several large U S  pork companies of conspiring to limit the supply of pork in order to inflate prices and their own profits at the expense of consumers and other purchasers

 This regulatory change allows us to ensure food safety while eliminating outdated rules and allowing for companies to innovate   USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said ",2019-09-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-worker-foodsafety-advocates-sound-alarm-over-new-hog-slaughter-rules-1980169,1980169

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Hormel  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Meat Products industry  posted revenues of  2 50 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 57   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 52 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Hormel shares have added about 0 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 25  
What s Next for Hormel 
While Hormel has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hormel was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

153786,375302,HRL,China Has Few Places to Shop for Pork If Fever Disrupts Output,news," Bloomberg     As a deadly pig virus strikes China  the world s biggest pork consumer won t have many places to turn if it needs to boost imports 
So far  it s too early to tell whether the outbreak of African swine fever    a highly contagious  pig eradicating virus    will have a significant impact on China s domestic pork production  said Joe Schuele  a spokesman for the U S  Meat Export Federation  Still  it s unsettling to see a disease this deadly  which no other country has been successful at fighting  spreading among the world s densest hog population  said Brett Stuart  founding partner of Global AgriTrends  a market intelligence firm

China produced 53 4 million metric tons of pork in 2017 and imported about 1 62 million tons  according to U S  Department of Agriculture data

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Pilgrim s Pride and Hormel Foods are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PPC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
PPC currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 22  while HRL has a forward P E of 23 36  We also note that PPC has a PEG ratio of 0 82  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  HRL currently has a PEG ratio of 2 75

These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PPC s Value grade of A and HRL s Value grade of C

153794,375310,HRL,Earnings Preview  Hormel Foods  HRL  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Hormel Foods  HRL  reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Spam canned ham  Dinty Moore stew and other foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 52 billion  down 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hormel 
For Hormel  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hormel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hormel would post earnings of  0 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering a surprise of  5 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

When looking at the last two reports  this maker of Spam canned ham  Dinty Moore stew and other foods has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 2 27   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Hormel was expected to post earnings of  0 45 per share  but it reported  0 46 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 22   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 43 per share  while it actually produced  0 44 per share  a surprise of 2 33

153848,375364,HRL,Corporate America s new dilemma  raising prices to cover higher transport costs,news,"By Eric M  Johnson and Chris Prentice SEATTLE BOCA RATON  Fla   Reuters    The drive for cost cuts and higher margins at U S  trucking and railroad operators is pinching their biggest customers  forcing the likes of  General Mills  Inc  NYSE GIS  and  Hormel Foods Corp   NYSE HRL  to spend more on deliveries and consider raising their own prices as a way to pass along the costs   Interviews with executives at 10 companies across the food  consumer goods and commodities sectors reveal that many are grappling with how to defend their profit margins as transportation costs climb at nearly double the inflation rate  Two executives told Reuters their companies do plan to raise prices  though they would not divulge by how much  A third said it was discussing prospective price increases with retailers   The prospect of higher prices on chicken  cereal and snacks costs comes as inflation emerged as a more distinct threat in recent weeks  The U S  Labor Department reported earlier this month that underlying consumer prices in January posted their biggest gain in more than a year   As U S  economic growth has revved up  railroads and truck fleets have not expanded capacity to keep pace   a decision applauded by Wall Street  Shares of CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX    Norfolk Southern   NYSE NSC   and  Union Pacific  Corp  NYSE UNP  have risen an average 22 percent over the past year as they cut headcount  locomotives and rail cars  and lengthened trains to lower expenses and raise margins  Quickening economic growth  a shortage of drivers and reduced capacity  and higher fuel prices have driven up transportation costs  prompting some companies to threaten to raise prices on goods ranging from chicken to cereal  For a graphic  click  Cream of Wheat maker B G Foods Inc  Cheerios maker General Mills and  Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN   owner of Hillshire Farms brand and Jimmy Dean sausage  said they will pass along higher freight costs to their customers  Tyson Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes told Reuters in an interview that its price increases  should be in place for the second half  of its fiscal year  and that it has begun negotiating price increases with retailers and food service operators  The company declined to specify how much its freight costs increased in recent months  but a spokesman said they are up between 10 to 15 percent for the total industry  General Mills informed convenience store and food service customers of the price increases directly  a spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement  declining to provide specifics  Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening cited logistic costs and wage inflation as factors    It feels to me like an environment that should be beneficial for some pricing   he said in a presentation at last week s Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference  Hormel Foods  the maker of Skippy peanut butter and SPAM  has been talking with retailers about raising prices  according to Chief Executive Jim Snee   We don t believe we re going to recoup all of our freight cost increases for the balance of the year   Snee told Reuters in an interview  noting operating margin sank to 13 2 percent  from 15 6 percent due to higher costs   including freight   in the most recent quarter   Confectionary and snack company  Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  halted operations over a weekend late last month at its Toledo  Ohio wheat flour mill   the second largest flour mill in the United States   because the plant could not get enough rail cars to carry flour to bakeries  a spokeswoman said   She declined to comment on whether Mondelez would raise prices to cover any higher costs  A new government regulation for drivers and truck availability are pushing up freight costs at JM Smucker Co   We anticipate inflationary pressures likely to cause upward price movements in a variety of categories   Chief Financial Officer Mark Belgya said last week at an analyst conference  To be sure  transportation costs are just a sliver of the price consumers pay at the grocery store  The U S  Department of Agriculture estimates transportation represents just 3 3 cents of every dollar consumers spend  But an increase in truck rates over the next 12 months implies a 15 to 18 basis point gross margin headwind for U S  food companies on average  according to Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard   A lot of the consumer goods companies work on margin   said Joe Glauber  a former USDA Chief Economist and a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute   They are going to be pushing those costs along  to retailers  Ultimately  consumers end up shouldering more of the burden   he said  That would be a change for consumers who have seen years of low to negative food inflation  he noted  RISING COSTS HIT EARNINGS Prices of key commodity ingredients including corn  sugar and cocoa remain relatively low due to bumper harvests around the globe  But even as companies  freight costs increase  their packaging costs are also rising  industry analysts said   Global energy prices have risen sharply from 2016 s lows  driving up prices for not only diesel but also packing material like plastics  which are byproducts of crude and natural gas  Others companies have blamed freight hikes for lower earnings forecasts for 2018  including U S  oilfield services company Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co  It shaved ten cents per share from its earnings forecast last week due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking    They try to squeeze every dollar for profit rather than provide service   said Robert Murray  the chief executive of Murray Energy Corporation  the largest privately owned U S  coal company which relies on CSX and Norfolk Southern to help transport its goods   Murray said both CSX and Norfolk Southern have lacked rail cars and crew to haul 4 million tons of coal from mines in West Virginia and Ohio to the Port of Baltimore this year   CSX spokesman Christopher Smith said its service has improved steadily over recent months and it was working with customers to solve problems  Norfolk Southern declined to comment  At an analyst conference Thursday  Norfolk Southern Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Earhart said that the railroad was looking to raise prices on consumer goods and other truck competitive freight it hauls in 2018  But she said it had no plans to increase headcount or move equipment out of storage  despite worsening train speeds and rail car idle times in the first quarter   Earhart said the railroad was moving some employees to problem spots  like its terminal in Birmingham  Alabama  from other areas of its network  Union Pacific has started pulling stored locomotives back into service and plans to bring back 600 employees in the first quarter 2018 to prevent rail cars from spending too much time in yards  said Union Pacific spokeswoman Raquel Espinoza  The time UP rail cars were sitting idle in terminals rose to 32 5 hours in the fourth quarter from 29 hours in the year ago period  and its overall workforce dropped during the last two quarters  according to company data   Berkshire Hathaway s BNSF said winter weather has impacted velocity and fluidity on portions of its primary route between the Pacific Northwest and Midwest  but said it has not been cutting crews and rolling stock   NO SLACK IN THE SYSTEM   U S  truck fleets have not kept pace with growing demand for different reasons  industry executives said  The April 1 enforcement deadline for a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their hours has effectively curtailed capacity  adding to a chronic shortage of people willing to drive trucks for the wages offered   Tight capacity means trucking firms have leverage as they negotiate freight rates  Dry van shipping rates are expected to rise as much as 10 percent in 2018  while  spot  rates for last minute cargo hit record levels in January before falling slightly  according to online freight marketplace DAT Solutions  Chemical maker Chemours Company estimates 30 percent of its rail shipments have highly unpredictable delivery times  while automaker Toyota Motor Corp has struggled periodically to get rail cars for finished vehicles at plants served by the major railroads    If I was to ask for anything  it s consistency   said Lee Hobgood  general manager of Toyota s transportation operations   I am not feeling cuts  I am feeling imbalance at times   Agribusiness giant Cargill declined to quantify how much its freight costs are going up and whether it would pass costs on to its customers  But at a soybean processing plant near Lafayette  Ind   Cargill has had such long delays getting loaded railcars moved out  the company plans to buy its own Trackmobile railcar mover to relieve the congestion  One Trackmobile unit can cost at least  250 000  Brad Hildebrand  Cargill s Global Rail and Barge Lead  told Reuters the Lafayette plant otherwise could shut down

153878,375394,HRL,Canada beats U S  in pork sales to China   feet  elbows and all,news,"By Rod Nickel  Michael Hirtzer and Dominique Patton WINNIPEG CHICAGO BEIJING  Reuters    Canada has overtaken the United States as the top North American supplier of pork to China as farmers and meat packers in both nations battle for lucrative shares of the biggest global market  Canada s pork sales to China  after a sharp rise last year  exceeded those of the United States in the first quarter of 2017  That s only happened a handful of times in two decades  according to U S  and Canadian government data  Rising affluence is driving China s voracious appetite for pork  including parts of the pig   feet  elbows  innards   which command little value in most countries  At the same time  tightened environmental standards in China have forced farm closures and boosted demand for cheaper imports  That s a bonanza for Canadian farmers  who have almost completely removed the growth drug ractopamine from their pigs  diet   largely because it is banned in China  which consumes half the world s pork  U S  exports to China  by contrast  are limited because only about half of the nation s herd has been weaned off the drug  according to U S  hog producers  meat packers and animal feed dealers  But major U S  based firms are now moving to produce more ractopamine free hogs   including the three biggest pork producers  Smithfield Foods  SFII UL   Seaboard Foods  a division of  Seaboard Corp   A SEB   and Triumph Foods  a hog farmer cooperative  The ascension of Canada s pork exports underscores the power of the gargantuan Chinese market to influence agricultural practices and profits in supplier countries worldwide  As recently as 2013  annual U S  pork sales to China  some 333 000 tonnes  more than doubled Canada s shipments of 161 000 tonnes  That s the same year Canada s hog industry started to remove ractopamine  best known as Eli Lilly   Co  N LLY  product Paylean  In the first quarter of this year  Canada shipped nearly 93 000 tonnes of pork to China  on pace to hit 372 000 tonnes annually  That eclipsed the 87 500 tonnes that the United States shipped  according to data from both governments  For a graphic on United States and Canada pork sales to China  see   The European Union  which has long banned ractopamine  is China s top foreign pork supplier  sending 393 365 tonnes there in the first quarter  Chinese authorities banned the use of ractopamine in livestock in 2002  They say meat raised with the drug can cause nausea and diarrhea in people and be life threatening to sufferers of heart disease  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  however  did not see the same dangers when it approved ractopamine in 1999  concluding that it would  not have a significant impact on the human environment   The FDA s stance has drawn some criticism  including a 2014 lawsuit by environmental groups alleging the agency has not fully examined the drug s impact  The suit was later dismissed on technical grounds but is being appealed  Hog farmer and rancher groups defend ractopamine use  saying it allows them to grow livestock more efficiently  with less feed  said Dave Warner  spokesman for National Pork Producers Council  Canadian health authorities also allow consumption of pork from hogs raised with the drug  SELLING ELBOWS ONLINE The China market is so lucrative that Canada s HyLife started selling pork online directly to Chinese consumers last year   The small Manitoba processor hawks pig feet and elbows on e commerce site JD com Inc  O JD   a competitor of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA    They re big online buyers   said Claude Vielfaure  HyLife s chief operating officer   You try to move your pork all kinds of ways   Rising Chinese pork demand has driven up prices for by products including pigs  feet  kidneys and livers  Pigs feet sell for more than C 2 50   1 85  per kilogram   about double their value two years ago  said Richard Davies  executive vice president of sales and marketing at Olymel  one of Canada s biggest pork packers  Selling by products can squeeze another  10 per pig from a carcass that otherwise earns packers about  180  said Ray Price  president of Alberta based processor Sunterra Meats  China is the biggest byproduct market  followed by Taiwan and Philippines  Stewed pigs feet with white beans is a famous dish from Sichuan province  one of China s culinary capitals  while blood sausage  made from intestines and cooked with pickled vegetables  is a traditional winter dish in the northeast  Chinese consumers enjoy the strong flavor of offal   internal organs and entrails  In Beijing  stir fried pig s liver with vegetables is common on dinner tables and known for its nutritional value  In all  China consumed 55 million tonnes of pork last year  Although that is the lowest total in four years  imports are rising fast because millions of China s small scale farmers have left the pork business in recent years because of falling prices and rising environmental standards  The government forced thousands of farms to close because of severe water pollution  China became Quebec based Olymel s biggest export market last year  vaulting over the United States and Japan  It plans to open a sales office there as early as next year   Just a tweak in that market can change the game for anyone in the world   Davies said  GETTING PIGS OFF DRUGS U S  pork producers have moved more slowly than their Canadian competitors to raise ractopamine free pigs  primarily because the United States is the world s third biggest domestic market for pork   Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  and  Hormel Foods Corp   N HRL  continue to process hogs that were fed ractopamine in part because they do not raise their own pigs  Hormel s hog supply  comes from more than 500 family farms   a Hormel spokesman said  many of which use the growth drug  U S  firms can also send pork from ractopamine fed hogs to Mexico and Japan  the top U S  pork export markets  But many U S  based suppliers are nonetheless scrambling to take advantage of Chinese demand for ractopamine free pork  Smithfield   the world s biggest pork producer and a subsidiary of Hong Kong listed WH Group  HK 0288    has raised most of its hogs without the drug for more than two years  a spokeswoman said  As the top exporter of pork to China  Smithfield firm shipped 300 000 tonnes there from the United States and Europe last year  The second  and third biggest U S  pork producers   Seaboard and Triumph   are jointly opening a pork processing plant next month in Sioux City  Iowa  where nearly all hogs slaughtered will be ractopamine free  according to local hog producers and animal feed mills  Building dedicated ractopamine free pork plants allows processors to limit risk of China rejecting shipments that contain trace amounts of the drug  Seaboard declined to comment about ractopamine  Triumph did not respond to requests for comment  The Cooperative Farmers Elevator in Ocheydan  Iowa  is constructing a new feed mill that by 2018 will produce only ractopamine free animal feed   It was requested from some of the customers we deal with   said Steve Peterson  the cooperative s vice president of feed   The one that is pushing the hardest is Seaboard   U S  hog producer Prestage Farms also is planning a new Iowa slaughterhouse for as many as 10 000 ractopamine free hogs annually by 2018  president Ron Prestage told Reuters  With the U S  hogs in record supply  foreign demand is essential to profits  Prestage said   When we have plentiful hogs  as we do today  packers prefer not to have ractopamine   Prestage said   They want to be able to export as much product as they can

153888,375404,HRL,Beyond Meat Might Be Animal Friendly  But Investors Could Suffer,opinion,"Beyond Meat  which went public on May 2 and might just turn out to be the most dramatic initial public offering  IPO  of the year was supposed to be a small  relatively quiet IPO  taking place in the shadow of debuts from bigger  higher profile  more closely watched tech giants  But a potent mix of investor irrationality and FOMO made this stock s premiere on the NASDAQ perhaps the most unpredictable market event we ve seen in a while  when shares at one point skyrocketed higher by 240  after the stock opened at  45 
Though Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  was set to IPO at  25  the stock opened at  45  jumped to  70 on the first day of trade and peaked at  85 mid week  before falling to  62 on Friday  The stock is now hovering around the  66 mark 

Chart powered by TradingView
Ten days and lots of volatility later  the direction the stock will take next remains unclear  Its upward momentum appears to have collapsed  though shares are still trading 165  above its IPO price  Is it worth buying into thIs correction or is there more pain to come for investors 
While Beyond Meat has potential  it s current fundamentals  as laid out in its pre IPO S 1 filing  make it seem that Beyond Meat is a  feel good  stock  rather than a good investment 
Unique Plant Based Meat Substitute 
Beyond Meat is a food manufacturer that s developed a line of plant based meat substitutes  Vegetarian meat alternatives aren t new  but  Beyond Meat claims its products replicate the  taste  texture  and sensory attributes  of actual meat  It has three product offerings  its flagship Beyond Burger  sausages and  beef  crumbles 
The company s products are already widely distributed in the U S  and Canada and are available at burger chains such as Carl s Jr  and TGI Friday  As well  they re available in 11 000 restaurants in total  and 11 000 grocery stores across the U S 
Beyond Meat s S 1 filing emphasizes that it isn t targeting vegetarians or vegans  but rather meat eaters  Given that the global meat industry is estimated at  1 4 trillion  with  270 billion or 19  of it coming from U S  based carnivores  Beyond Meat s mission is significant  Still  there s substantial potential  research shows that a majority of people  including meat eaters  would be willing to give this type of product a try  However  competition for an individual s ideal protein source is growing 
Two Fold Competition
Competition comes from two directions  First  Beyond Meat is competing with manufacturers of other plant based meat substitutes  such as Impossible Foods  whose vegetarian burger will soon get an exposure boost when it becomes available across the U S  at Burger King  NYSE QSR   Other veggie burger competitors include Boca Foods  NASDAQ KHC  and Tofurky  plus  of course  traditional meat industry stalwarts including Cargill  Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL   Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  and others 
A second competitive front comes from lab grown meat rather than plant based substitutes  Startups have been competing in this arena over the past few years  trying to become the first to offer this type of product at prices similar to traditional meat  though none have succeeded so far  Israel based Strauss Group  TA STRS  as well as Tyson are trying to make inroads on this front 
It s difficult  of course  to predict human behavior both on the moral and culinary front  but it pays to note that clearly  the entire industry is undergoing a massive shift right now 
Revenue and Earnings
More significant  perhaps  Beyond Meat s numbers make the stock s current value proposition questionable  In 2018  Beyond Meat brought in  88 million in revenue  compared to  32 million in 2017  for a growth trajectory of 175  in revenue  Maybe more important  2018 marked the first year during which Beyond Meat s revenue surpassed its cost of goods sold  meaning the company finally started to enjoy the benefits of economies of scales for its manufacturing operation 
Even after its public debut  the company remains in the red  with a loss of  29 million one million dollars less than its 2017 losses  Revenue growth was offset by higher freight costs  a 111  increase in headcount and higher marketing expenses as the company continues to try to expand its reach 
Questionable Valuation
At  66 a share  Beyond Meat s market cap is closing in on  4 billion  This means the company is currently valued at a little under 50 times annual sales  We ll say that again  not 50 times earnings  50 times revenue  That s an extremely lofty valuation for a company that hasn t yet brought in a single dollar of profit 
Take Tyson Foods  an established food manufacturer  as a counter example  The Arkansas based food conglomerate has an annual revenue of  40 billion  almost  2 billion in net income  and yet it s worth  only   28 billion dollars  0 7 times its annual sales  We re not saying that Tyson Foods has better or even equal growth prospects to Beyond Meat  but the gap between the two valuations is simply ludicrous  Consider this as well  Beyond Meat  which creates its product from pea protein  is now worth more than all the peas in America 
When it comes to business  growth prospects trump everything else  Though Beyond Meat s revenue grew 175  last year  on the back of new product and new distribution channels  after its current exposure boom  will the company be able to sustain that torrid pace 
In order to cross  1 billion in sales and justify its multi billion valuation as a sub  100 million in revenue business  Beyond Meat will need to double its revenue every year for the next four years  That may happen  of course  but we re in the business of considering the most likely scenario  And even with the early excitement surrounding the company s first days of trade  in the long term  given the competition  the state of the industry and its valuation  Beyond Meat s stock is simply too rich for our taste ",2019-05-13,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beyond-meat-vegan-friendly-maybe-but-hardly-so-for-investors-200420606,200420606
153889,375405,HRL,Hormel Foods  HRL  Q2 Earnings Beat  Stock Down On View Cut ,opinion,Hormel Foods Corporation   NYSE HRL   posted second quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein both top and bottom lines increased year over year and the latter marked its fourth successive beat  However  sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the sixth straight time  Also  the company struggled with input cost inflation  which along with expectations of volatile pork prices led to a lowered fiscal 2019 view Clearly  this was a letdown for investors  Hence  shares of the company lost 2 6  during the pre market trading session  Moreover  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has declined 7 2  in the past three months against the  s growth of 14 4  The company concluded the divestiture of CytoSport business to PepsiCo   NASDAQ PEP   last month  The transaction was valued at nearly  465 million Quarter in DetailQuarterly earnings of 46 cents per share came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents  Further  the bottom line rose 4 5  from 44 cents reported in the year ago period  This can be attributable to improved sales  lower interest expenses and reduced tax rate  Effective tax rate during the quarter was 11 1  compared with 20  in the year ago quarter Hormel Foods Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Net sales came in at  2 344 7 million  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 368 million  Nevertheless  the top line inched up 0 6  year over year backed by sales growth in three out of four segments Hormel Foods witnessed roughly 1  advancement in volumes  The upside can be mainly attributed to improved volumes in the Grocery Products segment Segment DetailsSales in the Grocery Products unit climbed 2 2  to  635 3 million  owing to gains from Wholly Guacamole dips  Herdez salsas and sauces  and Skippy peanut butter  These were countered by reduced sales from CytoSport products  Volumes in this unit improved 3   Further  operating profit rallied 12 1  to  104 5 million Revenues in the Jennie O Turkey Store segment moved up 0 5  to  305 3 million  as gains from foodservice and whole bird sales were countered by retail declines  Volumes in the segment grew 2   Operating profit slumped 45  to  17 7 million  This was accountable to greater than expected plant startup costs  elevated feed costs and soft retail sales The company s Refrigerated Foods segment generated sales of   1 257 9 million  up roughly 1  year over year  The upside was fueled by foodservice sales of products like Hormel Bacon 1  Hormel Fire Braised and Austin Blues as well as retail sales of Hormel pepperoni  Hormel Black Label  Hormel prepared foods and Hormel Natural Choice products  Further  volumes in the unit remained flat  Operating profit fell 5 3  to  158 1 million  owing to a decline in commodity profits and escalated operational costs International   Other revenues were down 8 6  to nearly  146 3 million  The downside can be blamed on continued tariff impacts on fresh pork exports  Further  volumes in the unit declined 7   Operating profit decreased 31 3  to nearly  14 3 million on account of tariffs and increased freight costs Costs MarginsSelling  general and administrative expenses totaled  170 1 million  down from  204 5 million in the year ago quarter  This can be partly accountable to reduced selling costs Operating income came in at  312 4 million  up 3 5   Operating margin increased 40 bps to 13 3  Balance Sheet Cash FlowThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  639 3 million and long term debt of  250 million  excluding current maturities  In the first six months of fiscal 2019  Hormel Foods generated cash of  365 6 million from operating activities  Capital expenditure summed  48 million during the second quarter  The company expects capital expenditures to be roughly  310 million for fiscal 2019 During the quarter  the company repurchased 0 6 million shares for nearly  23 million  On May 15  the company paid dividend at an annual rate of 84 cents per share A day prior to the release  Hormel Foods declared quarterly dividend of 21 cents a share  payable on Aug 15  2019  to shareholders of record as on Jul 15 OutlookWhile the company witnessed record sales  results were hampered by input cost inflation  This in turn stemmed from the African swine fever in China  which weighed on the hog and pork markets during the second quarter  Though the company has announced strong pricing actions across all its segments  except Jennie O Turkey Store  these actions are likely to lag the input cost inflation  Further  the company reduced its expectations for the Jennie O Turkey Store segment  as it continues to invest in the segment to regain retail distribution These factors along with expectations of volatile pork prices in the domestic market compelled management to lower its fiscal 2019 guidance Hormel Foods now expects net sales of  9 5  10 billion compared with the previous outlook of  9 7  10 2 billion  Further  it now envisions earnings of  1 71 1 85 per share  down from the old guidance of  1 77  1 91 Check These Solid Food StocksSanderson Farms

153924,375440,HRL,Earnings Preview  Hormel Foods  HRL  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Hormel Foods  HRL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Spam canned ham  Dinty Moore stew and other foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 40 billion  up 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hormel 
For Hormel  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hormel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hormel would post earnings of  0 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 51  delivering a surprise of  10 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hormel doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-hormel-foods-hrl-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200388207,200388207

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 33   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Spam canned ham  Dinty Moore stew and other foods would post earnings of  0 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 51  delivering a surprise of 10 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Hormel  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Meat Products industry  posted revenues of  2 36 billion for the quarter ended January 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 64   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 33 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Hormel shares have added about 1 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 11 1  
What s Next for Hormel 
While Hormel has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hormel was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 46 on  2 40 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 84 on  9 90 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Food   Meat Products is currently in the bottom 18  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hormel-foods-hrl-q1-earnings-top-estimates-200390838,200390838
153952,375468,HRL,Shares in Hormel Foods drop after bird flu outbreak hits its flock,news,"Investing com    Shares in Hormel Foods Corporation  NYSE HRL  fell mildly in after hours trading after the company admitted on Monday that a devastating avian flu outbreak in the Midwest over the last several weeks has impacted its Jennie O Turkey division   
Since early March  the spread of the H5N2 strain has led to the death of approximately 2 5 million turkeys in Minnesota and millions more throughout the Midwest  Also on Monday  the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  said a flock of 5 3 million chickens in Iowa had been infected with a deadly strain of the flu  the largest flock to be affected yet by the virus  Traces of the flu have reportedly been spread as far east as parts of Southern Ontario   
 We are experiencing significant challenges in our turkey supply chain due to the recent HPAI outbreaks in Minnesota and Wisconsin   Hormel Foods CEO Jeffrey M  Ettinger said in a statement   While Jennie O Turkey Store has delivered strong financial performance so far in the first half  tight meat supplies and operational challenges will pressure earnings in the back half of our fiscal year    
Ettinger said Hormel will keep its forward guidance at  2 50  2 60 per share  with the assumption that warmer temperatures will contain the outbreak over the next several months   
During a visit to Minnesota last week  Dr  John Clifford  chief veterinarian of the USDA  said the number of avian flu cases should level off once the warmer weather expectedly kills off the virus  Clifford added  though  that there is a strong chance the virus could re appear in the fall

153954,375470,HRL,Exclusive  U S  boosts bird flu emergency funds as Hormel cuts jobs,news,"By P J  Huffstutter and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO  Reuters    The U S  government approved the use of an additional  330 million in emergency funds to help contain the worst avian influenza outbreak in U S  history  as infected bird cases soared and hundreds of Minnesota poultry workers learned they would lose their jobs 
The funds became available after the federal Office of Management and Budget granted U S  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack s request for additional emergency funds  USDA sources confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday 
Virulent H5 avian influenza strains have spread to 14 states in five months and affected about 24 million birds so far  mostly egg laying hens and turkeys  according to USDA 
That tally is expected to grow  as U S  authorities confirm pending cases  The outbreak  which is also affecting two Canadian provinces  shows little sign of slowing 
In Minnesota  the largest producer of U S  turkeys  state officials said almost 5 5 million turkeys and egg laying chickens have either died from the flu virus or are set to be killed in an effort to contain the outbreak 
In Iowa  the top U S  egg producer  state agriculture officials said an estimated 20 million chickens and turkeys have been affected there 
The outbreak s economic ripple effects are being felt across numerous sectors  from food companies seeing a squeeze on egg supplies  to meat processors flooded with excess poultry products amid export market bans 
Also on Tuesday   Hormel Foods Corp   NYSE HRL  unit Jennie O Turkey Store said it will temporarily lay off 233 workers at a Minnesota plant  effective May 26  because the flu has reduced turkey supplies  It was the first known instance of a company linking job cuts to bird flu  There is no date set for the workers to return 
 Our intent is to have everyone come back to work when bird numbers return to normal levels   Randy Vergin  manager of the Jennie O Turkey Store plant in Faribault  Minnesota  said in a statement 
The outbreak has also raised concerns that turkey supplies may be tight for the Thanksgiving and holiday season 
The strains pose a low risk to human health  experts say  and no human infections have been identified so far 
ECONOMIC SQUEEZE
While scientists believe wild birds are spreading the disease  researchers do not know exactly how the highly pathogenic H5 viruses have penetrated inside barns 
The outbreak is also hurting scores of U S  poultry farmers  who are expected to submit indemnity claims to the U S  Agriculture Department in the wake of their birds becoming infected and flocks culled 
 Farmers across Minnesota are in a financial and emotional whirlwind   said Minnesota state Rep  Jeanne Poppe  a Democrat   Turkey processing plants are being forced to idle production lines because of the drastic decline in turkey supplies and workers are being laid off  
Initially  USDA had set aside  84 5 million to compensate farmers and for other outbreak related costs  The agency can use additional funds to pay for the expected increase in indemnity claims filed by poultry farmers 
The funds are also approved for such uses as sanitation of equipment and the culling of infected flocks

153959,375475,HRL,Hormel Foods  HRL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Hormel Foods  HRL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Spam canned ham  Dinty Moore stew and other foods is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 56 billion  up 2 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 72  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hormel 
For Hormel  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hormel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hormel would post earnings of  0 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  2 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hormel doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hormel-foods-hrl-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200358767,200358767

	In a move that surprised practically no one  President Trump pulled the U S  out of the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday  Since the outcome was predictable  the big question was how the market would react to this administration s latest controversial move 
	It pretty much just shrugged its shoulders 
	Stocks dipped after the announcement but spent the remainder of the session rallying into the close and leaving the major indices at breakeven 
	The Dow now has a four session winning streak  though that feels rather weird to say since it only advanced 0 01   or 2 89 points  to 24 360 2  Nevertheless  a winning streak is a winning streak  and the index fought back from a nearly 160 point loss in the moments after the Iran deal news 
	The NASDAQ also poked its head onto the positive side by the closing bell  increasing 0 02   or 1 69 points  to 7266 9  The S P couldn t follow its counterparts and ended with a slight decline of 0 03   or less than a point  to 2671 9  People are split on whether this was a good move for the US or a bad one  But stocks seemed to take it all in stride  Especially given the 90 day buffer before anything happens   said Kevin in Options Trader

154018,375534,HRL,What To Expect From Dean Foods  DF  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Dean Foods Company   NYSE DF   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 26 Last quarter  the company reported earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  Dean Foods has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 15 2  Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement What to Expect The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether Dean Foods will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 26 cents per share  reflecting a 31 6  decline year over year  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 95 billion  down 3 4  from the year ago quarter Furthermore  the stock has declined 14 6  in the past month  wider than the broader  sector s loss of 6 6  Factors at PlayDean Foods  top line has been plagued by challenges related to soft volumes  higher raw milk costs and loss of share in U S  fluid milk volumes  Moreover  the company s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk  soybeans  diesel fuel and others  the prices of which often fluctuate  Hence  any rise in the price of these commodities is likely to hurt margins In third quarter 2017  raw milk costs were up about 10  year over year and nearly 7  on a sequential basis  which impacted sales  Meanwhile  the milk category remained soft as the fluid milk volumes dipped 2 2  year over year  on a quarter to date basis  Additionally  Dean Foods  share of U S  fluid milk volumes contracted 50 basis points  These adverse fluctuations in raw material prices pose threats to Dean Foods  operating results However  Dean Foods looks well poised with its smart volume initiative  which aims at improving top line  building margins and creating operating efficiencies  In third quarter 2017  the company s results gained from overall solid sales execution and stringent progress on its smart volumes initiative  which helped in wining some new business for 2018  This is likely to produce roughly 40 million gallons on an annualized basis for numerous key customers  The company anticipates starting shipping this volume by end of this year and into early 2018  Going forward  the company expects to bring more smart volumes into its system to aid top line growth Additionally  Dean Foods  initiatives to strengthen brands and diversify portfolio bode well  While the company is seeing core dairy related business growth from products like ice cream  flavored milk and sour cream  it is also optimistic about opportunities in juices  teas and other beverages Going into 2018  the company expects to build brand equity on DairyPure through new product innovation and improved marketing  Moreover  the company s efforts to grow in the organic space  including recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt s juices  should strengthen its portfolio  In the meantime  Dean Foods  remains focused on improving profitability through cost reduction initiatives Despite top line constraints  the company s endeavors look promising to boost its performance in the near term What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model does not show that Dean Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before

Currently  Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL  is forming a bottom  
After gapping lower at the end of August  HRL consolidated losses between 30 32  It is currently at the upper end of its recent trading range  The MACD indicates momentum is shifting  implying a fair amount of upside potential 
The company is in the consumer staples sector  

Hormel Foods Corporation  a Delaware corporation  the Company   was founded by George A  Hormel in 1891 in Austin  Minnesota  as Geo  A  Hormel   Company  The Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this line of business  The Company s name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31  1995  The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States and internationally  Although pork and turkey remain the major raw materials for its products  the Company has emphasized for several years the manufacturing and distribution of branded  value added consumer items rather than the commodity fresh meat business  The Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth  new product development  and acquisitions

While this is certainly not the most exciting business  it is a necessity  which provides protection in weaker economic environments  There is also a large amount of competition in this space  Hormel s primary advantage is size  which means it not only has economies of scale but the ability to simply out muscle or purchase competition 
Hormel s financials  from Morningstar com  are very encouraging 

Balance sheet  unlike other companies I ve profiled  HRL has a nearly 2 1 current ratio  While total assets have increased over the last five years  most of the increase comes in goodwill  a highly subjective concept  But intellectual property has also increased  which means the company has been investing or buying new products    an encouraging sign  Total long term debt is minimal for a company this size  Finally  shareholder equity has increased from 61 78  in 2012 to 69 83  in 2016 
Cash flow  HRL has refunded a lot of its existing debt over the last five years  while also engaging in a stock repurchase plan  Like other large companies  HRL can fund their PPE expenditures from cash flow 
Income Statement  here there is good and bad news  On the good side  the company has expenses under control  Over the last 5 years  the gross margin increased 649 basis points  operating income was up 461 bps  while net income increased 327 BPs  This is fortunate because top line revenue growth has been slowing  The three year average has declined from 6 6  to 2 8  over the last 4 years 

Finally  according to Finviz com  the current dividend is 2 16  with a payout ratio of 38 2  
Overall  this is a solid company  The balance sheet is pristine  They have adequate cash flow and expenses are under control  At these levels  Hormel is worth a look ",2017-11-08,Hale Stewart,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-i-like-this-consumer-staple-200263604,200263604

154055,375571,HRL,Hormel  HRL  Fights Pricing Challenges With New Acquisitions ,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company  Hormel Foods Corporation   NYSE HRL   on Nov 22 Existing Scenario  Hormel Foods reported better than expected fourth quarter fiscal 2017  write when it ended  results  The company intends to boost its near term profitability on the back of stronger demand  new investments and latest business acquisitions  Increased sales of popular brands such as Hormel Gatherings  Hormel Pepperoni  Hormel Natural Choice  Justin s  Wholly Guacamole  Herdez  Spam and SKIPPY are expected to reinforce the company s top line performance in the near term 
Meanwhile  the  130 million capital investment planned to expand the vacant facilities in Kansas  anticipated to be accomplished by December 2018  is likely to help in boosting Hormel Foods  near term revenues by capturing the growing market demand for bacon 
Even so  Hormel Foods believes that the strategic acquisition of the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats  Inc  Aug 17  2017  and the Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol  Aug 24  2017  might boost its revenues and earnings in the quarters ahead 
Also  it stated that Columbus Craft Meats buyout  announced in October 2017  will continue to boost its earnings from fiscal 2018 onwards  Notably  for fiscal 2019  whole year accretion is projected to lie between 6 cents and 8 cents per share 
Additionally  the company believes that consolidation of its Specialty Foods segment into the Grocery Products segment  from fiscal 2018 onward  will assist in delivering increased revenues and cost synergies in the long haul 
However  we notice that Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has moved south for fiscal 2018  ending October 2018   over the last 60 days  Over the last three months  Hormel Foods shares have gained 1 8   underperforming the  s growth of 12 7  

 
In the fiscal fourth quarter  Hormel Foods  Jennie O Turkey Store segment s revenues and profit dipped nearly 10 4  and 24   respectively  The decline was owing to the fall in turkey prices that weighed over the segments  performance  In fact  the turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness price hike in the upcoming quarters 
Meanwhile  lower sales of MUSCLE MILK products led to a 9 2  decline in revenues in the Specialty Foods segment  Even so  spin off of the Farmer John business was primarily responsible for 5 7  year over year downfall in the Refrigerated Foods segment  Hormel Foods perceives that lower turkey prices will continue to hurt its Jennie O Turkey Store business in the quarters ahead 
Furthermore  Hormel Foods  margins are frequently subjected to input price fluctuations  Supply demand inconsistencies also make the market prices of these inputs highly volatile  For instance  the company s margins were severely hurt due to significant inflation in the prices of two major inputs   pork bellies and beef trim   in the reported quarter  Going forward  the company expects that elevated costs of these two inputs would continue hurting its profitability

154089,375605,HRL,China s Coal Miner Merges With Utility Giant  ETFs In Focus,opinion,"The Chinese government has approved a merger between coal miner  Shenhua Energy  and electricity producer  Guodian Corp  This merger will create the world s largest power company by capacity  read    
Per Bloomberg data  the merged companies will have assets to the tune of  271 billion and power capacity of more than 225 gigawatts  With this merger  China aims to tackle its inefficient state owned enterprises and battle the debt burden  Most recently  Shenhua reported its best interim results in four years  Moreover  this merger is expected to spur other deal making activities in the industry  read    
Given China s stand in global coal consumption  this deal is expected to impact international coal trade  China  for almost half of global coal production and consumption 
Shenhua accounts for a large portion of the total coal production in China  Per Reuters  it accounted for 8  of the entire country s production  Given its large size  it plays a major role in determining coal price in the country  Although the company presently sells more coal externally  the scenario is expected to change once the merger is complete 
Moreover  now that internal customers will take a larger share of the total production pie than external customers  the merged company might look at selling its higher quality products to external customers both domestically and internationally 
Not only will this merger help Guodian reduce its cost of raw materials  it will also give the company access to rail infrastructure and other resources of the giant coal miner  This deal has raised concerns among other utility companies  which generally buy from Shenhua  as these companies are concerned that Shenhua will favor Guodian over them when it comes to supplying coal 
Therefore  smaller utilities companies might have to look for other suppliers and purchase coal at a price higher than they currently pay in order to avoid supply shortages in winter

154090,375606,HRL,Why Tyson Foods  Stock Offers Healthy Upside,opinion,"Tyson Foods Inc  NYSE TSN  is the largest food business in the U S  and the largest supplier in both the chicken and beef market  One in five chickens sold in the US comes from Tyson Foods The company  which has been in operation for 70 years  operates four business segments 
Beef  including raw and fully cooked  accounts for 38  of sales 
Chicken  including fresh  frozen  value added and breeding stock  makes up 30  of revenue 
Prepared foods  including pizza crusts  tortillas  soups  sauces and side items  accounts for 20  of sales 
Pork makes up 11  of sales 
Tyson Foods sells its products under the Tyson  Jimmy Dean  Hillshire Farm  Ball Park  Van s  Sara Lee  Chef Pierre  Wright  Aidells  State Fair  Gallo Salame  and Golden Island brands  These brands are distributed to retail outlets and foodservice businesses 
Why Tyson s Stock Fell Off
The stock had performed strongly since 2013 after fluctuating in the mid teens from 2007 to 2012  Shares had reached  75 57 in September 2016 before coming under pressure after news broke that Tyson was  
While the rumors began in September of 2016  the company was only subpoenaed in February this year  That subpoena came after U S  poultry buyers sued the company  alleging it had colluded with other producers since 2008 to reduce chicken production 
At that point  Tyson s EBITDA margin stood at over 9  as of LTM June 2016  higher than it had been for years  Many analysts felt that margins would likely deteriorate going forward as a result of the price fixing investigation  However  management attributed its margin expansion to lower grain prices and higher demand for protein products  a situation analyst now feared wouldn t last 
The combination of rumors of a price fixing scandal and analyst concerns over potential margin pressures caused the stock to fall more than 20   However  on August 25th  the SEC announced that it had concluded its investigation and stated that it would not be recommending any enforcement action against Tyson 
With a major investor concern now out of the way  it s worth looking at the company s future prospects 
Tyson s Healthy Future Prospects
Management is determined to find new channels with sustainable growth potential as noted on the   In this search  the company has experimented with new products  A few of these new product launches include 
Refrigerated breakfasts  Jimmy Dean Fresh Scrambles and Jimmy Dean Pancake   Sausage Bites 
Tyson Tastemakers  fresh meal kits 
Tyson Ground Chicken 
New lines of Hillshire Snacking products 
Additionally  the investment in new experimental products is easily absorbed by a company that generates   This ability to test new markets and new products gives the company a unique competitive advantage 
Furthermore  China lifted its ban on beef imports from the US earlier this year giving Tyson access to a rapidly growing market for protein products  The ban was originally enacted in 2003 after a scare over mad cow disease 
As the middle class in China grows  so does the per capita demand for protein in the country  US protein products are widely recognized as superior to local products in China  Rabobank estimates that by 2020  imports will account for 20  of the protein market in the country  While per capita consumption is far lower than in the US  20  of that market is still 280 million people Here are a few additional tailwinds for Tyson 
The SEC dropping its investigation into the company as previously mentioned  This development has yet to be priced into the stock 
Demand for protein products is showing steady growth in the US which is a long term demographic trend  not a fad  The average American ate 55 6 pounds of beef in 2016  compared to 54 pounds in 2015 despite rising prices 
Grain prices remain under pressure  Many farmers are even looking at options to store their crops rather than selling at the current price 
In the recent earnings announcement  the company tightened full year guidance to 4 95 to 5 05 earnings per share  Presumably  to do so  they must be fairly certain about their costs and pricing power for the foreseeable future 
Tyson Trades At An Attractive Valuation
A company s EBITDA multiple is calculated by dividing its Enterprise Valueby EBITDA and is often used to benchmark the fair market value of a company  Its key benefit over the P E multiple is that it s capital structure neutral  and  therefore  better at comparing companies with different levels of debt 
Benchmarking Tyson Foods  EBITDA multiples relative to a group of selected peers illustrate how the market is still discounting the stock  The company s peer group includes Hormel Foods  NYSE  NYSE HRL   Kellogg  NYSE  K   General Mills  NYSE  NYSE GIS  and Flowers Foods  NYSE  FLO   Notice below how Tyson Foods  EBITDA multiples trade below its entire peer group source  finbox io
Companies expected to grow at a higher rate compared to their peers typically trade at higher multiples relative to this same peer group  However  Tyson Foods  multiples trade at a discount to its peers although analysts expect the company s revenues and EBITDA to grow at a higher rate over the next five years  This is likely a sign that the market is undervaluing Tyson Foods  stock source  finbox io
Additionally  all eight of finbox io s valuation models calculate a fair value of over  80 per share  This implies 24  upside at the low end of the valuation  However  the average of all eight analyses implies a fair value estimate of  94 34 per share  46  upside  

Conclusion  Buy and Hold
Going forward  growth in the US market should be steady  International growth promises to be rapid although that growth is currently off a low base  However  as that base continues to grow over the next few years  Tyson Foods  international operations will become a strong driver of future results 
The stock also trades at a significant discount relative to its peer group  In a market packed with companies trading at sky high valuations  Tyson offers a solid alternative for value investors ",2017-09-06,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-tyson-foods-stock-offers-healthy-upside-200211771,200211771

5 Consumer Staples Stocks with Strong Growth Prospects

	The consumer staples sector has been weak since quite some time  making risk averse investors jittery  Headwinds like unfavorable currency  food deflation  declining volumes  potential price wars  a competitive environment  slowdown in international markets and other global issues have been plaguing the companies in the sector 

	While many consumer staple stocks put up a strong performance in the third quarter earnings season  others suffered due to a volatile macroeconomic environment  Consumer staple stocks were hit hard  and reported softer than expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter 

	Nevertheless  the economy is picking up steam with inflation gradually edging toward the desired 2  target and the job market gaining strength  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 107 1 in November from October s upward revised reading of 100 8  and is at its highest level in nine years  The second estimate for GDP shows that the U S  economy grew 3 2  in the third quarter  faring better than the first estimate of 2 9  growth and an anemic increase of 1 4  in the second quarter 

	Per the Labor Department  the economy added 178 000 jobs in November  significantly higher than the revised figure of 142 000 for October  The job additions were in line with expectations even as the unemployment rate declined more than expected  from 4 9  to 4 6  in November 

	Given an improving labor market and the gradual rise in wages  we expect consumer spending to improve  This shows that the environment is much conducive now and Fed officials may look for a rate hike this December 

The Winning Strategy

	Surging consumer confidence and definite signs of near term economic recovery are making the consumer staples sector attractive  However  picking the winning stocks may prove to be quite difficult 

	With the help of our new   we have shortlisted five stocks that have excellent prospects and hold immense growth potential  Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space 

	All the stocks selected herein flaunt a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  with a Growth Style Score of  A  and have the potential to ride out the impending volatility

154158,375674,HRL,2 Dividend Aristocrats Trading At A Discount,opinion,"Caution  US Equities At All Time Highs
Although the S P 500 closed slightly lower Wednesday  the index is still near its all time high as investors continue to enjoy an 8 year bull market  However  many equity analysts remain cautious as stocks appear to be trading at inflated multiples  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  even went on record saying that they believe the US bull market is in its last few innings 
But what is an enterprising investor to do with that information  It s too costly to sit on the sideline  especially while the Trump trade rally is showing no sign of slowing  So where should investors look  One safe bet is to look at members of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF  NYSE NOBL   This ETF consists of a select group of 52 S P 500 stocks with 25  years of consecutive dividend increases  Investors can count on these dividends to potentially help offset losses from any type of market pullback  when it happens 
However  there s little upside in being too defensive in this bull market  So we used finbox io s  to see if there are any Dividend Aristocrats that still appear to be fundamentally undervalued 
2 Dividend Aristocrats Trading at a Discount
As quick reminder  a dividend discount model estimates the value of a company s stock price based on the theory that its true value is equal to the sum of the present value all of its future dividend payments to shareholders  After applying this technique to the 52 Dividend Aristocrats  there were two companies that stood out  Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL  and AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV  
As illustrated in the chart below  Hormel Foods  historical net income growth has averaged around 15  over the last several years  The company has also paid out roughly 25  to 35  of net income in the form of dividends  Applying similar assumptions in the 5 year dividend discount model  shown on the right hand side  concludes a fair value of  42 30 per share  This implies that the company s shares are currently 13  undervalued 
 
AbbVie has distributed a significant amount of its earnings in the form of dividends   60   since the company spun off from Abbott  NYSE ABT  in 2013  The company appears to be trading at a 10  discount to fair value when applying similar assumptions in the 5 year dividend discount model as shown below 
 
It s worth noting that dividend discount models are known to provide conservative estimates of fair value as some cash leakage not taken into account  However  as economist John Maynard Keynes once noted 

It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong 

Hence  the conservative nature of the model should help investors get comfortable with the upside potential for each company  These two Dividend Aristocrats could prove to produce outsized total returns in a bull market as well as a safe haven in a down market ",2017-02-22,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-dividend-aristocrats-trading-at-a-discount-200176569,200176569
154159,375675,HRL,HRL Vs  SAFM  Which Stock Looks Better Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"As the earnings season winds down  the focus shifts to stocks which are currently out of favor  Stock categories such as consumer staples have remained relatively subdued this year  given that more growth oriented stocks have notched up record gains  But with markets relatively subdued at this point  attention has shifted toward these stock classes once again    
Coming to the meat products industry  this category remains a firm consumer favorite and a major category for the food industry as a whole  A new report from market research firm Packaged Facts indicates total retail sales for the category will touch  100 billion by 2021  At the same time  the industry also faces several challenges as consumer awareness about ecology  health issues and economic impact grows 
With Hormel Foods Corp   HRL  and Sanderson Farms  Inc   SAFM  both scheduled to report on May 25  this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock  Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  rating  You can see  Other major earnings scheduled at this time include Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   Inc   LOW  and Medtronic  NYSE MDT  plc  MDT   
Price Performance
While the Zacks Food   Meat Products Industry has gained 1 8   Hormel Foods has inched up by 0 1  year to date  Here  Sanderson Farms stands out  since it has surged 22 3  over the same period 

Valuation
The most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is EV EBITDA  This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry  It is superior to other metrics such as P E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies  While Sanderson Farms is focused on chicken products  Hormel Foods has other major product lines such as turkey and pork 

First  it is important to consider where the industry as a whole stands from a valuation perspective  Here  we can see that with an EV EBITDA of 9 62  the meat products industry is significantly undervalued compared to the S P 500  which has a value of 10 57 

Coming to the two meat products producers  with an EV EBITDA value of 12 44  Hormel is overvalued relative to the rest of the industry  On the other hand  Sanderson Farms holds the edge here with a lower EV EBITDA value of 5 80  making it undervalued relative to the rest of the industry 

Dividend Yield

In the last year  Sanderson Farms offered a dividend yield of 0 8   which was lower than the broader industry s level of 1 5   In contrast  Hormel Foods offers a dividend yield of nearly 2   making the larger company this round s undisputed winner 

Return on Invested Capital

Broadly speaking  the consumer staples sector is characterized by high level of return on equity  ROE   and the meat products industry is no different  This is because consumer staples have outperformed the market for an extremely long period  This is why it is wrong to focus on ROEs when determining which stock is superior  Instead  return on invested capital  ROIC  is a better indicator of the profitability of a company 
Both Hormel and Sanderson Farms have outperformed the industry  which has an ROIC level of 9 2   on this count  However  Sanderson Farms outperforms Hormel since its ROIC is comparatively higher at 13 6   compared to its rival s level of 12 2    

Earnings History  ESP and Estimate Revisions
Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  Hormel Foods has delivered positive surprises in two of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 1 2   In comparison  Sanderson Farms delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 15 8  
Even when considering   Sanderson Farms is the superior stock  Its ESP value of  6 91  exceeds Hormel Foods level of  0 00   Additionally  Sanderson Farm s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 8 9  over the last 30 days  compared to Hormel Food s increase of 0 2  
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that Hormel Foods holds an edge over Sanderson Farms only when considering dividend yields  However  when considering EV EBITDA  ROIC  estimate revisions and a more comprehensive look at its previous earnings performance  Sanderson Farms is clearly a better stock

154220,375736,HRL,Pilgrim s Pride  PPC  Poised For Growth Amid Headwinds ,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on the premium consumer goods company Pilgrim s Pride Corporation   NASDAQ PPC   on Oct 17  2016  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is currently surrounded by both optimistic and pessimistic aspects 
Bullish Factors on Role
Pilgrim s Pride has been successfully expanding its business on the back of its unique product diversification strategy  Product portfolio diversification shields the company from various industry specific headwinds  The company is currently trying to capture the growing market demand for natural food products such as organic and ABF chicken 
At the same time  demand for the company s Pierce brand and a new  fully cooked chicken product is also radically improving  These factors should boost the company s revenues going ahead 
Apart from revenue growth  we believe that the company s strategic cost reduction moves would aid its margin growth trajectory in the quarters ahead  Moreover  the newly introduced portfolio model is expected to augment the company s profitability 
Also  Pilgrim s Pride aims to maximize its productivity through other initiatives  such as enhancing labor efficiency  optimal water usage  methodical management of waste water and proper plant maintenance  Further  the company expects to accrue  185 million of operational improvement through cost savings and effective generation of cash flow by the end of 2016 
Existing Causes of Worry  
Extensive industry rivalry has been augmenting the bargaining power of end users  thereby enhancing market share loss risks for Pilgrim s Pride  In order to boost competency  the company makes huge investments in new growth projects or research and development  However  such costs add to its existing debt burden 
Pilgrim s Pride s operational efficacy and product supplying capabilities both have been adversely affected by the sudden outbreak of livestock diseases within the meat industry  Moreover  outbreak of such epidemic diseases often raises the extent of government restrictions on the import and export of fresh chicken products  This increases the legal complexities of meat product producers 
Notably  earnings of Pilgrim s Pride remain highly sensitive to market price as well as availability of certain products such as soybean meal  corn and sorghum  Any sudden supply demand imbalance or fluctuations in price of these materials might significantly raise the company s operational expenses  This  in turn  would hurt the company s bottom line in the quarters ahead

Superior quality products  extensive innovation and marketing strategies as well as consumers  brand loyalty are few factors that drives demand for meat product manufactures  Meat companies based in the U S  are working to meet the demand for expensive organic products  while also expanding their geographical footprint in the international arena  especially in the emerging nations

Notwithstanding the growth momentum in the industry  meat product manufacturers have to comply with various governmental regulations  non compliance of which might attract penalties  Also  supply chain issues due to the outbreak of livestock diseases might be challenging for meat products manufacturers while foreign sales might shrink due to forex woes 

In view of all these factors  choosing the right stocks with a potential to beat earnings estimates can be a daunting task

The company has a nice growth story going for it  consistently increasing revenues and net income year after year   The company definitely looks like it s heading in the right direction for the long run  but should you buy its stock before it releases its earnings on the 18th of May 
HRL has received two positive earnings estimate revisions from financial analysts over the last 60 days for this quarter   In that same time frame  no analysts have revised estimates lower for Hormel   Our quarterly consensus estimate has trended upwards over the last 90 days  going from  0 35 to  0 38   It should be noted that our fiscal year consensus has increased over the last 3 months as well  going from  1 46 to  1 57 
The company has consistently beaten our EPS consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters  and Hormel beat the estimate by 16 22  last quarter   The graph below does a nice job of showing how HRL s share price has reacted to consistent earnings beats over the last few years

154290,375806,HRL,Hormel Foods  Raising Dividends For 49 Consecutive Years,opinion,"Hormel Foods  N HRL  was founded in 1891 by George Hormel in the small town of Austin Minnesota 
Today  Hormel has a market cap of  17 4 billion  The company has assembled a portfolio of well known food brands  The image below shows many of the company s most popular brands 

Source  Hormel Foods Company Website
Hormel operates in the slow changing packaged meat and packaged food industry  The stability of the industry in general  and Hormel in particular  has resulted in a tremendous streak of dividend growth 
Hormel has raised its dividends for 49 consecutive years  In 2016  the company will join the exclusive Dividend Kings   dividend stocks with 50  consecutive years of dividend increases  
Hormel s Competitive Advantage
More than 30 of Hormel s brands hold the  1 or  2 position in their respective market category  The company s competitive advantage comes from built up brand equity 
Over the last 3 years  Hormel has averaged advertising expenditures of about  100 million a year  The company only spends around 1  of sales revenue a year on advertising  This is far below what many other packaged foods companies spend 
Hormel does not need to advertise as much as its peers because many of its brands are already very well known  Skippy  Spam  and Hormel are all well known brands  For younger consumers  Applegate Organics  Muscle Milk  and Jennie O are likely very well known 
Where Hormel differentiates itself from its competitors is its growth through acquisitions  The company has realized excellent growth by acquiring up and coming brands and then growing them 
Growth Prospects   Total Return
Recent examples of large acquisitions for Hormel are CytoSport  makers of Muscle Milk  and Applegate Organics 
CytoSport was acquired for  450 million  Applegate Organics was acquired for  775 million  Older acquisitions for Hormel that were transformative for the company were the 2001 acquisition of Jennie O Turkey  and the 2013 acquisition of Skippy peanut butter 
Hormel has used the cash flows from its slower growing but established meat brands like Dinty Moore and Spam and used them to acquire brands with great potential like Jennie O  Applegate  and Muscle Milk 
Hormel s growth story is far from over  The company s management says it has another  3 billion in debt capacity  This will likely be used for additional acquisitions that match the company s criteria 
Recent history shows that Hormel is looking for brands that appeal to millennials and focus on health benefits and or high protein 
Hormel s growth strategy has worked out well for shareholders  The company has compounded earnings per share at 10 5  a year over the last decade  Dividends have grown even faster over the last decade   at 13 3  a year 
Amazingly  the company has grown earnings per share in 27 out of its last 30 years  The primary sources of the company s earnings per share growth over the last decade are shown below 
Sales have grown at 6 7  a year
Net profit margin has grown at 3 7  a year  from 4 7  in 2005 to 6 5  in 2014 
Increasing sales have been the biggest growth driver for Hormel  This shows the company s products are in demand   and that it can successfully integrate and expand its acquired brands 
As a note  Hormel has not grown at the expense of shareholders  The company s share count has actually decreased by about 0 5  a year over the last decade 
Net profit margin has also increased significantly for Hormel over the last decade  The company s margins have increased as it acquires higher margin brands  The company is also growing larger and can realize better economies of scale by eliminating redundancies resulting from acquisitions 
Going forward  I expect Hormel to continue growing earning per share somewhere between 9  and 11  a year  In addition  the company has a dividend yield of 1 5   Shareholders should expect total returns of 10 5  to 12 5  a year going forward from Hormel 
Recession Performance
During recessions  people still need to eat  Hormel s packaged food products are cheaper than dining out  When times get tough  one would expect the company s earnings to rise rather than fall 
As it turns out  that is what happened during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009  The company s earnings dipped slightly in 2008 before recovering to new highs at the height of the Great Recession in 2009 
Hormel s earnings per share through this period are shown below 
2007 earnings per share of  1 07  new high 
2008 earnings per share of  1 04  2 8  decline 
2009 earnings per share of  1 27  new high 
Hormel is recession resistant  The company s streak of 27 earnings per share increases in the last 30 years shows the company can thrive in a variety of economic environments 
Hormel s Valuation and Final Thoughts
Over the last decade  Hormel stock has traded for an average price to earnings ratio of around 17 
Given its safety  slow changing industry  growth potential  and double digit expected total returns a  fair  price to earnings ratio for the company is likely closer to 20 
Unfortunately for value conscious investors  Hormel s price to earnings ratio has risen substantially in the last 2 years  The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 26 6   well above its historical average 
Now is not the most opportune time to initiate a position in Hormel given its high current valuation 
With that said  Hormel is an exceptionally high quality business  There are little doubts that the company will continue growing its earnings and rewarding shareholders with rising dividends  In fact  it s difficult to envision what could actually stop the company from growing over the long run 
Hormel ranks fairly highly in spite of its high valuation using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing  That s because the company scores high marks for growth  low stock price volatility of 19 6   and a fairly low payout ratio of under 40  
Low stock price volatility is a proxy for risk  Interestingly  low volatility stocks have historically outperformed the market  Low payout ratios give Hormel plenty of room to continue growing its dividend payments faster than earnings per share growth for the next several years 
There s no doubt Hormel is an excellent business and shareholder friendly  At current prices  it is a hold  I would wait for a price to earnings ratio under 20  and preferably under 17  to initiate or add to a position in Hormel ",2015-10-18,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-8-of-52:-hormel-foods-268418,268418
154291,375807,HRL,The Trans Pacific Partnership  Who Profits ,opinion,"After eight years of planning and more than five years of mind numbing negotiations  America and 11 other Pacific Rim nations representing 37  of the global economy finally reached an agreement on the  in history   the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  
The negotiating text alone consists of 30 chapters and thousands of pages covering more than just trade 
It touches on issues concerning wildlife protection  dispute settlement  intellectual property rights for movies  union reform  online commerce  and internet openness 
Countries as diverse as Canada  America  Chile  Peru  Malaysia  Australia  New Zealand  Japan  Singapore  and Vietnam completed this ambitious 21st century pact with the goal of supercharging trade and investment in the Pacific Rim 
Tariffs on over 18 000 products will be phased out  For example 

Japan will phase out big tariffs on U S  exports of oranges and grapefruit 


Vietnam will drop a 20  tariff on cherries and a 70  tariff on U S  automobiles 


America currently faces tariffs in the Pacific as high as 55  on wine  35  on plywood  30  on tractors  and 20  on beauty products  All these tariffs will be gone after the TPP goes into effect 

The TPP   More Than Just Trade
Aside from eliminating tariffs  the pact is important as a geopolitical gambit to offset China s growing heft  as well as to highlight President Obama s much vaunted pivot to Asia 
Now comes the daunting political challenge of getting the pact through each country s legislature 
In America  accomplishing this in the midst of a competitive presidential campaign will be especially challenging 
It s a straight up or down majority vote in both the Senate and the House  and the stakes and pressures are equally high 
Passing these political hurdles is necessary to phase out thousands of import tariffs  as well as other barriers to international trade  such as Japanese regulations that keep out some American made automobiles and trucks 
It s also crucial in establishing uniform rules on corporations  intellectual property and opening the internet   even in communist Vietnam 
The issues covered in this historic TPP trade deal are deep and broad  For example  sensitive agricultural markets will be opened in Japan  Canada  and New Zealand 
Financial services reform means that foreign investors will have more opportunities to invest in fast growing banks and consumer finance companies  And stronger intellectual property protection also means higher profits for pharmaceutical companies as well as the movie and music industries 
Lobbyists  CEOs  politicians  economic ministers  and industry mavens have descended on Washington  D C   Tokyo  Sydney  and other capitals to plead for their special interests 
They know that just a paragraph  a sentence  or even a single word in the final documents can mean the difference between millions or billions of dollars in sales and profits gained   or lost 
Who Benefits Most From the TPP 
All the countries in the pact stand to gain in terms of exports and economic growth  Obviously  certain sectors will gain and others will lose  but it s not a zero sum game by any means 
For the United States  processed foods will be a big winner  particularly chicken and pork as opposed to beef  since both are more popular with Asian consumers and are less expensive 
As disposable incomes in these countries rise  the first thing families spend more money on is protein  with chicken and pork right at the bull s eye 
Earlier this year  I recommended doubling down on American food company Hormel Foods Corporation  N HRL  
Hormel has roots going back to the 19th century  double digit sales  profit  and earnings growth over the last decade  and almost 50 years of consecutive dividend growth 
Its top 30 brands garner the No  1 or No  2 spot in world markets 
International sales have tripled since 2005 and are up over 25  in the last year  Hormel itself is up 24 9  so far in 2015

154292,375808,HRL,HRL  Hard To Justify Current Valuation,opinion,"Hormel  N HRL  is the most recent dividend king to be crowned  The company recently raised its dividend by 16   marking its 50th consecutive dividend increase 
Any company that manages such an accomplishment is worth becoming familiar with  and HRL is no exception  The company has one of the safest dividends around and has grown its dividend by 18  per year over the last five years 
While we don t yet own HRL in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  dividend investors might want to keep an eye on the company for several reasons Business OverviewHRL has been in operation for 125 years and is a multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded food and meat products  Some of the company s well known brands include Skippy peanut butter  SPAM meat  Dinty Moore stew  Muscle Milk protein drinks  Wholly Guacamole dips  Jennie O turkey  and numerous Hormel branded products 
Roughly 53  of HRL s products are perishable  fresh meats  frozen items  refrigerated meals  sausages  hams  guacamole  and bacon   19  are poultry  Jennie O turkey   18  are shelf stable  canned luncheon meats  microwaveable meals  stews  chilies  hash  tortillas  and peanut butter   and 10  are miscellaneous  nutritional food products and supplements  sugar  dessert mixes  and drink mixes  
Business AnalysisFew companies survive for 125 years  HRL s competitive advantages are not about patents  HRL only has 63  or innovation  HRL spent  32 million on R D last year  
As one of the largest consumer branded food and meat manufacturers  HRL s key to success is favorably altering customers  perceptions of its products to gain loyalty and market share  The company spent approximately  145 million on advertising last year  an amount nearly five times greater than HRL s spending on R D 
With many of its brands dating back over 50 years  e g  SPAM and Dinty Moore were introduced in the 1930s  and supported by billions of advertising dollars over the years  consumers know and trust HRL s products  As a result  more than 30 of HRL s brands have  1 or  2 market share positions in their category 
Beyond brand recognition  retailer relationships  and shelf space market share  HRL also benefits from economies of scale  As one of the larger players in the market  HRL is able to achieve lower production costs than smaller rivals and squeezes more value out of each advertising dollar it spends by extending well known brands into adjacent product categories  Extensive regulations by the U S  Department of Agriculture also disadvantage smaller competitors 
HRL s global distribution channels and economies of scale also help the company s growth and diversification efforts  HRL has made several large acquisitions over the last five years to expand its business further beyond meat products  It acquired sports nutrition products company CytoSport for  450 million in 2014  Skippy peanut butter for over  700 million in 2013  and organic meat company Applegate Farms for  774 million in 2015  HRL can sell these new brands and products to its existing customers and improve the cost profile of each acquired company once they are integrated 
With the company s mix of higher margin products increasing  HRL recently boosted its company margins guidance from 9 12  to 10 13   As long as consumers need to eat  HRL s well known brands will be there for them Key RisksOver the near term  HRL s results are strongly affected by the cost and supply of pork  a key raw material input  Retail prices of many of HRL s products don t fluctuate by more than a few percentage points each year  but its input costs are notoriously volatile 
A virus that kills young pigs sent pork costs flying in 2013 2014 and crimped HRL s profitability  see the spike in the graph below  which shows swine prices over the last 30 years   However  pork prices have since plunged to reach levels last seen nearly 10 years ago  The price of corn  a key feedstock used in raising hogs  is also near its lowest level since 2010  which encourages hog farmers to expand their herds 
Source  IndexMundi
With stable retail prices and plunging pork costs  it s no wonder that HRL reported 2015 profit growth of 18  despite a 1  decline in sales  The company s stock also soared by nearly 50  in 2015 
In our opinion  this was driven primarily by luck  not skill  At some point  input cost trends will reverse again  However  with HRL s stock trading at a forward P E multiple of 26  investors could be in for a rude awakening whenever an input cost reversal occurs 
Beyond swings in commodity prices  one of the biggest risks facing HRL is shifting consumer preferences for healthier  natural  and organic foods  Walk through just about any grocery store today  and you will notice more organic products on the shelves  Consumers are becoming more aware of what they are eating and are reading more labels  They want to know how their food gets to their plates and how ethical its production process is  especially with meats 
In many cases  this shift is creating opportunities for new players to enter the market  The incumbents have brands associated with processed  unhealthy foods  e g  SPAM  Dinty Moore   However  they do have size  massive marketing budgets  long standing customer relationships  and shelf space 
Many incumbents are responding to this threat by acquiring new organic players  and HRL is no exception  For example  in May 2015  HRL bought Applegate Farms  the nation s leading branded natural and organic meat company  for  774 million  This acquisition provided its Refrigerated Foods segment with a meaningful entrance into the high growth natural and organic space 
Whether or not HRL can achieve success by acquiring and attempting to grow natural and organic brands is anyone s guess  We would imagine that these businesses have very different cultures and processes  but it could turn out to be a successful capital allocation decision 
For now  we will continue watching HRL s organic sales growth rate to see if the company can successfully adapt its product mix to meet consumers  increased desire for healthier foods  The company already has exposure to some of the  healthier  areas of the market  e g  turkey  natural peanut butter  perishables   but we estimate that the majority of its sales mix is neutral at best Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
HRL has one of the safest dividends investors can find with a dividend Safety Score of 98 
Over the last four quarters  HRL s dividend has consumed 41  of its earnings and 31  of its free cash flow  These low payout ratios provide plenty of safety and room for HRL to keep growing its dividend 
Over the last decade  HRL s payout ratios have increased by about 10   The company has grown its dividend somewhat faster than its underlying earnings  but not by much  If it wanted to  HRL could continue growing its dividend faster than its earnings because its payout ratio is still pretty low Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
HRL s high dividend Safety Score is further bolstered by the stability of the company s business  HRL has recorded earnings growth in 27 of the last 30 years and saw its sales fall by just 3  during the financial crisis  The company s stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 15  in 2008  Even when times get tough  consumers still need to eat Source  Simply Safe Dividends
HRL has also been a free cash flow machine  Free cash flow per share has nearly tripled over the last decade  providing the firepower needed for acquisitions  dividend growth  and share repurchases  The best companies generate consistent free cash flow  and HRL is no exception Source  Simply Safe Dividends
HRL s branding and efficient operations have also helped the company achieve extraordinarily high and stable returns on invested capital over the last decade  This is often a sign of a strong economic moat and a business that is creating meaningful shareholder value Source  Simply Safe Dividends
HRL s balance sheet is also in excellent shape  As seen below  the company could cover its entire net debt with cash on hand and less than half a year s worth of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   A healthy balance sheet enables HRL to continue searching for the right acquisitions to further growth the business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
HRL s dividend is one of the safest in the market  The company has relatively low payout ratios  sells recession resistant products  generates excellent free cash flow  and has a very healthy balance sheet Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
HRL s dividend Growth Score of 85 indicates that the company has excellent dividend growth potential  HRL has paid dividends every year since 1928 and recently achieved its 50th consecutive increase  qualifying it for the exclusive list of dividend kings  companies with at least 50 straight years of dividend growth  
As seen below  HRL s dividend growth has accelerated over its last 10 fiscal years  The company s dividend increase for 2016 is 16   and we believe HRL can continue delivering double digit dividend hikes for at least the next several years given its relatively low payout ratios and decent earnings growth Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationHRL trades at 26x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 1 5   which is below its five year average dividend yield of 1 7  
HRL is no doubt a great business  but it s really hard to justify the stock s current valuation  At the end of the day  this is a business that seems unlikely to grow sales much faster than GDP and has significantly benefited from plunging raw material costs over the last year  Is that really worth paying 26 times earnings for 
With company margins at a 10 year high and bumping up against the top of HRL s long term margin guidance  fundamentals could be about as good as they will get  We plan on watching HRL from the sidelines and would become more interested if raw material cost trends reverse and the earnings multiple comes way down ConclusionHRL is a great company that will likely be around for a very long time to come  but its current valuation is hard to get comfortable with  especially in light of the raw material cost benefits it has enjoyed over the last year  For now  we remain more interested in some of our other favorite blue chip dividend stocks ",2016-01-26,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hrl:-the-newest-dividend-king-381768,381768

The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Housing Market Index showed homebuilder sentiment this month declined to 58 the lowest level since May 2015 from January s upwardly revised 61 figure from the originally reported 60 level  where the Bloomberg estimate had called for it to remain  Builder confidence remained above 50  which separates good and poor conditions  for the twentieth straight month  The NAHB noted   Though builders report the dip in confidence this month is partly attributable to the high cost and lack of availability of lots and labor  they are still positive about the housing market   while adding that they expressed optimism that sales will pick up in the coming months 
Much of the rest of the economy continues to look fairly healthy  notably the all important labor market and the more heavily weighted services sector that remains in growth territory  Also  rising house prices indicate and help to facilitate confidence among consumers

154296,375812,HRL,Kraft Heinz  KHC  Likely To Top Q1 Earnings  Will Stock Gain  ,opinion,"We expect The Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC   to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results on May 4  after the market closes 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6 90  
Despite lackluster sales figures  the packaged food company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 1 08  

Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Kraft Heinz is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate  62 cents per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  61 cents   stands at  1 64   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Kraft Heinz has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings 
Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Kraft Heinz s Zacks Rank  3 and  1 64  ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Currently  the stock is trading at  78 36  We expect the release to lead to stock movement 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Kraft Heinz has been seeing top line weakness over the past many quarters  The company is witnessing lower volumes and share losses in the U S  due to weak category trends  Reduced spending by the U S  shoppers and a shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food have been hurting the company s business  Category trends and market share performance are likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter and through the rest of 2016 
Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Kraft Heinz s sales as a significant percentage of its revenues is generated outside the U S  With almost all the foreign currencies deteriorating in comparison with the U S  dollar  foreign exchange is expected to continue to be a headwind for revenues  thereby limiting top line growth in the first quarter 
Despite relatively soft sales  cost savings have led to better margins  mainly in the developed markets of the U S  and Europe  We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter  Kraft Heinz has implemented many cost saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz  
Though currency headwinds and weak consumption trends are expected to linger in 2016  management expects to address these issues through innovation  go to market capabilities and removal of inefficient spending 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include 
Pinnacle Foods Inc    NYSE PF   with an Earnings ESP of  5 00  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Hormel Foods Corp    NYSE HRL   with an Earnings ESP of  5 26  and a Zacks Rank  1

154328,375844,HRL,6 Stocks To Avoid This Grilling Season,opinion,"I hope you had an enjoyable Memorial Day holiday  It s now  unofficially  summer 
If you re like me  you spent some time grilling with friends and family this weekend  Indeed  all across the country  people were chowing down on burgers  sausages  and chicken  maybe even a few vegetables  
And since barbecue season is now upon us  it s worth asking  Are the companies providing our summer fare a  Buy  right now 
Purveyors of Fine Food and Drink
The food and beverage industries offer a number of dividend paying stocks  including the six below  which are some of the biggest names in the business 
First is Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   the world s second largest processor and marketer of chicken  beef  and pork  Its brands include Tyson  of course   as well as Hillshire Farm  Jimmy Dean  Ball Park  and Sara Lee 
Next is Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL   famous for introducing Spam  Hormel owns its namesake brand in addition to Black Label  Lloyd s  Saag s  and Wholly Guacamole  It also owns a few other popular but less barbecue related brands like Skippy and Chi Chi s 
Kraft Foods Group  NASDAQ KRFT    which recently merged with Heinz   is virtually inescapable at any barbecue  Among its brands  Kraft counts A1 steak sauce  Country Time Lemonade  Cracker Barrel cheese  Kraft Mayo  JET PUFFED Marshmallows  Kool Aid  Oscar Mayer meats  and Heinz condiments 
Now  in my opinion  a good barbecue isn t complete without a few beers  And when it comes to beer  there s no company quite like Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD   This massive conglomerate owns everything from Budweiser to Stella Artois to Corona  It also owns Beck s  Leffe  and Hoegaarden  And it even owns craft breweries like Goose Island and Elysian 
SABMiller  LONDON SAB  is the world s second largest beer company  though its  58 billion market cap is just one third of Anheuser Busch s  SAB owns Miller  Coors  Blue Moon  Grolsch  Foster s  Keystone  and Leinenkugel s  among many  many others 
Finally  there s Heineken  AMS HEIN   the Dutch brewery that also owns Amstel  Sol  Murphy s  and many other brands across the globe  With a  46 billion market cap  Heineken is the world s third largest beer company 
Big Valuations  Small Dividends
Let s start by looking at the current valuation of these companies compared to their 10 year median 

As a group  these stocks are trading at a significant premium right now  In fact  only Tyson and AB InBev are trading at even somewhat justifiable valuations  The rest are prohibitively expensive  Thus  we ll narrow our focus to hot dogs  sausages  and beer 
Next  let s take a look at the dividends paid by Tyson and ABI  The latter yields a pretty respectable 2 7  and  with a dividend payout ratio of 68 5   it s well below our 80  threshold  Unfortunately  Tyson s indicated yield is a meager 0 9    better than nothing  but not what we re looking for as income investors 
That leaves us with just one out of six companies  Anheuser Busch  And it does have a lot going for it  Total revenue has grown for six consecutive years  including by more than 8  in 2014  It has a decent yield  and the dividend has grown substantially since 2009  when it was cut by 90  
However  the company is still expensive relative to its 10 year median   and perhaps most importantly  the U S  market is facing increasing pressure from craft beer sales 
Consider this  By the end of 2014  craft beer sales were responsible for 11  of the total market in the United States  That s up from just 2 6  in 1998  an incredible rise 
The trend isn t slowing  either  Last year  craft beer dollar sales grew 22   faster than in any previous year  Once a niche market  craft beer is now a  20 billion a year industry  So  while ABI does pay a decent dividend  it s on the wrong end of a growing market trend  Plus  the stock isn t exactly cheap right now 
Bottom line  Go ahead and enjoy some sausages  hot dogs  and beer this summer   but don t bother with these major food and beverage stocks ",2015-05-28,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/6-stocks-to-avoid-this-grilling-season-253264,253264

eight ETFs and all eight mutual funds in the sector that meet our liquidity standards  Not all Consumer Staples sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 23 to 122   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks    To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Consumer Staples sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings    Investors seeking exposure

154356,375872,HRL,How To Invest In A Bacon Bull Market,opinion,"A bacon shortage   Say it ain t so 
Unfortunately for American bacon lovers though no doubt fortunately for their health a porcine virus is and will probably cause the biggest decline in pork production in more than 30 years   Meanwhile  demand for pork and bacon in particular continues to rise  U S  bacon sales increased last year by 10  to a whopping  4 billion 
The resulting supply squeeze has caused pork prices to already rise by about 10   Bacon prices have been particularly affected up about 13  year over year 
I ve been known to eat my share of bacon  Were I ever a condemned man  I would request a large plate of bacon as my last meal  washed down by a decent single malt scotch    Hey  let s keep it a little classy here  
It seems like bacon is everywhere these days   It s jumped off the breakfast menu at IHOP and into places and products that are surprising even a confirmed bacon lover like myself    to put on your toast in the morning   It exists   There is an all bacon restaurant in New York   and a   I am not a member yet   and a poll by Smithfield Foods found that 65  of Americans were supportive of making bacon America s      Taking it to levels that only an addict could appreciate  Olympic gold medalist Sage Kotsenburg tweeted that he wished his medal was   And the ultimate   You can buy    I couldn t make this up if I wanted to 
A bacon shortage would be devastating to millions of grease loving unhealthy American slobs like myself  But all joking aside  there are real economic consequences 
I ll start with pork product stocks    While there is no true substitute for bacon absolutely none  and I consider turkey bacon an unholy abomination the fact is that consumers will shift to other meats if they become significantly cheaper on a relative basis   This means that pork processors cannot fully pass on the price hikes to consumers and that their margins should be crimped as a result   This isn t particularly good news for Hormel  NYSE HRL  and Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  
But the biggest impact of rising pork prices goes far beyond U S  shores   China is the world s largest consumer of pork  eating  as much pork as the United States   Despite China s vastly lower per capita income  Chinese diners eat considerably more pork per person than Americans   Among large population countries   than China and China is close to surpassing Italy  Three fourths of all meat consumed in China is pork  and the Chinese government considers pork critical enough to have created a    Yes  that s a real thing 
So  a global shortage of pork were the U S  porcine virus to spread would potentially wreak havoc on China s major pork producers  such as Tianli Agritech  OINK O  and WH Group the Chinese company that bought Smithfield Foods last year  WH Group is planning an IPO in Hong Kong this year 
Rising pork prices also present the Chinese government with an unappealing set of choices   Do they exhaust their strategic reserve and possibly start an expensive pork subsidy to keep their middle and working classes happy   Or do they wait it out and hope that any price spikes are temporary  Food price inflation could threaten China s plan to reorganize its economy away from exports and investment and towards domestic consumption 
Chances are good that the price spike will be temporary and that  once the virus is contained  pork production will return to normal levels   In the meantime  keep your eyes open for the WH Group IPO   If you believe  as I do  that the rise of the Chinese middle class consumer is a durable and investable trend  then investing in the world s largest pork producer is a fine way to play that trend
