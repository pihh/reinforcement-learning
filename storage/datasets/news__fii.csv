7530,229045,FII,Can Higher Client Activity Aid Schwab  SCHW  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2019 results on Jan 16  before the market opens  Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have declined on a year over year basis In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenue growth and increase in total client assets aided results  However  higher expenses and lower trading revenues acted as headwinds Schwab has an impressive earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and met in one of the trailing four quarters  with a positive surprise of 5   on average The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    However  activities of the company during the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward  Over the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings for the to be reported quarter has been unchanged at 64 cents  The figure indicates a decline of 1 5  from the year ago reported number The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter sales is pegged at  2 59 billion  which suggests a 3 1  decline from the year ago quarter s reported figure Notably  during the fourth quarter  the company inked an all stock deal to acquire TD Ameritrade Holding for roughly  26 billion  This is expected to create a behemoth in online brokerage space  with combined client assets worth more than  5 trillion  serving nearly 24 million brokerage accounts  The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2020 Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the fourth quarter  let s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab s performance Key Factors to Note The fourth quarter witnessed a rise in client activity  Moreover  the performance of the equity markets was good enough Schwab opened 142 000 and 127 000 new brokerage accounts in October and November  respectively  indicating that investors were interested in entering the market  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts of 12 257 for the fourth quarter suggests an improvement of 1 1  from the previous quarter s reported number Thus  driven by relatively higher market volatility  Schwab s trading revenues are likely to have improved in the fourth quarter However  after the company lowered its U S  stock  ETF and options online trading commissions to  0  effective October 2019  its CFO Peter Crawford stated that the move would have a 3 4  adverse impact on quarterly net revenues Notably  Schwab is expected to have witnessed an increase in total client assets and average interest earning assets in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets is pegged at  3 9 trillion  indicating growth of 3 8  from the prior quarter s reported number  Moreover  the consensus estimate for average interest earning assets is pegged at  270 billion  which suggests growth of 1 9  sequentially  Despite growth in assets  Schwab s net interest revenues are not expected to have witnessed improvement in the quarter because of lower interest rates The company s operating expenses have remained elevated over the past few quarters  Moreover  because of higher compensation and benefits costs  overall expenses are expected to have remained high in the fourth quarter Management expects expenses to increase 5  in 2019  given significant investments to upgrade technology and support business expansion What the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model  chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re

before the market opens  While its revenues in the third quarter are expected to have improved year over year  earnings are likely to have witnessed a decline In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results benefited from a decline in expenses along with growth in assets under management  AUM   However  a decline in revenues was a headwind BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  The average positive surprise was 3 7  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and Consensus    However  activities of the company in the third quarter were not adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 99 cents has remained unchanged over the past 30 days  Moreover  it indicates a decline of 6 6  from the year ago reported number The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to be reported quarter is pegged at  4 09 billion  indicating marginal growth from the previous year quarter s reported figure Looking at BNY Mellon s price performance  its shares have lost 6 3  so far this year against 16 2  growth recorded by the  it belongs to Will the price performance improve post third quarter earnings  To a great extent  it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s check the factors that are likely to have impacted third quarter results Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AUM for the third quarter is pegged at  1 85 trillion  which indicates marginal growth from the previous quarter s reported figure  Further  the consensus estimate for total assets under custody and administration of  35 81 trillion suggests growth of nearly 1  from the prior quarter s reported figure  Thus  driven by expected growth in assets  investment management and performance fee are likely to have been positively impacted in the third quarter The consensus estimate for total investment services fee indicates that this component is also likely to have increased in the quarter  The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at  2 billion  which suggests growth of 1  from the previous quarter s reported number Thus  supported by marginal growth in the two most important components of fee revenues  total fee revenues are likely to have increased modestly in the third quarter  The consensus estimate for fee revenues for the third quarter is pegged at  3 12 billion  suggesting marginal growth from the prior quarter s reported figure However  the lending scenario was not that great in the third quarter  Thus  dismal loan growth along with the decline in interest rates  two rate cuts in July and September  and the flattening of the yield curve is likely to have hurt BNY Mellon s net interest revenue  NIR  growth Notably  management expects NIR in the third quarter to decline nearly 5  sequentially  This is based on expectations of a decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio and relatively flat interest bearing deposit balances Because of higher litigation and restructuring charges  the company s expenses have remained elevated over the past few years  While BNY Mellon continues investing in technology  overall costs are expected to have remained manageable in the third quarter  given the elimination of unnecessary management layers Now  let s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts According to our quantitative model  chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key

7671,229186,FII,What To Expect From Victory Capital  VCTR  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Victory Capital Holdings   NASDAQ VCTR   is scheduled to report third quarter 2018 results on Nov 6  after market close  Its earnings and revenues for full year 2018 are expected to grow year over year 
In the last reported quarter  the company benefited from an improvement in revenues  Further  growth in assets under management  AUM  and lower expenses were on the positive side  However  net outflows during the quarter acted as a headwind 
However  activities of the company in the third quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise estimates upward  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 43 cents remained stable over the past 30 days 
Victory Capital s price performance does not seem very impressive  Its shares have lost 21 6  in the past three months compared with 12 7  decline recorded by the  
Will the price performance improve post third quarter earnings  Before having a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s check the factors that are likely to impact the quarter s results 
Factors to Influence Q3 Results
Per the monthly metrics data published by Victory Capital  its September end AUM of  63 4 billion was up from  62 3 billion as of Jun 30  2018  The increase is likely driven by strong inflows in U S  Small Cap Equity 
Given the increase in AUM in the quarter  the related fee is also expected to witness some improvement  driving overall revenues higher 
Expenses are likely to have declined during the quarter on the back of Victory Capital s operational efficiency  as reflected in the prior quarters 
Earnings Whispers
According to our quantitative model  chances of Victory Capital beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat

Featured Stock for May  Federated Investors  FII   24 share 
Federated Investors  NYSE FII   an asset management holding company  is the featured stock in May s Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio 
Since 2014  FII has grown revenue and after tax operating profit  NOPAT  by 3  compounded annually  per Figure 1  NOPAT margins have averaged 20  since 2012 and currently sit at 21  over the last twelve months  TTM   The company has earned a double digit return on invested capital  ROIC  in every year of our model  which dates to 1998  and currently earns a top quintile 18  ROIC

Free Cash Flow Supports Dividend Payments
Over the past five years  FII has paid annual regular dividends of  1 share  In 2016  the company also paid an additional  1 share special dividend  The consistent dividend payment has been supported by FII s strong free cash flow  Since 2013  FII has generated a cumulative  769 million  31  of market cap  in FCF while paying  619 million in dividends 
Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because we know the firm has the cash to support its dividend  On the flip side  dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends

FII Remains Undervalued
At its current price of  24 share  FII has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 0  This ratio means the market expects FII s NOPAT to never meaningfully grow over the remaining life of the firm  This expectation seems pessimistic given that FII has grown NOPAT by 3  compounded annually since 1998 
If FII can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  21   and continue to grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  32 share today   a 33  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here

of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Essent Group Ltd    NYSE ESNT    Citizens Financial Group  Inc    NYSE CFG   and Federated Investors  Inc    NYSE FII   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  3 Battered Finance Stocks Set to Rebound in 2019Despite the growing optimism regarding lesser regulations  improvement in economy and benefits from tax cuts  the performance of the finance sector has been quite bumpy so far this year  The U S  China trade war  Brexit related uncertainty  inversion of the yield curve and the U S  Federal Reserve s aggressive stance related to interest rate hikes are some of the major factors that induced volatility in 2018 As a result  the S P 500 Index has lost nearly 1  year to date  The S P 500 Financials  Sector  Index has decreased 12 7  and the Finance Sector has witnessed a decline of 11 4  over the same time frame Notably  while the tariffs imposed on imports from China do not have direct bearing on the finance stocks  the uncertainty related to the trade war has made investors wary of the performance of the overall economy  This indirectly affects the finance companies as the performance of the finance sector is linked to the nation s health Moreover  British Prime Minister Theresa May s tentative  withdrawal agreement  with the European Union  EU  failed to get an approval from her own party  increasing uncertainty over Brexit  Thus  the U K is scheduled to leave the EU on Mar 29  2019  even if there is no deal  which is likely to have an adverse impact on the global economic growth Further  yield curve inversion is bad news for the finance sector  The inversion of the yield curve means long term rates are below short term rates  Finance stocks  except REITs  benefit from steeping of the yield curve and the inversion will likely hurt the stocks  financial performance  Further  many see inversion as an early indication of an impending recession Nonetheless  while these headwinds dragged down finance stocks in 2018  the story of 2019 seems to be in the making  Expectation of a peaceful agreement in connection with the trade war  an anticipated pick up in the economy and favorable operating environment are expected to turn things around for

shareholders of record as of Mar 29  Along with this  the company has announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of 23 cents per share  which will be paid on the same date Given that the new Tax Act improved the company s capital position as well as its financial strength  management feels that a special dividend is the best way to return capital to shareholders According to 551 7 million of shares outstanding as of Jan 23  2018  this special dividend represents a total payment of  1 7 billion In fact  the company s chairman and CEO  Greg Johnson  said   This dividend is consistent with our long term capital management policies and our commitment to our stockholders  We will continue to prudently invest in our business  actively pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions  buyback our stock when it makes economic sense  and distribute the rewards of those investments to our stockholders over time  Notably  the company also paid a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share in January 2015  Moreover  it has hiked its dividend every year since its inception in 1981  the latest being a 15  increase in December 2017  Further  the company has an efficient share repurchase program in place Given a solid capital and liquidity position  the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities However  question arises  whether it is worth considering Franklin stock for earning this dividend income Let s delve deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and reward Earnings  Although the company has witnessed nearly 4  decline in its earnings per share  EPS  over the last three five years  it is expected to deliver a strong earnings performance in the near term as indicated by its

Franklin stock looks overvalued  based on its price to earnings  F1  and price to sales ratios  The company currently has a P E  F1  ratio of 11 94 and a P S ratio of 3 32  which are above the industry averages of 11 76 and 3 09  respectively Leverage  Franklin has a debt equity ratio of 0 09  which compares favorably with the industry average of 0 11  This indicates that the company has a lower debt burden  relative to the industry and that it will be financially stable  even in adverse economic conditions Return on Equity  ROE   The company s ROE of 13 88  is higher than the industry average of 13 45   This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds  compared with its peers Expenses  Franklin has been successful in reducing costs for the last few years  Expenses have declined nearly 7   14  and 3  in fiscals 2015  2016 and 2017  respectively  Thus  lower expenses are expected to aid bottom line growth in the quarters ahead Share Price Movement  The company s price performance does not look impressive  Its shares have lost 5 8  in the past year  as against 19 9  growth for the  it belongs to Our TakeWhile a stretched valuation and poor price performance make us a little apprehensive about the stock  we believe that it is a wise idea to add the stock to your portfolio now  given its declining expenses  a lower debt burden  superior ROE and good earnings growth prospects Moreover  its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year earnings has been revised nearly 3 5  upward over the last 30 days  indicating analysts  optimism

In the third quarter  Navient surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings on higher fee income  However  lower net interest income and higher expenses were the headwinds 
The company has a weak surprise history  It lagged earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and delivered an average negative surprise of nearly 1  
Moreover  activities of the company during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings decreased 2 3  over the last 30 days  Also  the figure represents a decline of nearly 2  on a year over year basis 
Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q4 Results
Higher Legal Expenses  The company s legal expenses will likely remain elevated due to the lawsuits filed against it during the quarter

Easing Margin Pressure  Navient s prime indexed assets lag the rise in short term rates by a quarter  As a result  pressure on net interest margin  NIM  will likely ease  Moreover  with the acquisition of assets of Earnest  consisting of education refinancing  NIM is anticipated to be higher 
Let s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts 
Our proven model doesn t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around  as it does not have the right combination of two key components  Note that a stock with the combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates

However  the company has a decent earnings surprise history  It topped earnings in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5 3  
In the last quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results were supported by higher net interest income and lower provisions  However  lower non interest income was an undermining factor

Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise   Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Fifth Third s stock  That depends largely on whether the firm is able to impress market with its fourth quarter results 
Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsExpenses Might Increase Slightly  Fifth Third s ongoing strategic investments in several areas  such as technology  will increase expenses  However  the company might be successful in offsetting the expense rise through its North Star initiatives to some extent 
Net Interest Income  NII  to Improve  The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending   particularly on the consumer front  Thus  loan growth  combined with a rise in interest rates  is likely to boost the company s NII 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  1 58 billion indicates 3 1  year over year growth Fee Income Might Remain Flat  Fifth Third s focus on strengthening its fee income base through North Star initiatives is likely to lend support  Also  higher credit card revenues due to seasonality along with improved investment banking business will increase the non interest income  However  poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are likely to offset the positives

7750,229265,FII,Investment Managers  Q1 Earnings On Apr 26  BEN  IVZ   More,opinion,The   part of the broader Finance sector  performed decently over the past several quarters  However  the trend seems to have picked up pace to some extent in the first quarter on the back of improved domestic growth environment The companies that have reported first quarter 2018 earnings so far witnessed growth in their trading revenues due to increased volatility in the quarter  However  dismal overall investment banking activities remained a drag The Investment managers  earnings are expected to get support from rising interest rates and lower tax  Also  the quarter witnessed investors  anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation  along with President Trump s trade tariff announcements on Chinese imports  This led to increased volatility  which indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues Apart from this  the global M A activity increased in the quarter  Per the Thomson Reuters data  the total deal value of announced M As globally rose during the quarter  Also  strong equity issuances globally might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow on offerings  Hence  the related fees are projected to increase However  debt underwriting remained disappointing as rising rates limit corporates  involvement in  these activities  Thus  overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline  Also  increased spending in technology is expected to keep costs up  in turn  hurting the investment managers  bottom line Per the latest   overall earnings for the finance sector are expected to grow 27  year over year on revenue growth of 5 4  Now  let s take a look at some of the investment management

and distribution fees  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is  417 million  reflecting a fall of 3 2  from the prior year quarter   Franklin s revenues are likely to decline  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for

long term outflows  the company is expected to record a fall in AUM  Also  Invesco s expenses in the quarter are likely to witness a marginal increase  mainly due to higher compensation expenses

7771,229286,FII,5 Financial Stocks That Beat Berkshire Hathaway In 2017,opinion,"Finance stocks have been gaining momentum on the back of the recent interest rate hikes by the Fed since the end of 2016  A decent interest rate environment has favored almost all the industries under the Finance sector  except REITs   The sector s stocks have witnessed solid revenue growth driven by higher investment income  The investment companies  banks  consumer loan companies  etc   have substantially benefitted from the rate hikes 
The Fed s decision to reduce its  4 2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities to strengthen its balance sheet has also favored the Finance sector 
So far in 2017  the unemployment rate has dipped to 4 2  accompanied by 2 9  year over year growth in the wage rate  These have positively impacted overall disposable income leading to higher consumer spending  The Fed also provided an optimistic unemployment outlook  Unemployment rate is further expected to decline to 3 9  in 2018

Total revenues for 2018 were  1 14 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter  Further  it came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The year over year upswing in revenues mainly stemmed from the consolidation of Hermes  revenues  partly countered by the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting principle  Further  higher voluntary fee waivers for certain money market funds for competitive purposes and decline in revenues from lower average equity assets unfavorably impacted revenues 
Also  net investment advisory fees jumped 15  year over year to around  214 million  In addition  administrative service fees were up 6  to  52 million  However  net service fees  other  marked a 4  decline  amounting to  41 2 million 
During the quarter under review  Federated derived 36  of its revenues from money market assets  63  from equity and fixed income assets  and remaining 1  from sources other than managed assets 
Furthermore  due to net investment loss and higher debt expenses  the company recorded non operating expenses of  6 2 million in the quarter  down 362  year over year 
Total operating expenses escalated 17  year over year to  219 3 million  The rise was primarily due to the consolidation of Hermes  expenses  partly offset decline in expenses on account of adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard 
Steady Asset Position

7795,229310,FII,Wells Fargo CEO Looks Optimistic About Q4 C I Loans Scenario ,opinion,"Shares of Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   rose 2  yesterday driven by the optimistic comments of CEO Tim Sloan on loan scenario in the fourth quarter based on improved customer activity 
Despite several legal tensions  Wells Fargo remains focused on maintaining its financial position  In May 2017  it doubled its cost cutting targets to combat escalating expenses  These efforts might help the company regain confidence of its clients and shareholders 
During the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS    Sloan commented on the regular screening of the bank s operations  He said   I think actually that we ll never say it s finished   According to him  some other areas of mistakes might standout as the bank continues to make improvements 
Key Takeaways
Sloan is optimistic of the economic growth in the last quarter of 2017 due to the progress on tax reforms and a favorable interest rate environment 
Growth in economy is likely to have spurred some customer activity on the consumer and commercial front during the quarter  He expects customer activity to gain momentum when Trump becomes successful in enforcing the tax bill 
Another major takeaway from the conference was about his thoughts on loan growth  In the third quarter  the bank had reported nearly 1  drop in its loan portfolio  year over year  He expects commercial and industrial  C I  lending scenario to be better in the fourth quarter 
However  he expects the mortgage segment to be impacted by seasonality during the last quarter  resulting in sluggish growth 
Sloan anticipates the auto lending segment to improve late next year 
Our Take
The fake accounts fallout marked the beginning of the bank s downward journey  Despite efforts to maintain financial health  Wells Fargo s expense base is likely to continue impacting its financials for some time  primarily due to high legal costs 
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 6 3  year to date  underperforming the  s rally of 17 7  

Currently  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Federated Investors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 28  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 63  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Federated Investors s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Investment Management industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 24  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Federated Investors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 54  so it is fair to say that the stock price appreciate in future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Federated Investors has a P S ratio of about 2 54  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  FII is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Federated Investors currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Federated Investors a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Federated Investors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives FII a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have shown a pretty favorable trend  The current quarter has seen two estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward movement in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2   in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up 2 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Federated Investors  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite the positive trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineFederated Investors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 32  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Investment Management industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to

7818,229333,FII,Citigroup To Settle 10 Year Old Dispute With Lehman Brothers,opinion,"Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   has agreed to pay  1 74 billion to the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc  for a case that was filed during 2008 financial crisis  The settlement comes as a tailwind for Lehman s unsecured creditors in the 10 year old bankruptcy case 
Citigroup had claimed that Lehman owed it  2 billion as a result of bankruptcy  However  Lehman accused Citigroup of making a false claim  as at that time it had access to  2 1 billion it had on deposit for trades with the bank  Lehman also charged the company of making up extra costs and using unfair methods in order to justify its claim 
Further  Lehman claimed that even after bankruptcy  Citigroup had charged it with costs for replacing trades even though it had hedged its risk and not replaced individual trades 
During a trial held in New York  Lehman brought forward phone recordings and messages from Citigroup traders  which showed how they tried to take advantage of the situation 
However  Citigroup said that it followed accepted standards for closing trades and used best professional judgment to determine close out amounts on the trades  The contracts were governed by International Swaps   Derivatives Association master agreements  which gave Citigroup the right to assess the close out costs as long as it used commercially reasonable procedures 
Nevertheless  Citigroup is pleased to have settled the case with Lehman  per a bank spokesperson 
Citigroup remains on track to settle all the pending legal matters since the financial crisis  Though this goal is likely to keep expenses elevated in the near term  it would enable Citigroup to focus on developing its business strategically 
Shares of Citigroup have gained 22 4  year to date  outperforming the  s rally of 9 9  

Currently  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Some better ranked stocks in the financial space are M T Bank Corporation   NYSE MTB    Federated Investors  Inc    NYSE FII   and PNC Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE PNC    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

7828,229343,FII,5 High Yielding Stocks For An Uncertain April ,opinion,Wall Street completed a blockbuster first quarter 2019  rebounding sharply from the rout it faced in the fourth quarter of 2018  The S P 500 Index closed its best first quarter performance since 1998 and best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2009  The Dow recorded the biggest gain since first quarter 2013 and Nasdaq Composite posted the best quarterly performance since 2012 However  the first quarter performance does not guarantee continued success  The partial inversion of the U S  Treasury yield curve already created mayhem in stock market last week  There are other factors as well that can stir up severe volatility 3 Risk Bearing FactorsFirst  global economic slowdown and its contagion effect on the U S  economy are major near term concerns  The Fed lowered the U S  GDP growth rate to 2 1  in 2019 from 2 3  projected in December  In China  the authority had pegged the country s growth rate in the range of 6 6 5  for 2019  the lowest since 1990  The European Central Bank lowered the 2019 growth projection for Eurozone to 1 1  from its previous projection of 1 7  Second  expectations for first quarter 2019 earnings are far from encouraging at present  Total earnings of S P 500 Index are anticipated to be down 3 7  from the same period last year on 4 8  higher revenues  Current estimates indicate the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016  However  after a blockbuster first quarter performance on the bourses  valuation is high for most of the stocks  So  weak earnings or guidance may result in market fluctuations   Third  trade related problems between the United States and China are yet to be resolved despite significant progress in that direction  Moreover  geo political issues like the prolonged Brexit conundrum can also dent investors  confidence Wall Street at a CrossroadsThe performance of Wall Street in the first quarter should strongly motive investors to opt for risky securities like equities  However  the ground reality is somewhat different  According to Bank of America  NYSE BAC   investors pulled  5 6 billion from stock funds in the first quarter of 2019  while investing a huge  94 2 billion in fixed income funds  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  reported that 44  of its active traders increased the cash portion of their portfolio in the past three months Notably  Wall Street witnessed partial inversion of the U S  Treasury yield curve on Mar 22  which continued for seven trading days  The yield inversion between 3 month and 1 year government bonds happened for the first time since 2007  In fact  several economists consider inversion between the 3 month and 10 year bond yields as a clear indication of an upcoming recession  The market can again witness yield inversion if any of the three risky issues mentioned above heightens Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be lucrative to invest in high yielding

7838,229353,FII,Federated Investors  FII  Is In Oversold Territory  What s Next ,opinion,"Federated Investors  Inc    NYSE FII   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at FII given that  according to its RSI reading of 28 68  it is now in oversold territory 
What is RSI  
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet  FII s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Federated Investors  earnings consensus 
Over the past two months  investors have seen 2 earnings estimate revision move higher  compared with none lower  at least when looking at the key current year time frame  And the consensus estimate for FII has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days  as estimates have risen from  1 90 share two months ago to just  1 96 share right now 
If this wasn t enough  Federated Investors also has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy which puts it into rare company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now  or holding on   as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long

Uptrend in Revenue   ExpenseTotal revenue in the third quarter rose 26  year over year to  294 6 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  296 million The year over year growth in revenues can mainly be attributed to reduced voluntary fee waivers related to money market funds and increased revenue from higher average equity assets  This was partially mitigated by decreased revenue resulting from change in the mix of average money market assets Moreover  net investment advisory fees increased 24  year over year to  197 2 million  Also  net service fees  other  marked a notable increase  amounting to  42 7 million compared with  21 2 million in the year ago quarter During the quarter  Federated derived 45  of its revenues from money market assets and remaining 55  from equity and fixed income assets Further  driven by a rise in net investment income  the company recorded a spectacular improvement in non operating income of  2 9 million in the quarter as against non operating expenses of  4 million in the prior year quarter Total operating expenses surged 29  year over year to  205 9 million  The rise primarily exhibits an escalation in distribution expenses  resulting from a decrease in voluntary yield related fee waivers Steady Asset PositionAs of Sep 30  2016  total AUM was  364 3 billion  up 4  year over year  Average managed assets were  365 4 billion  up 4  from the prior year quarter Federated witnessed a record equity assets of  64 1 billion  up 23  year over year  Also  money market assets increased 1  year over year to  248 4 billion However  fixed income assets decreased slightly year over year to  51 8 billion  from  52 1 billion as of Sep 30  2015  Also  money market mutual fund assets came in at  209 4 billion  down 3  year over year

7843,229358,FII,Fortress Investment  FIG  Lags Q1 Earnings  Costs Increase,opinion,"Fortress Investment Group LLC   NYSE FIG   reported first quarter 2017 pre tax distributable earnings of 19 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents  However  the reported figure represents a year over year increase of 19  Elevated expenses were primarily responsible for the lower than expected results  Also  weakening balance sheet position was a headwind  However  a slight gain in revenues was a positive factor On a GAAP basis  net loss came in at  7 million compared with  16 million in the prior year quarter 
 
Higher Expenses More than Offset Revenue GrowthGAAP total revenue for the quarter came in at  232 2 million  up slightly year over year  The increase was mainly attributable to a rise in management fees income from non affiliates and expense reimbursements from affiliates  However  the reported figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  258 7 million Other income summed  0 6 million  as against a loss of  40 2 million recorded in the prior year quarter  This was primarily due to gains in the quarter versus losses incurred in the prior year period  Also  lower losses from equity method investees resulted in income 
Total expenses climbed 16 8  year over year to  241 4 million  This increase was due to a rise in compensation  general and administrative costs As of Mar 31  2017  assets under management  AUM  was  70 2 billion  was up nearly 1  sequentially  However  the reported figure was down slightly year over year  Also  the Logan Circle division witnessed net client outflows of nearly  0 4 billion Balance Sheet PositionAs of Mar 31  2017  cash and cash equivalents were  334 7 million  down from  397 1 million as of Dec 31  2016 As of the same date  debt obligations were  182 8 million  flat compared with the previous quarter Further  total uncalled capital aggregated  7 5 billion as of Mar 31  2017  out of which approximately  4 8 billion is available for common investment purposes Our Viewpoint
Fortress Investment s failure to compete with its bigger peers in the terms of AUM growth as well as its inefficient expense control mechanism are concerns Moreover  the company is expected to be acquired by Japan based SoftBank Group Corp  in an all cash deal by the second half of 2017  This makes us more apprehensive regarding its future prospects

7844,229359,FII,Is Federated Investors  FII  Stock A Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Federated Investors  Inc    NYSE FII   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Federated Investors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 42  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 01  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Federated Investors  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past three years  with the number having falling over the past few months  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Financial   Investment Management industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 96  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Federated Investors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 92  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Federated Investors has a P S ratio of about 2 21  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  FII is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Federated Investors currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Federated Investors a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Federated Investors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives FII a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher  The current quarter as well as the full year has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  Federated Investors  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFederated Investors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 40   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past one year  the Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Federated Investors Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start

7850,229365,FII,Can Q2 Earnings Propel BlackRock  BLK  Stock To New Highs ,opinion,"Shares of  BlackRock  Inc    NYSE BLK    which are trading close to their 52 week high with a year to date gain of about 15   might test highs post the company s second quarter 2017 results on Jul 17  That s because year over year growth in revenues and earnings is expected this time 
Moreover  BlackRock is very likely to beat earnings estimates this time around  The company topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 2 6  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
According to our proven model  BlackRock has the right combination of two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  0 19   This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise

BlackRock  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Drive Better than Expected Results
BlackRock continues to dominate the ETF market with its brand initiatives  Moreover  driven by a rise in equity inflows in the second quarter  the company s U S  iShares inflows remained strong  This might have strengthened its assets under management 
The New York based asset manager remains well diversified geographically  Thus  the average fee rate is likely to rise  driven by higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions 
However  higher expenses could be a dampening factor  BlackRock has witnessed rising expenses over the last few years  Its plans of restructuring traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings might lead to an increase in expenses in the to be reported quarter 
The company s activities encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter inched up 1 5  to  5 37 in the last seven days

7870,229385,FII,Apollo Global  APO  To Pay  52 7M To Settle SEC Charges,opinion,"Apollo Global Management  LLC s   NYSE APO   four private equity fund advisers have entered into a deal with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  to pay  52 7 million to resolve the charges filed against the company 
Allegations
Apollo Global advisers failed to properly disclose the benefits they had received by accelerating the payment of future monitoring fees  owed by the funds  portfolio companies  when those companies were sold or became the subject of an IPO  This incident is anticipated by the SEC to have taken place between 2011 and 2015 
This act was detrimental to the interests of the fund investors as the lump sum payments received by the advisers reduced the value of the portfolio companies  leading to a decline in the amount available for distribution to the investors 
Further  the SEC also found that between 2008 and 2013  one of the Apollo Global advisers misled the investors by failing to disclose some information about the interest payments made by the company on a  19 million loan 
The purpose of the loan was to defer taxes on carried interest  which was due to the general partner  The general partner paid interest on the loan  which was disclosed in the fund s financial statements as interest accrued on an asset of the fund  However  the interest was actually being allocated to the general partner  which in turn made the disclosure misleading 
Moreover  Apollo Global also failed to manage one of its former senior partners  Between 2010 and 2013  the partner charged personal items and services to the Apollo funds and its companies 
Earlier  Apollo Global verbally reprimanded the partner after he admitted to charging personal expenses and reimbursed the company for the same  Again in 2012  when more personal expenses resurfaced  the company verbally reprimanded the partner  but it did not impose further discipline or supervision 
However in 2013  a forensic review of the partner s expenses reflected that he has charged even more personal expenses to the fund s clients  Hence  Apollo Global and the partner entered into a separation agreement in 2014 and the company was once again reimbursed 
What s Next

7880,229395,FII,5 Top Dividend Stocks To Gain From A Dovish Federal Reserve,opinion,As trade tensions continue to spook investors  two of America s leading central bank functionaries have said that further rate cuts may be necessary in 2019  Trade related uncertainties will likely be the primary trigger for any such decision  Of course  they think it is too early to predict when such reductions will take place and with what intensity These are words which will surely please market participants  Apart from rate sensitive stocks  which will gain from softer rates  dividend yielding stocks will also benefit  Not only will conservative investors seek them out  growth oriented investors will also try to gain from the price surge in high yield stocks Bullard Calls for Further Cuts  Yields PlungeGiven the backdrop of rising trade tensions  both President Trump and leading investors have been urging the Fed to reduce rates even more to boost the economy  On Aug 6  St  Louis Fed President James Bullard indicated that such cuts are likely but not a certainty as of now Speaking to the National Economists Club of Washington  D C   Bullard agreed that  additional policy action may be desirable   Bullard also thinks that trade tensions have had a  chilling  impact on business investment  He also believes that the trade war is unlikely to end any time soon Bullard s belief that further monetary easing may be necessary was borne out by the plunge suffered by government bond yields  On Aug 6  U S  Treasury yields lingered near multi year lows  This was largely a result of investors seeking out safe havens to hedge against the effects of the U S  China trade war Daly Focusing on Trade War  Tensions to Continue Till 2020 Meanwhile  San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Aug 5 that she will keep a close watch on the ongoing trade war  She thinks it is necessary to do so as it is a key factor in determining the central bank s next step on rates  Daly also thinks that the current state of U S  China trade relations is worrying Daly supports the Fed s first rate cut in more than a decade  She believes it was necessary to prop up a sluggish domestic economy given concerns over global growth and trade related uncertainty  In keeping with Bullard s views  Daly thinks a slowing global economy and falling business investment could necessitate further rate cuts later this year Meanwhile  Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   warned its clients on Aug 5 that a trade deal  now looks far off  with both the United States and China  taking a harder line   The financial major thinks an agreement is unlikely before the 2020 presidential polls  Trump is likely to keep his fresh tariffs in place on Election Day Our ChoicesKey Fed policymakers recently said that additional rate cuts may be required later this year to maintain U S  economic momentum  Continuing U S  China trade tensions and global economic sluggishness could easily require the central bank to step in with further monetary easing   Investing in dividend stocks  which have registered strong price gains this year  looks prudent  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is

7918,229433,FII,BB T  BBT  Q2 Earnings  Will The Stock Disappoint This Time ,opinion,BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   is scheduled to announce second quarter 2016 results on Jul 21  before the opening bell Last quarter  a substantial rise in interest income helped drive BB T s earnings  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  higher operating expenses and a drastic rise in provision for loan losses  ostensibly due to exposure to a stressed energy sector were the headwinds The earnings beat translated into improved share price movement  For the three month ended Jun 30  2016  BB T stock was up more than 5   indicating that the company s business activities were cheered by the investors However  analysts don t seem to be happy with BB T s performance in the just concluded quarter  The company witnessed five downward revisions in earnings estimates  versus two upward revisions  over the last 30 days  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents remained stable over the last 7 days Notably  BB T also doesn t boast a decent earnings surprise history  as evident from the chart below BB T CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsWill improvement in interest income support BB T s bottom line yet again  Or will it succumb to the challenging operating scenario this earnings season  Let s check the factors that are expected to influence Q2 results Margin under Pressure  Assuming no changes in interest rates  BB T expects GAAP net interest margin  NIM  to decrease marginally  given the run off of PCI loans and the loss of a positive seasonal impact of interest income on benefit plans  offset by the National Penn acquisition  On the other hand  core NIM is expected to remain relatively stable Expenses to Rise Driven by Acquisitions  In the second quarter  BB T expects non interest expenses to be roughly  1 75 billion  including merger related charges of  40  50 million  The initial expense bases of National Penn and Swett   Crawford of roughly  100  110 million will also add the overall expenses Also  additional expenses are expected from an increase in technology and IT expenses  Further  BB T expects efficiency ratio to scale an up owing to the timing of acquisitions and the delayed timing of related cost savings and synergies Non interest Income to Trend Up  Management projects total non interest income  including both acquisitions  to increase around 9 11  on a year over year basis in second quarter 2016  The decline in FDIC loss share account  and growth in insurance and investment banking income should be the contributing factors Loan Growth to Drive Revenues Up  BB T projects overall loan growth of around 1 3  on a core basis in second quarter 2016  while including the impact of National Penn acquisition  loan growth will be nearly 20   Specifically  C I loan portfolio is anticipated to grow in the mid single digits  while CRE construction and development loan portfolio is likely to decline slightly  Therefore  driven by improved loans  we believe BB T s top line will witness moderate growth Asset Quality to Support Results  In the absence of energy deterioration  BB T expects provision for loan losses in second quarter 2016 to be in the low to mid range  Also  management expects provisions to grow in line with charge offs  NCOs  as well as acquisition driven new loan growth Management expects NCOs to remain within 0 35 0 45  range  while non performing assets levels to remain stable sequentially  assuming no unexpected impact from spring redeterminations for the energy portfolio Earnings WhispersOur proven model indicates that this time around the chances of BB T surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate is quite low as it does not have the right combination of two key components  Note that a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least  2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for BB T is  1 54   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 64 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents Zacks Rank  BB T s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  But need to have a positive ESP to be sure of an earnings beat Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter indicates a year over year fall of about 6 28  Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming

7939,229454,FII,PNC Financial  PNC   Stock To Turnaround Post Q2 Earnings  ,opinion,The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE PNC   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Friday  Jul 15 In first quarter 2016  the Pennsylvania based company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined 4  from the year ago tally  Results were weighed down by lower non interest income due to weakness in equity markets and reduced capital markets activity  Also  the quarter recorded higher provisions owing to energy stress  However  on a positive note  the company witnessed higher net interest income and lower expenses PNC Financial delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4 06   Notably  industry wide weakness and global macroeconomic concerns  which were further fueled by the recent Brexit referendum  took a toll on the bank stocks with PNC Financial falling nearly 15  year to date PNC FINL SVC CP Price and EPS Surprise   Will the stock turnaround post second quarter earnings release  Unfortunately  our quantitative model doesn t call for an earnings beat this time  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 76 for the second quarter indicates a year over year decline of more than 6  What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that PNC Financial is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the upcoming release  This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for greater chances of an earnings beat  But that is not the case here  as elaborated below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is  0 57    This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate of  1 75 is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 76 Zacks Rank  PNC Financial s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise What to Expect in Q2 While results of PNC Financial in the last quarter were undoubtedly a reflection of the stressed operating environment that the overall banking industry experienced in the first quarter  the picture for second quarter is no different  Let s have a look at the different factors at play Continued Pressure on Net Interest Margin  NIM   As the Federal Reserve held back on further rate hike so far this year  the company is not likely to record improvement in its NIM in second quarter  Lower investment securities yields might have further weighed on the margin Seasonally Higher Expenses  Though the company remains focused on driving operational efficiency through its ongoing cost containment efforts  the upcoming release may reflect pressure on the expense base   Notably  management noted in its first quarter 2016 conference call that non interest expense is projected to rise in mid single digits during the second quarter on a sequential basis  due to higher expected business activity and seasonality Modest Net Interest Income  NII  Growth  NII is expected to rise modestly in second quarter 2016  Notably  supporting NII  period end loans may exhibit modest rise during the quarter Fee Income to Exhibit Strength  Fee income is likely to exhibit an increase in the range of 10 12   reflecting higher expected business levels in the second quarter  Among fee revenue categories  management is optimistic about mid to high single digit growth in consumer services  Further  treasury management business is predicted to bolster corporate services income through product innovations as well as cross selling  Additionally  growth in residential mortgage income is based on expected production gains Benign Energy Headwinds  Management expects provision within  125  175 million including the impact of expectations of continued stress in energy lending  However given the rebound in oil prices that hit rock bottom in February  the provision to cover potential losses tied with energy portfolio should not be significant PNC Financial s activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  over the last seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at  1 76 Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering  as

7942,229457,FII,Wells Fargo  WFC  Q2 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   is scheduled to report its second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Friday  Jul 15  But many questions persist in its investors  minds this time around  given the tough industry backdrop and litigation hassles that the bank has endured during the quarter In the last quarter  driven by organic growth aided by higher revenues along with strong loans and deposit balances  Wells Fargo reported a positive earnings surprise of about 1   However  it compared unfavorably with the prior year quarter s earnings  Further  higher provisions and expenses remain a concern Wells Fargo has a decent earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart below WELLS FARGO NEW Price and EPS Surprise   
Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsGlobal economy  persistent low interest rate environment and volatile oil prices have remained concerns for the banking stocks  Brexit has further added to the troubles  While energy loans are still a concern  the provision requirement should not be as high as it was in the first quarter as oil prices have recovered to some extent Despite a rise in loan demand  revenue growth will remain restrained  similar to previous quarters   This is because of a continuing low rate environment on net interest income  though a small uptick might be recorded Mortgage business on the other hand seems to be rising  as the low rate environment may have pushed people to refinance their home loans  Moderate growth in fresh mortgage originations is also expected Efforts to strengthen the top line by focusing more on non interest income has not been very successful either  However  trading activity was impressive in the first two months of the quarter  While client activity was weaker in equities  it was higher for fixed income  It is expected that Brexit and other macro concerns may offset the early momentum Additionally  investment banking business is likely to remain weak as persistent decline in M A activities and a weakening IPO market in the wake of global economic concerns continues  Additionally  continued shift towards electronic platforms may have weighed on investment banking Banks are continuously looking for restructuring activities to control costs and improve its bottom line performances  In a bid to increase its market share in commercial lending markets  Wells Fargo completed the acquisition of General Electric  NYSE GE  Company s Commercial Distribution Finance  CDF  business in Asia Industry wide weakness in the key operating segments and regulatory matters are expected to hamper the results  Though Wells Fargo has implemented company wide expense management initiatives  it is facing challenges to manage costs  Over the past few quarters  the company has been experiencing an increase in non interest expenses  The absence of significant improvements in cost management is expected to continue to hurt the company s bottom line Notably  the efficiency ratio for full year 2016 is anticipated to be at the higher end of the company s targeted range of 55 59   Though the company does not expect to record seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter  other expenses  including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases and certain other expenses such as outside professional services and advertising costs are expected to increase in the second quarter Additionally  the legal costs are now an integral part of Wells Fargo s financials  With increasing regulatory scrutiny on the business model  Wells Fargo is not expected to rid itself of such expenses  at least in the near term  though settlement efforts should take some burden off its shoulders Most importantly  this banking giant has failed to impress analysts with its level of activities during the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable at  1 02 per share over the last seven days Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Wells Fargo is likely to miss the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter   This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here  as elaborated below Zacks ESP   The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is  0 98   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  1 01 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 02 Zacks Rank  Wells Fargo s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further lowers the predictive power of ESP  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider  as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Comerica Inc    NYSE CMA   has an earnings ESP of  1 47  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report its second quarter results on Jul 19 The earnings ESP for Regions Financial Corp    NYSE RF   is  5 00  and it carries a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release its second quarter results on Jul 19 Federated Investors  Inc    NYSE FII   has an earnings ESP of  2 13  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  It is slated to report its second quarter results on Jul 28 Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-07-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wells-fargo-(wfc)-q2-earnings:-disappointment-in-store-200141673,200141673

7955,229470,FII,Quality ETFs   Stocks To Beat The Market,opinion,Trade has been playing foul in the stock market since President Donald Trump threatens to impose 10  tariff on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods effective Sep 1  China retaliated by allowing the yuan to slip to the lowest level against the dollar in more than a decade  sparking currency war concerns  Per Bloomberg News  China has also halted imports of U S  agricultural products However  trade tensions eased somewhat this week when the Office of the U S  Trade Representative said it would delay tariffs on certain Chinese products  mainly consumer goods that are made in China and sold in the United States  until Dec 15  A few products would be removed altogether  including certain types of fish and baby seats  The latest drama in the U S  Sino trade war has renewed the appeal for riskier assets but uncertainty lingers  read    Additionally  a slew of downbeat economic data across the globe also resulted in a stock market decline  The U S  ISM manufacturing index dropped for the fourth straight month in July to record the lowest reading since August 2016  The U S  non manufacturing  services  index also dropped last month  United Kingdom s economy shrank for the first time in more than six years in the second quarter and the producer price index in China contracted for the first time in nearly three years  China s industrial output growth falls to a more than 17 year low Further  the possibility of snap elections in Italy  rising concerns about the pro democracy protests in Hong Kong  and a plunge in Argentina s currency and stock markets added to the chaos Against such a backdrop  investors should focus on high quality investing Why Quality Investing Quality stocks are rich in value characteristics with a healthy balance sheet  high return on capital  low volatility  elevated margins  and a track record of stable or rising sales and earnings growth  These products thus reduce

7967,229482,FII,Will KeyCorp Miss Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"KeyCorp is scheduled to report its fourth quarter and full year 2014 results on Jan 22  before the opening bell 
Third quarter 2014 earnings per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results were mainly impacted by decline in revenues  offset by lower expenses and a fall in provision for loan and lease losses 
KeyCorp recorded an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6 2   Is KeyCorp likely to miss on earnings this quarter  Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors to Influence Q4 Results Though the first nine months of 2014 reflected muted growth on the revenues front  management expects the top line to pick up momentum this quarter on the back of higher non interest income  Driven by strong investment banking activities  non interest income is anticipated in the low double digit percentage range in the upcoming release  However  net interest income in this quarter is expected to be relatively at par with the previous quarter figure of  581 million  For 2014  revenue generation is estimated to reflect low single digit growth  exhibiting a year over year improvement  Further  results this quarter will likely benefit from growth in loans as forecasted by management  With development in commercial lending operations  average loans are projected to rise year over year in the mid single digit range  On the expense front  management predicts additional pension settlement charges in the range of  5  10 million and efficiency charges of around  10 million in this quarter  However  overall expenses are expected to remain almost in level with the third quarter number of  704 million  For 2014  expenses are estimated to be in the low to mid single digits  representing better expense management on a year over year basis  Moving on to the credit quality metrics  net charge offs are anticipated to remain below the target range of 40 to 60 basis points in the upcoming release owing to favorable economic trends 
Nonetheless  KeyCorp s activities during the quarter were not sufficient to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 26 cents per share over the last 7 days Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that KeyCorp is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least  2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 26 cents is at par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Zacks Rank  KeyCorp s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call Stocks to Consider Here are some finance stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 

Ameriprise Financial Inc   NYSE AMP  has an Earnings ESP of  0 45  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report results on Jan 28 
Citigroup Inc   NYSE C  has an earnings ESP of  5 38  and carries a Zacks Rank  1  It is slated to release results on Jan 27

7971,229486,FII,80  Or Bust  Mind The Gap  It s A Bunny,opinion,"80  Or Bust
Not surprisingly  the recent sharp reflexive rally has brought the bulls out in full force as noted by a recent comment on my post earlier this week on 4  From The Highs 

 by the time you get confirmation with the long term indicators above  you will miss out on 20 to 30  of the rally 

It s a fair point if you are a short term trader looking to time the market  I m not  As a long term investor  and specifically as a manager of  other people s money   I am much more concerned with the specific inflection points where market dynamics change from a generally positive trend  to a negative one 
Yes  I will most definitely miss both the bottom and the top of markets  As shown in the chart below  the technical indications of a change in trend are slow to occur  However  I am only really concerned with capturing  or missing  the 80  between the tops and bottoms of major market cycles 

Further  the majority of the  Best 10  and  Worst 10  days are contained primarily within those 80  spans 

So  yes  I am absolutely going to be  wrong  at the tops of markets and at the bottoms while I await confirmation of a longer term  trend  to emerge  For those that are inherently  bullish  who choose  hope  over what prices are  actually  doing  the historical outcomes have been brutal  to say the least 
As I have said before  my methodologies are my own  They are not new ideas  They are not innovative  They are simply the lessons I have been repeatedly taught over the last 30 years of managing money  If the markets reverse the current long term sell signals  I will happily put a lot more money to work  Until then  I will wait rather than trying to  draw to an inside straight   
Think about it this way   if betting in the markets was really the way to build wealth  wouldn t the vast majority of Americans be wealthy versus just the top 1   Just a thought 
Mind The Gap
I have discussed the problems with earnings and earnings estimates  stating 

In a 2010 study  by the McKinsey Group  they found that analysts have been persistently overly optimistic for 25 years  During the 25 year time frame  Wall Street analysts pegged earnings growth at 10 12  a year  Unfortunately  earnings only grew at 6  which  as we have discussed in the past  is the growth rate of the economy 



The McKenzie study also noted that on average  analysts  forecasts have been almost 100  too high  which leads investors to make much more aggressive bets on the financial markets 

My friend Salil Mehta from Statistical Ideas recently published a great piece on this issue 

The gap between the 2016 forecasts and the YTD returns through January is 13   8  target minus the  5  YTD   Annual returns have a nearly 20  standard deviation  or 19  if you only look from the end of January onward   So it is still plausible   though rather unlikely  with only a one in five probability   to reach the 8  target gain for 2016   For statistics wonks  the test statistic decomposes the 13  gap to a  9  move in addition to the typical 4 5  annualized return  and then factors in a 19  standard deviation   Now that we are further into the year  mid March   euphoria and complacency are back to extreme market top levels 
It s also worth noting that strategists at major firms are consistently bullish  year after year  The sources of the most optimistic prognostications also don t change  Sorted from most to least bullish  they are Federated Investors  NYSE FII   JP Morgan  Prudential  LON PRU   Bank of America  NYSE BAC   and Columbia 



In the table below  two pieces of information averaged among the 10 firms listed above are presented 
The difference between the target and the January YTD returns 
The rest of the year returns  



If these analyst forecasts were mostly in the right direction  you would expect a positive linear relationship between 1 and 2  Regrettably  there is a negative relationship instead  Never mind that the market continued its drop in February  even after the revised forecasts  and the rebound leaves the market still below many firm s 2016  2015  and even 2014 targets 
In other words  the larger the gap in January between the YTD returns and the year end target  the more unlikely the chance the market will recover to the target by the year s end 
Think about this  For 2016  the 13  gap noted earlier  after the standardization adjustment  is the largest gap among this data 

As Salil concludes   That s not a good omen  
It s A Bunny
Since it is Easter  I will leave you with a story about a bunny 
James Paulsen  Chief Investment Strategist for Wells Capital Management  recently penned an excellent piece with respect to the ongoing  bull bear  debate 

The accompanying exhibit illustrates the U S  stock market since WWII with recessions shown by the grey bars  In the last two expansions  during the 1990s and again in the 2000s   the stock market was uninterrupted by a bear market posting solid and steady returns until the economic recovery ended with a recession  So far  despite some volatility in 2011  this has also characterized the contemporary bull market  Without a bunny market in more than 20 years  as shown in Exhibit 1  the last bunny market was in the mid 1990s   most investors currently seem to accept that either the bull market will soon resume or we are nearing the end of this expansion  Since there has not been one in some time  few consider that stocks could simply be headed for another bunny market 



Most bunny markets occur in the latter part of an economic recovery  Stocks initially recover aggressively after a recession  However  as the recovery matures  cost push pressures  inflation  and higher interest rates begin to pressure the bull market  This often resolves into a bunny market for the balance of many economic recoveries 

I have modified his chart to notate both secular bull and bear market periods  During secular bear markets  as we most likely currently remain in  volatility swings and prices declines are substantially larger than during secular bull market periods  This elevates the risk of emotionally driven investment mistakes during periods of markedly higher volatility which leads to lower rates of investor returns longer term 
Just some things to think about

	Results exhibited a fall in revenues offset by a decrease in operating expenses  Notably  growth in assets under management   AUM   led by net inflows acted as a tailwind

	Total revenue fell 14  year over year to  545 4 million  Also  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  580 8 million 
	Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  totaled  215 7 million  down 2  year over year 
	Total operating expenses fell 9  year over year to  366 6 million  The fall was due to a reduction in all expense components except depreciation and other amortization costs as well as other expenses 
	As of Mar 31  2016  total AUM was  642 0 billion  up 5  from Dec 31  2015 level  This reflected a net client cash inflow of  5 1 billion Capital and Liquidity

	Janus Capital Group  Inc    NYSE JNS   recorded a negative earnings surprise of 9 52  in first quarter 2016  Lower than expected results reflected the reduction in revenues partly offset by a decline in operating expenses 
	However  driven by lower fee waivers  Federated Investors  Inc    NYSE FII   delivered a positive earnings surprise in first quarter 2016  marking the fourth consecutive quarter of an earnings beat  The better than expected results were mainly driven by a rise in total revenue and a surge in equity asset balances ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/affiliated-managers-(amg)-q1-earnings-in-line,-costs-fall-200127643",200127643

8001,229516,FII,Muted Lending  Low Rates To Hurt SunTrust s  STI  Q3 Earnings,opinion,SunTrust Banks   NYSE STI   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 17  before the opening bell  While its revenues in the to be reported quarter are projected to have improved year over year  earnings are likely to have witnessed a decline In the last reported quarter  the company s results were hurt by an increase in expenses and higher provisions  partly offset by rise in revenues SunTrust has an impressive earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 3 6  SunTrust Banks  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    However  the company s activities in the third quarter were not able to impress analysts  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 40 has remained unchanged over the past 30 days  Moreover  the figure indicates a 1 4  decline from the prior year quarter s reported number The consensus estimate for the company s revenues of  2 33 billion for the to be reported quarter indicates 1 7  rise from the figure reported in the prior year quarter Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet interest income  NII  to not offer much support  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SunTrust s average earning assets for the to be reported quarter is pegged at  199 4 billion  which suggests marginal growth from the prior quarter s reported figure  However  the overall lending scenario was not great during the third quarter  A dismal lending picture   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  in which SunTrust has significant exposure   is likely to have hurt its NII The company expects NII to remain stable or decline 1  on a sequential basis Further  decline in interest rates  two rate cuts in July and September  and flattening of the yield curve along with rising deposit betas are likely to have hurt the company s net interest margin  NIM  Management expects NIM in the third quarter to have declined 7 9 basis points  bps  on a sequential basis Relatively stable non interest income  As mortgage rates declined in the third quarter  refinancing activities are likely to have improved  Thus  mortgage servicing fees and production income are expected to have provided some support to SunTrust s overall mortgage revenues in the quarter However  despite decent equity market performance in the third quarter  which seems to have resulted in a slight improvement in equity trading  several lingering concerns  including the uncertainty related to the U S  China trade war and Brexit  and expectations of global economic slowdown persisted  resulting in lower client activity  Thus  overall growth in trading revenues is likely to have been muted in the to be reported quarter Coming to investment banking activities  while dealmakers across the globe were active during the third quarter  M A deal value and volumes witnessed a decline due to the geopolitical concerns as the companies became more risk averse  So  this is likely to have hurt the bank s advisory fees Further  despite decent equity market performance and the central bank s accommodative stance  corporates seem to be shying away from equity issuances  given the global concerns  However  overall debt issuances were decent  given the lower interest rates  Hence  the company is expected to have witnessed only modest growth in overall underwriting fees Operating expenses to remain manageable  Due to the branch consolidation initiatives  SunTrust s expenses have been declining over the past few quarters  This is expected to have continued in the to be reported quarter Management expects to witness merger related costs of approximately  10  15 million in the third quarter Asset quality to offer some support  SunTrust expects net charge off  NCO  ratio in the third quarter to have been in the low end of 25 30 bps Further  the consensus estimate for the company s non performing assets of  595 million for the to be reported quarter suggests a marginal decline from the previous quarter s reported figure  Also  the estimate for non performing loans of  533 million indicates a decline of nearly 1  from the previous quarter Now  let s check what our quantitative model predicts Chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is  0 71  Zacks Rank  SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  While this

8002,229517,FII,Will Low Rates  Muted Lending Hurt BB T s  BBT  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   is slated to announce third quarter 2019 results on Oct 17  before the market opens  Per the Fed s latest   commercial and industrial loans  accounting for roughly 40  of the company s total loans and leases  recorded muted growth in the third quarter  with the quarter not witnessing much improvement in overall lending activities BB T anticipates average total loans held for investment  including the sale of residential mortgage loans  to have been down 4 6  sequentially  on an annualized basis  in the to be reported quarter  However  excluding the mortgage sale  average total loans held for investment are projected to have grown 4 6  sequentially Thus  driven by soft loan growth  earning assets in the to be reported quarter are likely to have risen too  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  2 03 trillion suggests nearly 1 1  rise from the prior quarter s reported figure However  decline in interest rates  two rate cuts in July and September  and flattening of the yield curve along with rising deposit betas are likely to have hurt BB T s net interest margin  NIM  in the third quarter  On a sequential basis  management expects GAAP and core NIM to have declined 4 8 basis points Moreover  the company anticipates net interest income  NII  to have been down marginally compared with the prior quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of  1 68 billion indicates a marginal decline from the prior quarter s reported number Now  let s check out some of the other factors that are likely to have influenced BB T s results in the third quarter Fee income to not provide much support  BB T is expected to have witnessed a fall in insurance income in the to be reported quarter  The company anticipates insurance revenues to have declined 15 16  sequentially due to seasonality  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance commission is pegged at  496 million  which indicates a decline of 12 4  sequentially Also  the consensus estimate for bankcard fees and merchant discounts is pegged at  76 million  suggesting a 1 3  decline from the prior quarter s reported figure Further  while lower mortgage rates are expected to have led to an increase in refinancing activity in the third quarter  overall mortgage revenues are not likely to have increased significantly  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income is pegged at  106 million  indicating a decline of 6 2  from the prior quarter s reported figure Moreover  investment banking  and brokerage fees and commissions are not likely to have provided much support to overall fee income growth in the third quarter  The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at  123 million  indicating a decline of 6 1  from the second quarter s reported figure However  BB T is likely to have registered rise in service charge on deposits  as deposit balances are expected to have increased  The consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is pegged at  184 million  indicating 1 7  rise from the prior quarter s reported number Thus  due to an anticipated decline in most of the components of fee income  total non interest income is likely to have declined in the third quarter  The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at  1 30 billion  indicating a 4 2  decline from the prior quarter s reported figure Expenses to rise marginally  Due to an increase in personnel expenses and BB T s efforts to improve digitization  overall costs have remained elevated over the past few quarters  In fact  as the company continues with its acquisitions and subsequent integrations along with branch consolidation efforts  costs are likely to have risen modestly in the third quarter Asset quality to remain strong  BB T expects loan loss provisions to match net charge offs  NCOs  in addition to providing for loan growth  Further  management expects NCO rates to have increased sequentially to 35 45 basis points on the assumption of no deterioration in the economy The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non performing assets of  519 million indicates a decline of nearly 1  from the prior quarter s reported figure Here is what our quantitative model predicts The chances of BB T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for BB T is  1 27  Zacks Rank  BB T currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  While this increases the predictive power of ESP  we also need a positive ESP to be sure of an earnings beat Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s earnings for the third quarter is pegged at  1 03  which suggests no change from the year ago

8278,229793,FII,U S  asset managers under allocated to emerging markets despite outperformance,news,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  based stock investors may have pumped fresh funds into emerging markets after their recent outperformance  but they remain under allocated by a key measure  as a combination of  home bias  and lingering concern about volatility have restrained client interest 
While they increased allocation to emerging markets by nearly  52 billion in the first quarter of 2017  U S  domiciled active managers still have just 5 percent of assets under management allocated to emerging market equities  data from research firm eVestment shows 
Globally  non U S  active funds have about twice the exposure to emerging market stocks  at around 9 94 percent  the eVestment data shows  European domiciled funds have nearly three times the weighting as their U S  counterparts at 14 8 percent 
 A lot of our clients  particularly on the private client side are U S   dollar  denominated   they do have a home bias and we reflect that home bias in our portfolios   said Jason Pride  director of investment strategy for Glenmede Investment Management  Data from Lipper shows just 0 21 percent of Glenmede s mutual fund assets are in emerging markets 
Meanwhile  MSCI s all country world index s  MIWD00000PUS  weighting to emerging markets has grown to 11 15 percent as of May 2017  from 7 percent in 2006  as more emerging market companies met standards for investable assets 
By being so underweight  American investors have missed big gains since emerging market stocks pulled out of a five year bear market in early 2016  Since then  MSCI s emerging markets index  MSCIEF  has surged nearly 48 percent  handily outpacing the S P 500 s  SPX  30 percent gain in the same period 
Such caution also reflects emerging markets  long term volatility  Over the past 18 months of outperformance  emerging markets investors have had to stomach about 35 percent more volatility  Reuters data shows 
FOLLOW THE GROWTH 
But with global economic growth trends favoring the fast growing asset class  investors will need to move into emerging markets to continue reaching gains above 5 percent in bond and equity portfolios  said Krishna Memani  chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds  That sentiment was echoed by more than a dozen fund managers interviewed by Reuters who collectively manage hundreds of billions of dollars 
 In a growth short world  emerging markets are going to be the primary source of growth for the foreseeable future   Memani said   That is decades  
Emerging economies are expected to grow between 5 percent and 7 percent a year over the next five years and to represent 45 percent of global GDP by 2020  up from 35 percent in 2010  according to data from the Institute of International Finance  IIF   They could represent as much as 60 percent in 15 years  Developed market economies like the United States and Western Europe are expected to expand around 2 percent annually through 2020 
Much of the growth of emerging markets has come from China  which will be more open to investors after MSCI announced in June it would include the country s domestic shares in its emerging markets index starting next year 
While few question the growth trajectory of emerging economies  not all fund managers agree that equates to long term asset outperformance 
 There is this narrative that you hear a lot that just by divine order EM is going to outperform developed markets because they re growing faster   said Tina Byles Williams  chief executive and chief investment officer of FIS Group   We don t think that  None of those things are necessarily untrue  but market dynamics change  over time   
Linda Bakhshian  a multi asset portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc  N FII   says that for her clients  who are more conservative  the returns are not consistent enough to merit significantly increasing allocation 
 To invest in EM you need to have reliable information   Bakhshian said   It takes a lot of resources that I could dedicate to other areas that will provide a better return for what I m looking for  
NOT AS STICKY
Volatility and long term underperformance has long led investors to think of EM as a short term tactical tool to boost returns at the margins rather than a long term  strategic investment  Indeed  over the past 20 years  MSCI s emerging index s rise of about 80 percent has delivered less than half the gain of the S P 500 s 164 percent 
Emerging markets also have a problem with remaining sticky for foreign investors  according to Emre Tiftik  IIF s deputy director in the capital markets and emerging markets policy department  When developed economies encounter hard times  emerging markets are among the first assets sold 
Money piled out of emerging markets after the global financial crash of 2008  investors further pulled out after the European debt crisis of 2011  and the largest migration from EM came after the Federal Reserve announced in 2013 that it would begin to reduce its bond buying program 
The debate over the merits of investing in emerging markets is also present between asset managers and clients  many of whom remain skittish about emerging markets 
 We definitely do our part in terms of our research and all the discussions we have on a regular basis with our clients to tell them   Based on our analysis EM is a great place to invest right now    said Isabelle Mateos y Lago  BlackRock s chief multi asset strategist   But ultimately it s their decision

focused days of 2000 but now common thanks to mountains of corporate cash and changes in tax policy that have been favorable to dividends   Should the Nasdaq set a new record soon  as many expect   the index remains about 4 percent below its highest point after gaining nearly 15 percent over the last 12 months   its catalyst won t be irrational exuberance  fund managers and analysts say   Instead  three key factors underpin the Nasdaq s 125 percent rise over the last five years  the Federal Reserve s ongoing policy of near zero interest rates that has made equities more attractive than bonds  the maturation of technology companies  and the rise of Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL O   a company that didn t appear among the largest 20 companies by market value in the index 15 years ago and now represents more than 10 percent of its weight   BUBBLE QUESTIONS The Fed s policy of keeping short term interest rates near zero is credited with pushing up the prices of stocks and real estate broadly over the last five years  Yet fund managers say that they see few signs of a bubble in technology stocks  at least for now   Because the Federal Reserve has waited so long to get rates back to normal  it s almost set up to fuel a bubble   said David Kelly  chief global strategist at J P  Morgan Funds   But my sense is that there s still a nervousness about the U S  equity market and it s been keeping a lid on valuations getting out of hand   The pace of new initial public offerings has slowed considerably from the 630 tech IPOs that came to market between 1999 and 2000  leading to less speculation overall  By comparison  299 companies overall went public between the start of 2014 and the year to date  according to Renaissance Capital  Technology companies make up 43 percent of the Nasdaq   Back then  companies routinely went public with little more than a concept  Now  companies such as Uber  the popular ride hailing service  have seen their valuations top  40 billion in the private markets  in part because mutual fund firms are more willing to take stakes in early stage companies   Nasdaq  then and now   Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB O   for instance  reached a valuation of  50 billion while still private  thanks in part to investments by fund companies such as T  Rowe Price  according to date from VentureSource  On an inflation adjusted basis  that was larger than the market value of all but 14 companies in the Nasdaq at its record on March 10  2000  according to data from Nasdaq OMX Group    Companies are staying private longer to develop their businesses so that when they go public they have a better chance of success out of the gate   said Michael Cuggino  portfolio manager of the Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Fund  Even if there isn t a bubble now  investors face other concerns  Chief among them  some of the largest companies in the Nasdaq are showing their age  a worry that they didn t have 15 years ago   What you re seeing with companies like Cisco and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM O  is that they have evolved to a point in their life cycle where it s very tough to show a lot of growth  That s the huge challenge now   said Skip Aylesworth  the portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund  Cisco said in August it would cut 6 000 jobs  at least the third workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom  but which has lately struggled to sustain growth  Semiconductor maker Qualcomm has branched into markets such as medical equipment and solar panels in recent years in order to increase its growth rate   APPLE INFLUENCE Investors  long memories of getting burned in the last crash has weighed on the Nasdaq  which has yet to surpass its previous highs even as the broader Standard   Poor s 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average have repeatedly topped new peaks over the last year  fund managers say  The rally in the shares of Apple   which has jumped nearly 68 percent over the last 12 months  including a 16 7 percent gain for the year to date   is likely to push the Nasdaq to new records  fund managers say    You have the largest company in the world continuing to grow at above market rates  which is incredible   said Aylesworth  the Hennessy manager   Apple represented slightly over 10 percent of the Nasdaq s market value as of Wednesday s close  At its record high in 2000  Apple made up less than 0 2 percent of the index  At the time  company co founder Steve Jobs was just three years into his second go round as its chief executive  and the company was still a year away from introducing the iPod digital music player  Despite its growth rates  Apple still trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 17 3  in line with the broad S P 500 index  and pays a dividend yield of 1 4 percent  Apple s outsized presence in the Nasdaq   along with that of Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL O   a company that was still private 15 years ago and now constitutes about 4 percent of the index   is one sign that the technology sector has matured  said Phil Orlando  chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors

8300,229815,FII,SEC fines Federated Investors for oversight shortfalls,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    Federated Investors Inc  N FII  will pay a  1 5 million fine to settle U S  Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it failed to properly monitor whether outside consultants it employed might have misused potential market moving information 
The SEC announced the civil settlement with Federated Global Investment Management Corp on Friday  It said Federated did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to pay the civil penalty 
The settlement resolves issues tied largely to a consultant who from 2001 to 2010 made biotechnology and pharmaceutical stock recommendations to the Federated Kaufmann Funds 
Meghan McAndrew  a Federated spokeswoman  said the company addressed the issues raised by the SEC prior to the regulator s inquiry   There was no finding of any misuse of material nonpublic information   she added 
Federated  based in Pittsburgh  is one of the largest U S  asset managers  with about  369 7 billion of assets under management as of March 31 
According to an order instituting settled administrative proceedings  Federated was unaware that the consultant in question had been a board member of four companies whose stocks Federated traded 
The SEC said the consultant at times also traded stocks that Federated owned in his own brokerage accounts   sometimes in close proximity  to the funds  trades  and should have been subjected to  blackout periods  surrounding the funds  trades 
 FGIMC s written policies and procedures were not reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material  nonpublic information with respect to outside consultants   the SEC said 
Federated ended its relationship with the consultant in May 2010  the SEC said ",2016-05-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sec-fines-federated-investors-for-oversight-shortfalls-405079,405079

   Italian bank shares slip on deepening euro zone crisis
   Concerns outweigh better than expected economic data
   U S  durable goods orders  German sentiment improve
  Adds fresh market prices 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  June 24  Reuters    The euro fell and global
stocks slipped on Friday as concerns the Greek parliament may
fail to pass the austerity measures that are critical to
securing more bailout funds outweighed better than expected
U S  and German economic data 
 The euro slid against the dollar for a third straight
session and it hit a record low against the Swiss franc as
investors sought traditional safe havens  For more  see

 European shares extended their slide to eight consecutive
weeks  the longest losing streak since 1998  with Italian banks
falling heavily as worries about Greece s debt crisis deepened 
On Wall Street  stocks headed for three days of losses  with
U S  banks also pressured by the European debt crisis 
  There s been a flight out of banks  even the stronger
ones   said Colin McLean  managing director at SVM Asset
Management in Edinburgh 
  There s an increasing feeling in the market that some form
of default in Greece is absolutely necessary  Even if they vote
for austerity  they won t necessarily carry it through  
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index  of 50 shares
fell 2 9 percent  it is down nearly 10 percent this year

almost 0 5 percent on the day  Against the Swiss franc
  the euro hit a record low of 1 1841 
 The U S  Dollar Index   a basket of trading partner
currencies  rose 0 1 percent 
 Concerns about the simmering European debt crisis trumped
better than expected data on durable goods orders in the United
States and German sentiment 
 May durable goods orders rose 1 9 percent after dropping
2 7 percent in April  the Commerce Department said  Economists
had expected May s orders to rise 1 5 percent 
 The Munich based Ifo think tank said its business climate
index  based on a monthly survey of some 7 000 firms  rose to
114 5 in June from an originally reported 114 2 in May 
  The market is very jittery today  The economic data is
being pushed to the back burner mainly because there is so much
uncertainty as to whether the Greek government is going to pass
the austerity measures   said Boris Schlossberg  director of FX
research at GFT in New York 
 Greece s parliament is scheduled to vote on the austerity
plan on Wednesday and Thursday  For a timeline see
