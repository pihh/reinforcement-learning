11298,232813,RHI,Why Robert Half  RHI  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  RHI is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-robert-half-rhi-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200440903,200440903

11320,232835,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Robert Half  RHI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This staffing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20  
Revenues are expected to be  1 50 billion  up 7 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Robert Half 
For Robert Half  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Robert Half will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Robert Half would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of  4 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Robert Half doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200407227,200407227

Technologies Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SSNC   Excellent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy NowThe return of volatility with the escalation of global growth concerns and the risk of recession in the United States has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks  This is because dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  zeroing in on the stocks that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase the payout ratio could be some excellent choices   Dividend Growth  A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

11338,232853,RHI,Depend On DuPont Analysis   Pick 5 Top Stocks ,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seem a prudent decision 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen 
Medifast Inc   NYSE MED    This company has a Zacks Rank of 1 and is a leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven healthy living products and programs  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 41    You can see  
Foot Locker Inc    NYSE FL    This company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and is a leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparels  It belongs to a favorably ranked Zacks sector  top 38

11341,232856,RHI,6 Excellent Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"The return of volatility with the escalation of global growth concerns and the risk of recession in the United States has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks  This is because dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  zeroing in on the stocks that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase the payout ratio could be some excellent choices   Dividend Growth  A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1

11342,232857,RHI,Zacks com Featured Expert Kevin Matras Highlights  Medifast  Foot Locker  Comfort Systems  EMCOR And Robert Half International,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   March 29  2019  Stocks in this week s article include Medifast Inc   NYSE MED    Foot Locker Inc    NYSE FL    Comfort Systems USA Inc    NYSE FIX    EMCOR Group Inc    NYSE EME   and Robert Half International Inc    NYSE RHI    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Depend on DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Analysis with These Top 5 Stocks
Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont technique seem a prudent decision 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis

11350,232865,RHI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Robert Half  Virtu  Interpublic  CH Robinson And AXA,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  March 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Robert Half International Inc    NYSE RHI    Virtu Financial  Inc    NASDAQ VIRT    The Interpublic Group of Companies  Inc    NYSE IPG    CH Robinson Worldwide Inc    NASDAQ CHRW   and AXA Equitable Holdings  Inc    NYSE EQH    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  5 Services Stocks Offering Excellent DividendsAmerica s equity market rally seems to be in trouble  After starting the year on a strong note  stocks have been faced with several roadblocks  the latest of which is the ambiguity over trade negotiations  The Dow has been in negative territory since late February and may remain there unless a trade deal comes through However  services stocks continue to present a lucrative opportunity  The primary factor powering the sector at this point is a resilient U S  economy with a strong jobs  market  Incidentally  services provide 80  of all private sector jobs Additionally  several services sector stocks sport strong and stable dividends  This offers investors steady income flows during volatile trading conditions  They also offer diversification across a variety of industries  This is why it makes sense to invest in services stocks at this point    Record Deficit in Goods  Surplus in ServicesFresh data released earlier this month conclusively proves that Trump s protectionist stance has failed to address the U S  trade balance problem  In 2018  the U S  trade deficit in goods touched a record level of  891 billion  This is nearly  100 billion more than the record achieved in 2015 during the Obama era Conversely  the United States runs a massive surplus in services  This amounted to nearly  270 billion in 2018  It comes as no surprise then that services finds no place in the current U S  China trade negotiations Like most mature  developed countries  the United States is essentially a services based economy  Private services make up almost 90  of U S  GDP and account for more than 80  of all the private sector employment generated So essentially  services draw their power from the state of the U S  economy  which at this point has shown great resilience in the face of a global slowdown  And this dynamic makes a very strong case for services Bullish Services Sector Data  Resilient EconomyThe ISM services index increased from 56 7 in January to 59 7 in February  The reading also exceeded the consensus estimate of 57 3 by a significant margin  In effect  the services sector recovered from a lackluster January and expanded for the 109th straight month  Notably  all 18 non manufacturing industries  which make up the sector  experienced expansion And despite talk of a slowdown  the second estimate for fourth quarter GDP revealed that the U S  economy had expanded by 2 6  during this period  This follows an extremely good 2018 for the economy during which it expanded at an annual pace of 3  for the first time since 2005 Further  bolstering the case against a dramatic economic slowdown is the latest data on consumer sentiment  The preliminary reading for the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment gauge increased from 93 8 to 97 8 in March This indicates that the economy has likely successfully recovered from a government shutdown induced slump which caused the gauge to fall to 91 2 in January  its lowest level since October 2016  With the economy in good shape  the case for services becomes even more bullish Our ChoicesThe equity market rally has run into trouble due to uncertainty over the progress of U S  China trade negotiations  which are essentially for a dispute over the flow of goods  However  it is crucial to note that the United States holds a clear edge when it comes to services  Also  services contribute a major chunk of GDP and the lion s share of private sector jobs Further  the U S  economy is in good shape and shows no imminent signs of a slowdown  This is why it makes sense to invest in services sector stocks that also promise strong and stable dividends  This helps to ride out the bumps created by ongoing trade disputes  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM

11357,232872,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Robert Half in Focus
Based in Menlo Park  Robert Half  RHI  is in the Business Services sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of  2 64   The staffing firm is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 31 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 23   This compares to the Staffing Firms industry s yield of 1 26  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 03  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 24 is up 10 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Robert Half has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 49   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Robert Half s current payout ratio is 33   meaning it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
RHI is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 98 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 10 25  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  RHI is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200426079,200426079

11364,232879,RHI,Believe In DuPont Analysis  Tap These 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"If you have to isolateprofit churners from profit burners  return on equity will come across to you as one of the most appropriate metrics  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
But ROE doesn t tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number  If you closely look at the components of ROE  you will be surprised to see that it can be high for the wrong reasons as well  Here comes the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique which helps investors to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 11 stocks that made it through the screen 
Robert Half International Inc     NYSE RHI     This Zacks Rank  1 company is one of the world s largest specialized staffing firms  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 13    You can see

5 Services Stocks Offering Excellent Dividends
America s equity market rally seems to be in trouble  After starting the year on a strong note  stocks have been faced with several roadblocks  the latest of which is the ambiguity over trade negotiations  The Dow has been in negative territory since late February and may remain there unless a trade deal comes through 
However  services stocks continue to present a lucrative opportunity  The primary factor powering the sector at this point is a resilient U S  economy with a strong jobs  market  Incidentally  services provide 80  of all private sector jobs 
Additionally  several services sector stocks sport strong and stable dividends  This offers investors steady income flows during volatile trading conditions  They also offer diversification across a variety of industries  This is why it makes sense to invest in services stocks at this point    
Record Deficit in Goods  Surplus in Services
Fresh data released earlier this month conclusively proves that Trump s protectionist stance has failed to address the U S  trade balance problem  In 2018  the U S  trade deficit in goods touched a record level of  891 billion  This is nearly  100 billion more than the record achieved in 2015 during the Obama era 
Conversely  the United States runs a massive surplus in services  This amounted to nearly  270 billion in 2018  It comes as no surprise then that services finds no place in the current U S  China trade negotiations 
Like most mature  developed countries  the United States is essentially a services based economy  Private services make up almost 90  of U S  GDP and account for more than 80  of all the private sector employment generated 
So essentially  services draw their power from the state of the U S  economy  which at this point has shown great resilience in the face of a global slowdown  And this dynamic makes a very strong case for services 
Bullish Services Sector Data  Resilient Economy
The ISM services index increased from 56 7 in January to 59 7 in February  The reading also exceeded the consensus estimate of 57 3 by a significant margin  In effect  the services sector recovered from a lackluster January and expanded for the 109th straight month  Notably  all 18 non manufacturing industries  which make up the sector  experienced expansion 
And despite talk of a slowdown  the second estimate for fourth quarter GDP revealed that the U S  economy had expanded by 2 6  during this period  This follows an extremely good 2018 for the economy during which it expanded at an annual pace of 3  for the first time since 2005 
Further  bolstering the case against a dramatic economic slowdown is the latest data on consumer sentiment  The preliminary reading for the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment gauge increased from 93 8 to 97 8 in March 
This indicates that the economy has likely successfully recovered from a government shutdown induced slump which caused the gauge to fall to 91 2 in January  its lowest level since October 2016  With the economy in good shape  the case for services becomes even more bullish 
Our Choices
The equity market rally has run into trouble due to uncertainty over the progress of U S  China trade negotiations  which are essentially for a dispute over the flow of goods  However  it is crucial to note that the United States holds a clear edge when it comes to services  Also  services contribute a major chunk of GDP and the lion s share of private sector jobs 
Further  the U S  economy is in good shape and shows no imminent signs of a slowdown  This is why it makes sense to invest in services sector stocks that also promise strong and stable dividends  This helps to ride out the bumps created by ongoing trade disputes  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score

11366,232881,RHI,The election ate their homework  CEOs blame campaign for weakness,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Apparently  Americans are too distracted or distraught by this year s wild presidential campaign to think about getting a dishwasher  buying an RV or opening a doughnut shop  And the topsy turvy race could be crimping furniture sales  hotel bookings and even temporary help hiring  At least that is the word from a clutch of corporate executives in recent weeks who have laid at least some blame for their companies  rocky performances or uneven consumer demand at the feet of constantly bickering White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  Since the start of October  executives from more than 80 U S  companies have made some mention of the U S  election during quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts and investors  based on a Reuters analysis of call transcripts   In many cases  their remarks have come in response to specific questions from call participants about whether the long campaign season has had an impact on results  Some  though  have specifically pointed to the election as a factor in their earnings  including by damping consumer or business spending  For example  appliances maker Whirlpool  N WHR  and coffee and doughnuts chain Dunkin  Brands  O DNKN  have directly blamed the elections as a drag on their business  Shares of both companies fell after their reports  In Whirlpool s case  CEO Jeff Fettig pointed to apparent  temporary softness in industry demand  in the United States in explaining why sales dipped around 0 5 percent from a year earlier  undershooting Wall Street s forecasts   We believe this is due to consumer confidence weakening  primarily due to the focus around the U S  elections   he told analysts on the appliance maker s conference call last month  At Dunkin  Brands  CEO Nigel Travis cited a hesitance by franchise operators to open new stores until they get a grip on how the election outcome will affect regulations and minimum wage laws  Executives at other companies  such as furniture chain Ethan Allen  N ETH   staffing firm Robert Half International  N RHI  and hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide   N HLT   have cited the election as a pressure point as they discussed the business climate   The election  really has impacted customers and clients  It s taken a tremendous amount of attention from especially discretionary budgets   said Farooq Kathwari  chairman  president and CEO of Ethan Allen Interiors  N ETH   DOSE OF SKEPTICISM  But just as voters often take campaign promises with a healthy dose of skepticism  some investors and even a few executives themselves are not taking the talk of risks from the election season seriously   I think companies with underwhelming results are looking for convenient excuses  and the attention being paid by the American public to this election is certainly a timely and readily available excuse   said Michael James  managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles    Whether or not that s true is debatable  I d be taking it with a grain of salt   The vitriolic race between Republican Trump and Democrat Clinton has been tight  and some executives said consumers appeared to be waiting on decisions until Tuesday s Election Day passes    As we near an election date in early November  there s no doubt that I think consumers are  certainly with all discretionary purchases  maybe just taking a look at what s going to happen here in the next couple of months   said Winnebago Industries  N WGO  CEO Michael Happe on the company s conference call last month  His observation came even as motorhome maker Winnebago s sales and earnings for the quarter ended in late August topped Wall Street estimates  Hilton  meanwhile  cut its outlook for a key revenue metric  citing weak business travel   This cycle of election     I think it s been an unusual cycle and as a consequence I think it has slowed down the economy probably more dramatically than I ve seen certainly in my adult life   Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on a conference call last month   Evercore ISI analyst Rich Hightower  who covers lodging companies including Hilton  said the election was a  relevant  point for executives to bring up  but he was not factoring any election impact into his financial forecasts  U S  consumer spending did fall in both August and September  the latest government data showed  and a key gauge of retail sales has posted a decline of around 0 1 percent on average over the three months through September  Still  Paul Nolte  portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago  questioned whether the campaign was having an effect on consumer behavior    I can t imagine it s created a kind of catatonic state for consumers to stop buying   said Nolte  And some C suite denizens have no patience for such excuses  Patrick McHale  CEO of pumps and spray equipment maker Graco  N GGG   told his conference call listeners he had not heard of  a single customer  holding off on an investment because of the election  McHale continued   In fact  if I heard somebody at Graco tell me that they were going to make an investment in something but they weren t because they want to see what was going to happen with the election  I d probably fire them

11383,232898,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  To Report Q2 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Robert Half  RHI  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This staffing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 52 billion  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Robert Half 
For Robert Half  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Robert Half will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Robert Half would post earnings of  0 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 93  delivering a surprise of  3 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Robert Half doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-to-report-q2-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440160,200440160

	A lot of traders decided to extend the President s Day weekend  as Tuesday s session was pretty quiet  The major indices started the day on the negative side  but managed slight gains by the closing bell despite slipping in the final hour 
	The NASDAQ was up 0 19  to 7486 77  while the S P advanced 0 15  to 2779 76  The Dow held onto the plus side by its fingernails with an increase of only 0 03  to 25 891 32 
	Trade issues promise to be another big factor this week  President Trump reiterated that the March 1 deadline could be extended if the U S  and China keep making progress  The meetings last week in Beijing provided some positive headlines  which hopefully will continue as the talks pick up again this week in Washington 
	Of course  the most positive headline would be an actual trade deal 
	Last week  the Dow and NASDAQ easily completed an 8th straight week in the green  while the S P finished its third straight week higher and its 7th in the past 8  The market expects some sort of trade deal  and soon  The good vibes last week and the continuation of talks this week is keeping sentiment positive for now   The market is pricing this  trade  deal in  so make no mistake that if talks break down the market will too  So  as we get closer to a deal over the next week or month  we will likely remain stuck between 2750 and 2800 in the S P until we receive more clarity   said Jeremy in Counterstrike 
	Meanwhile  retail colossus Walmart  NYSE WMT  had an amazing holiday quarter with earnings and revenue that beat expectations  Also  e commerce sales surged more than 40   Shares were up 2 2  today

11411,232926,RHI,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Robert Half  RHI ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Robert Half  RHI   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Robert Half currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if RHI is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this staffing firm holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For RHI  shares are up 5 65  over the past week while the Zacks Staffing Firms industry is up 5 63  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 12 87  compares favorably with the industry s 11 2  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Robert Half have risen 12 29   and are up 19 76  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 88  and 3 76   respectively 
Investors should also take note of RHI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  RHI is averaging 1 134 606 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with RHI 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost RHI s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 93 to  4 08 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that RHI is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Robert Half on your short list ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-robert-half-rhi-200390069,200390069

11415,232930,RHI,3 Reasons Why Robert Half  RHI  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Robert Half  RHI  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this staffing firm a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Robert Half is 9 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 13  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 12 7  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Robert Half has an S TA ratio of 2 99  which means that the company gets  2 99 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 2 33  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Robert Half is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 2  this year versus the industry average of 4 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Robert Half  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Robert Half has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

 Return on equity is one of the most sought after metrics used by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis

11417,232932,RHI,Verisk  VRSK  Rides On Organic Growth   Buyouts  Debt High,opinion,"Verisk Analytics  Inc    NASDAQ VRSK   looks strong on the back of its predictive data analytics portfolio  The company continues to grow with the help of acquisitions and organic growth 
The company s fourth quarter 2018 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same  Adjusted earnings of  1 04 per share missed the consensus estimate by 2 cents and declined 21 8  on a year over year basis  Quarterly revenues of  613 9 million beat the consensus mark by  4 million and improved 7 7  year over year on a reported basis  The figure improved 5 4  year over year on an organic constant currency  cc  basis 
Verisk has an impressive earnings surprise history  having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters  It delivered average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 1 3  
What s Driving Verisk Analytics 
Verisk s expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect and interpret different types of data sets is impressive  The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing to serve customers in areas of rating  underwriting  claims  catastrophe and weather risk  natural resources intelligence and economic forecasting  Its efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying client demands and its technical prowess in analytics and Big Data provide Verisk an edge over its competitors 
Higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions  cross sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions will help Verisk create long term value  In 2018  total revenues grew 6 5  organically and 6 1  on an organic constant currency basis  This marks an improvement from 2017 when total revenues grew 4 5  organically and 5 3  on an organic constant currency basis 
Moreover  Verisk continues to earn a major portion of its revenues from subscriptions and long term agreements  In 2018  Verisk s three reportable segments  Insurance  Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 82   78  and 73  of revenues from subscriptions and long term agreements for its solutions 
Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk  The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries  In 2018  the company acquired four companies   Rulebook on Dec 14  Validus IVC Limited on Jun 20  Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5  While Rulebook should solidify Verisk s position in the global insurance market  the buyout of Validus will help improve and automate the claims settlement process  The other two acquisitions will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making 
Risks
Verisk s balance sheet is highly leveraged  As of Dec 31  2018  long term debt was  2 05 billion while cash and cash equivalents were  139 5 million  Such a cash position implies that Verisk needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt  Also  high debt may limit the company s future expansion and worsen its risk profile 
Since Verisk s business model centers on huge amount of data  it remains susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches at its facilities  computer networks  and databases  resulting in loss of its credibility and or customers  Dependence on external sources for data supply can lead to contractual and pricing issues with data suppliers  some of them are also its rivals  
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Currently  Verisk carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Some better ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Omnicom   NYSE OMC    Robert Half   NYSE RHI   and Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP    all carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Long term expected EPS  three to five years  growth rate for Omnicom  Robert Half and Automatic Data Processing is 6 9   8 4  and 12 8   respectively

quarter 2019  Waste Management delivered only an earnings beat  Rollins and Robert Half s bottom line matched the consensus mark in the quarter  IHS Markit delivered an earnings beat in third quarter fiscal 2019 A look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that business services sector s earnings recorded an increase of 9 6  year over year  while revenues inched up 4 3   In the third quarter  revenues are expected to scale up 11 2   while overall earnings are projected to increase 11 3  year over year  per the latest  Business Services Sector in Good Shape Owing to its widely diversified nature  the business services sector has been benefiting from economic strength and stability  which is likely to have kept service activities in good shape in the third quarter  The sector was buoyed

Bureau of Economic Analysis  The Fed expects GDP growth of 2 2  in the third quarter and 2 1  in 2019  September was the 116th month of consecutive growth in non manufacturing activities with ISM measured Non Manufacturing Index touching 52 6 Since business services firms have lower foreign exposure compared with goods companies  the industry is likely to have been less affected by trade war in the third quarter The buoyancy in the sector is further confirmed by its Zacks Sector Rank in the top 32   5 out of 16 sectors   Additionally  we observe that the sector has performed well so far

11429,232944,RHI,Scared Of Volatility  5 DuPont Tested  Top Quality Picks,opinion,"With the global markets on a volatile ride thanks to still strong U S  China trade tensions  no concrete resolution of the U S  budget deal and global growth worries  quality stocks are investors  natural choice 
There are plenty of criteria or metrics that can lead investors to quality stocks  Among these return on equity  ROE  is one of the most coveted ones  That said  we would like to note that the basic ROE calculation doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get misled by picking stocks based on this number  
Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 14 stocks that made it through the screen

11433,232948,RHI,All You Need To Know About Robert Half  RHI  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Robert Half  RHI  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Robert Half is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Robert Half  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Robert Half
For the fiscal year ending December 2019  this staffing firm is expected to earn  4 01 per share  which is a change of 11 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Robert Half  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Robert Half to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-robert-half-rhi-rating-upgrade-to-buy-200381855,200381855
11434,232949,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Robert Half  RHI   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Robert Half currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if RHI is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this staffing firm holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For RHI  shares are up 0 2  over the past week while the Zacks Staffing Firms industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 15 3  compares favorably with the industry s 12 92  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Robert Half have increased 1 16  over the past quarter  and have gained 12 63  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 0 42  and  3 13   respectively 
Investors should also take note of RHI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  RHI is averaging 1 129 788 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with RHI 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost RHI s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 93 to  4 01 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that RHI is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Robert Half on your short list ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200382114,200382114

Transportation and delivery companies increased staffing by 27 000 and retailers beefed up payrolls by 21 000 following a year when the sector added 26 000 new jobs  Professional and business services too were up 30 000 and manufacturing organizations added 13 000 new jobs  reaching the sector s 12 month total to 261 000 However  it was the leisure and hospitality sector that singlehandedly led the way in hiring by boosting employment by 42 000  Such a hiring spree indicated that those who are into the arts and entertainment  hotels and food businesses are in an expansion mode and their

100th straight month  Hiring boomed despite a partial government shutdown that was the longest in history  dismissing fears of a major slowdown for the U S  economy  Let us  thus  look at stocks that can make the most of a stellar jobs report and scale north Hiring Continues at Blistering PaceThe U S  economy continues to be one of the world s most powerful employment generating machines  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 304 000 new jobs last October  exceeding analysts  estimates of around 172 000 December s job additions  in the meanwhile  were revised down from 312 000 jobs to 222 000  while November s rose from 176 000 to 196 000  Nonetheless  the average for the last three months is now 241 000 jobs  marking one of the best stretches during an economic expansion dating back nine and a half years ago  By the way  employment gains in 2018 turned out to be the strongest in the last three years The jobless rate  in the meantime  ticked up to 4  from 3 9   However  it continues to languish at historically low levels  Further  a higher jobless rate was mostly due to the government shutdown  but it had  no discernible impacts  on the uptick in hiring last month  added the Labor Department A separate measure of employment that considers discouraged workers and those holding part time positions for economic reasons went up to 8 1  from 7 6   But  that s still well below the 9 3  level when President Trump took office Staffing to ShineSuch a strong month of hiring has resulted in the labor force participation rate to increase to 63 1   the highest in Trump s era  This surely bodes well for staffing companies  Additionally  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index was 111 61 last December  up from 110 23 in November  Compared to the year ago level  the index shows a jump of 5 4   Gad Levanon  Chief Economist  North America  at The Conference Board said that  the Employment Trends Index rose sharply in December  reversing the

workers  Transportation and delivery companies increased staffing by 27 000 and retailers beefed up payrolls by 21 000 following a year when the sector added 26 000 new jobs  Professional and business services too were up 30 000 and manufacturing organizations added 13 000 new jobs  reaching the sector s 12 month total to 261 000 However  it was the leisure and hospitality sector that singlehandedly led the way in hiring by boosting employment by 42 000  Such a hiring spree indicated that those who are into the arts and entertainment  hotels and food businesses are in an expansion

11437,232952,RHI,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Robert Half  RHI ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Robert Half  RHI  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this staffing firm a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Robert Half is 9 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 13  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 12 4  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Robert Half has an S TA ratio of 2 97  which means that the company gets  2 97 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 2 31  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Robert Half looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 2  this year versus the industry average of 6 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Robert Half  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Robert Half a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

longest streak since 1969  The average level of jobless claims continues to hover just over the 200 000 mark  which was last seen in the early 1970s Moreover  the U S  labor market has been witnessing

currency growth of 7  in 2018 and 6  in 2019 by Staffing Industry Analysts  SIA   stands to gain Labor Market Still TightWhile the economy continues to create new jobs despite the 18 year low jobless

11488,233003,RHI,6 Business Services Stocks To Keep Trade War Fears At Bay,opinion,While a steady U S  economy and President Trump s reformative announcements are acting as tailwinds for the markets  heightened tensions related to trade war remain a major concern Fears of a trade war between the United States and its trading partners have been around since March  It all started with Trump s announcement of imposing 25  tariff on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports on America s biggest allies    European Union  Canada and Mexico America s trading partners retaliated by targeting its products worth billions of dollars  The European Union intends to hit back with higher tariffs on roughly  7 5 billion worth of U S  exports and file a legal notice against American measures at the World Trade Organization  Canada s retaliatory tariffs on  12 8 billion worth of U S  exports will be effective from Jul 1  Mexico is also set to impose a 20  tariff on U S  pork and ham imports in response to Trump s steel and aluminum import levies  per Reuters Relations between China and United States have been tensed for a while  with the latter announcing a hefty 25  tariff on  50 billion worth of Chinese goods  The final list of Chinese goods subject to new import taxes is expected to be announced tomorrow  Trump also plans to restrict Chinese investment in U S  companies and limit the number of goods that these companies can sell to China  China retaliated by announcing tariffs on U S  goods  including soybeans  aircraft and vehicles  worth  50 billion Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions  the Trump administration initiated a national security investigation into whether automobile imports are harming U S  national security  The investigation  under Section 232  is the same tactic used by the Trump administration before it imposed global tariffs on steel and aluminum import earlier this year  The public hearings for the aforesaid investigation into auto imports is expected to be held around Jul 19 20 Given these developments  tensions over trade policy are most likely to escalate again in the coming months  All these events are hinting toward a global trade war What s Going in Favor of the Business Services Sector  As tensions over trade policy intensify  the business services sector stands to gain from the growing U S  economy  This is because it is firmly tied to manufacturing and non manufacturing activities that are currently benefiting from the all round strength in the economy  The sector has recorded the highest jobs  with an addition of 483 000 jobs in the past 12 months In May  the sector added 31 000 jobs  the second highest among all sectors Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in May as PMI measured by Institute of Supply Management  ISM  touched 58 7   This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 21st consecutive month  driven by continued increase in new orders  production activity and employment  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  16 reported growth in May As far as the non manufacturing sector is concerned  NMI was 58 6  in May  recording the 100th consecutive month of expansion  This expansion was driven by continued increase in business activity  new orders  employment  inventories  prices and supplier deliveries  Out of the 18 non manufacturing industries  14 reported growth Although U S  economic growth decelerated in the first quarter to an annualized pace of 2 2   after averaging higher than 3  in the previous three quarters  the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters  Income tax cuts along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3  target Additionally  the current 18 year low unemployment rate of 3 8  recorded in the month of May further raises optimism about the economy 6 Stocks to Secure Your Portfolio Amid Trade War TensionsGiven the promising developments in the business service sector

11489,233004,RHI,Cash In On DuPont Analysis  Buy 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"If you have to isolate profit churners from profit burners  return on equity will come across to you as one of the most appropriate metrics  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
But ROE doesn t tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number  If you closely look at the components of ROE  you will be surprised to see that it can be high for the wrong reasons as well  Here comes the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique which helps investors to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen 
Medifast Inc   NYSE MED    The company is a leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven healthy living products and programs  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

and Duluth Holdings Inc    NASDAQ DLTH   Play 5 Top Ranked Stocks Picked on DuPont  NYSE DWDP  AnalysisReturn on equity is one of the most coveted metrics by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis For the rest

11528,233043,RHI,Business Services Industry Stock Outlook   January 2018,opinion,"The economic backdrop exhibits signs of improvement with the rise in GDP  a better employment scenario  inflation approaching 2   easing of the U S  dollar and momentum gained by oil prices   The outlook for business services sector moves in line with the broader economy  Significantly  the business friendly orientation of the current administration is widely expected to give the U S  economy a nudge of growth   The business services sector includes companies that provide ancillary services to other industries in the market  Companies from this sector help other firms focus on their core competencies  helping them benefit from operating efficiencies  Many of these functions fall within otherwise ancillary areas for most companies    for example  payroll processing  staffing  marketing advertising and information technology  to name some of the major areas  Gradual improvement in interest rate environment points toward improving economic conditions  The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1 25 1 50   Retaining this optimism  outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018 The Fed also provided an optimistic employment outlook  Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to be 3 9  for both 2018 and 2019 and 4  in 2020 
President Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22  2017  The tax reform policy  an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years  lowers the corporate tax burden to 21  from 35   This move is likely to act as an impetus  
Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters  GDP growth is now expected to accelerate 2 4  in 2018 and 2019  better than 2 3  in 2017  This favorable outlook for the U S  economy is a net positive for the business service sector as well  No doubt the Zacks Business Services sector has been a strong performer  gaining 20 9  in a year  outperforming the S P 500 index s 18 2  gain  
The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain profitability  Focus on functions and activities in line with core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale  as well as improving competitive positioning  
Economic sensitivity aside  business service companies are quite conservatively managed  with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks  Another attribute of the sector is its highly fragmented nature  with no single service provider enjoying market dominance  Per business reports  the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25  to the sector s total revenue  
Stand Alone Zacks Sector  Favorable Given the group s unique nature  Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors  the S P s official GIC classification has only 11 sectors where business services are grouped within the  Industrials  sector   Notably  with about 3 8  of total market capitalization  the sector generated 3 1  of the total S P 500 income in 2017  
This industry offers an array of services that include marketing  consulting  staffing  security  telecommunications  Internet services  logistics and waste handling  In its expanded sense  the U S  business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about  620 billion  though many of these companies do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry  
Within the Zacks Industry classification  we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium  M level  and 265 industries at the expanded  X level   We rank all 265 X level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available in the   
We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries into two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one  To learn more visit     
Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks   the core of our Industry Rank   has an impressive track record  verified by outside auditors  to foretell stock prices  in particular over the short term  one to three months   We have eight X level industries within the Business Services sector  namely Auction Valuation Services  Business Information Services  Business Services  Consulting  Financial Transaction Services  Outsourcing  Staffing and Waste Removal Services  
Staffing at  59  Business Information Services at  65  Auction Valuation Services at  68  Waste Removal at  88 and Outsourcing at  108 all fall in the top half 
Financial Transaction Services at  148  Business Services at  171 and Consulting at  234 are the industries that fall in the bottom half 
Our top picks from the Outsourcing industries are ExlService Holdings  Inc   EXLS  and The Brink s Co   BCO   both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   
Heidrick   Struggles International  Inc   HSII   On Assignment  Inc   ASGN  and Robert Half International Inc  NYSE RHI    RHI   carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   are our top picks from the Staffing industry  You can see

Valuation of the Sector
The valuation of the business service sector seems attractive relative to its own history as well as the broader S P 500 index 
The Zacks Business Service sector is currently trading at a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 11 2X  Over the last five years  the sector has traded as low as 9 2X and as high as 11 2X with a median of 10X  In other words  the sector is currently trading at the high end of its five year range and higher than median on a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA basis  
On a forward 12 month EPS basis  the sector trades at 21 8X  comparing with the five year range of 19 1X and 21 8X and a median of 20 3X  In other words  the sector is trading toward the high end of its five year forward 12 month P E range as well as its median  
The sector is trading at a discount to the S P 500 index on the trailing 12 month EV EBITDA basis  The sector modestly underperformed the S P 500 index in a year s time  While the sector has gained 21 3   the index has rallied 23 2    Earnings Outlook Companies have already started reporting fourth quarter earnings  While earnings are expected to be improving 5 4   revenues will grow 4 8   Both compare unfavorably with the S P 500 index  For 2017  earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 9 4  on 3 7  revenue growth compared with the S P 500 index s earnings growth of 7 5  on back of 5 2  top line growth   For 2018  earnings for the business service sector are estimated to increase 12  on 6 4  revenue growth  This compares unfavorably with the S P 500 index s expected earnings increase of 13 7  but favorably with 5 1  higher revenues from 2017 
The graph below shows year over year bottom line growth of the Business Services sector in comparison to the S P 500

11533,233048,RHI,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Robert Half  RHI  Stock ,opinion,Shares of Robert Half International   NYSE RHI   have returned 15 2  in the past six months  significantly outperforming the  s growth of 14 7   The stock also looks good when compared with the market at large  as the S P 500 index has gained 10  in the said time frame Let s discuss the company s performance and operations briefly to see why investors should hold on to this stock for now in spite of the adversities it faces What s Going in its Favor The company s international presence has paid off in terms of top line growth  Robert Half enjoys increasing demand for its professional staffing services  We note that Robert Half s currency neutral staffing revenues from international regions increased 15  to  269 million in fourth quarter 2017  while the same at Protiviti rose 23  to  41 million Considering lower U S  unemployment levels  which indicate that companies are increasingly adding jobs  the demand for professional staffing services continues to be on the rise  Evidently  Global Staffing U S  revenues climbed 2  to  863 million in fourth quarter 2017 Management has provided an insight into the trends  Temporary and consulting staffing revenues grew 3 3  in the first two weeks of January  For the first three weeks of January  revenues from permanent placement division advanced 11 9  year over year We appreciate the company s shareholder friendly moves of dividend payments and share buybacks  In fourth quarter 2017  Robert Half bought back 1 1 million shares for  59 million  On Feb 13  2018  the company s board of directors further approved the repurchase of an additional 10 million shares of the company s common stock  Apart from this  the company has approximately 2 3 million shares under its existing share repurchase plan  Moreover  the company also approved a dividend hike from 24 cents per share to 28 cents per share  The cash dividend was paid on Mar 15  2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb 23  2018 Backed by broad based growth across all segments and regions  with permanent placement being the outperformer  the company reported solid fourth quarter 2017 results  wherein both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate Going forward  reduced tax rates will likely lead to greater retention of profits  which will help the company allocate more funds toward corporate reformation and development efforts  Investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure should boost the company s growth opportunities Upward Estimate Revisions  Zacks Rank   Style ScoreThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock  Over the last 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings increased 10 6  to 73 cents per share  Full year 2018 earnings estimates increased 12 5  to  3 23 per share in the same time frame Further  current quarter and full year 2018 sales are estimated to rise 5 5  and 5 8   respectively The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  You can see  Additionally  the stock s of B highlights its short term attractiveness  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three scores Despite the positives  we remain concerned about the following risks DownsidesThe company faces stiff competition from many other firms in the staffing space   on a national  regional and local level   mainly in terms of pricing and reliability of services  Extensive international presence increases the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks  This might affect its top line  Apart from this  the company also remains vulnerable to political  regulatory and legal risks Higher operating expenses are another major headwind  Robert Half s SG A expenses increased 7 6  to  424 4 million in fourth quarter 2017  mainly due to higher staffing costs  This also weighed on the company s operating margin that contracted 30 basis points to 9 6  Unfavorable MetricsConsidering price to earnings  P E  ratio  Robert Half looks pretty overvalued when compared with the industry  The stock has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 22 75  On the contrary  the trailing 12 month P E ratio for the industry is 20 16  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks from the same space include ManpowerGroup   NYSE MAN    Kforce Inc    NASDAQ KFRC   and Korn Ferry International   NYSE KFY    All the stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank  1 Sales for ManpowerGroup  Kforce and Korn Ferry are estimated to rise 13   3 4  and 11 9   respectively  for the current

11544,233059,RHI,5 Top Ranked Stocks To Pick On DuPont Theory ,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  is one of the most favored metrics of investors  It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity  Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock 
However  stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns  Here is where DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis comes into play It is an analytical method  which examines three major elements  namely operating management  management of assets and capital structure to find out the financial condition of a company  Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one cannot brush off the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always portray a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies with higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margins compared with retail goods  which rely on a higher turnover 
And one of the ROE components   equity multiplier  explained below    can help you judge how burdened a company is with debts  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at a company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 14 stocks that made it through the screen

11558,233073,RHI,Does Robert Half  RHI  Look To Be A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Robert Half International Inc    NYSE RHI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Robert Half has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 32  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 19  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Robert Half s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Business Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 73  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Robert Half has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 22  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Robert Half stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Robert Half has a P S ratio of about 1 11  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  RHI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Robert Half currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Robert Half a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Robert Half is just 1 15  lower than the industry average of 1 22  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RHI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Robert Half might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives RHI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 7 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Robert Half International Inc  Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRobert Half is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past five years  the Zacks Business Service industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and

11568,233083,RHI,Can Robert Half  RHI  Spring A Surprise In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Robert Half International  Inc    NYSE RHI   is set to report second quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 25  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this global staffing firm will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company posted an average earnings surprise of 0 23  in the trailing four quarters 
A glimpse of Robert Half s stock performance shows that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader  sector for the last six months  The stock dipped 0 4  against the above mentioned industry s growth of 10 8  and sector s improvement of 8 7   Notably  the industry is part of the top 18  of the Zacks Classified industries  49 out of the 256   while the broader sector is placed at bottom 25  of the Zacks Classified sectors  12 out of 16  

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter and 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents per share for the second quarter and  2 66 per share for 2017 reflects a year over year decrease of 7 9  and 0 2   respectively  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 31 billion for the said quarter  down 2 4  from the year ago period  For 2017  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  5 22 billion  down 0 6  year over year Robert Half International Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Robert Halfis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Robert Half has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 65 cents  Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Robert Half is the world s largest specialized provider of temporary and permanent personnel in the fields of accounting and finance  Robert Half s total revenue has been improving on the back of higher demand for its professional staffing and consulting services  The company s international operations also improved due to higher demand for staffing and consulting services 
Moreover  Protiviti is also adding to the year over year revenue gains  which seem to be quite encouraging  Further  Protiviti has an impressive growth outlook due to a robust regulatory environment as well as increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures 
However  lower margins  currency fluctuations and rising health care costs remain the major concerns for Robert Half  In fact  lower margins  especially at Protiviti  are expected to take a toll on Robert Half s profits 
We note that the company s sales have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters due to a decline in the U S  staffing revenues  Currency headwinds are also denting sales 
Nevertheless  Robert Half remains confident of performing well given the solid labor market and stable economic landscape  Also  it expects reduction in the hiring cycle and in turn boosting the company s profitability  Further  Protiviti is enhancing its practice areas owing to digital expansion and data security measures 
Robert Half issued its earnings and sales guidance for second quarter 2017  The company expects revenues in the range of  1 275  1 335 billion for the said quarter  In addition  it expects earnings in the range of 61 67 cents per share 
Stocks Poised to Beat Estimates
Stocks in the business services sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  and are therefore worth considering include 
S P Global Inc    NYSE SPGI   with an Earnings ESP of  2 58  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
ManpowerGroup   NYSE MAN   with an Earnings ESP of  1 16  and a Zacks Rank  2

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement ROBT HALF INTL Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Consider
Estimates have been going down ahead of the second quarter earnings release  which might be due to macro economic pressures  Though Robert Half has been witnessing strong year over year earnings growth since the past many quarters driven by solid demand for services provided by skilled professionals as well as a growing labor market in the U S   the company cannot escape from currency fluctuations  Also  the company is expected to incur higher costs in the near term  In view of the rising demand for skilled professionals  Robert Half revealed that it is expected to increase salaries for professional occupations by an average of 4 1  in 2016  which will also increase its costs

11594,233109,RHI,What One Company Is Telling Us About The State Of The Economy,opinion,"Robert Half International Inc  NYSE RHI  is the largest staffing company in the country  It s business and stock price are thus very good real time indicators of what s going on in the broader jobs market and the economy  unlike the many lagging indicators economists like to focus on  A couple of weeks ago I  the chart below  There is just a massive gap between the broader stock market via S P 500  hope   and Robert Half s stock price  reality   right now 


Didn t get the lift we usually do in September and October
 Now  on the pace of deceleration  I d say that July  we actually ended July stronger than we began it  we were encouraged by that  August wasn t bad  But then September  where we usually start getting a sequential lift in September  we didn t see the lift we typically get  instead  it was sequentially about flat  And then again  traditionally we get even more lift yet again in October and we didn t see that lift either  So it s essentially sequential flattening starting in July  rather than the lift we typically see in September and early October  
Saw more softness in the accounting operations which would be consistent with softness in macro
 Well  I d say Accountemps we saw more softness in the accounting operations positions and those are the ones that are typically more client demand sensitive  more client volume sensitive  So it s consistent that if you were to see softness in accounting due to macro conditions you d see it in accounting operations  

All in all it sounds like this company is sending up a pretty clear warning for the economy and the markets right now ",2016-11-01,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-economic-flag-is-flying-at-half-mast-200161841,200161841
11597,233112,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  Q1 Earnings  Will It Beat Estimates ,opinion,"Robert Half International  Inc   NYSE RHI   is set to report first quarter 2016 results after the market closes on Apr 28  Last quarter  this global staffing firm posted positive earnings surprise of 1 43  
In fact  Robert Half has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters and in line earnings in one  making for an average positive surprise of 1 18  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Robert Half is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components 
Zacks ESP  The   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 56   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Robert Half has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Meanwhile  the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  
The combination of Robert Half s Zacks Rank  3 and  1 56  ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Strong revenue growth boosted by broad based and increasing demand for the company s professional staffing services  particularly in the U S  have proved to be Robert Half s strength for the past four years  Also  the company s earnings have grown in double digits for 23 consecutive quarters on a year over year basis  driven by growing demand for skilled workforce and consulting services 
In the first quarter  Robert Half expects revenues in the range of  1 270  1 330 billion  representing an increase of 5  10  from  1 21 billion on a reported basis  The company expects earnings in the range of 61   67 cents per share  which implies a growth rate of 5 2  15 5  from the year ago earnings of 58 cents per share 
Robert Half s subsidiary Protiviti is one of the key drivers of revenues and operating performance  It helps companies solve problems in finance  technology  operations  governance  risk and internal audit  The company expects the momentum to continue in the soon to be reported quarter with an improving economy  The company s international operations have also improved over time  particularly driven by higher demand for staffing and consulting services 
However  fluctuations in currency values have an adverse impact on the profitability of the company  as Robert Half derives a considerable portion of its revenues from foreign countries 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other consumer staple companies that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

11601,233116,RHI,Company Notes Digest  Construction And Labor Are Back,opinion,"The Macro Outlook  Callouts from Earnings Reports 
Construction  Is  Back 
 for construction  North America has been an area of strength and you might be surprised to hear so is our EAME region particularly Europe in the second quarter  it s been better as well   Caterpillar Inc  NYSE CAT  
 we re finally seeing activity in terms of builders coming back in for a call down of lines for development of lots  there s a dearth of lots out there now which we kind of projected was coming in and that s happening so we re seeing lot developments  And pure construction lending by some of our local strong builders that survive the crisis not that many did  but once it is survive a very strong and so it s fairly broad based  for all I say and frankly I think it s got legs for a good while to go    BB T Corporation  NYSE BBT  
 in certain pockets of the country  there are areas where the economy is zooming  And let me give you an example  Miami is booming right now  There s all kinds of construction  There s no glut of condos anymore  All of that has been absorbed and there s 50 condo towers being built in Miami alone  That said  that s not indicative of every place    Brown   Brown Inc  NYSE BRO  
 construction products shipments were up 15  as demand for aggregates and cement continue to be strong  particularly in Texas and California    Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP  
 we continue to see an uptick in new construction with about 54  of our mix being in new construction in 2014 versus just 43  last year during 2013  and that s helping our real estate team to find attractive new locations    Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  NYSE CMG  
Labor is back too
 The demand for skilled talent continues to outpace the supply in many of our specialty areas we saw greater demand for our professional staffing and recruitment services in the second quarter  This was the case among our small and midsize clients  in particular    Robert Half International Inc  NYSE RHI  
 what we re basically saying is fairly high hiring numbers  fairly high attrition rate     It s primarily retirements      and the net number will ultimately be driven by what the volume ends up being because we still squeeze out and expect to squeeze out productivity  But it s a high class problem for us as volume grows for us to continue to increase our hiring levels   UNP 
Beginning to see some wage inflation
 So the good news on Bill rates is that whereas last quarter bill rates were up 2 6  year over year  this quarter bill rates are up 3 5  year over year  So we are beginning to see some wage inflation    RHI 
 I d say on the labor side and our land still continues to be a benefit because we were early movers and in terms of our stick and brick costs we are seeing some pressure on the material side  But more so on the labor side its specifically in those local markets where we ve seen pretty good growth in volumes    DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  
Demand for loans is booming
 We are constraining loan growth in some cases by self imposed risk concentration limits particularly on some types of commercial real estate loans  If we did not have these risk management limits  but we do  loan growth rates would be stronger as there is demand out there    Zions Bancorporation  NASDAQ ZION  
 this was a very good loan growth quarter  We indicated that we re optimistic about pipeline and things that we see  But I want to be careful about sort of taking this quarter and extrapolating it long term  because it was a very  very particularly good quarter    SunTrust Banks Inc  NYSE STI  
Florida tourism is going  gang busters 
 All the data we see on Florida and the time I spent there is positive  Tourism industry is sort of going gang busters  Net in migration back in to the state at a pretty high clip    STI 
Even Cash America says that its pawn loan customers are feeling much better
 consumers are feeling better about the economic environment that they re in with respect to a similar employment situation and the overall economic prospects for them  We re seeing them back borrowing money at a higher rate than we ve experienced for the last couple of years  And they re also spending with us at higher rates than we ve seen for the last couple of years  So you really can t conclude much other than the fact that people are feeling better about their economic situation    Cash America International  NYSE CSH  
CEOs seem to be increasingly confident that things could stay good for a while
 If you look at the last three quarters  year over year we were up 1 7  then we were up 2 6  and now we re up 3 5   so its clearly going into right direction  but it still below the sweet spot that we ve experienced in the past and when we ve gotten to that sweet spot in the past  we stayed there four  five years    RHI 
 we ve had a few years of improvement in North American construction  This has been actually a pretty decent year  But even through all of that  we are still thinking this year is kind of unit basis  we are still thinking this year is going to be sort of 15  to 20  below the  06 peak  So there is still a lot of room I think to run in construction in North America    CAT 
 the lodging sector is hitting record occupancy but the U S  economy overall is showing no signs of overheating  This is very good news for us  It means that in this cycle we could enjoy full hotels and rising rates for some time before the rest of the economy catches up with lodging   Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  
 We see this protracted spotty recovery as beneficial to us  A growing economy is critical to our success  However too fast and heated is not helpful because it dictates unhealthy behavior from companies who are bloating their hiring doing things in an irrational way and clearly a much more heated recovery flings out a lot faster at a much faster rate    ManpowerGroup  NYSE MAN  
 we don t believe we are at a peak of cycle at all    DHI 
Chinese construction is weak though
 construction sales in Asia Pacific were down slightly and that includes weaker sales in China  Now in China we started the year 2014 with the improving construction equipment demand but over the second quarter it weakened a bit    CAT 
Retail is still slow too
 Well  look  the fact is the consumer generally is still very cautious and we see that across the board  There is no denying that  from   as you know  a number of retailers  both low and medium and even high end  are all seeing somewhat of a cautious consumer  And that s certainly is affecting retail sales in our properties    Simon Property Group Inc  NYSE SPG  
Retail may be a red herring though  These aren t really important months for retail
 I would say mall traffic is generally flat  the summer months are not big until late July and August because they re back to school  June is not an important month  Early part of July is not  So we ll see what happens    SPG 
Geopolitics really only affects Energy  however  even there  there are positives with the negatives 
 we are seeing delays in getting contract approvals through the  Iraqi  government  but  I have to believe that rights itself over a period as long as two years because of the importance of hydrocarbons in that markets and to the government et cetera    Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  
 Well it s interesting in Europe  we have actually seen an increase in our activity level and looking at unconventional plays  we ve done some work here just in the quarter in Germany  revisited some work in Poland  So I think that the geopolitical climate may be precipitating a relook at some of these unconventional plays  especially those tied to natural gas  So early days for that  but we do have some indication that some of the operating companies are looking at that pretty hard again    Core Laboratories  NYSE CLB  
Still  companies are trying to stay nimble
 in the conversations with the companies that I had  I can tell that they are facing incredible pressures to become more agile in their workforces   MAN 
 we ve tried to do with our cost structure as you say make it more flexible and that means being able to take out costs when volume goes down and add cost when volume comes back in other words  try to make more of the cost structure as variable as we can    CAT 
Financials
Retail investors aren t trading much  but they re still engaged
 even though we ve seen trades come down retail logins are essentially flat  and so people are still engaged  but they just haven t been trading as much    TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation  NYSE AMTD  
And where they are engaged  they have a bullish bias
 we haven t seen any change in the new clients coming in  but what we are seeing is our existing clients are definitely moving into the market with the improvement in the market and their attitudes   AMTD 
Investment Advisors definitely have their clients fully invested
 there s no question that the RIA s have their client s investments pretty much fully invested here and are keeping very little in cash  So we are definitely seeing and I would say relative to history  the RIA channel is more fully invested than the retail channel on a relative basis  even though retail will normally keep a lot more in cash    AMTD 
TD Ameritrade s CEO has a hard time believing that when QE ends there s not going to be more volatility
 whenever  QE  starts to come out  I have a hard time believing we are not going to see volatility  given how much stimulus we ve had and the longer term nature of it   AMTD 
Non performing assets may finally be clearing off of bank balance sheets
 I would point out though that while we may see a bit more of the cloud  we probably have kind of a base floor or normal level of NPAs  Now when you kind of get down to the bottom  you have a certain amount of natural flow  So I don t consider NPA to be a storyline at this point  They just tell you  it s kind of be what they re going to be in the normal operations as we go forward    BBT 
 Non performing assets improved by about 14  from the prior quarter and equaled 95 basis points of loans and REO the first time it s fallen below 1  since 2007    ZION 
We may have seen the bottom for Net Interest Margins
 if you assume that rates don t fall anymore from where they are today  I do think NIMs will start to stabilize in 2015    STI 
The Commercial lending market is the most competitive that many bankers have seen in their careers
 I ll point out that  that market is extremely tight  spreads are really tight  It s more competitive than any of us have ever seen in our careers    BBT 
ZION agrees with JPM that deposits are likely to flow out when the Fed raises rates
 I will refer you to the CFO of JPMorgan Chase  who laid out pretty explicitly what she thinks is going to happen  but I think kind of we are directionally in the same place she is  which is that the Fed will drain a lot of liquidity out of the system I think we are being more conservative on that front than a lot of peers and more explicit in publishing what we are modeling    ZION 
Insurance companies have much more capital discipline than they did 20 years ago
 I think much better management in the industry than wasn t the case 20 years ago  You look at capital deployment philosophies  it s different than it was 20 years ago But I said  coming close to probably 8 or 9 years ago  I thought that the amplitude on the way up as well as the amplitude on the way down were going to be much more narrow I think the leadership in this industry has come to understand that attempting to grow market share by marginally changing price  and actually creating share holder value from it is impossible we ve all learned within our own cultures and our own environment and our own strategies  how to manage our businesses to create shareholder value  that s what we re supposed to do    The Travelers Companies Inc  NYSE TRV

The retail environment is exacting its toll  More bankruptcies
 There s going to be a little volatility in through it  because there are some   we have a little bit more bankruptcies this year than we did the last couple  
Demand is creating tight supply for grass fed beef  and other natural food options 
 From many months now  we have struggled to get all of the beef we need from cattle raised without use of antibiotics for added hormones We believe we found that solution by sourcing some grass fed beef from Australia    CMG 
Ford has a new CEO  but same  ONE Ford  plan
 I had the opportunity to sit side by side with Alan for the last eight years in terms of developing the strategy and then the implementation of that  So the indication that there has to be a new strategy  because there s a new person sitting in the chair  I wouldn t necessarily assume that    Ford Motor Company  NYSE F

VC funding is at its highest level since 2001
 In the second quarter  VC funding reached its highest level since 2001 at  13 9 billion across 974 deals  In the first half of 2014  U S  VC funding grew to  23 9 billion  a 71  increase over the first half of 2013    SVB Financial Group  NASDAQ SIVB  
Silicon Valley bank does not believe this is a bubble though
 we don t believe this is a bubble  but the valuations of some companies and a few industries reflect very high expectations    SIVB 
The CEO seems to disagree with Janet Yellen media and biotech companies are not overvalued
 media and ad tech have experienced some frothiness but the potential for this type of company to disrupt and dominate entire industries on a global basis appears to set them apart despite some frothiness among small cap biotech companies  mid  and large cap biotechs appear to be appropriately valued based on their very high growth rates    SIVB 
Valuations seem high  but it s because we re focused on the best performing companies
 he innovation economy is thriving  and it s generally the disruptive companies  the best performers and those with the largest market opportunities that are achieving the highest valuations the company s performances that we re seeing with these growth stage and later stage companies is incredible  I mean  it s the best performance that I ve seen  highest growth is collectively in my 21 years at the bank   SIVB 
Startups are incredibly liquid
 we re seeing  on a regular basis  rounds of financing for private companies that are  30 million   40 million   50 million   60 million   70 million on a regular basis  That s something we haven t seen   I haven t   I actually have never seen that consistent number of companies raising that level of capital a lot of these companies are just keeping it on their balance sheet for liquidity they have so much liquidity and they re asking themselves  why would they want to borrow money even at today s interest rates for doing acquisitions or anything else  They re just using cash to finance it    SIVB 
iPhone is gaining back share in the US
 In the U S   iPhone accounts for 41 9  of the smartphone subscriber base according to the latest data from ComScore  up from 41 3  in the previous measurement period  Also based on the latest survey by ChangeWave among responders planning purchase a smartphone within 90 days  50  planned to purchase an iPhone  up from 42  in the March quarter and 44  a year ago    Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  
iPad sales were disappointing  but the enterprise is the key to growth
 our theory that the tablet market would eventually surpass the PC market is still intact  I just think we have to do some more things to get the business side of it moving in a faster trajectory and I think we re now on to something that can really do that we win if we can drive that penetration number I spoke about from 20  to 60   That would be incredibly exciting here  The walls would shake    AAPL 
Interestingly  tablet sales were still robust in emerging markets a mirror image of PCs  Perhaps this is a wealth gap issue 
 the market s very bifurcated on iPad  In the BRIC countries  iPad did extremely well  The growth was very high  Like in the China it was in the 50 s  in the Middle East it was in the 60 s In the developed countries like the U S   the market is clearly weaker there  It s interesting to note however that the U S  as an example  we had a very  very strong Macintosh market in the U S  and so there is probably a bit of higher add kind of stuff beginning to play out too  where higher add is clearly still very much notebook oriented    AAPL 
AT T s customers are shifting away from buying phones via subsidy
 The shift is in no device subsidy model is unmistakable  more and more customers are choosing the simplicity of Mobile Share Value plans and AT T Next  This model shift is driving impressive results  Postpaid churn was a record low 0 86   the best ever for AT T and likely and industry best this quarter    AT T Inc  NYSE T  
That s not really a bear case for Apple though  Only 1 4 of iPhones are being sold on subsidy now anyways
 And actually last quarter  as we estimated and this is subject to estimating but we re estimating that less than one out of four iPhones were sold on a traditional subsidy plan  And so that number is markedly different than it would have been two years ago   AAPL 
More people are buying insurance with their phone a negative for case manufacturers 
 we are seeing people take insurance  almost sort of 50  clip on our Next sales  So that s going to help and we continue to find satisfaction of those insurance rates anywhere from  7 to  10 a month  We see really good results there    T 
Verizon saw strong growth in machine to machine  internet of things  connections to their network
 I will tell you  this was one of the highest connection quarters we had from a machine to machine on a companywide basis which would include Verizon Wireless  Hughes Telematics and some of our enterprise customers  And that fueled that 50  year over year growth  So machine to machine continues to be a critical component    Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  
Satya Nadella laid out his vision for MSFT  Very enterprise  cloud  mobile focused

Facebook has unreal user engagement
 1 32 billion people now connecting on Facebook each month  and 63  of them visiting daily people on the Facebook in the U S  spend around 40 minutes each day using our service  including about one in five minutes on mobile  This is more than any other app by far  but overall people in the U S  spend about nine hours per day engaging with digital media on TVs  phones and computers    Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  
Facebook is interested in messaging because that s where growth is there are only so many photos that you can share with your friends
 like right now I think at some level  there are only so many photos that you re going to want to share with all of your friends  We still think that there s more to do there but it s like the amount of messaging and how quickly we see that growing  it s crazy  Because like there is just a lot more that people want to express and that they need the tools to express with smaller groups of people  not just one person at a time but smaller groups as well    FB 
Buying Oculus was about being engaged with whatever is the next platform of computing

Halliburton has finally seen capacity tighten in North America
 We re seeing all the right signs as capacity starts to tighten which we ve seen fall below sort of 10  spare capacity  We see activity increasing at breakneck rate  we re seeing some pass through  cost increases at this point and probably most importantly we have clarity of our frac calendar through the end of the year    HAL

On Core Labs  call  one analyst mentioned that there are a lot of new rigs coming to market  Core Labs says new plays will have to work for them to be absorbed
 So keep an eye on how the   the TMS  the SCOOP  the Codell  how these other plays evolve  If they continue to evolve as they have well with some of the expectation of the some of the E P companies that are in there  the answer is probably yes  the rigs can be absorbed   But I think it is very contingent on what the size and the development and the success in these emerging plays would be    Core Laboratories  NYSE CLB  
Caterpillar seeing signs of strength for oil service equipment too
 Last year was a down year for our servicing  But I think they ve gone through maybe the excess inventory they ve had that plus a little bit lower supplies of  proper supply of gas supporting prices it looks like  it looks in good orders on our standpoint  it looks like it s going to be a pretty good business    CAT 
The mining sector may be starting to show some green shoots
 Our resource industries segment which again is mostly mining was down 29  However  this was the first quarter since 2012 that resource industries sales were higher than the previous quarter  So that means second quarter of 2014 sales were about 6  higher than the first quarter   CAT 
Union Pacific is seeing strong coal demand
 As you said  we are seeing strong coal demand the inventory levels are still below where the utilities would like them to be  I mean  if you look at it on a 5 year average  So as we are in the throes of the winter   or excuse me  the summer air conditioning burn season  with low inventories  we think that gives us increasing opportunities    UNP 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom
You need to have  sponsors  at an acquired firm to help integrate cultures
 it s very important when we have an acquisition that there is a person in the organization who is responsible for kind of ushering them into the system  And so you could use the term sponsor  You could use whatever term you want to use  But that person helps share additional parts of our culture and talking with people internally and encouraging them to come to the right events where they would be exposed to other people  like mind  to share ideas and learn additional things    BRO 
Don t make acquisitions just for the sake of acquisitions
 t s not my goal to acquire certain number of companies or spend a certain amount of money  We want to do things that help us make great products that are great for our customers and so forth    AAPL 
You can do things fast  or you can do things right
 so while we might be able to get to markets more quickly if we did a single portfolio sale  we would rather do this right and take a little bit more time and sell hotels individually in the way that we think is best fit for our long term fee business and for our brands    HOT 
You really never know what opportunities will work and which will fail
 to be quite honest like California some years ago  California went from a developing market to a  never mind we won t build in California  market and then overnight became a proven market and now is the state in which we have more stores than any others   CMG 
Don t react  anticipate
 over the years  we have really shifted our approach  We have become much less reactionary and much more anticipatory  And so as we see things starting to develop on the horizon  we immediately start a planning phase that says   We re going to mobilize materials  We re going to mobilize people where they need to be  We re going to be doing some alternative scenario planning as the way to minimize disruption to our network and to our customer service levels    UNP 
Learn something from every event
 we learn something from every event  We learn something from every thing that happens on our railroad  and our goal is to take that and work it into our planning structure so we become even more effective and better going forward    UNP 
Do the right thing because it s the right thing to do
 many customers  including a number of our own customers do not fully understand the issues of the food system that still heavily influences the decisions we make  I think that we do a lot of these things  from food with integrity to the way we think about   the way we build our buildings and to the way we think about just doing the right thing by way of our people culture and the way we select our leaders for our company  All of these things are things we do because we know that they re the right thing to do    CMG

11630,233145,RHI,5 Quality Stock Picks Screened On DuPont Analysis,opinion,"With the global markets on a volatile ride thanks to tensions in the oil patch  Brexit negotiations and rising rate worries in the United States  looking for quality stocks is investors  natural choice 
There are plenty of criteria or metrics that can lead investors to quality stocks  Among these return on equity  ROE  is one of the most coveted ones  That said  we would like to note that the basic ROE calculation doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get misled by picking stocks based on this number  
Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 19 stocks that made it through the screen

oil patch  Brexit negotiations and rising rate worries in the United States  looking for quality stocks is investors  natural choice There are plenty of criteria or metrics that can lead investors to quality stocks  Among these return on equity  ROE  is one of the most coveted ones  That said  we would like to note that the basic ROE calculation doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get misled by picking stocks based on this number Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont technique seems to be an intriguing idea Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierInside the Strength of DuPontThe DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont

Center link at the bottom left of the page  Before we go over our fourth quarter results  I d like to say a few words about Max Messmer  who transitioned to Executive Chairman at the end of last year after 33 years as CEO  Max set a very high standard in leading Robert Half to where it is today  We re very grateful for everything he s done  Max and I ve worked together over this entire time period and I hope to continue his standard of excellence As we move forward  we are fortunate to have max stay as executive chairman  and remain involved in the growth and strategy of the company  Joining me now on our quarterly calls  is our newly appointed CFO  Michael Buckley  Mike is a 24 year veteran of Robert Half  Originally from public accounting  Micah Sir Robert Half in various roles  including controller  Vice President finance and most recently chief administrative officer  He has led the finance and accounting function at Robert Half for many years  Now  let s review Robert out fourth quarter 2019 financial results Companywide revenues were  1 537 billion  up 4  from the fourth quarter of 2018 on both a reported and as adjusted basis  Fourth quarter 2019 net income per share was  0 98 compared to  0 95 in the fourth quarter one year ago  This is a 4  increase year over year  Cash flow from operations was  81 million in the fourth quarter  and capital expenditures were  14 million  In December  we distributed a  0 31 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of  36 million  We also repurchased approximately one million Robert Half shares during the quarter for  59 million  We have 2 5 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan  We ended 2019 with continued strength in the U S  job market and solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services  We were particularly pleased with how Protiviti performed during the quarter  Our Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources divisions also turned in solid results  largely due to the ongoing talent shortages in the professional disciplines they serve  Return on invested capital for the company was 40  in the fourth quarter Now I ll turn the call over to Mike Buckley Michael C  Buckley    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Keith  and hello  everyone  I am very pleased to join you on the call today  Let s start with a closer look at revenues for the fourth quarter  As Keith had noted  global revenues were  1 537 billion for the quarter  This is up 4  in the fourth quarter one year ago on both the reported and as adjusted basis  Also on an as adjusted basis  fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 2  year over year  US staffing revenues were 962 million  up 3  on as adjusted basis  Non Us staffing revenues were 271 million down 1  year over year on an as adjusted basis  We have 326 staffing locations worldwide  including 87 locations in 17 countries outside the United States  In the fourth quarter  there were 61 7 billion days  unchanged from the same quarter of one year ago  The current first quarter has 63 1 billion days versus 62 2 days in the first quarter one year ago  Currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year over year staffing revenues by  6 million  This decreased our year over year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0 5 percentage point  Now let s take a look at results for Protiviti Global revenues in the fourth quarter were  304 million   239 million of that is from business within the United States and  65 million is from operations outside the United States  On an as adjusted basis  global fourth quarter Protiviti revenues were up 14  versus the year ago period  with U S  Protiviti revenues up 17  from the prior year  Non U S  revenues were up 3  on an as adjusted basis  Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year over year Protiviti revenues by  1 million and decreasing the year over year reported growth rate by 0 3 percentage points  Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries  Now let s take a look at gross margin  In our temporary and consulting staffing operations  gross margin was 38  of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 38  of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago  Our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 10 2  of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10 3  of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago When combined with temporary and consulting gross margin  overall staffing gross margin decreased 10 basis points compared to the year ago fourth quarter to 44 3   For Protiviti  gross margin was  93 million in the fourth quarter or 30 4  of Protiviti revenues  One year ago  gross margin for Protiviti was  80 million or 30 2  of Protiviti revenues  Companywide SG A costs were 31 6  of global revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 31 5  in the fourth quarter one year ago  Staffing SG A costs were 35 2  of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 34 5  in Q4 of 2018  The increase in staffing SG A as a percentage of revenue is a continuation of what we saw last quarter and is primarily the result of negative leverage from our non U S  staffing operations  We ended 2019 with 11 500 full time internal staff in our staffing divisions  up 3  from the prior year  Fourth quarter SG A costs for Protiviti were 17 1  of Protiviti revenues compared to 17 3  of revenues in the year ago period  We ended 2019 with 5 500 full time Protiviti employees and contractors  up 17  from the prior year  Companywide operating income was  153 million in the fourth quarter  Operating margin was 10   Fourth quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was  113 million with an operating margin of 9 1  Operating income for Protiviti in the fourth quarter was  40 million  with an operating margin of 13 3   At the end of the fourth quarter  accounts receivable were  833 million  and implied days sales outstanding  or DSO  of 48 7 days  Before we move on to first quarter guidance  let s review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019 and thus far in January 2020  all adjusted for currency and billing days  Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues up 2 1  versus the prior year compared to a 2 2  increase for the full quarter  Revenue for the first three weeks of January 2020 were up 3 2  compared to the same period one year ago  Permanent placement revenues in December were down 3 7  compared to December 2018  This compares to a 0 9  increase for the full quarter  For the first four weeks in January  permanent placement revenues were up 4  compared to the same period in 2019 As Keith has noted on prior calls  we provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into January  But as you know  these are very brief time periods  we caution against reading too much into them  With that in mind  we offer the following first quarter guidance  revenues   1 515 billion to  1 580 billion  Income per share   0 90 to  0 96  The midpoint of our guidance implies year over year revenue growth of 4  on an as adjusted basis  including Protiviti  We limit our guidance to one quarter  All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today s press release and in our SEC filings Now I ll turn the call back over to Keith M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Mike  As discussed at the start of the call  Protiviti had a very strong fourth quarter  Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources also performed well  largely because of intensifying labor shortages in technology disciplines and highly skilled accounting and finance specialties we serve  On the last call  we talked about how the shortage of IT talent is negatively impacting companies trying to make technology enhancements  particularly in the digital space  This is also resulting in higher demand for our IT staffing solutions  In December  the U S  unemployment rate held at 3 5   Until the last half of 2019  unemployment had not been that low in 50 years  Protracted skill shortages remain a problem for employers  The U S  economy added 145 000 jobs in December  The Vistage CEO Confidence Index also improved in the fourth quarter  moving from 85 in the prior quarter to 91 5  63  of CEOs said they plan to expand their workforce in the year ahead  up six points from the third quarter  Our Protiviti teams are also reporting higher demand across all of their practice areas  which run the gamut from internal audit to a wide range of business and technology consulting solutions  The collaboration between Protiviti and our staffing operations has become a key differentiator for us Our unique ability to provide businesses with a full spectrum of staffing and consulting solutions under one roof makes us an attractive alternative to working with multiple service providers  Customers demand more from companies today than ever before  our investments in technology  including enhancements to our website  personalized job and candidate recommendations  and our own mobile app allows To meet their changing expectations by offering more choice  and how and when they work with us  These innovations paired with the expertise of our local staffing specialist are making it easier and faster to hire or be hired through Robert Half  Whether customers engage with us online or in person  We feel very good about how the company is positioned right now  Our brand is the best recognized in the industry  supported by over  1 billion dollars in advertising over the last 25 years  Our business model continues to focus on professional level engagements at small and middle market companies  Attractive areas of the market  Our people are among the most driven and tenured in the industry  Our senior field leaders averaged more than 20 years with Robert Half  Our technology tools are state of the art  and we continue to invest in digital transformation  And finally  Protiviti is performing well  not only in its traditional consulting and solutions areas  but also as it goes to market together with our staffing professionals Now Mike and I d be happy to answer your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird  Your line is open  Please go ahead Mark Marcon    Baird    AnalystGood afternoon  I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the strong growth that you re seeing domestically in Protiviti  And just to what extent the momentum can be continued  Because it certainly seems like you went up against a pretty tough comp in the year ago period and still delivered the 16  total growth  And clearly  the blended workforce solutions is helpful  but it looks like you re expanding the number of areas of solutions that you re providing  So I m just wondering if you can give some context there  And then I have a follow up M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So Protiviti is performing very well  It s at seven straight quarters of double digit growth  It achieved an 11 3  operating margin for the year  So we had double digit growth and double digit margins  which we ve long talked about is the standard we ve set for Protiviti  Their growth and their strength is broad based  Internal audit or IT audit is particularly strong  Technology consulting or cybersecurity and cloud  privacy are strong  FSI regulatory  We ve long talked about anti money laundering  but they re also getting nice traction in consumer lending as well  And then our joint solution  which we call management business solutions and managed technology solutions  where we combine such better expertise from Protiviti  scalable resources from staffing  that continues to do well  In fact  the growth there has accelerated for several quarters in a row  The pipeline is strong  They feel good going into 2020  The normal Q1 seasonality  we expect to be pretty much like it s been in the past  such that year on year  when you look at our guidance  we pretty much perceive Protiviti staying at the same growth rates you saw in the fourth quarter  which is strong Mark Marcon    Baird    AnalystThat s fantastic  And then can you talk a little bit about what you re seeing in the international markets  if we look at perm and Protiviti  Listening to some other professional services firms that are based in Europe  it s not a surprise  but just wondering what you re seeing there and what we should think about with regards to some of the deleveraging that you mentioned earlier in terms of how that s going to impact the near term M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we have built into our guidance for the last few quarters  and we continue to    for the coming quarter that would see some moderation of growth rates that has been the case  I d say on the good news front  Germany  which is our largest non U S  market  their growth rates are still positive  low single digit  but positive  They held in the fourth quarter versus the third  And the expectation is they hold again in the first quarter  So we re very pleased with how Germany is doing  The other strong spot outside the U S  would be Australia  and that s on both the staffing and the Protiviti side  We do have negative growth in France  the U K   Belgium  Canada  pretty much all the other countries  but I would observe we re faring better than most of the industry is in that way  in large part because we re not near as exposed to manufacturing as is most of the industry Mark Marcon    Baird    AnalystKeith  would you say that France and the U K  were somewhat episodic  either from the French pension strikes or the U K  election M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s hard to put causation precisely on what you describe  They clearly contribute to it  But hopefully  those clear as the quarters progress  particularly as Brexit  Hopefully  the major disruption and uncertainty around that is behind us  but we ll see Mark Marcon    Baird    AnalystGreat  appreciate the color  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan  Please go ahead Andrew Steinerman    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  I I keep in Mike  My question is about the 3 2  growth rate in early January for temp and consulting revs  Just remind everybody  I believe  it s that even though you say consulting  that s without Protiviti  My question is really    that s on a global basis  could you give us a sense of how the U S  did in January in temp revenues M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo you are correct  the 3 2  is staffing only  does not include anything for Protiviti  It is global  U S  is stronger  There is continuation of some negative growth outside the U S  So if anything  if you look at the fourth quarter  November was particularly strong  December was not as strong  in part because there was a bigger holiday impact than we typically see  So we see January getting closer to what we had seen in November  and I must say that the reentry points we saw once we got past January 6  our field people are quite energetic and enthused about Andrew Steinerman    JPMorgan    AnalystRight  Maybe just answer the question  Why  Keith  why do you feel like U S  temp revenue growth picked up in January from December M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  one factor is the comps get a little easier  That s not the total message  but there was clearly some holiday impact to December more so than we typically see  We talked about the Wednesday holidays on the last call  but we saw a broad based strong reentry point in January in U S  temp staffing  which we re very pleased with Andrew Steinerman    JPMorgan    AnalystThank you OperatorYour question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse  Your line is open  Please go ahead Kevin McVeigh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you  Hey  Let me add my congratulations to Max  Keith  it s hard to replace a legend  but definitely if one was going to do  it s you  In terms of just really nice trends of Protiviti  I just wanted you to remind us if you could of the impact on management resources and just what percentage of that business is tied into Protiviti today  and kind of    and just how that s trended over  I guess  2019  if you could M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  first of all  the numbers you see externally for management resources include 0 as it relates to Protiviti because all of the people management resources placed on Protiviti engagements are reported as Protiviti  not management resources  And in fact  if you look at Protiviti overall  25   28  of their staff hours come from the staffing divisions collectively  not just management resources  and that s up versus it was a year ago  but that revenue gets reported as Protiviti  But orders of magnitude  about 1 4 of the staff level resources in Protiviti come from staffing  and we re delighted with that Kevin McVeigh    Credit Suisse    AnalystThat brings a lot of flexibility  And then just real quick  Keith  If you said it  I apologize  Just the tax rate in the first quarter and then what we should model for 2020 M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo the tax rate that we expect in Q1 would be in the 26  to 27  range  For the full year 2019  the tax rate was 27   We expect the full year of 2020 to be in a similar range  say  27  to 28  Kevin McVeigh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets  your line is open  Please go ahead Jeff Silber    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThank you so much  When you typically give your outlook for earnings per share  you typically give us a little bit of color on what kind of margins we should expect  So I was just wondering if you can go through that right now M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So let me provide context to that a little bit from some commentary on the fourth quarter and then I ll segue into guidance from that  So in the fourth quarter on the temp side  it was pretty much as we expected with OfficeTeam being a little lighter as open enrollment didn t get to seasonal lift we ve gotten in years past  and we exited some low margin accounts  Our project divisions  management resources and technology did very well  And understand that s as much supply as it is demand because management resources and technology have access to career consultants  a broader talent ecosystem than do Accountemps and OfficeTeam  which pretty much deal with the traditional people between full time engagements  The Wednesday holidays had a little more of an impact  as I said earlier  Europe  modest low and continues  Encouraged that Germany appears to be bottoming  Perm  demand remains strong  Holidays  even more impactful to perm as both clients and candidates were not around to close deals Biggest issue for perm is we continue to lose candidates to counter offers from existing employers from multiple offers from outside  but demand there remains strong  and that s continued into the first quarter and then get to    get into the first quarter  Our 2020 guidance has overall revenues up 4   consistent with Q4  Staffing would be 2   consistent with Q4  U S  strong  Europe continuing to decline modestly  Remember  Germany  strong as the offset  Protiviti  growth rates stay pretty close to where they were in Q4  which was a strong double digit  14   Gross margins year over year  flat with last year  plus or minus 10 to 20 basis points as we continue to pass through wage increases and our bill rate increased 5 2  in the fourth quarter versus a year ago  and we would expect to see that trend into the first quarter  Protiviti    going back to guidance again  Protiviti gross margins would be up 100 basis points  plus or minus 20 as they get more leverage from their outsized revenue growth  Staffing SG A  up 80 basis points  Again  relative to last year  plus or minus 10 to 20 basis points  We talked about the international zone  negative leverage The tech spending that we ramped up starting a couple of years ago  We re continuing at those levels  Protiviti SG A versus a year ago  up 50 basis points  plus or minus 10 to 20  Principally  training and marketing as they add more people to support their growth  which means that overall operating income  the percentage versus revenues would be down 80 basis points  plus or minus those same 10 to 20 range that we ve been talking about  Tax rate  as Mike mentioned  will be up a point versus a year ago  We ll have fewer grandfathered nondeductible cost  which drives up the rate and then the share counts in the  114 million range  But all in all  we re pretty pleased with the U S  environment  how we re performing in the U S  environment  and we re hopeful that things are going to bottom out in Europe  And as I ve said that now for the fourth time  we re particularly encouraged with Germany Jeff Silber    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystRight  Well  it sounds like you were prepared for that question  I really appreciate that  I m sorry to ask this one  I just want to nitpick a little bit  but did you change the way that you calculate your full time internal staff  You finished 2019 with 11 500  I had in my note  yes  something like 14 900 last year  Maybe I had the wrong number  But was there a different way of calculating it this year M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo yes  we did make a change  and the change relates to the number of people that we have full time that are out on engagements and build to clients  It s long been the case outside the United States  And in some cases  it s mandatory  starting with Germany  that the people you place on engagements are your full time employees  As you know  in the technology staffing sector  it s long been the case that many of those consultants are full time to the staffing company and then they re put on their engagements from there  And so what we ve done is we ve taken from the full time number  those that are actually billable on engagements  and we ve reported an internal number  So whereas the prior distinction was full time versus temporary  The distinction we re now making is internal versus on engagement  which is a suddenly different distinction But the reason being that one of the strategies we have to deal with the candidate shortage is that we are beginning to put a single digit number of the people we have on billing on our full time payroll and then putting them on engagements because we believe our scale allows to do that and keep them highly utilized  And further  we get to access the same pool of people for Accountemps  OfficeTeam  etc   that were already getting to access for Management Resources and Robert Half Technology  because that s a common way of doing business in those sectors  So it s a long winded way of saying  yes  we made a change  and we made a change because it reflects that some of the people we have on billing are  in fact  our full time employees  which has long been the case outside the United States  which has long been the case for a portion of our technology staffing and is more recently the case in accounting and finance Jeff Silber    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  And the important thing is that on a like for like basis  it was up 3  year over year M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCorrect  The percentages are definitely on a like for like basis Jeff Silber    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystAll right  thank you so much for the clarity OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays  your line is open  please go ahead Ryan Leonard    Barclays    AnalystYeah  hi  guys  This is Ryan on for Manav  Just a question on    you kept the growth rate in temp  You re saying that it should be kind of similar to the 4Q    the fourth quarter  You re  obviously  getting pricing  the comps are easing a little bit  Is that an element of conservatism  Or there    the volume slipping a little bit more  Maybe you can help bridge that gap M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe hope we re being conservative  We understand that our guidance is at the same growth rates as Q4 with easier compares  But understand that the compares are easiest outside of the United States where there s more uncertainty as to how the quarter will play out  But we hope we have upside  We began the quarter stronger than we exited the fourth quarter  On top of that  we have easier comps  So hopefully  we have some upside relative to what we forecast Ryan Leonard    Barclays    AnalystGot it  And then just on Protiviti  I think  you mentioned in the last call  there were some kind of big contracts in the mix of the fourth quarter  Maybe you can give some comment on how those progressed  And I guess  just generally  the pipeline of Protiviti M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  the pipeline is very strong  and we feel great about that  As we talked last quarter  if you look at Protiviti international  the growth went from 9  to 3  between quarters three and four  And that s the deceleration we talked about because they lost a couple of big contracts that hadn t yet anniversaried  So that was consistent with expectation  The good news is we had more than enough acceleration in the U S  to more than cover that  But pipeline Protiviti  very good  And what s incredible about it  is virtually every one of their solution areas and then the go to market with staffing is just gravy on top of that Ryan Leonard    Barclays    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities  Your line is open  Please go ahead Gary Bisbee    Bank of America Securities    AnalystHi  good afternoon  So I guess  it s interesting when we look at your international  obviously  you ve seen deceleration as one would expect  But the deceleration has been significantly after sort of the typical temp data in a lot of these countries outside the U S  turned down  And I caught the comment less manufacturing and understand you have a very different mix  But is part of the timing of the deceleration just that higher skilled professional tends to lag low skill  And I guess  to the extent that part of why things are weakening now  would it be reasonable to expect that reacceleration might lag sort of the reacceleration seen in some of those markets at some point in the future M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe ve been around over 30 years and at least the first half of that period  there was clearly a theory out there that manufacturing led and that ultimately that made its way to the back office and then the back office has impacted later  I no longer buy into that theory  A  manufacturing is not near as large a percentage of the total as it once was  and I don t think there s any empirical data that would support in today s digital world and very intertwine supply chains  I think it happens much more quickly and pretty much coincidently than it did 15 years ago and longer  So I believe it s more coincident  I don t think the principal reason why we were impacted later is because of the traditional manufacturing back office lag  I think it s in part which countries we re in  it s which markets  which disciplines within those countries  what investments have we made  particularly in head count  what s the quality of leadership  which was quite good  I think it s way more company specific and specific and granular market exposures than it is the old general theme of back office lags manufacturing Gary Bisbee    Bank of America Securities    AnalystOkay  And then just    do you have on hand what you expect the number of workdays in staffing to be for all four quarters of this year M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Michael will give you that Michael C  Buckley    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So by quarter  63 1  quarter 2  63 4  third quarter  64 3  and in the fourth quarter  61 7  for a total of 252 5 billing days for the year Gary Bisbee    Bank of America Securities    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from Tobey Sommer from SunTrust  Your line is open  Please go ahead Jasper Bibb    SunTrust    AnalystHey  good afternoon  This is Jasper Bibb on for Tobey  I was wondering what you re seeing with respect to pricing for Protiviti  And also how you re thinking about head count growth in that segment M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd so the second part cut out  The high  what Jasper Bibb    SunTrust    AnalystHiring in Protiviti M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Hiring  And so Protiviti clearly is having to pay its new staff more and it s impacted by wage inflation generally  which it is successfully passing through  As we talked earlier in the call  we re expecting 100 basis points improvement in gross margin year over year  So that s a good thing  As to hiring two sources  as I talked earlier  about 1 4 of their staff resources  they re sourcing from staffing on a just in time basis  And beyond that  they re very aggressive on campus  They have been forever  That s how the Big four grow their staff  and Protiviti is right there with them  And they ve got a very aggressive hiring program for 2020  in fact  even more so than it was in 2019 Jasper Bibb    SunTrust    AnalystHistorically  it seems there have been demand positives due to election and tax uncertainty  So as kind of we approach new primary season  what extent do you think that might become a predominant factor in customer decision making again M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s hard to comment on political and tax uncertainty  I don t think it s risen to every day conversation yet at this point Jasper Bibb    SunTrust    AnalystI appreciate it  Thanks  guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets  your line is open  Please go ahead Emily McLaughlin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth tonight  Sorry  if I missed it  but did you talk about  well  Protiviti margins were a little bit better than we expected in the fourth quarter  Was staff utilization better  Or did something else drive that M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  it s a combination of utilization  inclusive of using contractors sourced through staffing  And I d say the biggest piece of upside is probably related to the number of people sourced through staffing which  by definition  have a 100  utilization  which helps their margins Emily McLaughlin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And can you just talk about your capex expectations this year  and then the spend on technology and digital strategy Michael C  Buckley    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo we finished  19 with capex of  90 million  for 2020  we re expecting a range of  100 million to  110 million  with Q1 coming in at  20 million to  25 million range  The increase in capex is largely the result of ongoing investments in technology and specifically a new project to implement Workday financials globally  Our legacy financial system is 17 years old in op support  And so this move will bring our financial systems up to date and out of the data center and into the cloud  In addition  we ve already transitioned to Workday HCM on a global basis  and this implementation will result in a full integration between these systems M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then talking more generally about digital transformation and technology strategy  we ve talked several quarters in a row about    we re about providing a world class personalized digital experience for clients and candidates that s focused on our website  that s focused on our mobile app  We continue to refine and improve our AI for our matching engines  We micro target recommendations to clients and candidates  We prioritize leads for our staff  The good news is we re now starting to see quantifiable benefits  We ve seen a significant increase in traffic to our sites  both in terms of client  candidate    excuse me  candidate applications and client leads  As importantly  we ve also seen an improvement in the quality of those candidates  Because in many cases  they were pre matched before we invited them to apply  Also  I m very pleased with our field adoption of our technology tools  And in fact  we re told by sales force we re one of the top 10 users in the world of their software  which is pretty impressive because we re certainly not one of the top 10 largest companies in the world Our mobile app has gotten nice traction  It s currently rated 4 8 in the Apple App Store  We ve gotten over 100 000 applications since we launched it in July  And further  we ve launched Robert Half Direct earlier last year  It s our online hiring platform  where our clients have direct access to a short list of candidates  It leverages our technology  It leverages our candidate database that s maintained by live recruiters around the world  We piloted that in a dozen offices  It extends traditionally our full service offerings to the sales service market  So we re upbeat about that as well  But the bottom line is  and the thing that s most encouraging to me is that we re beginning to see quantifiable benefits of significance from the investments we ve made so far  and we continue to make those investments Emily McLaughlin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  thanks for all the detail Operator Operator Instructions  Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs  Your line is open George Tong    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  thanks  Good afternoon  You mentioned you re still seeing negative growth in France  the U K   Belgium and Canada  Can you elaborate on client sentiment and sales cycles in those countries M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSentiment and sales cycles  I d say  sentiment hasn t changed much  It s guarded  it s cautious  it s measured and it s been that way for a while  And we ve included that in the guidance that we ve given  On the flip side  we ve talked about what appears to be a stabilization in Germany  which is our largest non U S  operation  But not a lot of change  George  from what we saw in the fourth quarter  If anything  some stabilization in Germany George Tong    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  This cycle has been previously characterized as one that s relatively supply constrained from a talent perspective  What evidence might you be seeing that suggests that there might be some give with demand as well M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  as we ve talked about a couple of times on the call  demand is good  And this  if you ask me  what needs to happen for our growth rates to improve  particularly in the United States  the first thing I would say is we need more fee eligible candidates  If a client needs a person with 10 years  experience to the extent we have more people with 10 years  experience  our revenues are going to grow  And in a nuanced way or our clients could have more urgency and that when we present a seven year person to their 10 year requirement  they take the seven year person  So the combination of more fee eligible supply and or more client urgency would help us grow our revenues  As I just talked about  clearly  our technology investments are helping with supply  As we talked earlier  our approach to hire full time  some of the people we put out of engagement should also help with supply  But to this point  we are not seeing  particularly in the United States  any moderation in demand  Demand is strong  If we had more fee eligible candidates  we report more revenue  full stop George Tong    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGotta hurry up  Well  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies  Your line is open  please go ahead Mario Cortellacci    Jefferies    AnalystHi  This is Mario Cortellacci filling in Hamzah  Just wanted to comment on the management change  Congratulations to both of you  But I also had a question about that as well  I just wanted to know if you re thinking about any type of change in strategy or if you guys have discussed how you guys are approaching the business and you guys have done business almost the same way with slight changes to it over the past decade or so  I just didn t know if there is a change in thought process or discussion that you guys had about that M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  the fact that I ve been here 33 years  and Mike has been here 24 years  and we ve been    both been very involved in the strategy and the execution of that for those periods of time  I don t think you can expect any material changes because of the management change Mario Cortellacci    Jefferies    AnalystThat s what I figured  I just wanted to ask  And then on Protiviti  I just wanted to see if you can kind of frame for us what the competitive environment looks like there  And maybe share with us whether or not you think you re gaining share M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Protiviti s principal competitors are the Big four accounting firms  and that s been true since day one in 2002  Gaining share  I don t think there s any question that our joint go to market with staffing is unique  differentiated and growing more quickly than the Big four generally and the consulting market  specifically  Because the Big four doesn t break out their like for like solutions similar to Protiviti s  it s hard to say  per se  whether we re gaining share  But I can say  overall  the Big four aren t growing at the same rates of Protiviti  And I suspect that we are gaining share  We ve always majored in internal audit  and are known as such  more so than even the Big 4  And we ve gotten tremendous traction in FSI regulatory consulting  as I said earlier We re extending the base of anti money laundering into consumer lending  where we ve gotten some very good engagements of late  Technology  security  privacy is a hot area  where we re able to attract people into those practices  Success    lead success  We get all types of awards as an organization  We were just named for the 23rd straight year to Fortune s Most Admired list  We made Forbes  Best Employers for Diversity  We made Bloomberg s Gender Equality Index  We made to Human Rights Foundation for Best Places for LBGTQ Equality  and that s just in the last couple of months  So all of those help Protiviti attract and Robert Half generally to attract the best and brightest which then propels their client satisfaction and engagement growth Mario Cortellacci    Jefferies    AnalystThank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from David Silver from CL King  Your line is open  please go ahead David Silver    CL King    AnalystOkay  thank you  So I m going to ask a question or two that I think have been answered in part  But first thing I was going to ask was maybe about your staffing    your internal staffing needs for maybe the first quarter and the full year  But you talked about an aggressive plan to staff up Protiviti  In the past  I guess  your first quarter EPS has been affected by additional hiring and the time it takes to absorb that incremental overhead  How should we think about that maybe for your first quarter and the full year for staffing as well as Protiviti M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBy and large  we try to match internal head counts to top line growth  and we just reported for the full year  that was the case  3  on the staffing side and double digit on the Protiviti side  and that would be our plan as we move forward  The principal issue sequentially for the first quarter is that Protiviti has a seasonality impact from your post Sarbanes Oxley compliance and post internal audit ramp up for year end  which happens in the fourth quarter  So the following first quarter always is lower by 5  to 7   And I think our guidance has something similar to that for this year  So it s that seasonal pattern inclusive of all of their raises are effective Jan 1  which then take some time to absorb as well  The combination of those sequentially  because of that seasonality  we back up somewhat at the EPS line  But if you look year on year  which effectively negates that  Protiviti is growing nicely and double digit  But that seasonal impact we ve had per every year of the 17 years we ve had Protiviti  it s very unexpected and very well managed  And the fact that 25  of their workforce hours come from staffing makes their cost even more variable David Silver    CL King    AnalystOkay  And then I have a question about the capex budget  And there s a couple of parts to it  So I hope I get this out in an organized fashion  So Mike highlighted an increase in budgeted capex for this year  And if I understand his description correctly  it was focused on  I guess  improving the back office reporting and administration side of your business  So first question there would be  do you anticipate year over year efficiency gain or cost reduction from updating what you said was a fairly outdated or older system  Second thing I would say    I wanted to know about capex was  you mentioned a couple of years ago  the major IT investment you made  And Keith  you were about as effusive as I ve ever heard you on this call today discussing the revenue generation potential of that 2  to three year old investment  So what s the opportunity    or what s the possibility  Keith  that you might be contemplating a step change in your digital capabilities  and maybe kind of a stage two development on the IT side to further enhance the efficiencies and the opportunities that your first stage front office  I ll call it  IT effort has generated M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo on the Workday Financials front  I mean  typically changing financial systems isn t an efficiency cost reduction driven endeavor  Although  I will say  we will be going from on premise to cloud  and that should drive some cost reduction and some efficiency  but it s basically a new financial system  accounts payable  accounts receivable  So it s accounting infrastructure  if you will  On the second point  as I look at our IT initiatives  as we sit here today  it s more additional refinement of our AI  It s additional refinement of our recommendations  marketing  It s additional refinements of how we help the field generate and prioritize leads  Thematically  there s no one big thing that s going to be new to what we re already doing  but don t discount the benefit of the refinements we re talking because we re pretty much first generation of everything we ve already done  But again  the candidate sourcing benefits we re already seeing are very encouraging  and in the future  make us less dependent on third party sources for candidate for which we spend significant sums that would be our plan in years following  and we now continue to spend at those amounts David Silver    CL King    AnalystAll right  thanks for that  Appreciate it OperatorAnd your last question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird  Your line is open  Please go ahead Mark Marcon    Baird    AnalystJust a quick question with regards to AB5  Are you seeing any sort of impact M  Keith Waddell    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  clearly  Mark  AB5 for California  which is the independent contractor versus employee and other states have their own versions of it  Many clients throw their hands up and say  I don t understand it  I don t want to understand it  The easiest way to deal with it is to only use employees and not use independent contractors  It s early  There are a lot of exceptions already in that  There s a lot of flux about whether there are going to be ballot initiatives that change it  So I would say it s early  We haven t seen significant movement  but we clearly have seen  particularly with larger clients that rather than try to figure it out  they just say  let s make this easy  We will not allow independent contractors  which would be good for staffing firms generally and us specifically  Okay  So that was our last question  Thank you for joining us today
