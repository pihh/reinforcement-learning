23656,245171,CCOI,4 Tariff Proof Dividend Stocks Poised To Double,opinion,"Is it time to tariff proof our dividends  again  
A couple months into the U S  China trade tensions  I said the key was to buy dividend growth stocks   Payout growth like that is proven to throw an updraft under share prices when the markets get skittish due to any kind of worry  trade spats  terrorist attacks  wars you name it  
Then I highlighted a trio of dividend growers Life Storage  NYSE LSI   Ecolab  NYSE ECL  and Carnival Corp   NYSE CCL  that looked primed to swim upstream  Unpredictable fuel costs helped weigh on our Carnival pick  but even then  the combined total return of all three selections nearly doubled the S P 500 s return 
A Winning Tariff Proof Portfolio
Now  here we are again  The U S  has ramped up tariffs on China  and Beijing has retaliated  Stocks have plunged into volatility in the early offing  Uncertainty is back 
You and I can focus on the factors that matter  however  dividend growth  high current yields and or businesses that are mostly China proof  Let s get into a new tariff proof four pack with 100  price upside or better  powered  as usual  by soaring dividend payouts  
Wendy s  WEN   Dividend Yield  2 2 
I don t want to linger on burger slinger Wendy s  NASDAQ WEN  too long because I highlighted it earlier this month  But it bears repeating as a great way to fend off the Red Dragon 
You can read my bull case on Wendy s in full here  but in short  it has red hot dividend growth and a skinflint payout ratio  as well as generally improving operations 
What makes it a specifically compelling play right now is that it s one of the largest fast food companies that aren t really exposed to China  In fact  Wendy s has precisely zero locations in the country  Malaysia  Japan  the Philippines  Indonesia   check  China  Nada 
Yes  Wendy s is likely to suffer higher input costs on things such as produce in its salads and on its burgers  but same goes for most of its competitors  But Wendy s doesn t have to deal with anti American sentiment in China   something that could be a drag on the international results of company s such as McDonald s  NYSE MCD  
AT T  NYSE T   Dividend Yield  6 7 
AT T  NYSE T  is a difficult stock to get behind  While it s a Dividend Aristocrat  its dividend growth has slowed to a crawl  at a mere penny per share for years that put 2019 s boost at a mere 2   The company s growth prospects haven t looked good for a long time 
But I would be remiss to point out that AT T has delivered a yield this big just a handful of times over the past three decades 
AT T  A Blue Chip Business Yielding Like a Dying Retailer 
AT T still isn t an elite play  but it might be a  making the best of a bad situation  play  You see  the domestic nature of AT T s business makes it a smart place to hide while America and China duke it out 
For one  AT T has no Chinese revenues  And there has been some confusion about the effect on smartphone and peripheral prices like those sold in AT T stores  Avi Greengart  founder and lead analyst at Techspotential  tells TomsGuide that  parts and materials have just gotten a lot more expensive  but phones and other devices are not subject to the larger tariffs  Most consumer electronics are assembled outside the U S   so the direct impact here should be fairly low  
And while AT T will have a tough row to hoe with the streaming offering it plans to launch in late 2019 it must battle Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Amazon com s  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime Video  Hulu and Disney s  NYSE DIS  new over the top service   it is doing one thing right  AT T is yanking Time Warner TV shows and movies from the likes of Netflix and stuffing it into its service  weakening its rivals while bolstering its own offering in one move 
Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   Dividend Yield  2 1 
Data center real estate investment trust Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  has the kind of chart I can t help but love  One where prices are generally chasing the dividend higher  and there s still more room for the price to catch up 
Equinix Keeps Booting Up Bigger Cash Payouts
Equinix  for those not familiar  is a colocation provider that boasts nearly 10 000 customers and 341 000 total interconnections across 52 metro areas in 24 countries  It s the largest global data center company by market share  and it has been swiftly expanding its lucrative enterprise business 
This is absolutely a growth business  EQIX has logged 65 consecutive quarters of increasing revenues  which tops every other company in the S P 500  and it anticipated 8  10  in annual revenue growth through 2022 
Its 2 1  yield is nothing special  though it s largely an effect of a growing share price keeping up with a rapidly growing dividend  EQIX s quarterly payout has jumped by 45  since it initiated payouts in early 2015 and is only paying out less than half its adjusted free cash flow  AFFO  in dividends  portending plenty of dividend growth ahead  But the stock has rocketed roughly 150  higher in that time  depressing the yield 
This is a great problem to have from a superstar REIT 
Cogent Communications  CCOI   Dividend Yield  4 3 
Speaking of growth  let me introduce you to Cogent Communications  NASDAQ CCOI  
Cogent Communications plays in roughly the same sandbox as Equinix  But it s not a REIT  and while it does provide colocation services  it s primarily an Internet Service Provider  ISP  that provides businesses with high speed Internet and Ethernet transport  It s one of the top networks in the world  and it is indeed worldwide  spanning more than 200 markets across 43 countries 
It s a simply booming business that has helped CCOI expand just about every meaningful statistic you can think of 

Revenues   404 2 million in 2015   502 2 in 2018
Operating Income   46 1 million in 2015   85 6 million in 2018
Net Income   4 9 million in 2015   28 7 million in 2018
Free Cash Flow   48 2 million in 2015   84 0 million in 2018

Cogent Communications Is a Red Hot Growth Stock  And  
But best of all  it blends a nice current yield above 4  with a stellar streak of dividend increases that recently was extended to 27 consecutive quarters  These aren t token hikes  either  At its current rate of growth  CCOI will double its early 2015 dividend by the end of this year 
It seems too good to be true  right 
Uh Oh  Payout Ratio
CCOI has a payout problem  It s not a full blown panic yet  But the dividend is by far outstripping its net income  and free cash isn t enough to tackle the distribution either  In fact  despite the fact that 2020 s expected profits of  1 15 per share should be more than 80  greater than 2018 s  it doesn t come close to touching its current annual obligation of  2 40 per share 
And that makes me wonder just how reliable this dividend will be down the road

On Jan 2  Apple lowered its revenue guidance for the holiday quarter from  91 billion  at the mid point  to  84 billion  its gross profit from  34 8 billion at the mid point to  31 92 billion  its operating expense from  8 75 billion to  8 7 billion  effectively lowering operating income from  26 05 billion at the mid point to  23 22 billion  and its other income from  300 million to  550 million  Applying the tax rate of 16 5   unchanged  to the after tax income  guided net income reduced from  22 00 billion to  19 85 billion 
Apple s Tim Cook blamed the economic slowdown in China to the sales weakness  In a note to investors he said   Most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance  and over 100 percent of our year over year worldwide revenue decline  occurred in Greater China across iPhone  Mac and iPad   He also said that the slowdown in economic activity as a result of the government s credit tightening policies added to the continuing tensions from the trade conflict with the U S   ultimately leading to lower footfall at its retail outlets  He also mentioned that  market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China s smartphone market has been particularly sharp    
In a subsequent interview  he said that there was limited if any anti America sentiment as an offshoot to the trade war although independent media continues to point at growing Chinese patriotism and the availability of quality smartphones of Chinese make 
Slower iPhone sales in China  one of its largest markets  aren t a particularly encouraging signal given strained sino U S  relations and recent market gyrations  If negotiations fall through  iPhone parts will come in for some rather heavy tariffs and Apple maintains that there isn t adequate expertise in the country to allow a production shift back to the U S  So prices of iPhones  a high end consumer good  will rise and a corresponding impact on sales will follow  Investors could see this as another sign of general economic weakness 
Samsung  KS 005930  Deal
Apple has a new deal with long time frenemy Samsung that will see Samsung add an app on its TVs that will let users browse and play their existing iTunes movies and TV shows or buy rent new ones 
The financial terms aren t public  so we don t know what Apple is paying  But Apple wants to get in deep on the very popular TV maker s devices  so the agreement also covers its AirPlay 2 software so iPhone owners can stream content from their phones to their Samsung TVs 
Apple s intentions are obvious  first  to grow its services revenue as fast as possible to offset the increasing pressure on device sales  second  to woo Android device owners into its ecosystem and failing that  to profit from them where possible  and three  to increase options for Apple device owners by letting them stream phone content onto their Samsung TVs  Since Apple TV hasn t been wildly popular  the need to combine with leading TV makers is all the more important  especially as it gets ready to launch its video streaming service in the second half of the year

23780,245295,CCOI,AT T nears U S  approval of  48 5 billion DirecTV merger ,news,"By Alina Selyukh
WASHINGTON  Reuters    AT T Inc  N T  is close to wrapping up its deal to buy DirecTV  O DTV  as U S  telecom and antitrust regulators signaled a green light for the  48 5 billion merger that would create the country s largest pay TV company 
The Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Tuesday recommended that the five member commission vote to approve the merger  and the Justice Department said the deal did not pose a significant risk to competition 
AT T and the FCC have spent recent weeks negotiating the conditions of the deal that combines the No  2 wireless carrier with the largest satellite TV provider  giving DirecTV a broadband product and AT T new avenues of growth beyond the maturing wireless service  The deal was announced in May 2014 
The proposed approval includes a requirement that AT T build out high speed Internet connections to 12 5 million customer locations and share with the FCC all traffic exchange agreements it strikes with content and web transit companies 
AT T would also pledge to count its affiliated video services toward any data caps on fixed broadband connections  according to the proposed conditions 
In a first for the FCC  Wheeler is also seeking to set up an independent officer to help ensure AT T complies with the conditions in the long run 
Wheeler s outlined conditions mark an end of negotiations between the company and the agency as the FCC sought to make sure that the merger serves the public interest  The Justice Department ensures that mergers comply with antitrust law 
Video companies Netflix Inc  O NFLX  and Dish Network Corp  O DISH   traffic company  Cogent Communications  Holdings Inc  O CCOI  and others had pushed for limitations to AT T s power to slow down or charge fees for the web traffic traveling through its networks  as well as protections for rival video services 
 The commitments that the proposed FCC order includes  if adopted  will provide significant benefits to millions of subscribers   Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer said in a statement 
AT T welcomed the Justice Department s completion of the review and said it was looking forward to the FCC approval to begin providing consumers  the benefits of this combination  
The company had earlier committed to expand access to broadband service in rural areas and to offer standalone Internet service at speeds of at least 6 Megabits per second to ensure consumers can access rival video services online 
The success of the merger in passing regulatory muster is in sharp contrast to the recently derailed rival mega merger between cable and Internet providers Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  and Time Warner Cable Inc  N TWC  
That deal was rejected in April largely over the combined companies  reach into the broadband market

23811,245326,CCOI,Comcast s Questionable Methods Of  Persuasion ,opinion,"The internet mafia is becoming increasingly aggressive 
If you re a company operating online  you can either pay the mafia or suffer the consequences 
How bad are the consequences 
Well  based on what just happened to Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   let s just say the wise  business move  might be to pay up 
You see  near the end of last year  Netflix began to experience rapidly declining download speeds 
According to Netflix  streaming speeds had dropped by a significant margin on the major ISPs  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and Verizon  NYSE VZ   Yet download speeds remained steady on other ISPs during that time period 
Strangely suspicious  wouldn t you agree  Well  wait until you see this chart  

As it turns out  Netflix s traffic had been running through Comcast s network via third parties  such as Cogent Communications  NASDAQ CCOI  
The result was dreadfully slow download speeds for Netflix customers  who were offloading their frustrations on the company 
To get itself back in the internet fast lane  Netflix had to pay the mafia  ahem  Comcast  an exorbitant fee 
Now Netflix feeds Comcast its videos directly 
Since agreeing to pay up  streaming speeds for Comcast users jumped nearly 50  from 1 51 in January to 2 5 megabits per second  according to the latest data 
Netflix accused Comcast of resorting to bullying tactics in order to get a piece of the action 
Of course  now Verizon wants Netflix to pay up  too 
But the situation is about to get even uglier 
More than likely  we re going to lose the internet to the mafia in the months ahead 
The FCC is reported to be considering a new rule that will permit ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content 
Unless something drastic happens  it s going to pass 
The ripple effects will be far reaching  even hitting us here at Wall Street Daily 
Under the new rule  the speed at which you ll be able to watch our rich media content  like videos  will depend on how much we re paying ISPs like Comcast and Verizon 
If Wall Street Daily wants to put its best foot forward  which we always do  we ll be forced to pay up  just like Netflix did

Urgent Update on Puerto Rico 
On May 19  2014  I told you that something happened in Puerto Rico that demanded our closest investment attention 
Puerto Rico s mid March bond issue had just become the largest U S  municipal junk bond sale in history 
I also told you that billionaire hedge fund manager  John Paulson  was among those extremely bullish on Puerto Rico  saying that  Puerto Rico will become the Singapore of the Caribbean  
On such merits  you asked to receive news of any investment opportunities in Puerto Rico the moment I finished my research 
Well  Wall Street Daily s top analyst just returned from Puerto Rico and briefed me on the situation  and it isn t compelling 
Although Puerto Rico has nicely restructured its debt to make the latest bond an attractive investment  the nation is a long way from economic prosperity 
My analyst didn t see a single crane or construction effort 
Some of the hotels were even mothballed 
As our analyst said   The economy has turned the corner  but is in early stages of recovery  There s lots of property available for sale  Many investors just walked away  leaving huge mortgages that will have to be written down  Banks on the island are not doing well because of huge loans outstanding  many of which are unlikely to be paid back in full  
In light of this news  I will not be recommending any investment in Puerto Rico at this time

23812,245327,CCOI,Should You Cancel Your Phone  TV and Internet Service Contracts  ,opinion,"Introduction

Chaos is too strong a term  But communication technologies are rapidly changing and significant regulatory changes are coming  And while humans get locked into habits  a growing number of Americans are opting out of their TV and landline phone contracts  Cell phones are taking over  And it is increasingly apparent that traditional mechanisms for TV delivery are outdated  do you really need to be provided with 200  TV channels when you only watch 7  This article explains what has happened and what you should do 


The History of TV Technologies  a Consumer s Perspective

TV started in the late  40 s with TV  ears  and  The Ed Sullivan Show   Next came the roof antenna  In the late  80 s  I purchased a 12  satellite dish and then cable  In 2005  I bought a  that allowed me to watch my home TV channels from anywhere in the world     By December 2011  there were more than 5300 systems serving approximately 60 million subscribers in more than 34 000 communities   And today  Roku and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  TV and other devices stream Internet to TV sets 


Background on the  Big 3  Communication Vehicles

Most US households communicate electronically via  Internet Service Providers  ISPs   for three services  landline phones  TV  and Internet  Recently  cell phones have developed a huge market via separate contracts  Table 1 indicates there are now more cell phone contracts than landlines  and the latter continue to decline  There appear to be relatively few Internet contracts  but that is primarily because so many now get to the web via their cell phones 


Table 1    US Communication Customers by Vehicle  1 000 


Source  Phone Data  households    Centers for Disease Control  TV and Internet  contracts    Leichtman Research Group

One more point on cell phones  we associate them with cell  towers   But keep in mind that towers provide only the final link to from the cell user  Like TV and the Internet  most cell phone traffic quickly moves from tower reception to cables  The following picture indicates the leading global cable provider companies  as measured by the quantity of  transited Internet provider space  



Some of these companies are both carriers and providers to end users while others are just carriers  For example  Cogent manages over 57 900 route miles of intercity fiber and more than 27 400 metro fiber miles  It provides service to over 190 major markets and interconnect with over 5 130 other networks  But it is only an intermediary between providers with  end use  customers 

Table 2 provides data on ISP Internet contracts  The numbers continue to grow for all providers 


Table 2    Internet Contracts by Leading Providers



The story for TV contracts is quite different  As Table 3 indicates  it has started to decline 


Table 3    TV Contracts by Leading Providers


Now  while the decline is small  the so called  cord cutters   those who have canceled their TV contracts  and  cord neverings   those who have never had TV contracts   The question of where this is all going much discussed within the industry  The Sandvine Company has done some interesting research on what is happening  It defines  cord cutters  as the group streaming the most audio and video via the Internet  top 15th percentile   Their steaming share of this group is extremely high   72  of the total  Sandvine estimates this group watches roughly 100 hours of video per month via the Internet  It is reasonable to assume that many in this group do not have TV contracts but are watching TV via the web  In addition  this group probably plays video games online  a rapidly growing user of bandwidth 

Broadband Use

Broadband use is measured in two ways  by what is being sent  upstream  and by what is being received  downstream   These data are presented in Table 4  Netflix s heavy use of broadband is notable  While not on this list  video games are  climbing up the charts   For example  the video game live streaming service Twitch TV  1 35   now accounts for more traffic in the US than HBO GO  1 24   

Table 4    Top 10 Peak Period Applications   North America



What WILL  Net Neutrality  Mean 

In earlier times  the meaning of  net neutrality  was pretty straight forward   everyone on the Internet was treated equally  e g   nobody could pay more to get faster service  But times have changed  and the FCC decided it needed to regulate ISPs  So it recently  redefined  ISPs as common carriers  like telephone companies   Then came   One thing is certain  there will be litigation and lots of it 

To give some sense of what is happening   Netflix Inc  NASDAQ NFLX  dominance  The  spirit  of net neutrality is that all are treated equal   that no company can pay a carrier extra for  special services   But can a carrier charge a company  such as Netflix  more for a huge amount of Broadband use  For example  we just learned that Netflix has agreed to pay Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   extra  for its heavy bandwidth use  Is this special treatment  A second example  Many cable and DSL providers considering implementing  usage based billing   In North America  the top 1  of subscribers who make the heaviest use of the network s upstream resources account for 47  of total upstream traffic  The comparable downstream users account for 12  of downstream bytes  At the opposite end of the usage spectrum  the network s lightest 50  of users account for only 7  of total monthly traffic 

Will the FCC view such charges as a violation of net neutrality  Timothy Lee  who writes about   thinks so 

 Network neutrality advocates are going to have to go back to the drawing board   Another  example of new issues comes from a dispute between the backbone provider Cogent Communications Group Inc  NASDAQ CCOI  and Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   Netflix is a Cogent customer  Surging Netflix traffic has been overwhelming the links between Cogent and Verizon  Cogent has asked for those links to be upgraded  but according to Cogent  Verizon has demanded payment for upgrading the links  

Lee goes on    in a world where Netflix and Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  connect directly to residential ISPs  every Internet company will have its own separate  pipe   And policing whether different pipes are equally good is a much harder problem than requiring that all of the traffic in a single pipe be treated the same  If it wanted to ensure a level playing field  the FCC would be forced to become intimately involved in interconnection disputes  overseeing who Verizon interconnects with  how fast the connections are   

Should You Give Up Your TV Contract 

I return to the question posed at the beginning of this article  Consider my  quite typical  TV uses  I regularly watch 7 TV channels for news  sports and entertainment  I also have a Roku and an Apple TV hooked up to different TVs so I can stream from the Web  Can I get all I need from the Web  Some channels stream directly from the Web  And even if they do not  one can access some past shows from the Web  But there are very few channels that allow you to stream live content unless it is from your current TV provider  My guess is that in return for payments from the ISPs  content providers are not allowed to offer their content via the Web  The only exception I have found is CBS   the CBS network s shows are available live for  5 99 per month  In short  most content prodders will only offer what I have been able to get via Slingbox since 2005   all the TV that I get through my current TV provider 

The Dish Network is trying something slightly different  In January  it launched  Sling TV  a stripped down  16 channel package for  20 monthly  And you can pay to add additional channels  Undoubtedly  more changes are coming  But for now  I am not going to give up my TV contract to save  70 monthly  It is just too easy to turn on my TV and click on a channel  However  I will continue to call my ISP every two months and threaten to cancel my TV contract  It works well as a way to get my monthly payments reduced 

Investment Implications

The technologies in the communication industry are continually changing and set of new regulations will shortly be imposed  How likely is it that anyone will be able to anticipate what will happen next  Not very  For example  I cannot imagine the FCC will allow the merger of Comcast and Time Warner to go through  it would clearly reduce competition  But one should not underestimate their lobbying arms in DC  Open Secrets reports that the Communications Industry spent  381 million lobbying in DC last year 

For the record  Table 5 presents the price earnings ratio for some of the leading communications companies  For reasons discussed above  I will not be investing in them in the foreseeable future

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that BCE is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP   for BCE stands at  1 54  because the Most Accurate estimate is 66 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 65 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise   Zacks Rank  BCE currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement The combination of BCE s Zacks Rank  2 and  1 54  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings Launch of a new portfolio of products and support services to make mobile communications more handy for customers bodes well and is likely to boost the company s bottom and top line performance Moreover  the partnership with IBM  NYSE IBM  to expand cloud computing services via Bell Business Cloud and a 5  dividend hike should bolster the company s performance in the to be reported quarter Successful launch of Gigabit Fibe coupled with efforts to enhance broadband fiber and 4G LTE mobile networks should help the company gain customers and also put a check on churn  Additionally  Bell Canada s launch of 4K Whole Home PVR  the most advanced 4K PVR available at present  for all Fibe TV customers in Toronto  Montreal  Ottawa and Quebec should result in an increase in Fibe TV customer count However  a decline in Network Access Services lines  stiff competition and union issues are certain factors that might hamper the quarter s performance Other Stocks to ConsiderBCE is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Sprint Corp    NYSE S   has an earnings ESP of  69 23  and a Zacks Rank  3 Cogent Communications Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ CCOI   has an earnings ESP of  25 00  and a Zacks Rank  3 Mattersight Corp    NASDAQ MATR   has an earnings ESP of  6 67  and a Zacks Rank  3 Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-bce-(bce)-keep-earnings-streak-alive-in-q1-200126161,200126161
