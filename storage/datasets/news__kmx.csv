14947,236462,KMX,U S  Used Vehicle Market Red Hot  Stocks To Watch Out For,opinion,With new cars getting expensive and out of reach for many shoppers  affordable used vehicles are becoming increasingly popular  The used car market has gained traction over the past few years and is poised to witness strong demand going forward  Despite the introduction of various models in a bid to bridge the gap between luxury and budget cars  the used car market has not come under any threat Used Vehicle Market Outpacing New Vehicle MarketThe auto sector  being consumer cyclical  is dependent on business cycles and economic conditions  However  historically  used vehicle sales have shown less volatile reactions to market shocks  offering a relatively safe harbor from the drastic high and low sales of new vehicles during boom and slump periods New emission standards  and rise in ride sharing services and used car sales are weighing on the demand for new vehicle sales  Amid economic slowdown concerns and weak credit growth  consumers are getting more inclined toward used vehicles With a shift toward electric and self driving vehicles  automakers are re orienting their business models  Technological development with regard to electric  autonomous and connected cars demands huge investment  which is then passed on to consumers  Rising prices of new cars and low discounts to buyers have tamed consumer demand and consequently resulted in decline in new vehicle sales In addition to these  the lucratively priced  high quality used vehicles inventory has prompted consumers to think about the alternatives of buying new cars  This resulted in higher demand for used vehicles and supported its prices through 2019 Notably  digital revolution is disrupting used car retailing  Increased use of dedicated online sites to sell used cars is having a positive impact on the used car market  The presence of several online car sales sites has enabled buyers to pick a used car through online sites Data Validating the Used Vehicle Market BoomPer Statista   the used vehicle market was more than twice the size of the new vehicle market every year from 2000 to 2018 in the United States  Notably  the U S  used and new vehicle sales in 2018 had amounted to 40 4 and 17 2 million units  respectively While full year 2019 figures for used vehicle sales and average price have not been released yet  average selling price of used cars is also on the rise  Per National Automobile Dealer Association   NADA    the average transaction price for the same through the first six months of 2019 was  20 835  higher than the year ago level of  20 390  According to NADA  average used vehicle department sales in the first nine months of 2019 totaled  15 2 million  suggesting a3 7  year over year uptick  In contrast  average new vehicle department segment sales through the first nine months of 2019 had declined 1  year over year Per JD Power  dealers had generated average gross profit of  140 on a mass market new car in 2019  whereas profit on used cars came in at  950  Further  used trucks made handsome profits of  1 200 per unit versus  540 each for new trucks What to Expect Down the RoadRising prices for new vehicles and weakening credit conditions are likely to result in new vehicle sales decline in 2020 as well  Omni channel retailing and high number of off lease supply are anticipated to offer a wide variety of options to shoppers in the used vehicle market The used car industry is highly fragmented and the situation is not expected to change anytime in 2020  Notably  the biggest used vehicle retailer  CarMax   NYSE KMX   holds roughly 3  market share in the industry  This offers opportunity for new players to enter the market easily  However  competition is expected to remain high Used car demand from mass market brands is expected to remain strong  In 2019  small and midsized cars witnessed stronger price appreciation than spacious vehicles like trucks or SUVs and the trend is likely to continue in 2020  While the share of trucks and SUVs in the used vehicle market will continue to grow  higher supply of these vehicles coming back to market may lower their resale value Notably  the volume of off lease vehicles returning to market peaked at  4 1 million this year  The inventory level in 2020 is expected to either remain stable or decline slightly  Per J D  Power  15 35 million used vehicles  upto five years old  had returned to the market in 2019 and the company forecasts 15 28 million vehicles to come back to the market in 2020  While this does not suggest a huge decline  still the ebbing supply is likely to support the selling price of used vehicles Anticipated BeneficiariesThe automotive industry primarily consists of two types of companies   a handful of multinational auto giants and numerous retailers  While the first group is mainly engaged in the production of various types of vehicles  the latter deals with both new and used vehicles While highly priced new vehicles   owing to mounting R D costs   could deter debt weary millennials to make big ticket purchases  the demand for used vehicles is likely to remain robust  This has brightened the prospects of the below mentioned auto companies that deal in used cars Sonic Automotive  Inc    NYSE SAH    The stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months and looks poised to continue its bull run in 2020 Markedly  Sonic s pre owned vehicle chain  EchoPark is growing  This is expected to boost the firm s profitability  going forward  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  firm expects sales and earnings to witness year over year growth of 8  and 16 1   respectively  in fiscal 2020 You can see  Penske Automotive Group  Inc    NYSE PAG    Penske is anticipated to benefit from acquisitions  and the opening of dealerships in the United States and European markets  The company s product diversification  stand alone used vehicle supercenters and enhanced digital capabilities bode well  The Zacks Rank  2  Buy  firm expects sales and earnings to grow 2 2  and 8 2  year over year in fiscal 2020 CarMax  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  firm looks well poised to sustain previous year s momentum in 2020  backed by store expansion efforts and focus on the used car market  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 and 2021 earnings indicates year over year improvement of 8 1  and 8 1   respectively AutoNation  Inc    NYSE AN    One of the largest automotive retailers in the United States  AutoNation s brand extension strategy of

14948,236463,KMX,Is CarMax  KMX  A Potential Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CarMax Inc    NYSE KMX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CarMax has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 98  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 47  If we focus on the long term PE trend  CarMax s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18 09 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that CarMax has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 73  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CarMax stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  CarMax has a P S ratio of about 0 74  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 54x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CarMax currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CarMax a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for CarMax is just 1 33  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 54  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  KMX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though CarMax might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives KMX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen none up and five down in the same time period  This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 2 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CarMax  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat sluggish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineCarMax is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 27  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  5

118939,340454,KMX,CarMax  KMX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects CarMax  NYSE KMX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This used car dealership chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 67 billion  up 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 58  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CarMax 
For CarMax  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that CarMax will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CarMax would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 40  delivering a surprise of  5 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CarMax appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/carmax-kmx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200492529,200492529

118978,340493,KMX,Why CarMax  KMX  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  CarMax  NYSE KMX   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this used car dealership chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 5 99   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  CarMax was expected to post earnings of  1 33 per share  but it reported  1 40 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 26   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 49 per share  while it actually produced  1 59 per share  a surprise of 6 71  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for CarMax  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CarMax has an Earnings ESP of  0 50  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-12-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-carmax-kmx-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200489296,200489296

119070,340585,KMX,U S  stocks keep watch on Brexit  Yellen dovish on economic uncertainty,news,"Investing com   With no major economic data stateside on Tuesday  Wall Street traded slightly higher as market participants continued to contemplate the risk associated with the U K  s June 23 referendum on its membership in the European Union  EU  and while Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen continued to show a dovish stance in her semi annual testimony 
At 16 27GMT or 12 27ET  the Dow 30 rose 37 points  or 0 21   the S P 500 traded up 6 points  or 0 29   while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite advanced 5 points  or 0 10  
U S  markets continued keeping a close eye on developments regarding the possibility of a Brexit  as a vote to leave in the U K  s June 23 referendum on EU membership is known 
Online betting service Betfair showed on Tuesday that there was a 75  chance the British public would vote to stay in the EU 
Opinion polls published in the U K  continued to mostly show the vote to remain in the lead and the pound showed strength in early European trade on Tuesday  hitting its highest level since before the EU referendum date was announced 
However  in early U S  trade  investors appeared to change their minds  with GBP USD entering negative territory as a Survation poll appeared to remind traders that both sides where neck and neck 
Indeed  JP Morgan did warn that the race was too close to call  so market participants may have decided to take risk off the table with only two days to go before the vote 
Stateside  Yellen appeared before the Senate Banking Committee and insisted on the fact that the Fed still anticipated a gradual increase in rate hikes  but admitted that  considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains  
She noted to her concern about the recent weak employment reading  pace of investment and low productivity growth  although the May jobs report was expected to be  transitory  
With regard to external risks  Yellen once again referenced the Brexit referendum and reiterated that  a U K  vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions  
The Fed chief also mentioned China s rebalancing among the primary risks to the global economic outlook  precisely on a day in which the People s Bank of China  PBOC  admitted that the country s economy continued to face a relatively large downward pressure 
Despite repeating the Fed s outlook for a gradual increase in interest rates  Yellen s speech appeared to be slightly more dovish  as it more clearly left the door open interest rate cuts 
While insisting that U S  monetary policy was data dependent and stronger readings could imply a more rapid tightening path  she also added the possibility of the opposite situation 
 Conversely  if the economy were to disappoint  a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate   Yellen said 
The possibility of a rate cut was not mentioned in the June 15 statement  while the Yellen s only mentioned the idea once during the press conference 
 Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock   she stated 
In Tuesday s testimony  Yellen did not clarify what would be considered a disappointment 
In any case  the Fed chair will repeat her same speech to the House of Representatives  Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday  though market players will pay attention to the question and answer period to see if Yellen reveals any further details in her testimony 
Furthermore  Fed governor Jerome Powell was scheduled to deliver a speech on Tuesday at 18 30GMT  or 14 30ET 
Meanwhile  crude fell for the first time in three days as market players looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U S  stockpiles of crude and refined products

Stemberg pioneered the office superstore industry when he authored the business plans for Staples in the mid 1980s  Stemberg  as legend has it  developed the idea to create an office supply chain store shortly after he was unable to locate a ribbon for his printer when a local dealer closed its doors for the Labor Day holiday  In 1986  the Harvard University and Harvard MBA alum opened the first Staples in the Boston neighborhood of Brighton  before expanding the company into Canada only five years later  By the company s 10th anniversary  Staples already surpassed  3 billion in sales after opening subsidiaries into Europe  
In total  Stemberg spent 16 years as Staples  CEO while leading a Fortune 500 company that now produces annual revenues in excess of  20 billion a year  
Along the way  Stemberg forged a close relationship with 2012 U S  republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney  who served on the company s Board of Directors for 15 years and helped develop its business model  Stemberg s idea for Staples may have never gained traction without the funding from Bain Capital  the private equity firm co founded by Romney  
At the 2012 Republican National Convention  Stemberg paid homage to his longtime friend by painting a vivid picture of Romney s sharp business acumen  even at a young age  
 Mitt was not a typical investor  he was a true partner   Stemberg said in a speech on August  30  2012   Where some saw an unproven new business he saw a store that could save people money  He recognized that efficiency creates value   
 He never looked at Staples as merely a financial investment  He saw the engine of prosperity it could become   
After stepping down as the CEO of Staples  Stemberg became a managing general partner at Highland Consumer Partners  focusing on retail and consumer services companies  Stemberg also served on the boards of  CarMax  N KMX   Inc   City Sports  David s Tea   Guitar Center  Indochino  J McLaughlin  Lululemon Athletica and Pharmaca

119210,340725,KMX,Are Investors Undervaluing CarMax  KMX  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company value investors might notice is CarMax  NYSE KMX   KMX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 15 95 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 18 39  Over the past year  KMX s Forward P E has been as high as 16 71 and as low as 11 39  with a median of 14 39 
KMX is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 27  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  KMX s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 42  Over the last 12 months  KMX s PEG has been as high as 1 35 and as low as 0 77  with a median of 1 05 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is KMX s P B ratio of 4 17  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 11 44  Over the past year  KMX s P B has been as high as 4 28 and as low as 2 88  with a median of 3 65 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  KMX has a P S ratio of 0 75  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 17 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that KMX has a P CF ratio of 13 71  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 24 40  KMX s P CF has been as high as 15 98 and as low as 9 71  with a median of 12 84  all within the past year 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that CarMax is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  KMX feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-carmax-kmx-right-now-200442510,200442510
119211,340726,KMX,Can Value Investors Consider CarMax  KMX  A Worthy Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CarMax  Inc    NYSE KMX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CarMax has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 39  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  CarMax s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18 62 over the past five years The stock s PE compares quite favorably with the Retail Wholesale Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 01  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  CarMax has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 10  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CarMax stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CarMax has a P S ratio of just 0 76  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 32x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CarMax currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CarMax a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for CarMax is just 1 28  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 50  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though CarMax might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives KMX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been bullish  The current quarter has seen two estimates go down in the past sixty days compared to four upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen two down and seven up in the same time period This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 1 5  over the past two months  the current year estimate has also shot up 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CarMax  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCarMax is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among Top 25  of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  2 instill investors  optimism in the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  a satisfactory past industry performance  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in KMX Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to

119280,340795,KMX,Is CarMax  KMX  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company to watch right now is CarMax  NYSE KMX   KMX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 16 21  while its industry has an average P E of 18 07  KMX s Forward P E has been as high as 16 71 and as low as 11 39  with a median of 14 39  all within the past year 
Investors will also notice that KMX has a PEG ratio of 1 29  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  KMX s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1 39  Over the past 52 weeks  KMX s PEG has been as high as 1 35 and as low as 0 77  with a median of 1 05 
Investors should also recognize that KMX has a P B ratio of 4 22  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 11 43  KMX s P B has been as high as 4 22 and as low as 2 88  with a median of 3 65  over the past year 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  KMX has a P S ratio of 0 79  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 19 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that KMX has a P CF ratio of 13 88  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  KMX s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 23 77  Within the past 12 months  KMX s P CF has been as high as 15 98 and as low as 9 71  with a median of 12 84

119281,340796,KMX,Is CarMax  KMX  Stock Outpacing Its Retail Wholesale Peers This Year ,opinion,"The Retail Wholesale group has plenty of great stocks  but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers  Has CarMax  NYSE KMX  been one of those stocks this year  Let s take a closer look at the stock s year to date performance to find out 
CarMax is a member of the Retail Wholesale sector  This group includes 224 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of  3  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  KMX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for KMX s full year earnings has moved 2 88  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
According to our latest data  KMX has moved about 41 72  on a year to date basis  Meanwhile  stocks in the Retail Wholesale group have gained about 20 32  on average  As we can see  CarMax is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
Breaking things down more  KMX is a member of the Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  which includes 5 individual companies and currently sits at  30 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  this group has gained an average of 22 12  so far this year  meaning that KMX is performing better in terms of year to date returns 
Investors in the Retail Wholesale sector will want to keep a close eye on KMX as it attempts to continue its solid performance ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-carmax-kmx-stock-outpacing-its-retailwholesale-peers-this-year-200437054,200437054
119282,340797,KMX,CarMax  KMX  Is Up 1 39  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at CarMax  NYSE KMX   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  CarMax currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if KMX is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this used car dealership chain holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For KMX  shares are up 1 39  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is up 0 59  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 67  compares favorably with the industry s 3 69  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of CarMax have risen 19 73   and are up 16 25  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 93  and 11 38   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to KMX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  KMX is currently averaging 2 231 640 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with KMX 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KMX s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 14 to  5 27 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that KMX is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep CarMax on your short list ",2019-07-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/carmax-kmx-is-up-139-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200437648,200437648

119313,340828,KMX,CarMax  KMX  Q1 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"CarMax  NYSE KMX  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 59 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 49 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 33 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 71   A quarter ago  it was expected that this used car dealership chain would post earnings of  1 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 13  delivering a surprise of 8 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
CarMax  which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  posted revenues of  5 37 billion for the quarter ended May 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 77   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 79 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CarMax shares have added about 32 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 8  
What s Next for CarMax 
While CarMax has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CarMax was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 33 on  5 01 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 16 on  19 30 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts is currently in the top 40  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/carmax-kmx-q1-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200433787,200433787

CarMax stock has being climbing the charts since a late March post earnings bull gap  Year to date  the security has added just over 30   and after consolidating atop the 40 day moving average and  76 mark  KMX touched a record high of  84 99 this past Monday  June 17 

Digging into CarMax s earnings history  the stock has closed higher the day after earnings in six of the last eight quarters    including a 9 6  surge in March  as well as a 12 9  gain this time last year  Over the past two years  the shares have swung an average of 5 6  the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 8 7  swing for Friday s trading 
Looking toward analyst sentiment  CarMax stock has scored several bull notes ahead of earnings  Just this week  KMX saw price target hikes from both Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  and RBC    to  90 and  92  respectively  Likewise  the security hosts 10  buy  or better ratings  just one  hold   and zero  sells   However  the consensus 12 month price target of  85 46 is just a hair s breadth from current levels  Should the company once again report stronger than expected earnings  there s room for additional price target increases 
A strong earnings showing could also shake loose some shorts  Short interest surged more than 30  in the most recent reporting period  and now accounts for nearly 13  of KMX s total available float  At the stock s average pace of trading  it would take more than 12 sessions to buy back these bearish bets    ample fuel for a potential short squeeze to drive the shares to new heights ",2019-06-21,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shorts-circle-carmax-stock-before-earnings-200433520,200433520

119340,340855,KMX,Avoid These Overvalued Momentum Stocks,opinion,"As the market reaches record levels despite no real profit growth  diligence matters more than ever  Irrational exuberance can drive stocks to dangerously high levels in the short term  If you own momentum stocks with poor fundamentals  your portfolio could take big hits when fickle noise traders suddenly decide to sell 
These stocks are some of the best performing so far in 2019  but they have misleading earnings and significant downside risk  Carvana Co   CVNA   67 share  and Rogers Corporation  ROG   171 share  are in the Danger Zone 
Stock Valuations Don t Only Go Up
Per Figure 1  CVNA and ROG are up 106  and 72  year to date  YTD  respectively  which greatly outpaces the 17  YTD return of the S P 500  However  the fundamentals of their businesses remain weak and do not justify their valuations 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The momentum that investors are chasing could end soon  In  Big Tech Still Dominates Economic Earnings Growth   we showed that despite reported profit growth  economic earnings declined across the market in 2018 after removing the impact of tax cuts  Artificially elevated earnings cannot support overvalued stocks indefinitely 
When the music stops for momentum stocks  the results can be devastating  Look no further than the fourth quarter of 2018  when CVNA and ROG were down 43  and 30  respectively  compared to a 14  decline in the S P 500  Investors would be wise to take their gains  or avoid entering at these high levels  before the next downturn in these momentum stocks 
Carvana Co   NYSE CVNA   Unattractive Rating 
Carvana aims to simplify the car buying experience by allows consumers to view  analyze  and purchase a car directly from their computer or mobile device  While a great proposition for consumers  the business model is not so great at creating shareholder value 
Misleading Earnings  From 2016 2018  CVNA s GAAP net income improved from   114 million to   67 million  Meanwhile  economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business  fell from   112 million to   315 million  per Figure 2 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
This disconnect between GAAP net income and economic earnings is partially attributed to a net  155 million in non operating income that artificially improves CVNA s GAAP net loss  We add back  193 million in reported losses attributable to non controlling interests  Due to Carvana s status as a holding company  it is able to remove these losses and  therefore  improve its reported bottom line  Only by adding this loss back to economic earnings can we calculate the true operating profits of the business  regardless of the company s corporate structure 
Economic earnings also account for changes to the balance sheet  from which we made the following adjustments 
 109 million  17  of reported net assets  in off balance sheet operating leases
 2 million   1  of reported net assets  in asset write downs
By adding these items back to invested capital  we hold CVNA accountable for all capital invested in the business  These adjustments  when combined with a rising weighted average cost of capital  11 2  in 2018  up from 9 8  in 2016   increase the capital charge and decrease economic earnings 
In addition to negative and declining economic earnings  Carvana faces significant competition and has yet to prove its online centric business model can lead to sustained profitability in a highly fragmented market  Of the 19 auto vehicles  parts  and services retailers under coverage  only Carvana has negative NOPAT margins and return on invested capital  ROIC   Despite the issues  CVNA is priced as if it will immediately achieve profitability  but also garner a significantly greater share of the market 
Shares Are Now Overvalued  We re not alone when we point out how overvalued CVNA is    the stock is one of the most shorted stocks in the market  When we use our reverse DCF model to quantify the future cash flow expectations baked into the current stock price  we re not sure anyone can make a straight faced argument for owning CVNA 
To justify its current price of  67 share  CVNA must immediately achieve 8  NOPAT margins  vs   11  in 2018  and grow revenue by 20  compounded annually for the next 15 years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario  For reference  CarMax  NYSE KMX  earned a 5  NOPAT margin in 2018  In this scenario  Carvana would generate over  27 billion in revenue 13 years from now  compared to CarMax s  18 billion in revenue in 2018 
In other words  simply to justify the current stock price  one must believe Carvana can instantly become more profitable and generate more revenue than the current largest used car dealership in the United States  CarMax  
Even if Carvana can leverage its online platform to achieve 6  NOPAT margins  slightly higher than CarMax   and grow revenue by 25  compounded annually  the stock is worth just  43 share today   a 36  downside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
Each of these scenarios also assumes CVNA is able to grow revenue  NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets  This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are  For reference  CVNA s invested capital has grown on average  276 million  14  of 2018 revenue  each year over the past three years 
Rogers Corporation  NYSE ROG   Very Unattractive Rating
Rogers Corporation  an electronic materials components provider  has completed numerous acquisitions in recent years that  on the surface  appear accretive  However  when we do proper diligence on the earnings  we find that the company s fundamentals are headed the opposite direction of reported results and cannot justify the stock s lofty valuation 
Misleading Earnings  In 2018  GAAP net income grew 8  YoY  from  80 million to  88 million  while economic earnings fell from  7 million to   8 million  per Figure 3 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
In its 10 K  we found non recurring items that both increase and decrease reported profits  such as  3 million in other income on the income statement and  1 million in transaction costs found on page 52  While the net impact of all these items was 
We also added the following adjustments to ROG s balance sheet 
 78 million  7  of reported net assets  in accumulated other comprehensive loss
 76 million  6  of reported net assets  in accumulated asset write downs
 10 million  1  of reported net assets  in operating leases
By including these items in invested capital  we hold ROG accountable for all capital invested in the business  These adjustments  when combined with a rising weighted average cost of capital  8 7  in 2018  up from 8 4  in 2017   increase the capital charge and decrease economic earnings 
The company s numerous acquisitions over the past five years have failed to create shareholder value  Since 2014  ROG has spent over  430 million on acquisitions  36  of 2018 invested capital   These acquisitions have helped NOPAT grow 9  compounded annually over the past five years  Unfortunately for shareholders  ROG s invested capital has grown 17  compounded annually over the same time  ROG s balance sheet growing faster than profits drove its ROIC  the real driver of shareholder value  down from 10  in 2014 to its current 8  
Shares Are Overvalued  After rising 72  in the first few months of 2019  it should come as no surprise that ROG is significantly overvalued  The surprising part is just how high expectations for future cash flows are 
To justify its current price of  171 share  ROG must achieve 15  NOPAT margins  higher than the company record of 11  achieved in 2017 and 2006  and grow NOPAT by 15  compounded annually for the next decade  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario  These expectations seem overly optimistic for a firm that is expected to grow EPS by only 6  next year 
Even if ROG can achieve its peak 11  NOPAT margins  compared to 10  in 2018  and grow NOPAT by 7  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth just  87 share today   a 49  downside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
As with CVNA above  each of these scenarios also assumes ROG is able to grow revenue  NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets  This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are  For reference  ROG s invested capital has grown on average  116 million  13  of 2018 revenue  each year over the past five years ",2019-05-08,Kyle Guske II,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avoid-these-overvalued-momentum-stocks-200418743,200418743
119341,340856,KMX,Can CarMax  KMX  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering CarMax  NYSE KMX   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry 
This used car dealership chain has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 29  
For the most recent quarter  CarMax was expected to post earnings of  1 04 per share  but it reported  1 13 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 65   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 01 per share  while it actually produced  1 09 per share  a surprise of 7 92  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for CarMax lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CarMax has an Earnings ESP of  2 80  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on June 21  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-carmax-kmx-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200426137,200426137

119346,340861,KMX,Will RH s Pricing Power Combat Slower Demand In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,RH   NYSE RH   is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2019  ended May 4  results on Jun 12  after the closing bell In the last reported quarter  this leading luxury home furnishing retailer s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6   Markedly  the company beat expectations in each of the last four quarters  with the average being 22 9  Meanwhile  it missed revenue expectation by 2 2  in the last reported quarter  Nonetheless  its adjusted earnings and revenues   including recall accrual  grew 78  and 0 3   respectively  from the year ago level How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from RH prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 60 days at  1 54  This indicates an increase of 15 8  from the year ago reported earnings of  1 33 per share  Revenues are expected to increase 4 6  year over year to  583 million Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayLuxury home sales slowed down in the first quarter than the fourth quarter of last year  Luxury homes in high tax areas of the state are faced with a decreasing number of potential buyers but an increase in potential sellers  given the material loss of deductions under Trump s new tax plan  Weakness in the core business due to market volatility  continued softness in the housing market over the last few quarters  and its ongoing exit from unprofitable and non strategic businesses will likely impact RH s revenues in the to be reported quarter That said  despite a soft sales environment  RH s promotional activities  increased pricing activities  spring sale and a modest uptick in discounts at limited outlet stores are expected to offset the aforementioned headwinds to some extent Overall  the company expects revenues for the quarter in the range of  583  588 million  up 4 5  year over year  Meanwhile  RH has been posting strong bottom line growth  buoyed by focus on improving profit margins rather than chasing for sales  The trend is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter as well  The company has been benefiting from higher margins  lower tax rate  and initiatives to create a new and different shopping experience with the addition of hospitality  restaurants and cafes  in new Full Line Design Galleries  These positives are expected to boost results in the quarter to be reported Meanwhile  RH has been working on cost saving initiatives such as redesigning its supply chain  reducing inventory  improving product margins and so on However  increased shipping and labor costs  as well as modest pressure from RH s outlet segment may partially restrict margin improvement  Again  more discounts in its outlet stores are likely to weigh on merchandise margins  Meanwhile  increased pricing activities are likely to offset higher product costs from Chinese tariffs For the to be reported quarter  it expects adjusted gross margin in the band of 38 6 38 9  versus 38  in the year ago period  Adjusted operating margin is projected in the range of 10 10 6  compared with 9 6  reported in the year ago quarter  Adjusted SG A expenses  as a percentage of revenues  are expected in the 28 5 28 2  band compared with 28 5  reported a year ago Notably  adoption of ASC 842 accounting standard is expected to act as a headwind to its bottom line Overall  fiscal first quarter earnings per share are projected to grow between  1 47 and  1 58 What the Zacks Model UnveilsRH does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for KMX that show why this used car dealership chain shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For KMX  shares are up 2 35  over the past week while the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry is up 0 62  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 1 73  compares favorably with the industry s 4 05  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of CarMax have increased 31 81  over the past quarter  and have gained 9 32  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 07  and 5 8   respectively 
Investors should also take note of KMX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  KMX is averaging 1 412 225 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with KMX 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KMX s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 12 to  5 15 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that KMX is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep CarMax on your short list ",2019-06-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/carmax-kmx-is-up-235-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200430113,200430113

119415,340930,KMX,Why CarMax  KMX  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  CarMax  NYSE KMX   which belongs to the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Wholesale   Parts industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This used car dealership chain has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 78  
For the last reported quarter  CarMax came out with earnings of  1 09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 01 per share  representing a surprise of 7 92   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 22 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 24 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 64  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for CarMax lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CarMax has an Earnings ESP of  0 96  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on March 29  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-carmax-kmx-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200401520,200401520

What s Next for CarMax

Ahead of earnings  there s been a huge increase in interest for long puts  suggesting traders are betting on a move lower from the car sales specialist  The 10 day put call volume ratio at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  stands at 3 51  ranking in the 88th annual percentile  Similarly  its Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  comes in at 4 39  only 5 percentage points from an annual high  showing put open interest more than quadruples call open interest among contracts expiring within three months 
This put skew is due to recent increases at the April 57 50  58  and 61 puts  with most of the trades occurring at the ask price  These three contracts are now the top open interest positions for CarMax  The weekly 3 29 59 strike put also saw a large rise in open interest during the past 10 days 
On the charts  the security is trading at  63 77  recently pushing past the 80 day moving average and a trendline connecting lower highs since late October  The equity will now face off with the  65  70 area that blocked its last two breakout attempts

Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CarMax 
For CarMax  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CarMax will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CarMax would post earnings of  1 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 24  delivering a surprise of  1 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CarMax doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/carmax-kmx-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200368244,200368244

119535,341050,KMX,US GDP Hits 3  Despite Twin Hurricanes  5 Top Gainers,opinion,The nation s gross domestic product  GDP  grew at a faster pace than forecasted in the third quarter  indicating signs of resilience from consumers and businesses  The expansion dispelled qualms that hurricanes Harvey and Irma would hamper production levels In fact  the economy recorded its best 6 month stretch of growth in 3 years  a sign that it might be recovering from the long spell of slow growth  An uptick in consumer spending and business investment in equipment boosted economic growth  Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances  Hence  it seems judicious to invest in areas where consumers have led the way U S  GDP Grows 3   Storm Impact NullifiedThe U S  economy expanded at a solid 3  seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 2017  according to Commerce Department data  Such an expansion came on the heels of 3 1  growth in the second quarter  It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3  growth or more since mid 2014 for the economy The economy shook off the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma were expected to impede growth in the July September quarter  The hurricanes inflicted massive damage in Texas and Florida during August and September Production at factories  offices and transportation centers were interrupted  Precisely  the storms disrupted fuel production in Texas and agricultural production in Florida  The U S  economy  in fact  lost 33 000 jobs last month  marking the first month of decline in employment in seven years Economy Gains on Solid Consumer SpendingNevertheless  the economy was boosted by solid consumer spending  The main engine of the economy grew at 2 4  over the quarter after a 3 3  gain in the second quarter  Such an uptick in household outlays is commendable since lower spending was anticipated owing to the storms Meanwhile  consumers have stepped up purchases of durable goods including long lasting products like refrigerators  Spending on motor vehicles was driven by the need to replace damaged cars  Needless to say  a steady job market buoyed household optimism  while low borrowing costs will provide the wherewithal to sustain spending A clearer view of last month s labor market data  in fact  showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside  the U S  employment scenario is continuing to tighten  The unemployment rate declined to 4 2  in September  the lowest since February 2001  while wages increased 0 5  to an average of  26 55 an hour  per the Labor Department  In fact  in the last 12 months  hourly pay increased 2 9   up from 2 7  in the prior month and also in line with a post recession high Business Investments Ramp Up The first reading of the GDP also showed continued strength in business investment  Nonresidential investment  which includes outlays on equipment  structures and intellectual property increased at a 3 9  annual rate in the third quarter Among other bright spots  business equipment investment climbed 8 6  for a fourth quarter of growth  the longest streak since 2014  However  residential investments and national defense spending  to name a few  saw declining investments in the said quarter Overall  the economy continues to be in good shape and has expanded for nine straight quarters since the recession  Renowned economists also gave a positive view on the economy Economist ViewsPaul Ashworth  chief U S  economist at Capital Economics    The 3  growth rate will be welcomed by the White House and demonstrates that the hurricanes ended up having little lasting impact on the economy  Michael Feroli  chief U S  economist at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM     The gain in equipment investment shows businesses may be getting confident about the expansion  both here in the U S  and abroad   He added that  consumers stepped down a little from the second quarter but their spending still expanded at a decent pace  Steven Blitz  chief U S  economist at TS Lombard    If the point of looking at Q3 data is to confirm whether the Fed is on track for a series of quarterly 25bp increases in policy rates  consider the point was made  5 Potential GainersAs consumers continue to increase their spending  big ticket items like auto and auto parts stand to gain  In fact  other durable goods like appliances  furniture  jewelry  consumer electronics and sporting goods are also affected as spending plays a major role in determining their revenues  Durables have an extended product life and are not typically worn out within a short span of time Significantly higher equipment spending also calls for investing in such a space  We have  thus  selected five solid

119549,341064,KMX,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  General Motors  Volkswagen  Fiat Chrysler And CarMax,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 7  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Autos  Part 3  including General Motors Company  NYSE    NYSE GM        Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG  OTCMKTS    OTC VLKAY        Fiat Chrysler  NYSE    NYSE FCAU       and CarMax Inc  NYSE    NYSE KMX       Industry  Autos  Part 3Link  Modest sales in emerging markets have been a boon for the auto sector lately  However  there are a few challenges that are being faced by the auto sector  In fact  automakers are witnessing a revolutionary shift in their operations  The velocity at which consumers  preferences are changing  has promoted many automakers to reconsider their strategies  Added to this is the compulsion of manufacturing electric and  green  cars  which are likely to bring in several changes in the industry There are a number of factors that raise concerns for the auto sector in both the short and the long run  Below  we discuss some of the key challenges that the auto sector might face in the coming months Safety Recall ExpensesSafety recalls and related costs have turned out to be a major issue for most automakers  Per the U S  Transportation Department  automakers recalled 53 2 million vehicles in the United States in 2016  setting a new record  In total  automakers announced nearly 927 recalls for safety issues in 2016  which is another record high The previous record for both the number of recalls and vehicles recalled was set in 2015  when automakers announced 900 recalls covering 51 1 million vehicles  Notably  these figures only cover the recalls in the United States  the global numbers are a lot higher Auto recall figures for 2017 are also expected to be high as a result of the defective Takata airbag inflators  which resulted in significant recalls between 2014 and 2016  The U S  regulators expect recalls to eventually affect roughly 42 million vehicles in the country  with nearly 70 million Takata airbags  This also marks the largest auto recall in the United States Recently  General Motors Company  NYSE       recalled around 800 000 pickup trucks across the globe  The recall includes 2014 models of Chevrolet Silverado 1500  as well as GMC Sierra 1500  which could lead to loss of power steering  Per company reports  the 2014 model trucks can come across as a temporary loss of power steering  majorly during low speed turning maneuvers  The recall includes approximately 690 000 vehicles from the United States  80 000 from Canada and approximately  25 000 from other markets  globally Meanwhile  Volkswagen AG s  OTCMKTS       emission scandal is responsible for a significant number of recalls  Also  EPA accused Fiat Chrysler  NYSE       of using software to manipulate emissions in vehicles that would have otherwise violated the Clean Air Act  This may again lead to a large number of recalls Strict regulatory implementation by the government and high fines imposed in recent years on many automakers for delay in reporting safety issues prompted a number of companies to proactively announce safety recalls  Recall related repair costs increase the financial burden of auto manufacturers  A massive recall can also hurt sales as consumers start questioning the brand s safety U S  Sales Set to PlateauFollowing two years of record volumes  most analysts believe that U S  auto sales are likely to plateau in 2017 Pent up demand from the recession period  which drove sales in the last few years  seems to have been satisfied  Moreover  with several rate hikes planned by the Fed  interest rates on auto loans might rise Vehicle sales in the United States have already been showing weakness throughout the year  Analysts are predicting sales to plateau at around 17 million annually for the foreseeable future after two consecutive years of record results  Sales have been falling as potential buyers have become more erratic despite generous incentives offered on vehicles  Those discounts  which erode profits of automakers  have recently spread to high margin pickup trucks and SUVs that have garnered strong demand amid low gas prices Slower Sales Growth in EuropeAlthough the European auto market is recovering  it is expected to witness slower growth this year  Per the IHS Markit report  light vehicle sales growth in 2017 is expected to slow down to 1  compared with growth of 6 2  in 2016  Uncertainty related to macro economic conditions and political developments remain in the region Declining Used Car PricesUsed car prices have been declining in the United States  The NADA Used Car Guide s used car index has been falling consistently over the last few months

119620,341135,KMX,Auto Sector Grapples With Safety Recalls  Softening U S  Sales,opinion,"Strong sales in all major markets have been a boon for the auto sector lately  However  there are certain challenges like high expenses related to auto recalls  The rate of sales growth in the U S  and Europe is also on the decline 
While there are several positives such as low gas prices  record U S  sales and impressive China sales  there are also a number of factors that raise caution in the short and the long term  Below  we discuss some of the key challenges that the auto sector might face in the coming months 
Safety Recall Expenses
Safety recalls and related costs have turned out to be a major issue for most automakers  Per the U S  Transportation Department  automakers recalled 53 2 million vehicles in the U S  in 2016  setting a new record  In total  automakers announced nearly 927 recalls for safety issues in 2016  which is another record high 
The previous record for both the number of recalls and vehicles recalled was set in 2015  when automakers announced 900 recalls covering 51 1 million vehicles  Notably  these figures only cover the recalls in the U S     the global numbers are much higher 
Auto recall figures for 2017 are also expected to be high due to the defective Takata airbag inflators  which resulted in significant recalls between 2014 and 2016  The U S  regulators expect recalls to eventually affect roughly 42 million vehicles in the country  with nearly 70 million Takata air bag inflators  This also marks the largest auto recall in the U S 
Meanwhile  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG s  VLKAY  emission scandal is responsible for a significant number of recalls  However  these are not included in the figures issued by the NHTSA as emission related problems fall under standard violation and not safety  Recently  the EPA accused Fiat Chrysler  FCAU  of using software to manipulate emissions in vehicles that would have otherwise violated the Clean Air Act  This may again lead to a large number of recalls 
Strict regulatory implementation by the government and high fines imposed in recent years on many automakers for delay in reporting safety issues prompted many companies to proactively announce safety recalls  Recall related repair costs increase the financial burden of auto manufacturers  A massive recall can also hurt sales as consumers start questioning the brand s safety 
U S Sales Set to Plateau
Following two years of record volumes  most analysts believe that U S  auto sales are likely to hit a plateau  Sales are expected to be significantly high this year but lower than 2016 
Pent up demand from the Great Recession  which drove sales in the last few years  seems to have been satisfied  Moreover  with several rate hikes planned by the Fed  interest rate on auto loans may rise  This will have a direct impact on sales volume  U S  auto sales in the first quarter of 2017 were the lowest first quarter sales since 2009 
Risk of Border Tax
President Trump is planning to impose taxes as high as 35  on import of Mexico made vehicles  While the policy is aimed at encouraging production in the U S   most automakers have been producing a significant proportion of their vehicles in Mexico to advantage from lower costs for long  This allows them to reduce the cost of production  which ensures profitability of low margin vehicle segments  A hefty border tax may force these automakers to reduce or completely stop production in Mexico  which can affect their bottom lines 
Slower Sales Growth in Europe
Although the European auto market is recovering  it is expected to witness slower growth this year  Per the   car sales growth in 2017 is expected to slow down to 1   compared to 6 8  growth witnessed in 2016  Uncertainty related to macro economic conditions and political developments remain in the region 
Declining Used Car Prices
Used car prices have been declining in the U S  The  s used car index has been falling consistently over the last few months  with an exception in March  In 2017  prices are expected to decline 6  year over year 
This has been supported by a large number of leased cars coming off of the lease  increasing the supply of used cars  A fall in the price of used cars will lead to a decline in the demand for new cars  Moreover  automakers may need to offer further incentives to boost new car sales 
Alternately  for companies such as CarMax Inc   NYSE KMX   dealing primarily in used cars  decline in the average selling price is expected to affect revenues 
Rising Delinquency Rates
Auto loans have been rising consistently over the last few years  touching a record  1 16 trillion in 2016  per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  While this rise in loans has been driving auto sales  consumers with the riskiest credit profiles saw the highest growth  This has led to a significant rise in auto loan delinquencies  For loan providers  as bad debts increase  the loans provided will also decline  affecting demand for vehicles 
Market Share Concentration
The majority share of the automobile market is held only by a few leading automakers  This makes the automobile sector highly competitive  The top 10 global automakers account for nearly 81  of total vehicles sold  according to marketrealist com 
Moreover  high dependence on these automakers makes auto parts  suppliers vulnerable to pricing pressure and production cut  Pricing pressure from automakers constricts margins of parts suppliers  Simultaneously  frequent production cuts by automakers to cope with market adjustments affect suppliers  operations 
Some auto industry suppliers that are dependent on a few major automakers are Meritor Inc   MTOR   Tenneco Inc   TEN  and Magna International Inc   MGA   The full list can be seen in this auto supplier page  
Bottom Line
The auto industry continues to face a number of challenges  As a result  we would advise investors to dump stocks with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  such as Autoliv  Inc   ALV   Mazda Motor Corp   MZDAY  and Aisin Seiki Co  Ltd  Unsponsored ADR  ASEKY  
Meanwhile  investors who continue to be optimistic about the sector can check out companies like Cummins Inc  NYSE CMI    CMI   Fox Factory Holding Corp  FOXF  and GKN  LON GKN  plc  GKNLY  
Cummins has an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 9 8   It recorded average earnings beat of 14 5  over the last four quarters  Cummins carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Fox Factory sports a Zacks Rank  1  The company has an expected earnings growth rate of around 16 6  for the long term  Fox Factory has a positive average surprise of 13 8  for the last four quarters 
GKN has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a long term growth rate of 6 3

119622,341137,KMX,The Market s Bullish Push Through Thursday s Trifecta ,opinion,"AT40   52 1  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   55 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   10 2  volatility index Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary One out of three 
The last event of  had the only notable impact on financial markets  With exit polls tabulated  news arrived that  although they will be the largest of the parties  The British pound  FXB  immediately sold off on the news  Against the dollar  GBP USD   the pound broke through uptrending support at the 50 day moving average  DMA  that had held since the last pullback  Against the yen  GBP JPY   the pound broke through 200DMA support but bounced back  The move against the euro  EUR GBP  did not generate much of technical significance as upper resistance seems to be holding firm 
GBP USD broke down below 50DMA support and left behind what looks like a topping pattern  almost like a head and shoulders 

GBP JPY has been in decline for almost a month  Previous breaks of 200DMA support have been short lived  Is this breakdown the one that sticks 

EUR GBP is only distinctive in that it stopped cold at resistance form previous peaks  Will a year long trading range stay largely intact 
Prime Minister Theresa May called the election in the hope that she could parlay a strong showing into a stronger negotiating position with the European Union over terms of Brexit that she would control  Now that May s gambit has failed  the pound will likely  over time  erase all its gains from the day May surprised markets with the call for elections  April 18th   Now markets must once again take seriously the prospect of political uncertainty over Brexit  Yet  it is instructive to note how the market s interpretation of Brexit has evolved  When voters approved Brexit  the pound practically crashed on fears that Brexit would ruin the UK economy  With the economy performing much better than initially expected  financial markets have tended to interpret May s  hard Brexit  approach  a complete and clean extrication from European Union rules and regulations  as a positive  The market now wavers on the prospect that the UK could still give in to some EU mandates  At a minimum  the return of uncertainty will make the pound once again particularly sensitive to daily Brexit headlines  First off  will Theresa May be forced to resign 
For now  I imagine that the pound will stabilize going into European trading and perhaps even mount a substantial relief rally going into U S  trading  I am preparing to fade such a rally 
Stateside  the S P 500  NYSE SPY  bid its time for the day  idling between the highs and the lows of the day   of former FBI Director James Comey s Congressional testimony barely registered on the general stock market  Indeed  under the covers  bullish waves kissed the shores all day  For example  the NASDAQ  NASDAQ QQQ  closed at another all time high  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  rallied for an impressive 1 2  gain that closed the ETF above its 50DMA  The small breakout briefly took XLF above February s breakout line and brought Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  much closer to the edge of a very bullish invalidation of the on going head and shoulders pattern 
The S P 500  SPY  was generally unfazed by the Thursday Trifecta

The NASDAQ  QQQ  quietly crept to another all time high 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  made a bullish move to invalidate its head and shoulders topping pattern 
I continue to watch financials closely  A clean breakout above the right shoulder of the H S pattern will likely motivate me to upgrade my short term trading call on the entire market from cautiously bullish to bullish  A lot of the action may hinge on the market s response going into and exiting the U S  Federal Reserve s pronouncement on monetary policy next week  June 14  
The financials were likely a big part of the reason that AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   soared by 5 percentage points  At the high of the day  AT40 gained 7 percentage points  This near bullish divergence with the flat S P 500 was significant  it paved the way for me to think incrementally more positively about the market s underlying foundation 
The volatility index provided the final word on market sentiment  The CBOE Volatility Index gapped down at the open and only traded in the green for brief spurts shortly after the open and near the close  Clearly  the market was largely satisfied with the day s activities 
The volatility index  the VIX  swooned to start the day  rallied off its lows  but still failed to register a gain on the day 
Beyond the indices and ETFs  three stock specific  mostly bullish themes caught most of my attention on the day  steel  retail  apparel   and autos 
Steel On May 31  2017  Peter Najarian of Najarian Family Office  also a host guest on CNBC s Fast Money  appeared on Nightly Business Report on a new segment called  Investor s Edge  to discuss his method for making money by tracking the trades of big institutional investors  His commentary on steel was particularly noteworthy 

 I own both of these  U S  Steel and AK Steel  U S  Steel is symbol X  AK Steel is AKS  And both of these have been seeing some decent money flow after a big selloff 
I mean  they were betting on the infrastructure spending that President Trump talked about  It didn t happen  They came all the way back down to where they were before the election  And now  people are betting maybe something happens in the second half of the year  and they want to get in for the last month of the second quarter  

While I am not interested here in betting on Trump s promises for the future  I am interested in following market sentiment  Today  U S  Steel  X  and other steel related stocks soared on more tariff news  With U S  Steel rallying well above its upper Bollinger  Band  BB   I decided to lock in profits  Najarian claims that the steel trade is a second half story so this trade should have room to run  I just do not want to sit still in steel longer than needed 
U S  Steel  NYSE X  is starting to turn the corner after a disastrous April earnings report that completed a full reversal from its post Trump gains 

Retail  Apparel  I have periodically chronicled the trials and tribulations of the retail sector  In the   I took a look at the ugly and the pretty extremes  Somewhere in the middle sits Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Ahead of the bulk of earnings for retailers  NBR brought in a retail analyst whom I recognized as having a particularly good track record  He claimed that certain luxury retailers like Nordstrom should survive the on going carnage in retail  That nod caught my attention as JWN has stayed on my radar ever since I called it out as  after the Ivanka kerfuffle  sorry  I have always wanted to find a reason to use that word   
After JWN plummeted in the wake of its May earnings report  I bought shares and then loaded up on a call spread for good measure with a long term expectation  However  the retail sell off that Macy s  M  sparked this week made me forget my original strategy  I stopped the bleeding in the shares and decided to just ride out the call spread  Imagine my mix of delight and dismay when I discovered this morning that JWN gapped up a whopping 7 points  or almost 20  
Nordstrom  JWN  gapped up well above 50DMA resistance on news that the Nordstrom family wants to take the company private  Sellers regained their composure enough to wipe out half those gains 
JWN lost half its gain by the close as a testament to the weight of bearishness in retail  If I still had my shares I certainly would have locked in my profits right at the open  Instead  I decided to keep holding my long term call spread in deference to my earlier strategy  I treated the fade as a gift and bought back half my original position of shares  I will definitely snatch back the other half if the market grants me that opportunity  JWN has become a retail value play and the prospect of going private should provide major support to that value 
Cars Talk of peak auto has gone on for a few years  The stocks of General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford  F  peaked all the way back in 2013 2014  I have mainly watched this story from the sidelines  Last year  I learned about new models for selling used cars that seek to reduce transaction costs and increase convenience  Shift  founded by Minnie Ingersoll  B S  computer science  MBA and 11 years at Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   GOOG    seems particularly promising  for example  see     It occurred to me that if this model works  established dealers like Carmax  NYSE KMX  will eventually get shoved out the way  Since then  KMX has experienced three main swoons with another one likely underway now  My latest short position is now back in the green  KMX is still up since I got my original bearish idea  so I know the market has yet to get concerned about potential future industry disruption   At some point  I hope to write in detail on this space given I know someone who used Shift to buy a car after I made a recommendation  

Karmax  KMX  has bounced convincingly form its last post earnings low  Yet a 50 200DMA breakout is on the verge of completing an important reversal 
Along the way  I stumbled upon Carvana  NYSE CVNA   The company went IPO on April 28  2017  I first learned about it after seeing the initiation of analysts on May 23  When I discovered that the company sells cars through vending machines  I scoffed  Yet  unlike Snapchat  SNAP  where   I decided to give CVNA a swing as pure speculation  Within days I had to sell to stop the bleeding  Unlike SNAP again  CVNA managed to report earnings that greatly pleased investors and traders  The stock soared to a closing all time high and landed right back on my radar  The stock soared again today only to fade back to its upper BB  I snapped up a small number of shares right there to re speculate 

The first earnings report for Carvana  CVNA  did what a flurry of bullish analyst calls could not do  drive the stock to a new all time high 
And then there is Cars com  NYSE CARS   I first stumbled on this spin off in conjunction with news that IHS Markit  INFO  would join the S P 500 index to replace TEGNA Inc   TGNA  which planned to spin off CARS at the time  For three of the first 4 days  CARS did well  Based on that strength  I bought the dip on day  5  Much to my dismay  CARS continued to fall today  I doubled down with an eye to stop out at or near a close below the all time intraday low   I first learned about the out sized potential of investing in spin offs from     
Cars com  CARS   From the highs to the lows in a flash

119623,341138,KMX,The Week Ahead  Oil Closes Below Key Level  Tech In Focus  Amazon s Buy,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
The Week That Was

US indices closed at mixed levels at the end of last week with the Dow up  the S P 500 eking in a 0 1 percent increase and the NASDAQ down 0 9 percent after last week s fall in tech sector  The small cap Russell 2000 declined one percent 

Investors were reacting to Wednesday s widely expected but disappointing inflation release  ignoring the seemingly optimistic  interest rate hike  the third since the Trump reflation  as well as the Fed s plan to tackle its  4 trillion balance sheet  The 10 year Treasury yield already at a historic low fell again to 2 15  
The surprising  but disappointing core inflation data was outdone by the surprise of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and the Fed s lack of deterrence by it  As of now the Fed is acting in a unexpectedly hawkish manner  in stark contrast to last year s dovishness when the momentum was heading in the opposite direction  While inflation was rising in 2016  the Fed wanted to wait until it achieved its 2 percent target to act  but now that it s going the wrong way  it s convinced it will reach its target 
Given some of the weakness of the inflation data and also some of the slightly disappointing growth numbers  it seems that at this point the Fed should be done with their tightening cycle for 2017  although there remains a possibility of one more hike  Many investors remain unconvinced this will happen 
With regards to the Fed s balance sheet  it announced a full fledged  detailed plan to wind it down  It will be a very slow and predictable process  possibly taking up to five years if not more  Yellen described it as  watching paint dry  

The dollar also had a volatile week and closed the week at a loss 
There has been some concern from investors that the Chinese economy is starting to decelerate again  but news from the last couple of weeks has been encouraging 
Two weeks ago  trade numbers were released which showed import demand from China had improved significantly across several different commodities  an important signal of economic strength  and last week better than expected domestic retail sales and industrial production activity data was released as well  These numbers are important for investors given the critical role that China plays as a growth engine for emerging markets  economies 
Over the last year or so there has been an improvement in the emerging market cycle  and that dynamic coupled with their cheaper valuations  has been an important source of upside this year  There still remains a concern among investors  of Chinese fraud when it comes to their economic projections and reporting 
Oil extended its fall with a 2 45  decline  slipping a total of 9 75  4 week decline  on fears of a global oil glut and the continuation of the Gulf crisis 
Week Ahead
Tech  Fedspeak  Oil  Whole Foods

Continued focus on the tech industry  after last week s sudden drop in value 
The Fed s announcements may get more attention than usual  considering the Fed s sudden hawkishness  as the economy slows down 
US oil futures closed under  45  a key level  will it hold 
Will fallout from Amazon s bid for Whole Foods deepen 

Economic calendars may be working on a lighter schedule during the summer  but the Fed has a packed schedule of releases in the week ahead 
Investors are likely to continue to focus on the tech sector  which performed the worst on the S P  down 1 1 percent for the week 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  made a  13 7 billion bid on Whole Foods  which rattled retail and food shares  in which they took out  40 billion from their market capitalization  Speculations are abound that another buyer will enter a bidding war  and investors entered a frenzy  pushing up the price of the stock 9 65 percent above the  42 offered by Amazon  Further price fluctuations can be expected in the week ahead 
Inflation and other data is not quite up to expectations  and investors are wondering if the Fed is overoptimistic on its estimates for housing starts  retail sales  consumer inflation and consumer sentiment 
After the recent disappointing data  existing home sales may prove important  as will Friday s new home sales and manufacturing data  While investors will be ascertaining whether a pattern emerges  they would be equally interested whether a corresponding pattern emerges from the Fed s half dozen speakers  starting with New York Fed President Willian Dudley on Monday  to continue its current apparent lack of concern 

The price of oil proved a significant factor in the tech selloff  as investors rotated out of tech and into value stocks  including energy  Traders are betting whether the price will hold in the  45 per barrel level  it closed last week at  44 74 per barrel a decline of 2 4 percent  or if it will fall even lower towards the  40 price level  which is considered negative to stocks 
The global market structure may recalibrate  undergoing a shift next week  when MSCI will decide whether to include a group of China s mainland shares within its indexes  This would have a crucial effect on some large ETFs  such as the MSCI Emerging Markets  It would be good news  as it would give investors easier access to invest in Chinese markets  increasing the liquidity for the shares

119661,341176,KMX,The Week Ahead  What Can We Learn From The Trump Xi Meeting ,opinion,"We have a big economic calendar and potential Fed news  Those stories will take a back burner this week  My safest prediction is that we are about to see a new rash of China experts both in print media and on CNBC  These freshly minted pundits will be asking 
What will the Trump Xi meeting mean for the economy  and for stocks 
Last Week
Last week the news was mostly positive  but light  Markets continued the attention to the Trump Administration s next policy steps   especially the chances for tax reform 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a discussion about the aftermath of the ACA repeal decision  That was a good call  as assorted pundits explained what the next policy moves might be  The more adventurous speculated about whether the Freedom caucus would block changes in the debt ceiling or tax reform  Some of that discussion will continue in the early part of next week 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  She notes the overall weekly gain of 0 80  and the quarter one increase of 5 5   The biggest takeaway might be the general rebound from last week s market reaction to the failure of the ACA repeal 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasions something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
This week s news was slightly positive 
The Good

The Bad
Personal consumption spending missed expectations  The increase was only 0 1  despite an income increase meeting expectations of 0 4  growth  Steven Hansen    has a thorough analysis with excellent tables and charts 
Jobless claims moved slightly lower  to 258K  but the four week moving average moved higher  I am scoring this as  bad  because the series has moved a bit higher from the best levels   helps us to keep this in perspective with this interesting chart of claims compared to the labor force 

The Ugly

The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  but nominations are always welcome  There are many bogus claims and charts out there  I wrote about  last week  and the misleading recession forecasts that resulted  We should all encourage astute analysts to help on this front 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a very big week for economic data  featuring the most important reports 
The  A  List
Employment report  F   Expectations are in the 180K range  down from last month s 235K
ISM index  M   Continuing strength expected 
Auto sales  M   The concept of  peak auto  has some recent buzz  drawing attention to this private data 
ISM services  W   Wider scope than manufacturing  but a shorter history  Strength expected 
FOMC minutes  W   Will be scrutinized for hints about the pace of future rate hikes 
Initial jobless claims  Th   Is the series edging up from record low levels 
The  B  List
ADP employment change  W   A good independent read on job growth 
Construction spending  M   February data  but an important sector 
Factory orders  T   More February data of significance  Continuing strength expected 
Trade balance  T   Usually not a market mover  but will get extra attention this week 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
While the schedule is not as heavy as last week  FedSpeak will be featured on several days  The Thursday meeting between President Trump and China s President Xi Jinping could be extremely important for economic policy and the markets 
Next Week s Theme
This is a big week for economic data  We could usually expect daily analysis of the news  focusing on the Friday employment data  A secondary theme might be the emerging change in Fed policy  with speakers and the release of minutes on Wednesday 
Not this week  The visit of Xi Jinping and the meetings at Mar a Lago have significance extending beyond recent economic news  The commentary this coming week will raise the question 
What will the Trump Xi meeting mean for the economy and stocks 
No one knows what will happen  The best we can do is collect relevant facts and decide what to watch for  Here is some key background 
Trump is advertising a  tough  meeting   suggests the reasons and key issues 

He is sure to be coached by hardline China advisor Peter Navarro  who of cheating thieves  intent on global domination  After Trump s allegations that China had stolen jobs and a way of life from America s middle class on the campaign trail  the stage seems set for a clash  Sensitive topics could include the trade imbalance  China s over production of steel  North Korea s increasing militarization  and Beijing s insistence that it control the South China Sea  in defiance of international law  American CEOs are worried that the wrong move could and harm the US economy 


Xi is the most powerful and popular Chinese leader in decades  He is dismantling the  collective leadership  approach   explains and questions whether this will lead to needed reforms  After describing his takeover of key committees and battle against corruption  the article focuses on his mission 

All of this helps Mr Xi in his twofold mission  His first aim is to keep the economy growing fast enough to stave off unrest  while weaning it off an over dependence on investment in property and infrastructure that threatens to mire it in debt  Mr Xi made a promising start last November  when he declared that market forces would play a decisive role  not even Deng had the courage to say that   There have since been encouraging moves  such as giving private companies bigger stakes in sectors that were once the exclusive preserve of state owned enterprises  and selling shares in firms owned by local governments to private investors  Mr Xi has also started to overhaul the household registration system  a legacy of the Mao era that makes it difficult for migrants from the countryside to settle permanently in cities  He has relaxed the one child per couple policy  a Deng era legacy that has led to widespread abuses 


Chinese strategy is to reach Trump through his family   describes the background 

China seems to have grasped that the best way to influence Mr Trump is via his family  Chinese diplomats have gone out of their way to court Mr Kushner and Ivanka Trump  who were their guests of honour at the Chinese new year celebration in February  China has also looked favourably on Mr Trump s business  Since his inauguration it has approved dozens of pending trademark applications by The Trump Organization  The volume of applications to market Ivanka Trump s brand in China has also soared  This week  Kushner Companies   the family property group from which Jared has stepped back   ended talks to sell a prime piece of Manhattan real estate on very favourable terms to Anbang  a Chinese company  after members of Congress alleged a conflict of interest 


Possible outcomes   continues with the range of what we might expect 

At one extreme  Mr Trump could threaten to carry out his campaign vow to impose a 45 per cent tariff on Chinese imports   a step that would provoke a global trade war and fall foul of the World Trade Organisation  That would produce a similar outcome to Mr Trump s rancorous meeting with Angela Merkel last month  in which he presented her with a massive invoice for Germany s defence costs  At the other extreme  Mr Xi could package a few Chinese investments into easily tweetable jobs announcements  Last year China invested a record  45bn in the US   mostly in real estate  finance and entertainment

Best Advice for the Week Ahead
The right move often depends on your time horizon  Are you a trader or an investor 
Insight for Traders
We consider both our models and the top sources we follow 
Felix  Holmes  and Friends
We continue with a strongly bullish market forecast  All our models are now fully invested  The group meets weekly for a discussion they call the    In each post I include a trading theme  ideas from each of our five technical experts  and some rebuttal from a fundamental analyst  usually me  but sometimes a guest expert   We try to have fun  but there are always fresh ideas  Last week the focus was on  Voodoo Chart Reading  inspired by Michael Kahn  see below  
Top Trading Advice
Like everyone else  I like reading about Jesse Livermore  He enjoys a reputation as a great trader despite multiple bankruptcies and a life ending in suicide  That certainly is one measure of success 
 has a nice post highlighting Livermore trading rules from almost 80 years ago  Most still make plenty of sense  It would be a nice project for someone to analyze how these might be different under modern conditions  Out of the many rules I endorse  I especially like this one 

21  Few people ever make money on tips  Beware of inside information  If there was easy money lying around  no one would be forcing it into your pocket 

Brett Steenbarger remains at the top of trader  must reads   My favorite post this week is about   Many traders do not recognize how negative factors can affect their work  You need the ability to bounce back 
Chartered Market Technician  uses the  Voodoo  word in discussing charts  He has a great post on what you can and cannot expect to learn from your chart study  I especially like his dismissal of the  death cross  

First of all  the death cross occurs when the trend has already changed  That is the only way the math works  by the way  because the pattern is defined as the 50 day moving average crossing below the 200 day moving average  That cannot happen when prices are rising 
Anyway  in practice we often see the market bounce right as the cross happens  Why  Because typically it has been falling for a while already  Again  is has to be falling otherwise the short term average cannot drop under the long term average 
OK  Einsteins  I know we can make the math work with price spikes and outliers but roll with me here 
So  the market may be a bit oversold and it bounces  But overall the cross appeared because most likely something is wrong  Short of real voodoo telling us what s what that is all we can hope from charts  They do not tell us what will happen  They are meant to give us clues as to what to do 

Insight for Investors
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Michael Kitces great article   He presents an excellent history of retirement needs and alternatives  He also analyzes the consequences of each of the current choices  I especially like this element of the conclusion  an issue that we frequently discuss with clients 

In fact  arguably when thinking about a retirement portfolio  it s better to think in terms of  retirement cash flows  than   as what constitutes  income  for investment purposes  interest and dividends  but not principal  is different than what constitutes  income  for tax purposes  as interest and dividends might be tax free coming from a Roth  while principal may be fully taxable if withdrawn from a pre tax retirement account  

Nice work  with many great points  Please read the entire post 
Stock Ideas
 has updated the list of dividend champions  challengers  and contenders  This is always a good source of ideas  This week he features McGrath RentCorp  NASDAQ MGRC  and includes some analysis from Chuck Carnevale 
Chuck is back with a   NYSE UPS   The quantitative metrics are solid  so he takes on the key concern   the challenges in business to consumer deliveries  This is a typically first rate analysis 
 earnings driven analysis still favors energy stocks  Like everyone else  we will be paying even more attention to Brian next week as earnings season begins 
 agrees with the energy theme  and also features Under Armour  UA  and Lowes  LOW  
Our  always has some fresh ideas  There are ideas from five different approaches  Felix  who is most aligned with long term traders  likes Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   The most recent post provides descriptions of each model  You will probably identify with one of the characters  and your questions are welcomed 
Lee Jackson has five    if you think the  Trump magic  has worn off 
Yield Plays
 has some dividend ideas in health care 
 does a nice job in describing bond ladders  I especially like the rolling ladder  which we offer as a complement to higher yielding programs  Anyone interested in safe yield  with the potential to grow with the market  should read this post 
Emerging Europe 
Frank Holmes opines that the time has come 
Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  As usual  investors will find value in several of them  but my favorite is this week s best investment advice  see above   Other great posts included the question of   1 million or  5000 per month for your retirement  and the  about making financial decisions on your smartphone 
In his regular column  Seeking Alpha Editor  yet another important topic   diversification and what is added by ETFs  He cites   who provides a balanced discussion of diversification  stock picking  concentrated portfolios  and recent strong opinions  A timely point for discussion

Final Thoughts
A major change in leadership has everyone thirsting for information about possible policy changes  Stated positions from a candidate are not dependable  Those ideas might change once in office  or might prove infeasible  In the case of foreign policy  the range of possible results is especially wide  The President has a lot of flexibility  and many of the relationships have a personal quality 
This highlights the importance of this week s Trump Xi meeting  Like a top poker player  you should be looking for  tells  about true intentions  future policies  and the economic implications 
As is often the case  it is foolish to predict the specific outcome of these meetings  Readers sometimes expect a definitive answer to the week s question in my  final thought   That is not the mission of WTWA  I try to do two things 
Explain what will be the focus in the coming week 
Provide help with interpreting events 
It is important to recognize what you do not know  what is unknowable  and what is pure speculation  Pretending that you know a specific answer can be costly 
Given that setting  how can we prepare for this event  Most observers will be focused on specific policy implications  That is a mistake  I am interested in the following 
Overall tone and friendliness  I do not expect any golf  This will be an early test of how foreign leaders  aggressively criticized by Trump during the election campaign  respond to him as President 
Symbolic quality of the announced results  A tough line by the President  Some clear concessions by Xi 
Common ground  Will there be an emphasis on issues like North Korea 
Technical missteps  The China team consists of specialist on the specific issues   those who work only on these matters and have done so for years  The US team has dismissed the experts for a more general approach  Will this matter  Will it lead to blunders 
The most important consequence will be the implications for trade policy  One major viewpoint is that President Trump has engaged in tough talk to facilitate bargaining  The other is that he will instigate a trade war  Which is closer to the truth 
This week will provide the first hints  Stay tuned ",2017-04-02,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-what-can-we-learn-from-the-trump-xi-meeting-200180883,200180883

Fed Chair Yellen takes to the Hill
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen kicked off her two day semiannual monetary policy report to Congress  speaking to the Senate Banking Committee  In her prepared remarks  she noted that the economy has made further progress   However  the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently  suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate   she added  Yellen also stressed that the Central Bank believes the recent slowing in employment growth is  transitory  but it is watching the job market carefully  Moreover  she said a U K  vote to exit the European Union  EU  known as a Brexit  could have significant economic repercussions   Yellen concluded by saying the path of the fed funds rate will depend on economic and financial developments  Traders are paying close attention to the Q A session following her remarks  Yellen will conclude her testimony tomorrow in front of the House Financial Services Committee 
May s severely disappointing labor report and continued Brexit uncertainty have applied pressure on global bond yields 
Regardless of the efforts of the Federal Reserve  it s unlikely a major new expansion of private sector debt is coming  The debt supercycle  lasting over three decades  allowed demand growth to exceed underlying income growth  That era has seemingly died and continued sluggish growth for the U S  economy will likely continue to be a byproduct of that potential death 
Treasuries were little changed  while the U S  economic calendar was dormant today  The yields on the 2 year and 10 year notes were flat at 0 76  and 1 69   respectively  while the 30 year bond rate dipped by 1 basis point to 2 49  
Tomorrow  the economic front will awaken with the release of existing home sales  projected to rise 1 8  month over month  m m  to an annual rate of 5 55 million units in May  Investors should remain patient as positive signs are emerging  For the frustration in the stock market to end  we believe businesses need to pick up their capital spending but for now a relatively healthy consumer and housing are keeping the U S  economy afloat 
Europe modestly adds to recent rally  Asia mixed

119688,341203,KMX,As The Stock Market Levitates  Economic Activity Deteriorates,opinion,"In my latest issue of the Short Seller s Journal  I predicted a weak showing for July auto sales  Both General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford  NYSE F  missed Wall Street s forecast  With the magic of seasonal adjustments  the industry data overall was presented to show a  7  increase in overall sales vs  June  GM sales dropped 2  and Ford s sales fell 3  
Again  any overall industry gains can be attributed to mysterious  seasonal adjustments   June auto sales dropped 3 4  from May 
When Ford reported its Q2 earnings  Ford s auto finance division reported a decline in profits that reflected lower values realized at auction on cars returned after the lease expired 
Auto market weakness typically shows up first in the resale used market  I traded the auto supply sector junk bonds when I traded on Wall Street in the 1990s  which is why I m familiar with auto cycle dynamics   In addition  Ford Credit reported higher than expected credit losses 
My point here is that the auto industry  after being hyper stimulated by the Fed with  100s of billions of subprime quality car loans and leases  is going to head south   probably rather quickly  Our financial system is about to feel a huge shock from delinquent and defaulted car financing extended to people who could never really afford the payments 
Ford is already feeling it  CarMax  NYSE KMX  also reported bigger than expected losses in its car loan portfolio 
Housing is the other economic sector that has been hyper stimulated by the Fed and the Government with artificially low interest rates and taxpayer sponsored low  to no down payment mortgages 
Housing is going to head south quickly as well  This was evident with yesterday s construction spending report  June private construction spending fell  6  from May  non residential construction dropped its most since December  April construction spending was revised to down 2 9  from down 2  
Not only is construction spending declining  previously reported construction spending is being revised to show that it was weaker than originally reported 
The housing market data reported by the National Association of Realtors is tragically corrupted  Recently the NAR has been reporting an increase in first time buyers  Yet  the Census Bureau measured rate of home ownership continues to decline  Last week the CB reported the rate had dropped 62 9   a 51 year low  

What this means is that real first time buyers are not showing up as buyers  contrary to the NAR s manipulated data  The chart above is from the   It shows the breakdown of home ownership by age demographic for Q2 2015 vs Q2 2016  As you can see the first time homebuyer age demographic has declined  This graph undermines the data being reported by Larry Yun and the NAR 
My educated bet is that a large percentage of existing home buyers over the last couple years has been speculators   either quick flippers or  investors  who buy a home with the intent to fix it up and re sell it six to twelve months later  There will be a lot of  second  home owners who end up stuck with their  investment  
I have been theorizing for quite some time that the housing market would get  squashed  from the top  The first time buyer is the key component in the housing market sales activity cycle  If a move up buyer can t sell its home to a first time buyer  the owner with the  move up  home   the upper price range home   for sale can t sell  It leads to a glut at the high end   something that is being reported all over the country 
As I ve noted several times recently  high end inventory has been building up across the country for well over a year  Long time housing market analyst and consultant  Mark Hanson  said in his latest blog post 
I am getting reports from sources in mid to high end regions all over the nation that after a strong June  July sales were down between 15  and 50  with Pendings down as much as 60  from a year ago 
One large West Coast brokers firm with whom I talk said they are recommending to clients with mid to high end properties on the market over 30 days with no offers to cut list prices aggressively in order to get in front of the market versus the process of small  frequent price cuts that look bad optically and keep sellers constantly behind the market  
In other words  the inventory clog at the high end of the market is starting to spill over into the upper middle price range  I received a price change alert yesterday about a  1 million  home which was taken down over 14  in price  The  new price  competition is heating up  I m seeing  new price  signs in the mid priced homes now all around Denver 
The point here is that the two primary drivers of economic activity   albeit artificially stimulated economic activity   auto and housing   are heading south  I believe the U S  economic system will be engulfed by drop off in economic activity that will shock even those who can see through the economic propaganda being reported by the Government  Fed and industry associations 
In my last couple of Short Seller s Journals  I have been recommending shorts in the housing and auto sectors  These are two high beta sectors that will sell off more than the overall market once the market heads south again  something which may already be happening 
As you can see from the following 11 year weekly graph of the Dow Jones Home Construction index  the homebuilders and related home construction companies have been trending sideways since April 2013 

The index is down 6 8  since hitting 610 intra day last Wednesday  The S P 500 is down just  7  in that same time frame  But this illustrates my point about the downside potential for the housing stocks if the S P trends lower 
It s clear that the Fed is doing what it can to keep the broad market indices from selling off  but underneath the marquee lights there s a whole world of stocks that are collapsing in price ",2016-08-03,David I.

S P 500  SPX  sold off hard and early yesterday  only to see a strong rally  just prior to the FOMC minutes being released  that lasted into the closing bell  
Despite the rally  the Russell 200  RUT  was lower and weighed heavily on a large number of stocks yesterday 
The 20 day moving average was broken intraday  but the bulls managed to still close above it with a solid hammer candle  Also the 10 day moving average was held on to 
Strong possibility  if the market manages to rally today  that it forms a morning star pattern 
Yesterday marked nine straight days of alternating up down on SPDRs S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY    We are getting close to a record and is the third time in the past year we have been on one of these streaks  which in and of itself is unusual 
Notable pick up in volume on SPY yesterday vs anything seen over the previous three trading sessions  Nonetheless  still below recent averages 
VIX was crushed yesterday as well  having risen almost to 14  only to drop 3 6  on the day and close at 12 19  It was unable to push through and sustain a move above  at 13 
Oil continues to climb higher  but the market  just like during its recent downturn  refuses to follow  Over the last three months there has been a notable disconnect between equities and the price of crude 
Two gaps on the SPY 30 minute chart remains unfilled  Otherwise the price is extremely choppy 
Key  today will be 2171 followed by 2155  Even a break of the former should require traders to reduce their expectations for the market going forward 
SPX has not seen a     1  move in either direction since July 8  2016  Since then the market has moved higher but in very small increments and tight daily ranges 
Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  is keeping the double top pattern in play here  However it is coiling just underneath resistance which leads me to believe it wants to break through 
The bulk of the earnings season is behind us  No significant disasters from the big names that reported that negatively impacted the market as a whole 
Overall  August is the worst performing month for the Dow Jones 30 and S P 500 
At this point  and with the election ahead  I d expect the market to keep rallying higher  I don t expect there to be a rate hike between now and the election  To do so would impact the market and thereby the election  I don t think the Fed wants that  particularly since Trump has indicated that he would replace Yellen

119716,341231,KMX,The Lazy Investor s Way To Beat The Market,opinion,"What if I told you there was a simple three step strategy for beating the market  One that could earn you triple digit excess returns over the broad indexes 
And  to top it all off  what if I told you this strategy takes no more than 30 minutes per year to implement 
You d probably think I m pulling your leg  Well  here are the facts   
Over the last two decades  one lazy strategy has generated excess total returns of 114  over the S P 500  You can see it at work in this week s chart 
And the kicker is   
It s based on just one metric for selecting your stocks 

Low Price to Sales Stocks
The strategy got big attention in James O Shaughnessy s What Works on Wall Street  In his research  the famed analyst found that large cap stocks with low value metrics   such as price to earnings  price to book and price to sales   had a tendency to outperform their higher value peers 
But of all of the value metrics he studied  the price to sales metric generated the highest excess returns 
Here s how the strategy works 




Step 1  Take the bottom 50 stocks of the S P 500 based on P S 





Step 2  Invest in those companies 





Step 3  Repeat steps 1 and 2 at the end of each year 



That s it 

 Dark Money  Spending in the 2016 Presidential Election Will Make Investors Very Rich
The 2016 election is already projected to cost  5 billion  almost double the amount of the previous election  Thanks to a Supreme Court ruling that gave the OK for  dark money  spending  more and more cash is flooding into campaigns    and during the last presidential election year  three companies outperformed the market by 215 05   That means investors who act now could be in for a blockbuster year 
Amazingly  over the last 20 years the low P S portfolio offered an average annual return of 15 4   compared to just 9 9  from the S P 500 
If you invested just  10 000 into this strategy at the end of 1995  you would now have  103 085  To compare  you would be sitting on  48 190 if you invested the same amount in the S P 500  A 114  difference

Want to add some value to your portfolio today  Using our low P S metric  here are four undervalued stocks to consider

  7 13  so far in 2016  compared with a 1 33  rise in the S P 500 index  Over the past twelve months  the shares have declined 31 21   while the S P 500 index has declined 1 39   KMX stock has a consensus hold rating and an average analyst 12 month price target of  60 50  implying a rise of 20  from current levels  
Looking at the daily chart  you will see that shares are starting to form an ascending wedge  with the lower range at the  48 level and the upper range sitting at about  52 90ish  right where the 200 day moving average is as well  as of the time of this writing 
We should see those levels act as support resistance with some further support at  50 and more resistance at  52  Shares have been gaining today ahead of their earnings  with current highs at  51 84 after closing Friday at  50 12  equaling a 3 4  increase in value 
Shares have been under some pressure after hitting highs back in March at  75 40  and started a new downtrend that pushed shares well below their 200 day moving average before finding buyers at the  42  where they were able to hold their ground and make a push back up 
Shares tried regaining the 200 day moving average multiple times recently but were not able to reclaim that crucial level  We ll need some solid volume and a strong catalyst to get shares back above and to hold that level  Currently analysts have an average price target of  58 21

The action in the markets since Thanksgiving have been amazing  there is so much to cover after the past week so let s get into it 
The last five days saw the worst price action for markets in a few years  the Industrials dropping nearly 800 points from the high set on Monday morning  The S P 500 fell a staggering 3 7  but that was also off of an all time high  while the Russell 2000 was down but not nearly as much  We can point to one culprit of the poor action   Crude Oil  Since Thanksgiving crude has cascaded lower and has reached 5 yr lows  Unless some intervention occurs it appears oil prices could continue to slide 
For it s part  crude fell about 12  on the week  and we have seen many try to catch the falling knife  but with oil volatility  OVX chart below  so high it makes little sense to try and call a bottom  For one reason  with volatility at these high levels option prices are juiced up  there is no advantage in buying  and selling premium   normally a great strategy with the volatility spiking   is not clear until the price has surely bottomed 
The VIX moved nearly 100  over the past five days  and it was this action that caused a major concern  The previous Friday saw volatility at near the lows of the year  the VIX clocking in under 12   That s a dangerously complacent level    Recent spikes in VIX have been great areas for reversals WHEN THEY HAPPEN  NOT BEFORE  but this time around everyone buying protection is getting on board early  looking to cash in on the big spikes lower  this is a change in the pattern of buying protection  which usually seems to occur at the end of a big run   We ll have to see if a spike high occurs quickly this time around 
One of the most reliable reversal tools has been the VIX VXV ratio  Simply put  this is 30 days volatility 90 days volatility  In a bull market this ratio over 1 is not sustainable for long  It is as my friend calls the  place to buy the blood   see chart below   We chatted in mid October about this when the ratio spiked over 1  and while the condition lasted for about 5 days  it triggered a very powerful SPX 500 run  more than 190 handles up I would say the odds favor a turn HIGHER in the markets in the next couple of days  We ll play it that way The VIX term structure is something I watch closely  and my friend Jay Wolberg has some great charts and statistics each day on   Currently  the VIX cash is above many of the futures  as the reach for protection is extremely short term  However  the curve has flattened significantly  much like the last time  when in mid October the term structure actually inverted for several days  That was a temporary condition and the curve soon  normalized  and morphed back into a bullish construct  I suspect this time around the worry is short lived Breadth has been worrisome of late  given the amount of selling and the shock from dropping crude  those who have been long stocks and are forced to sell  as we saw this happen late Friday  are getting out of the way  Buyers have stepped aside  too  The MC oscillators are well oversold  the NYSE coming in Friday at a ridiculously low  201 while the Nasdaq clocked in at  96  These are extreme oversold readings  Next week brings a big convergence of data and events that may swing the markets  We are entering a seasonally strong period for stocks  and while that is not the case this month we could see the tide turn with all of the bearish sentiment stacked high  The Fed will have their last meeting of 2014 and I suspect no change They will bring us a revised forecast and Janet Yellen will hold a press conference  A slew of important economic data is forthcoming and some key earnings will be released by Nike  NYSE NKE   Oracle  NYSE ORCL   FedEx  NYSE FDX   Accenture  NYSE ACN   General Mills  NYSE GIS  and CarMax  NYSE KMX   among others   This week is also a big options expiration  and that ll have a major effect on price action as we end the week  The speed of these moves down brings us worry  doubt and uneasiness  We ve been saying it for awhile  the market is need of a bigger correction  but we won t make the timing call  Why is that  Simply put  the market will  see  the reason for a correction and perhaps a bear market and will TELL US before hand  The stock market is a great discounting mechanism that never fails  so there is really no sense in trying to front run a move  Santa Claus comes to town for the  rally  on Dec 24  which lasts until Jan 5  We ll have to see if he s bringing presents to Wall Street or lumps of coal ",2014-12-14,Bob Lang,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-struggle-with-drop-in-crude,-but-a-silver-lining-is-there-235706",235706

The spring selling season has confirmed further improvement in housing markets

 This year s spring selling season confirms that the market is continuing to improve at a very consistent pace      Home Builder 

There s strength across the board

 there is no question that our demand has broadened out we re seeing strength across the markets there is none that I can think of where I d say that s a tough market today      Homebuilder 

The first time homebuyer is coming back

 We are starting to see the first time homebuyer come back to the market place  but from basically a very flat level of virtually non existent first time homebuyer to some beginnings of improvement      Home Builder 

Household formation has rebounded

 Recent census reports put household formation at an annualized rate of almost 2 million  well above normalized historical levels and significantly higher than the 500 000 households we have averaged per year over the last eight years  This data point suggests that we may be at a turning point in this housing recovery  as household formation has been the missing link      Homebuilder 

People have moved on with their lives

 over a 40 year period  the nation averaged 1 2 million household formations With the job growth that s occurring and the aging of the millennials  they re getting to a point in their life where they re getting a job and moving on with their life      Homebuilder 

Consumers are feeling more flush

 I do think the consumer is looking for less discounting activity today than they were a year ago  or two years ago we haven t seen lower gas prices stimulate traffic  but we have seen it change the consumer behavior once they re in our building  and they re not seeking the deals the way they were years ago We re seeing some more    the consumers buy more add ons  They re buying wine  dessert  apps      Restaurant Chains 

Small companies are growing more aggressively than larger ones

 our own order patterns suggest demand for midmarket customers may have grown faster than from the larger customers what you see is that the companies that are in the  25 million to  50 million of revenue size are the ones that are leading the growth     Office Furniture 

Wage pressure is rising

 There s continued pressure  we see it more on the labor side  perhaps than the material side in today s world     Homebuilder 

 I would say the wage rate is probably in the upper half of  the inflation  range     Restaurant Chains 

Given this environment  wouldn t you expect higher inflation expectations 

 We anticipate fiscal 2016 to be a more normalized inflation environment  resulting in overall inflation of 1 5  to 2   with commodity inflation of 0 50  to 1   and we expect the price at the low end of the overall inflation range      Restaurant Chains

New regulations could disrupt mortgage markets in October

 this is a rough and tumble mortgage market that is defined by a regulatory environment that has a lot of laws of unintended consequences coming through  And the new legislation  the new regulations that will come in to affect in October will have some ripple effect we recognize that there is potential for disruption and we are trying to stay ahead of the curve      Homebuilder 

It s cheaper to buy land directly than acquire a homebuilder

 And when you are buying companies today  you are buying land assets  and we had found that we are able to buy those assets through negotiations with sellers at a cheaper price than acquiring the company and paying the goodwill associated with the company  We have continued to look at smaller acquisitions and you can and we ll continue to do so  But with regards to the larger public companies don t seem to pencil out for us today      Homebuilder 

There is a cost to stock based compensation

 we re also planning to reduce dilution from shares granted in our stock based compensation program  We ve made good progress in reducing our stock based compensation expense over the last year and half  We remain committed to continuing this effort and will work to reduce our 2017 annual share purchase by approximately half of our current year level      Energy Data 

Consumer 

It will be easy to buy used cars in a few years because a lot of people are leasing vehicles right now

 Lease percentage right now  I think  in the new car industry is somewhere around 30   And when you see that supply coming back is really two years and three years later after you see a high lease percentage  So I m not sure that we ve seen much of it yet  but it s never been a problem for us to source cars  And when cars are at a high lease percentage  when you look out two years and three years later  generally  they re more organized at the auction  so it s a little easier for us actually to buy those cars when we see them come back to the marketplace      Used Car Dealer

Regulation benefits large players who can afford to make adjustments

Key Takeaways 
The Estimize consensus is forecasting EPS of  0 71 and revenue of  3 68 billion  right in line with Wall Street s estimates
CarMax focus on used vehicles and location expansion could give them an upper hand on the competition
CarMax maintains a muddled balance sheet with long debt significant rising in the past 2 years
CarMax  KMX   the largest used vehicle retailer in the U S   is scheduled to report fiscal fourth quarters earnings tomorrow  before the opening bell  Lately  expectations have been raised  but that does not necessarily mean a solid earnings report will help the stock  Over the past year  CarMax shares have plummeted 30  
Even though used car sales constitute a majority of its sales  CarMax has struggled reach millennials  Young americans have been reluctant to purchase cars as they don t need them or can t afford them  Moreover  owners are now squeezing an extra few years out of their automobiles  thereby hurting the industry 

Moreover  CarMax is not in sound financial shape  As of November 2015  cash and cash equivalents totaled  33 35 million  down from  371 50 million in May 2015  This figure is in line with capex guidance of roughly  360 million  but declining revenue is cause for concern  The first nine months of fiscal 2016 saw a 16  decline in new vehicle sales  Furthermore  CarMax s debt has soared over the past year from  300 million in 2014 to  864 in 2015 
Despite its woes  CarMax continues to expand into new markets  In fiscal 2015  the auto retailer opened 13 new stores  10 of which were in new markets  CarMax plans to open 7 additional stores throughout the first half of fiscal 2016 and between 13 and 16 on the full year 
Moving forward  CarMax must build up cash to reconcile its mounting debt and appease investors  The stock has been hurting over the past year now and it seems that a positive earnings report may not help that much

119777,341292,KMX,Markets Asking A Lot from Blue Chips  Can They Deliver ,opinion,"Earnings are beginning to roll in and quite a few companies are missing Wall Street consensus 
This doesn t mean  however  that there isn t growth out there  only that estimates have so far been a little optimistic 
CarMax Inc  NYSE KMX  is a well known used car dealer  The company s latest numbers were decent  but they came in below what Wall Street was looking for 
Fiscal fourth quarter sales grew nine percent to  3 08 billion  which is pretty good  Comparable store unit sales grew seven percent in the fourth quarter and 12  year over year 
The company had to correct some accounting procedures related to extended service plans and warranties  and it took a hit on earnings because of this 
CarMax is buying back its own stock and just authorized another  1 0 billion repurchase plan that expires at the end of the 2015 calendar year  The stock only dropped marginally on the news 
Another company that missed consensus but is very much a growing enterprise is AZZ Incorporated  AZZ  out of Fort Worth  Texas  We looked at this company last year  
This is a good business  The company manufactures electrical equipment and components for power generation and transmission  Management recently said that business conditions are improving and new quoting activity is noticeably stronger 
Fiscal 2014 fourth quarter revenues came in at  180 million  compared to  140 million in the fourth quarter of 2013  Earnings were  10 2 million  or  0 40 per diluted share  compared to earnings of  13 2 million  or  0 52 per diluted share 
While the company actually missed Wall Street consensus earnings by  0 02 a share and missed on the revenue estimate  the stock went up after management reaffirmed its previous guidance for fiscal 2015  This is the theme we re getting so far this earnings season 
So the numbers are decent  but not great  There is growth  but not enough so far to beat the Street  With this backdrop  the stock market shouldn t really be going up  But then again  monetary policy is a powerful force and in equities  reality is about future earnings  not the present 
I m very reticent to be a buyer in this market  recognizing  of course  that there are always opportunities in any market 
I think investors should be highly selective and focused on quality and value if they want to be buying a stock market that s trading at its high  I view investment risk as having gone up because of the broader market s action that has yet to produce a meaningful price correction since the financial crisis 
Earnings are still playing a game of catch up with share prices  This is particularly the case in faster growing  more speculative sectors like Bakken oil 
Some speculative fervor has come out of this market  initial public offerings and biotechnology stocks   and it s a very good development for the longer run trend 
Key stock market indicators like the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones Transportation Average are confirming the market s still positive trend 
In order for the main market averages to accelerate meaningfully  blue chips will have to beat consensus which is a tall order

119778,341293,KMX,What The Buy Side Expects From Carmax,opinion,"CarMax Inc   NYSE KMX  is set to report FQ1 2015 earnings before the market opens on Friday  June 20  CarMax is the largest network of used car dealerships in the United States by market cap  operating over 125 dealerships across 28 states  Shares of CarMax have been in a bit of a rut since December as the company has missed earnings projections 2 quarters in a row  However this quarter Wall Street is expecting modest gains from CarMax including a 2c increase in FQ1 earnings per share and a 7 3  year over year increase in sales  Here s what investors are expecting from CarMax on Friday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for CarMax to report 66c EPS and  3 554B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 65c EPS and  3 576B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting CarMax to miss the Wall Street earnings consensus by a 1c per share while beating revenue projections by  22 million 
Over the previous 5 quarters the consensus from Estimize has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting CarMax s EPS and revenue 2 and 4 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a smaller than usual differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 64c to 69c per share and from  3 540B to  3 620B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide range of EPS estimates and a narrow range of revenue projections 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of earnings estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street consensus fell from 68c to 66c while the Estimize consensus dipped from 66c to 65c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast declined from  3 645B to  3 554B while the Estimize sales consensus dropped from  3 596B to  3 576B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and down analyst revisions at the end of the period are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is amirziai who projects 64c EPS and  3 540B in revenue  amirziai self identifies as a hedge fund analyst and is ranked 81st overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  This season amirziai has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 59  and 63  of the time respectively throughout 27 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case amirziai is making a bearish call expecting CarMax to miss the Estimize consensus on both the top and bottom line 
CarMax may have missed 2 earnings forecasts in a row but contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are predicting that the used auto sales company can produce solid revenue this quarter  The Estimize community is expecting CarMax to report an 8  increase in year over year revenue while missing the Wall Street profit consensus by just a penny per share
