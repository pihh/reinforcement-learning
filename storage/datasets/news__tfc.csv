194377,415893,TFC,Powell Heads to Congress With Rate Cut in Play  Risk on His Mind,news," Bloomberg     Jerome Powell is likely to leave Federal Reserve interest rate cuts firmly on the table when he appears before Congress this week  even though the latest U S  jobs report dialed down the urgency to ease borrowing costs 
The Fed chairman  who has been hectored for months by President Donald Trump for not cutting rates  will probably repeat language from the Federal Open Market Committee s June statement that it will  act as appropriate   to sustain the economic expansion    reinforcing bets the central bank will cut at its July 30 31 meeting 
Powell gives his semiannual monetary policy testimony at 10 a m  Wednesday before the House Financial Services committee and a day later to the Senate banking panel  Lawmakers including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren are expected to question him about a range of issues such as Trump s attacks  the state of the economy and  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   s new currency plans 
 He s going to have to send a clear signal this week  go  no go  or still unsure and watching the data   said Stephen Stanley  chief economist with Amherst Pierpont Securities   If he continues to be ambiguous  the markets probably will assume that he approves of market pricing  so he might as well take a position   
Investors are fully pricing in a 25 basis point move  Here are five things to watch out for in his testimony 
Risk Assessment
Powell s updated assessment of risks to the U S  outlook will be especially important  since rising concerns would be the rationale for rate cuts  The Fed s monetary policy report released Friday highlighted a significant weakening in global trade growth and manufacturing since 2017  Uncertainly has weighed on business investment and tariffs have had a  material but modest  direct impact on global trade flows  according to the study 
 Powell has made it clear that  if necessary  the Fed will take steps to assure the continuation of the expansion    said Ward McCarthy  chief financial economist at Jefferies   What is not clear is what would trigger the Fed take these steps  I am looking for him to provide some clarity   
The addition of 224 000 jobs in June  far more than economists expected  would tend to suggest there s less urgency to offset a global economic slowing  The Labor Department report Friday showed no wage pressures  with average hourly earnings steady at 3 1   and an expansion of the labor force signals there may still some slack in the job market 
Seeing Headwinds
The stock market has hit new highs as concerns over the U S  trade battle with China have eased in recent weeks  But at the same time  growth slowed in the second quarter  and is tracking about a 1 3  annual rate  according to the Atlanta Fed s tracker 
 He will affirm the economy remains solid  if not spectacular    said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Grant Thornton   What matters most is what he sees as headwinds and how he characterizes those risks  They are driving the desire to do an insurance cut   
Trump Attacks
Powell is likely to be asked to respond to repeated criticism from Trump and pressed to discuss his conversations with the president   We don t have a Fed that knows what they re doing    Trump said July 5 
The president has said he has the right to fire or demote Powell  while the Fed chief has said he intends to serve his full four year term as chairman and  the law is clear  on that issue 
 Powell will continue to stress Fed independence  that the committee is made up of a number of people and there s a strong debate    said Sarah House  senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co   The answers will be short and he will try to move on   
What Our Economists Say
 Powell will have the opportunity to refine market expectations of upcoming changes to interest rate policy during his two day semi annual testimony before Congress  The Fed is looking to deliver a few  insurance cuts  and not get dragged into an extended easing cycle   
   Carl Riccadonna  Yelena Shulyatyeva and Eliza Winger
Democrats in Spotlight
The questioning of Powell from two members of Congress in particular will merit some special attention 
Senator Warren of Massachusetts  a Democratic presidential candidate  has typically direct  confrontational questions that have sometimes wrong footed Fed leaders  Freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  a self described socialist and social media star  has proven to be an adept inquisitor during congressional hearings 
They or others could press Powell to explain the Fed s yearlong review of its framework for monetary policy  With inflation missing the central bank s 2  goal for most of seven years  the Fed is considering adopting a new approach that could include overshooting its target to compensate for misses on the low side in the past 
Big Banks
Powell is also expected to be asked about the Fed s most high profile efforts to oversee U S  banking 
The agency is nearing a proposal to overhaul the Volcker Rule that limited Wall Street banks  ability to trade after the 2008 financial crisis  It s also weighing a big bank merger between BB T Corp  NYSE BBT   and SunTrust Banks Inc  NYSE STI    which has drawn criticism from some Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups 
Another hot regulatory topic for the Fed has been how it and other financial regulators will handle emerging digital currencies  such as Facebook s Libra  Powell has said he had discussions with that company about its plans ",2019-07-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/powell-heads-to-congress-with-rate-cut-in-play-risk-on-his-mind-1918381,1918381

for your support  What you re going to see is  overall  a fantastic progress in 1 year  And I would say to you  generally  if you liked our company a year ago  you should love us now  As we go through this information  we re going to be completely transparent  But as you would expect  it s going to be messy  We don t know all that you want to know  but our pledge to you is that over the next quarter or 2 we will give you more and more as we go along  Some of the highlights  which you probably already know  but we did successfully closed the deal on December 6 This is  interestingly  the largest financial transaction    institution transaction in 15 years  And these 2 iconic companies have 275 plus combined years of service  which is huge  We are the sixth largest U S  commercial bank  We have the  2 weighted average deposit market share on our top 20 MSAs and about  473 billion in assets  I think very  very importantly  before legal day 1  which was less than 60 days ago  we had all managers in place  and our organizational structure today is set and running  No confusion about who s doing what  So that s a really  really big deal  We ve done a lot of work with regard to our culture  I ll talk about that in a moment  but I feel really  really good  And we ve made much progress in other areas I want to spend just a minute on culture because this is the most important consideration for all of us  Culture drives long term performance  There is no question about that  And therefore  it is our  1 priority  The way we think about culture is a culture is a function of our purpose  our mission and our values  There are certain practices  the kind of way we do things around here  and there s a whole process of embedding the culture into the organization  But the most important thing to think about is our purpose  our mission and our values  Our purpose at Truist is to inspire and build better lives and communities  We really believe we can make the world better  and we think that is exactly what major corporations are called upon to do today We execute our purpose through our mission  which is focusing on taking care of our clients through a really good environment for our teammates and  of course  optimizing long term value for all of our stakeholders  Most importantly  all of our mission efforts are guided by our long standing deep beliefs  which we call values  Our values at Truist are about being trustworthy  We serve with integrity  It s about being caring  We know that everyone and every moment matters  It s about one team coming together  We can accomplish anything working together as a team  It s about success  We know that when our clients win  we all win  And for our teammates  it s about happiness  Essentially positive energy changes lives  and we ultimately want all of our teammates to be happy because when you re happy  you don t have a job  you have a passion and we want everybody to be passionately focused on accomplishing our purpose  We know that we are very  very closely aligned Early on in this process  we got really good research from our 59 000 teammates  We    for example  early on  we gave them 16 words to describe their companies  We got over 10 000 responses from each side  They all picked exactly the same 4 words  A couple months later  we had scientific research where we asked  again  over 20 000 teammates divided between the companies to describe the company in terms of how we operate  And they described it almost exactly the same  Just a week before last  we started a series of 39 town halls  where Bill Rogers and I went around and started talking to our teammates and answering questions  Week before last  we did 11 of 39  Next week  we will do another 11 as well  And I would tell you that the responses are fantastic  Our teammates are excited  They love our culture  They love our purpose  They love our brand  They love our colors  They love our logo So it is off to a really  really good start  But I want you to feel confident as investors that this is not 2 companies struggling  trying to come together  This is 2 companies that were already deeply aligned in terms of our purpose  our mission and our values  Everything we ve seen over the last year affirms just that  And now there s a renewed level of excitement from everybody as we think about coming together as Truist and going out and making the world a better place  Let s talk about some of the highlights  If you re following along on page six  Total taxable equivalent revenue was  3 6 billion  Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was  1 46 billion  and that s up 29  But like all these numbers  you re going to know that they re obviously inflated because of the SunTrust impact on the BB T numbers as we added 25 days toward the end of the fourth quarter  So we won t dwell so much on the specific changes  but we did make over  1 billion  In terms of diluted earnings per share adjusted  it s a balance where give you some detail in terms of how that adjustment was arrived at  Return on average assets adjusted 1 4   very strong  Return on average tangible common equity 18 6   which right out of the shoot is really  really good  again on adjusted basis  And adjusted efficiency ratio was 57 5   Both companies  to give you a sense of momentum  grew loans at a healthy pace  when you ex out from restructuring  which Daryl will talk about  But underlying growth is very good  The pipelines are very strong  And we feel very  very good about momentum  Asset quality is great  And we ve taken some actions to optimize the portfolio from a credit perspective  Our capital and liquidity levels are excellent  Daryl will give you detail about that Our businesses  as I said  have good momentum  We talked to bankers all across the footprint  Pipelines are strong  People are excited about doing business with Truist  The launching of the Truist brand  colors  logo could not have gone better  But I want you to know that we are primarily focused on serving our clients  We are laser focused on making sure our clients have a distinctive  outstanding service quality relationship with Truist  We re going to talk about cost saves  and Daryl will give you a lot of detail that we have available for that  But I want you to know  from our perspective  we have made a decision to slow the timing down just a few months  And we did that to improve client service quality  to ensure strong client retention  to improve the long term value proposition  This is about really the digital investments that we re going to be making  We want to get some of those made before we actually roll out the conversion  and so the branch conversions are delayed some Part of that was because of the agreement we reached with regulators  Part of that was because we wanted to delay it to make sure  again  we have a digital value proposition in place  Still  we are very  very confident on our net  1 6 billion in savings  So this should not be viewed as a negative  This is a positive  It s the same number  We ve simply taken just a little bit longer to make sure we do it and do it right  Our nonperforming assets were fantastic at 0 14   Net charge offs were right in the sweet spot of what we ve always indicated  0 40  and a very strong common equity Tier 1 capital of 9 4   So we feel really  really good about asset quality and capital  If you look at page seven  I ll just mention these selected items  really just 3 that are large The merger related restructuring charges   223 million pre tax  which is  0 19 negative impact on diluted EPS  We had security losses because of our balance sheet restructuring  That was  116 million  which translates into about  0 10 in terms of negative impact on EPS  And then we have some expenses that are not technically  from an accounting point of view  designated as merger related  but they are incremental operating expenses that do have future benefits  but they re not part of our ongoing run rate  So you can kind of think about them the same  The main thing is they don t impact future run rate  So when you add all that together  you get a net negative impact on our ongoing run rate of  0 37  which is substantially why you see the difference in GAAP and our adjusted numbers  If you look at page eight  just a few comments with regard to loans We did have an end of period balance of about  300 billion  really good mix  The mix of loans held for investment consists of 56  commercial  40  consumer  about 2  credit card  pretty balanced  Over time  you might expect to see the consumer grow a little faster than commercial if you get a little closer to 50 50  but we feel really good about where we are starting out  We did take some actions  which Daryl will give you more color on with regard to the portfolios  But I would just point out that the year end portfolio loans are a little inflated by about  4 5 billion because of the loans that have moved into loans held for sale and moved but haven t closed it  So we ll close very  very soon  So as we think about the overall market  just in talking to an awful lot of our regional presidents and market presidents  I would say that overall market is pretty good  CEOs are confident in their businesses But it s fair to say  they are nervous  They re worried about the macro issues  the trade war  Iran  the coronavirus  We have 10 plus years long into recovery  So while we do not expect a recession in the near term  I would say  in fairness  we can certainly talk ourselves into one  So it s a little bit of a nervous period right now  I think we need to be honest about that  But that s one of the reasons that Truist always remains strong in terms of capital and liquidity in the event these existential factors do create an interruption in terms of ongoing business  But we don t really predict one now  We really think this will settle down  We certainly hope and pray that this coronavirus does not get out of hand  but we all have to be really concerned about that  There are a lot of people around the world being hurt  a lot of people are dying and we got to really hope that  that does not become a global systemic issue And I personally don t think it will  but we have to pay a lot of close attention to that  If you re looking at slides on page nine  just a couple of comments with regard to deposits  We did end up with noninterest bearing deposits of about  92 billion and total deposits of about  335 billion  The    if you exclude purchase accounting  noninterest deposits declined just a little bit in the third quarter  Everybody  I believe  is seeing a continued shift out of noninterest into time  and we re seeing the same thing  It s not indifferent than anybody else is facing  But our interest deposits did increase a strong 9   So you can see what s going on  Our total deposit activity is very good  It s just a little shift going on  We have strong noninterest deposits that total 30 6   one of the best in the industry  So we feel good about that  Our total cost of average total deposits and average interest bearing deposits  respectively  decreased 10 basis points and 17  So actually  pretty good there given the relatively flat yield curve We re very happy to report that we are telegraphing to our clients that virtually all of our clients will not experience any change in their account numbers  Having been involved in lots and lots of mergers over my career  I can tell you that the big issue for the client is change  And the main thing about change is don t change my account number  So we ve worked out a way  and I congratulate our people  for virtually all of our clients not to have any changes in their account numbers  So we predict that it will go extraordinarily smoothly for our clients  which is certainly our goal  So overall  even though it s a little hard to see through the numbers  our balance sheet is strong  strong earnings  tremendous progress in movingTruist forward  and we are very excited  and we re very confident With that  let me turn it to Daryl who will give you a lot more detail and a lot more color Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentThank you  Kelly  and good morning  everyone  Turning to slide 10  Net interest income was  2 25 billion  Net interest margin was 3 41   up 4 basis points versus the third quarter  Purchase accounting contributed 27 basis points to reported net interest margin  At the end of the year  our final purchase accounting marks included  4 5 billion against the SunTrust loan portfolio  an  83 million upward adjustment to CDs and a  309 million upward adjustment to long term debt  These marks were close to the recent estimates that we provided based upon September 30 data  We plan to true up these marks in the first quarter as the final valuation numbers come in from our third party provider  Core net interest margin was 3 14   down 15 basis points from the third quarter  The yield on loans held for investment decreased 6 basis points as the effect of lower short term rates was partially offset by a 37 basis point benefit from purchase accounting  The balance sheet restructuring improved our securities yield by 5 basis points and achieved our goal of a relatively neutral interest rate risk profile Continuing on slide 11  This summarizes our balance sheet restructuring  which is focused on improving credit quality  liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  net interest margin and return on capital  Through the restructuring  we improved the run rate on the investment portfolio  built liquidity to meet our LCR requirements  rehedged the balance sheet and managed toward a more neutral interest rate position  We sold loans to manage negative convexity  reduced premium amortization and enhanced credit quality by exiting  1 4 billion of high risk credit exposures  of which  516 million was funded at year end  About 80  of that sale traded in January Through the end of January  we lowered interest rates on about  17 billion of institutional deposits by 20 basis points because of our higher credit ratings  We will continue to be opportunistic in optimizing other funding to take advantage of Truist s higher credit ratings  We also estimate that year end loans held for sale were elevated relative to normalized levels by approximately  4 5 billion and that the securities were elevated by approximately  1 4 billion  This means the balance sheet should settle slightly under  470 billion in total assets  Turning to slide 12  Noninterest income increased  233 million after excluding  116 million in security losses and  22 million in losses related to the transfer of residential mortgages held for sale  Approximately   215 million of the increase was due to the merger The rest was due to a  22 million increase in insurance income due to seasonality and minor changes in heritage BB T fee income categories  Of note  full year 2019 insurance income had organic growth of 8 8   Continuing on slide 13  Noninterest expense was up  497 million after excluding a  189 million increase in merger and restructuring charges and  49 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger  Approximately   400 million of this was due to core expenses from the merger  The remaining increase was due to  42 million in heritage BB T incentives and  42 million in amortization due to higher CDI and other intangibles Turning to slide 14  Asset quality remains strong  NPAs increased  175 million to  684 million  The increase was due to the merger and included  107 million of acquired nonperforming loans held for sale   63 million of loans and leases held for investment and  63 million of foreclosed real estate  partially offset by the sale of  69 million of nonperforming mortgages  NPLs were 15 basis points of total loans held for investment at the end of the year  down from 30 basis points at September 30  The decrease in the ratio was mostly due to the effect of accounting for acquired NPLs on a pooled basis in PCI  This effect on the ratio will reverse with the adoption of CECL and the transition of pooled level accounting for PCI  Net charge offs increased  39 million and were 40 basis points of average loans  down 1 basis point from last quarter The provision increased  54 million due to higher net charge offs and an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments  Our allowance was 52 basis points of loans held for investment at year end  down from 105 at September 30 due to the elimination of the SunTrust allowance  We would note that the combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is a very robust 2 01  of total loans  The allowance coverage ratios also remained strong at 2 03x net charge offs and 3 41x NPLs  Continuing on slide 15  Effective January 1  Truist adopted CECL  the new accounting standard related to credit losses  As a result  this did not impact our 2019 financial results  However  the impact at adoption was an overall  2 9 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses  The magnitude of this increase was significantly impacted by purchase accounting related to the merger We were not required to carry allowance on the acquired loans from the transaction at year end due to the related purchase accounting marks  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting  the implementation of CECL resulted in an approximate 40  increase in the allowance for credit losses  This reflects increases that are related to our consumer and mortgage portfolios  partially offset by the decrease in our commercial loan portfolio  In terms of capital  the increase in the allowance due to CECL resulted in a  2 1 billion after tax reduction to retained earnings  Truist has elected to phase in the impact to regulatory capital by 25  annually from 2020 through 2023  Turning to slide 16  Our capital ratios decreased due to the merger  but remained strong relative to regulatory capital levels for well capitalized banks Our CET1 ratio was 9 4   down from 10 6  in the third quarter  The benefits of purchase accounting will be partially offset in the first quarter by a 10 basis point impact from the treatment of MSR risk weighted assets under the simplification rule and a 14 basis point impact from the CECL phase in  At December 31  tangible book value per share increased 5 2  from September 30  Earnings during the quarter contributed 3 4  of the increase  And the merger with SunTrust contributed 1 8   confirming the close was accretable to tangible common equity  Compared to December 31  2018  tangible book per share increased 18 5  Continuing to slide 17  We realized 2020 may be challenging to analyze and model  So we are providing more guidance than usual  Our guidance is largely dollar based due to the absence of historical baselines to which growth rates can be applied  Some highlights from our first quarter 2020 guidance includes average earning assets to be plus or minus  406 billion  We expect reported net interest margin to be in the mid to high 3 40s and core margin to be just over 3   Net charge offs should range from 35 to 50 basis points  And fee income should be just over  2 billion  Our expense guidance includes  100 million to  150 million in merger expenses  For the full year  we expect the balance sheet to grow based upon our guidance  Net charge offs should remain relatively stable  assuming no significant deterioration in the economy  And expenses will trend down each quarter until we achieve an annual run rate expense savings of about  480 million in the fourth quarter Turning to slide 18  We are also providing medium term performance target for about three years  We are confident Truist can generate peer leading return on tangible common equity in the low 20s and an adjusted efficiency ratio in the low 50s over the medium term  In terms of capital  we are targeting 10  CET1 ratio for 2020  We are also confident we will achieve  1 6 billion in net expense savings through 2022  But we are updating the expected timing of our expense net savings  This is primarily due to our commitment to the regulators not to close overlapping branches for the    at least the first year and careful and cautious approach to systems integration to minimize client disruption  By the end of 2020  we expect to achieve a run rate equal to 30  of our net cost savings target  by the end of 2021 65  and by the end of 2022 a full  1 6 billion  All of this will drive positive operating leverage for the next three years For reference  2019 combined noninterest expense  excluding merger expenses  a onetime charitable contribution and amortization was approximately  1 8 billion  We expect to achieve an annual run rate of investment of approximately  200 million by the fourth quarter of 2020  These investments will be directed toward personnel  branding  digital and technology Now let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q A Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Daryl  So if you ll take a look at page 19  just to summarize  Just a lot of really  really good accomplishments so far  Once we closed the deal  we ve integrated a financial reporting system  We ve integrated and converted derivatives  Workday  a number of other systems  We have successfully retained our talent and our clients  So any concern about any mass exits on that is not warranted  We ve restructured the balance sheet  We ve launched our visual imagery  colors and logo  We ve introduced our culture of purpose  mission and values  And I m happy to say we ve added some key leadership in certain areas  particularly in the digital space So kind of what s coming up in a big picture perspective is that we are now working hard on completing product mapping  which allows us then to go into the development  We will be continuing to complete another 28 town halls  We ll be doing about 12 next week  So that continues on  We will continue to focus on deepening our relationship with our clients  We will complete the branch divestitures in a few months  We will complete the purchase of our new Truist and our headquarters here in Charlotte  I just mentioned that because that s a pretty big deal in this market and for our people  Our people are really excited about being in a 47 story iconic building that shows well in Charlotte We ll be introducing and marketing our Truist brand  and we ll continue investments in digital and technology  And then we ll phase into the conversion of the primary systems  So overall  it was a very strong quarter  As we ve said a year ago  we have 2 great companies coming together to create a very special company  We are in great markets  We have great economics  We have a very strong culture  Everyone is excited about our purpose  We have the opportunity to make the world a better place  You got to love Truist So I ll turn it back over to Rich Rich Baytosh    Director of Investor RelationsThank you  Kelly  Lauren  at this time  if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the Q A session Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Gerard Cassidy    RBC    AnalystGood morning  Kelly and Bill  congratulations on doing a monumental dealing and coming out of the gates with some really good numbers  Congratulations William H Rogers    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  We appreciate that Gerard Cassidy    RBC    AnalystDaryl  can you share with us on the credit side  the provision for the guidance for 2020 seems pretty robust  Did CECL have an impact on what you guys are looking for  Because considering that you mark to market all those loans at the time of closing  without CECL I would have maybe expected the provision maybe to be a little lower Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  Gerard  So we basically adopted FASB s guidance on how CECL operate  Our auditors  PwC  feels very comfortable with what we booked on 1 1 of 2020  In essence  if you back out the purchase accounting  it s a 40  increase of the 2 banks combined  We were both around 105 or 106 allowance  We re up to about 147  If you add in reserve for unfunded  it s about 161 But that s what the guidance basically told us to do and that s why we booked that  I do agree  though  there is a double dip in there  I mean  that is definitely positive because we have purchase accounting marks of  4 5 billion on the SunTrust loan portfolio  And now we have a reserve  147  on the loan book as well Gerard Cassidy    RBC    AnalystVery good  And then  Kelly and Bill  when you guys    on slide 19  you listed your accomplishments so far and now the next steps  Can you share with us how challenged are the    is the heaviest listening ahead of us  Or has it already been accomplished  Can you compare and contrast what you ve already accomplished with what you still need to do in terms of the degree of difficulty Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood question  Gerard  I ll take a start and then Bill can add to that  I would say  in all honesty  the heaviest listening is done because pulling 2 companies together early on to make sure that you don t have any cultural interruption  that you don t have any clashes in business strategies  that you still feel confident in terms of achieving the expense saves  all of those are    we feel better today than we felt a year ago  I have to say for myself  and I think Bill will echo this  Week before last when we visited 11 town halls  we touched about 6 000 teammates And if you d have been in that room  number one  you would have said  these people have been working together for 25 years  And number two  you would have thought the level of excitement was just extraordinarily high  And so that s work that s got to be done with regard to programming  and I don t take anything away from that  There s really  really hard work  But at this point  the organization is settled  strong  focused  and we are just now focusing on doing the connectivity work that is big  but is predictable in terms of how well we can do it  Bill William H Rogers    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  I think  Kelly and I looked at this through the same lens in terms of what s hard and what s easy  And the hard part and the most important part is getting the cultural alignment and making sure that s fair  And I think Kelly has articulated that really well and I feel the exact same way  And if that wasn t there  then that would be some concern  and that would make the road ahead hard So I think we ve set a really good foundation for the road ahead  That s not to diminish the fact we have a lot of work  So we ve got a lot of systems integration to do and revenue synergies to achieve and all those things  But what I think we would align on is the highest hurdle is  is it working and is the company culture aligned and are we leaning forward  and I feel great about that Gerard Cassidy    RBC    AnalystAgain  thank you and congratulations William H Rogers    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystHey  good morning  everybody  Congratulations on your first quarter as a combined entity  A couple of questions  First  on your marks in the outlook for purchase accounting accretion  I think the mark is about  4 5 billion  not too different from in your last filing  Daryl  can you just walk us through whether that calculation has changed at all with regards to how much of it s credit  liquidity and rate marks And the purchase accounting accretion trajectory as well  If you can talk to that because I think this    your guidance implies about  I think   1 6 billion of purchase accounting accretion this year  How does that go    how does that move forward also beyond 2020  How do we think about the glide path of PAA and how it impacts numbers beyond this year Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentThank you for the question  Saul  So first  I would tell you that the  4 5 billion that was booked that we re showing from December 6 that we remarked  about 60  of it is credit related  1 8   It came down a little bit  But it s really closely aligned to    I mean  our CECL with reserve for unfunded was in the 160s  low 160s  So it s just a little bit more than that  obviously due for a little bit different methodologies  but it s very consistent from that impact  The other part    the other 40  is mainly attributable to liquidity and interest rate risk  We did put in one of the slides that the commercial portfolio probably has an average life of around three years  consumer around 6 I would say it s going to ebb and flow of how contractual payments come through as well as prepayments  You will definitely see a downward trajectory on the purchase accounting accretion that s coming through  But at the same time  what you re going to see is our cost savings  our net cost savings really kick in  and over that same time period  And you would actually still see improvement on a consistent basis on our operating leverage number just because of the calculation of how efficiency works with expenses over revenue  For every dollar we save  it s worth  2 of revenue that s lost  So we still feel very good about the projections that we gained from that perspective Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystOkay  got it  And I guess a follow up there  You re    adjusting for purchase accounting accretion  The guidance implies about    by my calculation  about  12 2 billion to  12 5 billion of net interest income ex ing out PAA  if I look at the combined entity  historically  SunTrust  BB T  the run rate has been about  13 billion  Can you just walk us through what s driving that difference I know there s a lot of balance sheet restructuring going on  but it does seem to imply that the core NII    there s some degradation there ex ing out the PAA  Is my understanding this right  Can you just walk me through  like what s driving that Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  I mean  if you really look at the balance sheet restructuring  we didn t shrink that much  I mean  the mark was  4 5 billion  So the loans didn t sell  We just basically wrote down the loans  We did sell mortgages  Mortgages  if you look at it over the last couple quarters  is down about  10 billion  But pretty much everything else is consistent  The big reason why NII is down    if you go back a year ago and you look at like what we were projecting  our models and all of our peers models had interest rates still rising at the start of  19 And if    we actually went back and did a little homework  We looked at what estimates were back then and we compared them to what estimates are right now  And across the board  the peer average is down 20 to 25 basis points  And that s just because of the lower rate environment and the flatter curve that you re seeing Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystOkay  So it s really just the rate backdrop has degradated NII Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentCorrect Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystI mean  I guess I get that  But like even if I look at the third quarter  Daryl  combined NII pro forma was about  3 25 billion or  13 billion annualized  So this quarter  I guess  there s some degradation there  but it seems like a pretty big drop off Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYou had margins in the second half of  19 really start to hit as the rate cuts came in  They occurred in July  and you had 3 drops  So you really aren t seeing the full impact  The last drop was in December  So you aren t getting to see full impact until you get to the first quarter  So you have to look at that trajectory that we ve seen over the last six months Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystAll right  well  fair enough  Thanks a lot OperatorWe ll take our next question from Matt O Connor with Deutsche Bank Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for the update on some of the kind of planned milestones that we should be focusing on  on page 19  But I guess I want to focus on just the systems conversions and what are the big ones that we should be thinking about that will drive the cost saves  And it seems like banks have done a pretty good job converting various systems and decent deals  but it can always be the risk  So what s the time frame for some of the bigger system conversions  And I guess  just what should we be looking for to make sure they go well Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo Matt  the    clearly  the biggest is the overall deposit conversion because that s what drives the interaction with the clients  Loan conversion is a big deal  obviously  I would say those are the 2 larger ones  There are    we have about 3 000 programs that have to be dealt with  100 ecosystem  So there s a lot of them  But it s like any other bank  the primary is loans and deposits Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And the timing of those conversions Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSorry Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentTiming of the conversions Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystTiming Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerTiming  so we are    we will be primarily shooting for about August of  21  That may seem like a long time  but we re committed to doing it right  Much work is already under way in terms of ecosystem selection that s virtually all done  We are moving into programming now  The programming takes several months  Then you have a huge amount of time of testing  You can do it sooner  and we could beat that a little bit  But the key is it takes plenty of time for testing because you only know through testing if you ve done it right  And you don t want to put it out there and then go back and have to change it  So if I had to give you a specific date now  I d give you like August of  21 Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And then separately  Daryl  if you look at  I guess  on slide 17 here  the outlook for the first quarter and the full year implies relatively stable earning assets throughout the year  And  I mean  it sounds like there s some kind of inflated assets at year end in held for sale and the securities book that presumably will run off I would think also like quick  So what I m getting at is I m trying to think about the loan growth that you re assuming for the rest of the year  Or maybe I m wrong that those kind of inflated assets run off in the first quarter Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  So Matt  what I would say is  I mean  the trajectory of loans coming off the books  mainly mortgages  was down third  fourth quarter  We ve bottomed out  Most of the trades have settled down  Just a little bit left to go this quarter  But when you look at point to point when we presented to our Board earlier this week our operating plan on a go forward basis  we re looking to be a little bit better than growth in GDP So I would say  in the 2  to 3  range  point to point in loans over the next year and favored a little bit heavier in commercial versus retail  But I think we have  as Kelly said  momentum that we finished with the year fourth quarter  And the teams are working really well together and feel very positive that we re going to grow and generate revenue as we move forward in 2020 Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood Morning  On the slowing of the timing of the cost saves  of the factors that you said  what was the biggest driver  Because I just assume a lot of the drivers that you said like focusing on service quality  the customer retention  the digital  that s stuff that you would have already assumed that you would have been doing  So what was the change  What surprised you to make that change Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo John  it was not really a surprise  but it is a difference  We were very committed to picking the best of the systems  And so we went system by system to look at the best  And we picked a number of SunTrust systems which are really  really good as surviving Truist systems  So it s a little technical  But if you took all of the BB T systems  you can convert this much faster  You just move all of the data from SunTrust over to BB T systems    programs  But when you pick the SunTrust system and you put it on the BB T equipment  you have equipment changes and you have the programming to move that SunTrust program over to the BB T systems That s really what s driving the time a bit longer than we thought  But it s also a conservative estimate with regard to testing because we are committed to do an awful lot of testing  And then remember  when we first talked about our timing  we did not anticipate the branch delay  which you alluded to that  but that is a year of delayed savings  It was the right thing to do in conjunction with approval of the process  We feel good about it  We will be doing closings during the course of the year in non overlapping markets  We will be doing a lot of work through our retail channel in terms of preparing for the closings  But that s a pretty material change in terms of the timing of the cost saves John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  that s helpful Thanks  Kelly  And then separately  back to your 2020 outlook on slide 17  It looks like the share count outlook isn t showing a change  So is that implying that you re not assuming buybacks in 2020  And if so  could you give us the rationale for that Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentWe basically said when we announced the merger  we re going to run at a 10  CET1 ratio until we got through some of the integrations and took some of the risk off the table  So we are starting off  targeting 10   When we do our CCAR ask    our CCAR ask that will be coming up in the next couple of months  we will build in capacity such that if we decide to change that and decide to target something less than that after we have some success we ll have the ability to do that  But right now  we re sticking to 10  John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  got it  Alright  thank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHi  Well  the delay in the branch closing is not really new  I guess you just updated the numbers  because you said that almost six months ago  So I m just trying to understand better the outlook for expenses  So you look to take the efficiency ratio from 57 5  down to what like 53  or 54  over three years  That implies a lot of positive operating leverage  So I guess the real question is  do you expect positive operating leverage in 2020  And as part of that  I mean  if you re delaying some of the branch closures and the deposit and loan conversions aren t until August 2021  what are the expense savings that you can get more in the near term such as back office or anything else Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we will    we are expecting positive operating leverage really for the next three years  So that s a really  really good story  There are a lot of savings that we will get  Remember  again  the overlapping branches closings are deferred  There are a number of branch closings that are not in overlapping areas that are going to be closed in the near term  In addition to that  just because we don t close certain branches and overlapping doesn t mean we don t reduce expenses in those areas Some of these branches are literally side by side  And there are commonalities in terms of staffing that we can integrate even though they are 2 separate branches  And so there will be cost saves in the branches even before the branches actually are closed  So there are a lot of areas    to be honest  there s still a lot of backroom areas that are not related to the branches that we have overlapping staffing  We didn t deal with all of that day 1  As time goes on  we will have additional overlapping  redundancy in staffing that we will be reducing  So it s kind of a hodgepodge to be honest  But it s pretty clear to see what we ve laid out  We think with this modification in terms of the expected time frame with regard to saves  we feel very  very confident we ll be able to accomplish that Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentMike  if you look on page 13  on the noninterest expense space that we have  the first 5 categories that you have there  personnel  all the way down to equipment expense  I would expect those expense items to decrease over the next three years  This year  personnel will drop  We did went through our first RIF more in the management level when we closed the transaction  Our sourcing group is working aggressively with our third party vendor supplier  So we will get savings in those areas And while we got a lot of branches to date won t close this year  we re working very aggressively in all the major markets in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast to really focus and consolidate our buildings in all the metropolitan areas  and that should come online middle to end of 2020  So we feel very good that we re going to get the cost savings in 2020 and in the next three years Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystAnd so just maybe don t want to answer the question  you re not giving that guidance  So when we look at the year 2020  shared revenue growth exceed expense growth or just really just all back ended to years two and three Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentWe believe we re going to have operating    positive operating leverage every year  Can t promise it every quarter because of the seasonality  But every year  we will generate positive operating leverage from  19 to  20   20 to  21 and  21 to  22 Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  And then just a separate follow up question  It sounds like you really are planning to have a strong long term company  You said that you re taking a very measured approach  I guess just maybe a little bit more from Bill on the old SunTrust side  Kind of what are you seeing that s not going as well as you expected that you could do better  Then maybe  Kelly  you can chime in too Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHonestly  everything is going really well  and I don t have any area that I d say is not going as well as expected  There are a lot of areas that are going much better  To be honest  the integration of our people and our teams  whether it s corporate and institutional group or our community bank  all of those are integrating extraordinarily well  So personally I ve seen some real upside in terms of revenue momentum  particularly because of how well our teams are working together I ve had the chance to visit  Bill has had the chance to visit  with a lot of our teams in the last 90 days  especially  And again  you walk into the room  you would not be able to detect that this is 2 companies just having come together  You think they ve all been working together for a long time William H Rogers    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  Mike  I d say just we entered it in with some good momentum  Kelly outlined some good loan momentum and legacy SunTrust coming into that  There was good loan momentum in BB T as well  So that s carrying over into the early weeks of the year  On the investment banking side and the relationship and the teamwork that s going on with the commercial community bank  it s just off the charts  I mean we feel really good about that  And of course  we re 1 month in  But the things that you want to see in terms of pipelines and teamwork and all that  I feel really good about  So the    I think  generally  just strong momentum and the business is heading into the merger Mike Mayo    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystHi  thanks  Good morning I wanted to ask a bit about on the credit side  And Daryl  you mentioned that you re going to redo the marks again  We re going through CECL  I assume that s in your provision guidance  Can you help us understand when we move to the PCD and non PCD within the 35 to 50 basis points of charge offs  how much of the legacy SunTrust charge offs are we going to see in that number  And is there any room where just    the math ends up looking better than the guidance just because of how the mechanics of the charge off recognition works with path of book marked Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  So Ken  what I would say is that our guidance between 35 and 50  we believe we can be within that range  Until    there s a little bit of uncertainty in the marketplace right now  So we widened the range out a little bit  SunTrust portfolio is performing very well  We have good marks on it  We did sell a few credits  Nothing of substance  but we did sell some that we wanted to just dispose of  But for the most part  their credit profile is really strong as well So I wouldn t say there would be any impact  When we do convert from PCI to PCD  there will be about  200 million that will basically come out of the purchase accounting market and go into the allowance out of the  500 million that we have allocated to it  That s a little bit of a nuance  but that s just how the CECL accounting plays out  But I don t know  Clarke  do you want to add anything Clark Starnes    Chief Risk OfficerYes  I don t see any big changes  and things look very stable right now  And our guidance around the range depends on the economy and also how fast some of our consumer segments grow  We ve got a lot of attractive  higher margin consumer opportunities now between the 2 companies  So it s really dependent upon the mix and the economy  But as far as stability of asset quality right now and our outlook  it looks good Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And my follow up just on provision versus charge offs on this point  You have the wider range of charge offs  but  I guess  is it fair to say that the provision pretty much matches  if you just look at your full year guidance versus what the charge off guide implies for losses  Just the moving parts between provision and charge offs  that would be helpful Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentSo I ll start and Clarke can jump in  But in essence  our provision estimate is assuming charge offs  And then all of our assumptions within CECL  as you heard from all of our peers  the models are more complex now  So you have to look at the market environment  client behavior  There s a lot more variables that you have here  We re assuming all that is static  We re assuming we re going to grow the portfolio  And our assumption is  is that mix stays the same  Obviously  all that is not going to be static like that  but that s what s built into the assumption Clark Starnes    Chief Risk OfficerYes  Ken  the way I think about it is we re going to incrementally provide charge offs generally at the reserve rate  assuming no big change in our CECL assumption  So you d assume the provisions larger than charge offs  Okay  thank you guys Operator Operator Instructions  We ll take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Erika Najarian    Bank of America    AnalystHi  good morning  My first question is on synergies once again  So very strong statement on positive operating leverage over the next three years  I m wondering if that includes any revenue synergies  And how should we think about revenue synergies going forward  The organic growth in insurance is particularly impressive given the company was combined for only 24 days  Clearly  that didn t have any impact So I wanted to understand what the revenue opportunities for the combined company are  And also  the other question on that  on the cost side  Daryl  Could you tell us about the pacing during the year in  20 and  21 of the cost savings realization  please Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo Erika  we feel    and Bill alluded to this  we feel very  very good about the revenue synergies  I mean  really  you got to remind yourself of how synergistic this combination is  SunTrust had a fantastic corporate institutional group program of fantastic wealth management strategies  a fantastic national consumer finance business  all of which are complementary  can be leveraged over BB T client base Likewise  you alluded to the insurance opportunity from BB T side and the BB T Community Bank has a broader reach than the SunTrust Community Bank reach has  So they will be able to expand some of the programs that the BB T Community Bank had into SunTrust Bank  So all of that  which  of course  not factored into our numbers  is net very positive and accretive  We can t give you numbers on that today because it s hard to really give you meaningfully accurate numbers But intuitively  from talking to our people  we know that all of those businesses are very synergistic  have huge opportunity  And the early response from our people in terms of executing on that is outstanding  Now insurance you talked about is real and very easy to kind of talk about  So I ll just ask Chris to talk about that a minute Chris Henson    Head of Banking and InsuranceYes  Erika  I might just also mention to play off of both Bill and Kelly s comments on the Community Bank and the CIB working together  just a couple tangible thoughts  When Beau Cummins and I sat down  actually designed the model  we actually designed in the Community Bank    embedded in the Community Bank about 200 folks that are capital markets  industry specialists  corporate finance specialists  Their sole purpose in life is to integrate with the regional presence  24 of those  share the client base of BB T with those individuals And we have  for example  just since December 9  7 deals that would be sizable enough that we get your attention that we have been involved in with the client  and we have commitments on 3 of those  Now 7 deals doesn t make a future  but 7 deals in about 45 days of that nature  I think  is pretty good  Both teams  I can tell you from having said in the regional presidents meetings  are exceptionally excited  And it s a natural gravitation  and I ll just    I ll leave it at that  It s been very  very effective  On the    to Kelly s point on the insurance side We two years ago really said we want to transform this business  and we brought in a consultant to really to kind of transform  starting with a white sheet of paper  I could not be more proud of what those guys have executed on  We set up 32 initiatives  We re on plan or on to our target to develop the    improve the EBITDA  Just in two years  for example  we ve increased our margins 6   And we ve got industry leading organic growth year to date  And I will tell you the 3 things you want in place are in place  We ve got industry leading retention We ve got pricings coming our way  and it s up 5   another 0 5  this quarter versus third  And our new business production  which is actually feet on The Street generating business  is up 13   And not in my career have I seen 13   So all things go in the insurance brokerage business Erika Najarian    Bank of America    AnalystAnd just a follow up question    yes Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentErika  yes  I would just tell you  It s hard to call it on a quarter by quarter basis  We re trying to give you target estimates of what we would be at the end of each year  That s probably what I would just stay with right now  We re only eight weeks into the merger  We ll have more clarity  We ll close the first full month s books next week  So give us another quarter or 2 and we ll have more certainty down the road  But I think we gave you good enough estimates and feel very confident we re going to get the cost saves Erika Najarian    Bank of America    AnalystGot it  And just as a follow up  I just wanted to make sure I understood how we should treat the purchase accounting over the three years  So you mentioned that 60  of the  4 5 billion is credit and 40  is liquidity  And I guess  the way I just understood the credit part of the mark is the nonaccretable difference  which would not accrete on over NII  And I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it the right way or does all of the  4 5 billion accrete back to NII Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  So the nuance    I mentioned this earlier  I m glad you called this out  So out of the  4 5 billion  now that we ve adopted CECL  about  200 million of it is going to go into the reserve  It s part of CECL  so it s in there now  So it s  in essence  having  4 3 billion will accrete in as principal and cash flows come in from assets and then the liabilities that you have over those terms Erika Najarian    Bank of America    AnalystGot it  Great logo Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you William H Rogers    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe  Bruyette    Wood Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette    Wood    AnalystGood morning  gentlemen  Daryl  I just have a quick follow up  I just want to make sure that I understand the comment on the CET1 10  target and then buybacks  So even though the CET1 came in at 9 4   which was a little bit lower end versus what you guys initially thought  the accretable yield that s coming through is coming in pretty fast  So does it feel like you got your timing with the CCAR submission that you guys would probably be    enable a buy back of stock in the second half of the year  Would that still sound like that s on target Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentSo Brian  yes  we did give guidance that this next quarter because of the MSR change in RWA and then the CECL adoption  our first quarter ending CET1 ratio will probably be relatively flat to what we have right now in the 9 4  range  After that  I agree with you  We ll start to build pretty quickly as we generate and accrete through the earnings power there  It s really a call on Kelly and Bill s part and the Board part on when we start buyback  Right now  we re just sticking with the 10  Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And so remember that    so remember we ve said very clearly that over the term  assuming things settle down  there s a capital opportunity with regard to Truist  We ve also said very clearly that during the first phase of our new Truist life it s really smart to be conservative  I mean we have a lot of moving parts that need to settle down  We had a lot of existential factors out in the world  but we know about that right now with what s breaking from a medical point of view  So there s just a lot of sound reason in terms of being conservative Now as that    those uncertainties settle down  to your point in terms of the capital level we have  in terms of the capital accretion that will occur predictably over the next several quarters  there certainly could be opportunity of some capital buybacks  I wouldn t be surprised at all if that were to happen Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette    Wood    AnalystThat s helpful  Appreciate it  And then  Daryl  just 1 real quick follow up  When I get to slide 17 on the guidance for merger expenses for the full year  the  600 million to  700 million  the footnote says it includes some of the incremental operating expenses related to the merger  I guess how much is in that  600 million to  700 million related to incremental operating expenses  And can you just remind us what that means in light of the differentiation between the incremental operating and the other restructuring and merger charges Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  Brian  so if you remember at that  I went through in detail the difference between what a normal merger and restructuring charges versus this incremental operating  The main primary difference is our definition of merger and restructuring basically has no future benefit  It s due just to the transaction  Because of the size of this transaction and the magnitude  there are a lot of things that we are doing at putting things together that will have some benefit  So like    in Scott s area where we re putting the systems together already working on an integration in the ecosystems  The design around putting those ecosystems together  while it has a future benefit  we re doing lots of that  hundreds of millions of dollars of people working on the architecture that we re putting those and calling those out For the most part  we have schedules in our tables that break out  We re going to pull those numbers out  But for the most part  it s in personnel and professional    are where most of those charges exist  As far as the breakdown goes  at a high level estimate  I would say  about 1 3 of it might be related to the MOE and the operating  The rest would probably be MERCs  if you could ballpark on it  But it s going to be fluid  It s going to move back and forth Brian Klock    Keefe  Bruyette    Wood    AnalystThanks your time appreciate it OperatorOur next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystGuys  A couple quick follow ups  I guess just on the CET1  Daryl  if you don t do buybacks this year  with the share count that you ve guided to  does that get you back up to the 10  in your modeling by the end of the year and you roughly add 10  to take you into  21 to get back to that 10  Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentOur estimates right now  we are plus or minus 10  toward the end of the year  It all depends on how fast the balance sheet grows and how the accretion comes in  So there s a lot of variables there  But we re in the neighborhood of 10  John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  And just to follow up on Saul s question  The purchase accounting is a nice boost for this year  It seems like the difference between the core and noncore margins suggest something like  1 5 billion or so of purchase accounting addition to NII this year  Does that fall off quickly next year  Is it a drop by 20   Or is it    just any idea of the pace that  that kind of scales down  I know you got the merger saves that will kick in to offset it  but what s the    any idea on the pace of that Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  I mean  we gave you the terms of trying to how you would amortize it in  It does fade away over the several year process  So I think you re having the right mindset of how to model it  Just know that as you model and you factor in the cost saves  you will see that you still drive positive operating leverage John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystRight  right  Okay  Last question is on to page 18  The investment    the annualized 4Q  20 investment of  200 million  What are you guys including in that  And how are you characterizing  Like what kind of investments and why you re calling that out  just to give us some color on that Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentI ll give a couple  So our executive leadership team approved about more than doubling our digital teams that are out work now and they re assigned to all the different business units working to make our improvements and enhancements for our client experience  So that would be one  In personnel  there are some key hires that we re putting out into the marketplace and more teams that have some skill sets that we don t have that we re trying to get more of  be starting to see some branding  in Dante s world  marketing going back and forth  So I don t know if anybody else wants to   Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe big one of those is the development of our innovation and technology  etc  That has got a lot of excitement  a lot of focus and a pretty immediate investment in  So that will be a big development during this year  I ll add on there commercial onboarding  I mean it s a list of dozens of things that we re seeing that are    we ve got the capacity to do them  They re not opportunistic  They re really client friendly  client focused  And we re calling it out because these are strategic investments that we think making now are going to really have an incredibly good long term payback  And deferring them for the point of meeting some quarter just doesn t make a lot of sense  So that s the reason to put them in there and call them out John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  all right  Thanks  Phil  That s helpful  So when you guys talk about the merger saves  the  1 6 billion net  that s kind of the kind of investments that you re netting against that    the merger saves Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s right Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentAnd I wouldn t expect the investment to stop at  200 million  I mean  our gross saves is well north of  1 6 billion John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystHi  good morning  So 1 quick question on the preferred dividend in the fourth quarter  Was there something unusual there  And can you give us a run rate for the quarters in 2020 Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  Lana  we have a couple preferreds that are semi annual rather than quarterly  That s the nuance that you have to factor in now when you look at the Truist dividend payout schedule Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystBut it was only  19 million  which is much lower than even  I think  the previous run rate Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYou remember  though  in the BB T world we retired one preferred and then we reissued another preferred  I think the timing of all that basically had a favorable impact in the fourth quarter  It should level out as we get into 2020 from a schedule  But if you want to talk about this offline  I m sure myself or Rich or Aaron can handle that question for you Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  great  And then just I wanted to confirm  Daryl  that you said before  On the core run rate for the expenses through 2020 by the time we get to the fourth quarter with the cost savings that we should see a decline in the quarterly run rate through the year Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  So we gave you    if you make all the adjustments  baseline for  19 is  12 8 billion  We are saying that our net cost savings for the fourth quarter of 2020 would be down  120 million  which is annualized  480 million run rate number  which is 30   and then we ll continue to build year after year on that Lana Chan    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentWelcomeOperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler Stephen Scouten    Piper Sandler    AnalystNot to beat a dead horse here  but kind of thinking about the delayed expense savings  I m just wondering  if I calculate that  it seems like the timing is about  0 20 a year in 2020 and 2021  I m wondering if there s any offsets that you ve seen in terms of upside surprises from any sort of revenue realizations or otherwise as you ve gotten into the deal so far Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerStephen  we didn t factor in intentionally any of the revenue opportunities in this  What you re seeing now is the work down in the worst case in terms of expense delay with no factored in revenue opportunities  But as you just heard Chris and Bill say  the revenue opportunities in Commercial Banking and private banking and insurance across the board are really very  very substantial And it s not something that we re talking like two years to get under way  It s under way as we speak  So it s a very conservative view to factor in the expense delay without factoring in the revenue enhancements  but that s our nature  We try to be conservative  so we d rather beat than miss  And so that s kind of the way we ve tried to factor it together Stephen Scouten    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  great  And then another question for me is just in terms of restructuring business units  loan runoff and things like that nature  has everything  in your mind  been completed here already or are in the process of what s remaining in held for sale  Or are there still other decisions to be made about additional business line exits potentially or other loans that you might look to take off the balance sheet Daryl N  Bible    Chief Financial Officer   Senior Executive Vice PresidentYes  Stephen  I would say  for the most part  we re pretty much over with from a balance sheet restructuring perspective  Everything will settle that we wanted to move off this quarter and move forward from that perspective  We still have our divestiture that s planned later in the year  probably second quarter  So that will come out of run rate when that occurs  But I think for the most part we have pretty much everything done Stephen Scouten    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks so much OperatorAnd we ll take our final question from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystI want to ask about compensation for the combined companies in terms of just retaining the employees that you have  Is there anything unique that you are doing or that you intend to do just to keep competitors away and keep your team focused Kelly S  King    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Chris  we ve been working on that from day 1 in terms of special compensation arrangements for key players and developing a very aggressive ongoing compensation program for all of our people  whether in sales jobs or in revenue jobs  I mean  for example  we did a  1 500 bonus for like 48 000 of our teammates that we just paid out in the last few months  just as a thank you for their hard work  And so yes  we ve done a lot of particular activities to try to focus on that And so that s 1 of the reasons we feel very  very confident in terms of our low attrition  And in fact  what we re seeing is low attrition  So everybody feels good  We ve done all the right things  and we will remain aggressive in terms of taking care of our teammates because  ultimately  work well or not is based on the teammates  And again  all of our teammates today feel very  very good  very  very excited  very confident  And again  I ll say again  the attrition is very  very low  So we feel very good Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystLike Kelly

194390,415906,TFC,U S  regional bank Prosperity to buy peer LegacyTexas for  2 1 billion,news," Reuters    U S  regional bank Prosperity Bancshares Inc said on Monday it would buy Plano  Texas based peer LegacyTexas Financial Group Inc for  2 1 billion  creating the second biggest bank by deposits in the state 
LegacyTexas shareholders will receive 0 528 Prosperity shares  and  6 28 in cash for each share held  representing a deal value of  41 78 per share  a premium of 9 3  based on the closing price of LegacyTexas on Friday 
The deal is also expected to strengthen Houston  Texas based Prosperity s foothold in North Texas cities as well as in and around the Dallas Fort Worth area 
As of March 31  2019  LegacyTexas held assets worth more than  9 billion  total loans of  8 1 billion and total deposits of  7 1 billion  while Prosperity held  22 35 billion in assets and  17 2 billion in deposits 
Dealmaking in the banking sector has been rising ever since U S  President Donald Trump lowered corporate taxes and eased financial regulations on regional banks 
M A activity in the sector had languished after the 2007 2009 financial crisis  as stricter rules were imposed on lenders with more than  50 billion in assets and regulators barred banks with compliance issues from expanding 
But a cut in corporate taxes in December 2017 and easing of stringent capital requirements in the following year have freed up capital  reviving dealmaking in the banking sector 
Earlier this year  U S  regional lender BB T Corp  NYSE BBT  bought rival SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  for about  28 billion in stock  marking the first big bank merger since the 2007 2009 crisis 
With more financial easing on the horizon  Wall Street analysts have said they remain optimistic about more consolidation in the banking sector  especially between super regional banks 
The deal between Prosperity and LegacyTexas is expected to close in the fourth quarter 
Kevin Hanigan  chief executive of LegacyTexas  will join Prosperity as its chief operating officer  the companies said 
Prosperity s financial adviser in the deal was Keefe  Bruyette   Woods  while J P  Morgan Securities LLC acted as financial adviser for LegacyTexas ",2019-06-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-regional-bank-prosperity-to-buy-peer-legacytexas-for-21-billion-1900100,1900100

194402,415918,TFC,Fed s Powell says  no rush  to hike rates in  solid  but slowing economy,news,"By Howard Schneider and Jason Lange WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Reserve is in  no rush to make a judgment  about further changes to interest rates  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told U S  lawmakers on Tuesday as he spelled out the central bank s approach to an economy that is likely slowing  In two hours of testimony to the Senate Banking Committee  Powell elaborated on the  conflicting signals  the Fed has tried to decipher in recent weeks  including disappointing data on retail sales and other aspects of the economy that contrast with steady hiring  wage growth  and ongoing low unemployment   The baseline outlook is a good one   Powell said  but slower growth overseas is a drag on the U S  economy that  we may feel more of  in the coming months   We have the makings of a good outlook and our  rate setting  committee is really monitoring the crosscurrents  the risks  and for now we are going to be patient with our policy and allow things to take time to clarify   If anything  Powell s comments solidified a Fed policy shift last month in which it indicated it would pause a three year cycle of rate hikes  which had been projected to run well into 2020  until the inflation or growth dynamics change  The flow of new workers into the labor force  for example  has surprised the central bank and means  there is more room to grow   Powell said  Powell  who has led the Fed for just over a year  faced virtually no pushback from Republicans on the Senate panel  as former Fed chief Janet Yellen had in the past  that the central bank was courting inflation or financial risks by leaving rates too low  After raising rates four times in 2018  and anticipating further hikes in 2019  the Fed in January switched to a  patient  stance as concerns about the global economy took root  and markets voiced doubts about the U S  economic recovery   The Fed s benchmark overnight lending rate currently is within a range of 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent  There was also little said by lawmakers about the Fed s evolving plan to maintain a balance sheet of perhaps  3 5 trillion  which would be lower than the current  4 trillion but still massive by historical standards  Republican lawmakers generally have pushed the central bank to reduce a financial footprint inflated by crisis era programs many in the party considered risky  Financial markets were largely unmoved by Powell s testimony  which was the first of his two hearings this week in Congress  He is due to appear before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday  U S  Treasury yields were lower in afternoon trading while major U S  stock indexes were slightly higher  The dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies  POLITICAL SHIFT Powell told lawmakers that the Fed expected the U S  economy to grow solidly but at a slower pace this year than the estimated 3 percent growth for 2018  an outlook that was built into the central bank s policy statement in January  The  patient  approach to rate hikes has been a staple of Fed commentary since early last month   As long as we have steady growth with no inflation  that should keep the Fed at bay   said Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago   But Tuesday s hearing did offer a preview of issues the central bank may confront as the 2020 presidential campaign takes shape  and Democrats use their recently won control of the House to press new economic and political ideas  Amid a growing debate over whether the U S  government may have far more room to expand its debt than conventional economics might recommend  or whether the Fed s own balance sheet might help finance a  Green New Deal  of economic and environmental programs  Powell made clear he was among the traditionalists   The idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong  I think that U S  debt is fairly high as a level of  gross domestic product  and  much more importantly than that  it s growing faster than GDP   Powell said   To the extent that people are talking about the Fed   our role is not to provide support for particular policies  on environmental  social or other related issues  Indeed  asked about the upcoming need to boost the U S  debt ceiling  he said he considered the prospect of a U S  government default on its obligations  a bright line  and I hope we never do pass it    Powell s appearances on Capitol Hill this week  part of his semi annual testimony to Congress  are his first since Democrats won control of the House in the November elections  They also follow the kickoff of a number of 2020 presidential campaigns   Along with questions that ranged from the sources of rural poverty to the impact of climate change on banks  Senate committee members pressed points likely to figure into the Democratic primary battle   The Fed works for big rich banks that want to get bigger and richer   said Senator Elizabeth Warren  a Massachusetts Democrat running for president  She questioned whether Powell would be adequately aggressive in reviewing a proposed megamerger between U S  regional lender BB T Corp  NYSE BBT  and rival SunTrust Banks Inc  NYSE STI    Powell pledged an  open and transparent  review of the deal   When asked whether there had been any  direct or indirect  communication from the White House about interest rates  Powell deferred  saying he would not comment on private conversations with other officials  President Donald Trump has castigated the Fed for raising rates  arguing that the monetary tightening was undercutting his administration s efforts to boost economic growth  
On Tuesday  Powell repeated his oft heard pledge that the Fed will make policy decisions  in a way that is not political  ",2019-02-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-powell-patient-policy-still-warranted-despite-solid-us-growth-1790832,1790832

194415,415931,TFC,Can Value Investors Pick BB T Corporation  BBT  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BB T Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 47  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 48  If we focus on the long term PE trend  BB T Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 72 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that BB T Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 85  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for BB T Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BB T Corporation has a P S ratio of about 3 02  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 26x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BB T Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BB T Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though BB T Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives BBT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the next year estimate has seen four up and six down in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has fallen by 1 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BB T Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBB T Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 25  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops  Since 1988  the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of  24 50  per year  So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention

194420,415936,TFC,Annoying Bank Fees and How to Avoid Them,news,"Several banks require you to have your account open for a certain amount of time before you can close it  They will charge you an early account closure fee  with an industry average being roughly  25  BB T  NYSE BBT  and Citibank both charge this fee if you do not keep your account open for at least 90 days  Other banks will require you to keep your account open for as long as 180 days  Make sure to ask questions about an early account closure fee before opening your new account  in order to avoid this fee 
Many banks charge maintenance fees  so make sure you know what the parameters are  Some banks require a minimum balance to avoid these fees  while others charge a flat out fee  regardless  Typically  the minimum balance required is an average over the entire month  so if you do not get steady paychecks  you may need to ask the bank about this ahead of time

194426,415942,TFC,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  BB T  BBT  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
BB T in Focus
BB T  BBT  is headquartered in Winston Salem  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 19 23  since the start of the year  The regional banking company is paying out a dividend of  0 41 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 14  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 94  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 87  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 62 is up 3 8  from last year  Over the last 5 years  BB T has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12 65   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  BB T s payout ratio is 38   which means it paid out 38  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BBT expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 16 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 6 39  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  BBT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-bbampt-bbt-could-be-a-great-choice-200446349,200446349

194447,415963,TFC,Why BB T  BBT  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
BB T in Focus
Based in Winston Salem  BB T  BBT  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 12 6   The regional banking company is paying out a dividend of  0 41 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 32  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 9  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 94  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 62 is up 3 8  from last year  BB T has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12 32   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  BB T s current payout ratio is 39   This means it paid out 39  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BBT expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 30 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 97  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  BBT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bbt-bbt-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200423889,200423889
194448,415964,TFC,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For BB T  BBT ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering BB T  BBT   which belongs to the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry 
This regional banking company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1 45  
For the last reported quarter  BB T came out with earnings of  1 05 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 03 per share  representing a surprise of 1 94   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 04 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 05 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 96  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for BB T  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
BB T currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 83   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 18  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-bbt-bbt-200437080,200437080
194449,415965,TFC,BB T  BBT  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when BB T  BBT  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional banking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 98 billion  up 3 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 9  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BB T 
For BB T  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 74  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that BB T will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that BB T would post earnings of  1 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  1 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
BB T appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bbt-bbt-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200438971,200438971

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BB T 
For BB T  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 58  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BB T will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that BB T would post earnings of  1 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  0 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
BB T doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bbt-bbt-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200405971,200405971

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for BB T  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
BB T currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 32   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 18  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  BBT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-bbt-bbt-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200383221,200383221

194485,416001,TFC,Tax cut debate in U S  Congress swings to Senate bill,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON  Reuters    A U S  Senate tax cut bill  differing from one in the House of Representatives  was expected to be unveiled on Thursday  complicating a Republican tax overhaul push and increasing skepticism on Wall Street about the effort  As the House tax committee worked on its bill  members of the Senate weighed new approaches to corporate taxes  deductions for state and local taxes and the estate tax on inherited assets  senators said  providing few details  John Cornyn  the No  2 Senate Republican  told reporters that senators would be briefed on the bill on Thursday before its release   House and Senate Republicans are working on separate plans for the biggest overhaul of the U S  tax code since the 1980s  President Donald Trump and his House allies have proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent  one of the costliest features of the wide ranging House plan  The tax overhaul is a priority for Trump  who says it will boost economic growth and create jobs  Republicans have yet to score a major legislative win since he took office in January  although they control Congress as well as the White House  Democrats have blasted the proposals in the Republican tax legislation as giveaways to large corporations and the rich  Senator Orrin Hatch  chairman of the tax writing finance committee  told reporters he would prefer not to delay a corporate tax cut by a year  which some lawmakers said was a possibility   I d prefer to get it done   he said  Financial markets have rallied since Trump s stunning election victory in November 2016  partly on expectations that he and Congress would slash taxes on businesses  Stock markets closed little changed on Wednesday  with investors focused on chances for a tax bill becoming law   I do think there s disappointment with Republicans kicking the tax bill around      Some of the things leaking out are not encouraging   said Bucky Hellwig  senior vice president at BB T  NYSE BBT  Wealth Management in Birmingham  Alabama  WARNING TO REPUBLICANS The latest version of the House bill would add  1 7 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years  said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  which tallies the costs of legislation  That would violate a rule requiring the legislation to add no more than  1 5 trillion to the deficit  But Representative Kevin Brady  Republican chairman of the House tax committee  said he would revise the legislation on Thursday to bring it into compliance   A report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank said the biggest tax cuts would go to high income households under the current bill  which would raise taxes on more than one in four taxpayers by 2027 because of the expiration of certain benefits including a  300 family credit   Top earners with incomes of more than  730 000 would get 21 percent of the benefits in 2018 and nearly 50 percent in a decade  the report said  The House bill would repeal a tax deduction Americans can now take for state and local income and sales taxes  but preserve it for business owners  It would cap the deduction for state and local property tax paid at  10 000   Republican Senator David Perdue told reporters the Senate bill could repeal the entire state and local tax  SALT  deduction  a concern for people in heavily Democratic high tax states such as California  New York and New Jersey   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said victories for Democrats in state elections on Tuesday should be a warning to Republicans   The Republicans should look at the elections last night  and it should be a giant stop sign for their tax bill   Schumer said  There are enough Republicans from high tax states in the House to torpedo the tax bill  given that Democrats broadly oppose it  Republicans  who have a slim 52 48 majority in the Senate  also may need support from Democrats to pass their version  The House and Senate must agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president  ESTATE TAX Republican Senator Susan Collins  whose vote is crucial  declined to say if the Senate bill would duplicate the House s proposed estate tax repeal  But she told reporters   It s certainly true that I expressed reservations about having complete repeal    A Washington tax expert raised concern about a House provision to create a 25 percent tax rate for  pass through  businesses  saying it would do little to help small business and be vulnerable to abuse  Pass through businesses  which include mom and pop enterprises and large private companies  are not organized as publicly traded corporations  Profits are passed through to their owners as individual income and taxed at rates as high as 39 6 percent  Steven Rosenthal  a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center  said the new pass through rate  would add great complexity  and  provide plenty of opportunity for clever investors and business owners     to game the system   In addition  a proposed 20 percent excise tax meant to discourage foreign companies from shifting U S  profits offshore  appears dead   said Chris Krueger  an analyst at financial firm Cowen s Washington Research Group  The tax was amended by the House committee after complaints from multinational companies

194503,416019,TFC,Will BB T  BBT  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering BB T  BBT   which belongs to the Zacks Banks   Major Regional industry 
This regional banking company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1 50  
For the most recent quarter  BB T was expected to post earnings of  1 per share  but it reported  1 03 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 01 per share  while it actually produced  1 01 per share  a surprise of 0  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for BB T  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
BB T has an Earnings ESP of  2 56  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 17  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-bbt-bbt-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200369175,200369175

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional banking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 95 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BB T 
For BB T  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 64  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that BB T will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that BB T would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  3  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
BB T appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bbt-bbt-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200374499,200374499

194513,416029,TFC,5 Stocks To Buy As House Votes To Soften Bank Regulations ,opinion,Late on May 22  the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill loosening Obama era regulations on the banking industry  The Economic Growth  Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act not only eases rules for banks  it sets the stage for further deregulation by multiple agencies  President Trump is widely expected to sign the bill into law before Memorial Day  According to House Speaker Paul Ryan  the new bill is likely to significantly benefit community banks  However  apart from suburban and rural banks  the bill is also expected to benefit regional and medium sized institutions  With additional rate hikes also around the corner  investing in select bank stocks looks like a smart option    House Approves Bill Easing Bank RulesOn Tuesday  the House voted 258 to 159 to approve the bipartisan Senate drafted legislation which significantly deregulates the banking industry  The bill raised the assets threshold for banks which are considered too important to fail from  50 billion to  250 billion  In doing so  it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision As a result  the likes of SunTrust Banks  Inc    NYSE STI   and BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   will no longer have to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills  These plans outline how a bank proposes to be wound up in case it faces bankruptcy The bill also cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks  New measures have been introduced for those taking student loans  Additionally  credit reporting agencies will now be required to offer credit monitoring services at no charge  Further Deregulation on the AnvilThe new legislation also gives regulators greater discretion to decide at what point banks holding  100 billion to  250 billion in assets would have to undergo stress tests for capital adequacy  Such a need would  of course  only arise in case another financial crisis takes place This doesn t exclude the largest banks from stress tests altogether  But  increasing the threshold from  50 billion to  250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the  political cover  to further ease regulations governing such stress tests  These tests are collectively termed Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR Further  multiple agencies  including the SEC and the Fed  have powers to amend the manner in which the Volcker Rule is implemented  Congressional approval would not be required in such an event  For instance  regulators plan to remove an assumption that defines positions held by banks for a period led than 60 days as speculative  Our ChoicesIn keeping with Trump s electoral promises  the new bill passed by the House has greatly eased banking regulations  Further  it has set the stage for further deregulation which will likely be undertaken by multiple financial agencies Investing in banking

194578,416094,TFC,Isles close in on series win  beat Panthers in double OT,news," The Sports Xchange    Two weeks ago  Alan Quine was in the minor leagues  Now he is a New York Islanders hero  Quine scored a game winning power play goal with 4 00 left in double overtime as the New York Islanders defeated the Florida Panthers 2 1 on Friday night at the BB T  NYSE BBT  Center  taking a 3 2 lead in their best of seven first round playoff series  The power play was set up when Panthers center Derek MacKenzie was called for slashing  and that s when the 23 year old Quine came through  putting an end to an exhausting game   Everyone wanted to score before the end of the second overtime  but we weren t worried if it went longer   said Quine  who didn t score his first NHL goal until April 9   However long it took  we wanted to make sure we didn t let up    Our energy  was low  and then it was high  when New York scored   That gave us an extra jolt   The close game was indicative of the entire series  Aside from one empty netter  each of the first five games in this series has been decided by one goal  Center Frans Nielsen scored New York s other goal  and Thomas Greiss made 47 saves to earn the win  Greiss  biggest stop came with 12 41 left in the first overtime after Islanders defenseman Calvin De Haan grabbed the puck in the crease  which was ruled an infraction  Panthers center Aleksander Barkov was awarded a penalty shot  but his backhand move was stopped by Greiss  That was just the third penalty shot in NHL playoff history  and De Haan did not agree with the call   It was kind of a phantom penalty shot   he said   I didn t cover the puck in the crease  I just grabbed it and spun it  You can t control it like a soccer ball and take it off the chest  It was a reactionary play    Greiss  made a good save  on the penalty shot   and I feel like that was the turning point of the game   The game was marred by a gruesome injury  With 18 11 left in double overtime  the Panthers lost second line center Nick Bjugstad  who was clipped at the knees by New York s Shane Prince  falling face first into the boards  Bjugstad remained down on the ice for about five minutes before he was able to recover and head to the trainers  room  Panthers coach Gerard Gallant said Bjugstad needed some stitches to close a cut on his head   Hopefully he s alright   Panthers defenseman Brian Campbell said   That was definitely scary   This was the Islanders  first win in a Game 5 since 1987  snapping a 0 for 11 skid  Game 6 is set for Sunday in New York  where the Islanders can clinch their first series win since 1993  No team has waited longer to advance in the playoffs than the Islanders  although Florida hasn t won a series since 1996  The winner of this series will play the Tampa Bay Lightning in the second round  The Islanders apparently learned some lessons of late  As of Friday morning  they were in this scenario    tied 2 2 heading into Game 5    twice in the past couple years  In 2013  they lost at the Pittsburgh Penguins  In 2014  they lost 5 1 at the Washington Capitals  This time  the Islanders came out on top  thanks in part to Quine  Nielsen and Greiss  who had never started a playoff game before this series but now has three wins  Nielsen has three goals in the playoffs  one in each of New York s wins  Florida was led by Barkov  who scored the Panthers  goal  and goalie Roberto Luongo  who made 40 saves  The Islanders again shut down Panthers right winger Jaromir Jagr  who hasn t scored in a playoff game since 2012  a span of 36 games  Jagr  44  had four shots on goal in 28 42 of ice time  New York scored first  With 6 29 left in the first period  Nielsen rebounded a Thomas Hickey shot and scored from the slot  Florida tied the score 1 1 with 18 01 left in the third period  Defenseman Alex Petrovic  who scored the game winning goal in the third period of Game 4  set up Barkov for the tying goal  Petrovic threaded a pass from the right side  through traffic and in between Jagr s legs  right to Barkov  who tapped the puck in on the left side with a yawning net to shoot at  The Islanders  claiming offside  challenged the goal  but the play stood as called  That was all the scoring until Quine s game winner  And now  with the series headed back to Brooklyn  the Islanders have the edge  In the history of the Stanley Cup playoffs  in series tied 2 2  the team that came out on top in Game 5 advanced 78 4 percent of the time  Campbell  though  said the Panthers won t back down   We ll be ready   he said

194580,416096,TFC,Weak Trading Might Curb Morgan Stanley s  MS  Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Morgan Stanley s   NYSE MS   fourth quarter and 2017 results  scheduled for Jan 18  are likely to witness a fall in trading income   one of the major revenue components  While this might majorly affect its earnings  an expected improvement in revenues from other segments  will likely offset the adverse impact to some extent The decline in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U S  Presidential election results  But trading activities remained sluggish in the to be reported quarter Several political and geopolitical developments  hike in interest rates  passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility  However  subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag Also  similar to the last couple of quarters  lower fixed income trading is expected to be largely responsible for lower trading revenues in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of  1 12 billion reflects a decline of 3 9  sequentially and 23 6  from the year ago quarter  On the other hand  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of  1 92 billion indicates a rise of 1 5  from the prior quarter  But the same is expected to fall 1 7  on a year over year basis Overall  fourth quarter trading revenues are expected to be  2 86 billion  down 1 8  from the last quarter and 10 3  from the prior year quarter Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley s fourth quarter results Underwriting fees to rise  Despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally  fourth quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception  Strong rally in the equity markets across the world might have propelled IPOs and follow on offerings  So  the related fees are projected to increase for Morgan Stanley  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of  312 million reflects a surge of 38 7  from the prior year quarter Further  as the interest rate hike is expected to continue  many U S  companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later  As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley s total underwriting fees  this will lead to strong gains  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of  440 million reflects year over year growth of 4 5  All in all  total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 14 4  year over year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is  752 million Modest rise in net interest income  NII   Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income  But overall loan demand remained weak   particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate  Therefore  NII is anticipated to witness slight growth Advisory fees to show weakness  Slowdown in M A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M As announced in the fourth quarter will have an adverse effect on advisory fees  Thus  Morgan Stanley is not likely to be untouched  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is  573 million  down 8 8  year over year Expense control to support bottom line  Morgan Stanley s cost savings plan   Project Streamline   is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter  Also  as much improvement in revenues is not likely  chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low  Notably  the company expects to lower its expenses by  1 billion in 2017 Adverse impact of new tax code  Following the passage of the tax act in December 2017  Morgan Stanley announced expectation of one time charge of  1 4 billion in the fourth quarter related to write down of certain net deferred tax assets  However  this will partially be offset by nearly  160 million net discrete tax benefit  mainly related to  the remeasurement of reserves and related interest relating to the status of multi year Internal Revenue Service tax examinations  Therefore  the company is anticipated to record a net one time charge of  1 25 billion in the to be reported quarter Here is what our quantitative model predicts Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 77 cents reflects a 4 9  decline on a year over year basis  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  9 1 billion indicates 1 2  growth from the prior year quarter Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise
    Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   is slated to release results on Jan 18  It has an Earnings ESP of  0 33  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK   has an Earnings ESP of  0 16  and carries a Zacks Rank of 3  The company is also slated to release results on Jan 18 SunTrust Banks  Inc    NYSE STI   is scheduled to release results on Jan 19  It has an Earnings ESP of  0 81  and carries a Zacks Rank of 2 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weak-trading-might-curb-morgan-stanleys-ms-q4-earnings-200280704,200280704

nearly 1  year over year to  1 17 billion  Rise in service charges on deposits  bankcard fees and merchant discounts  operating lease income and other income led to the growth  These increases were mostly offset by lower mortgage banking income and income from bank owned life insurance  Also  the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income Non interest expense of  1 75 billion increased 2 3

The company s retail banking business has been struggling  Income from continuing operations at the unit fell 46 percent in the second quarter  Revenue from the business accounts for nearly a quarter of total revenue 
The bank had 3 463 branches in 35 countries as of June 30  with a little over a third of them in North America  according to a filing 
The latest purchase will boost BB T s total branches in Texas to 123 with  5 3 billion of deposits 
BB T said it would pay a premium to book value of about 5 3 percent of total deposits 
Citi said the sale was not material to its earnings and that it would continue its other businesses in Texas 
Deutsche Bank Securities was financial adviser and Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen   Katz provided legal counsel to BB T for the deal

194630,416146,TFC,Wells Fargo  WFC  Penalized By Court On Abusive Tax Shelter  ,opinion,"Following a three week trial in a federal court in Minnesota  the jury passed a verdict on Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC    The bank has been penalized with a 20  negligence fine in relation to the foreign tax credits claimed on the basis of Structured Trust Advantaged Repackaged Securities  STARS   a tax shelter that secures U S  companies  profits from double taxation 
Despite the bank s assurance of STARS being a single and low cost funding based transaction  the court found two different transactions  a loan and a trust structure  The loan was a  1 25 billion contribution by Barclays  LON BARC  PLC   NYSE BCS   to the Wells Fargo trust  which the bank had to repay after five years  It was found that the bank entered into it for tax related purposes only   
Whereas regarding the trust  the jury found that it contained potential for pretax profit and that the bank entered into it solely for tax reasons  However  Wells Fargo has to pay the penalty for the underpayments of the foreign tax credits disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service 
In the past  the courts have been found to have rejected tax shelters coming under STARS  which involved banks such as Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK    BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT   and Santander  MC SAN  Bank 
This is another blow to Wells Fargo s reputation in a short time span  Although  the bank s efforts to alleviate the impact of the scandals are encouraging  its financials continue to remain under pressure 
Wells Fargo s shares have gained 2 4  in the last six months  underperforming the 8 1  growth for Zacks categorized  industry

194639,416155,TFC,BBT Is Poised to Rebound Versus Prudential  Pair Trade,opinion,"A pair trade is a market neutral trade  were you are speculating on the relative value of one stock to another  There are several ways to find market neutral trades  and one of the best is to find a mis valued pair trade where the companies are in the same sector 
BB T Corp  NYSE BBT  has declined relative to Prudential  LON PRU   During the past 3 years the ratio of the two companies share prices has stretched to 2 5 standard devations from the 100 day moving average  generating an opportunity to purchase one stock and short the other 
This has happened 6 times over the past 3 years and in all six occasions  the ratio between BB T and Prudential has reverted back to the mean 
There are multiple ways that you can take a position where you buy BBT and Sell PRU  The most common would be to purchase BBT and Short sell PRU  The ratio is approximately 0 42  so you want to short 42 PRU for Every 100 BBT you purchase
You can also  use options to take a position  there are website such as Optionwisdom that describe how to use options to generate a pair spread 
For example  you can purchase the BB T April 21   46 call and sell the PRU April 21   110 call for a net credit of  0 10  This position makes money if the ratio of the prices remains unchanged or moves in favor of BB T  Both strikes are 5  out of the money 
Example
Purchase BBT April 21  2017  46 call for  0 30  5  0 30    1 50 Sell PRU April 21  2017  110 for  0 80  2 80    1 60 
You want to use the ratio of approximately 42   So you purchase 5 BBT calls for every 2 PRU Calls  for a net debit of  0 10 
The benefit of trading the options position is that if the prices of both shares move lower you make money  and if they both rise  you are positioned to take advantage if BBT outperforms PRU ",2017-03-23,David Becker,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bbt-is-poised-to-rebound-versus-prudential---pair-trade-200179985,200179985

However  spurred demand for loans with an improving domestic economy is the silver lining for the U S  banks  While margin pressure may not alleviate any time soon given the indifferent interest rate picture  rising loan volume will make up for the loss to some extent  Most importantly  the recuperating financial condition of Americans will minimize default rates on loans        Overall  banks are not expected to be relieved of the nonstop cropping up of issues before long  In addition to increasing threats related to cybercrime and unconventional competition  they will keep grappling with the ever changing regulatory restrictions  Actually  failure to control the cost of business due to so many mandates and defensive actions will mar their profitability 
But banks are not sitting idle  They are continuously attempting to reduce needless expenses by reorganizing business and increasing focus on non interest revenue sources  Actually  this is how they have been able to deliver decent bottom line numbers in the past few quarters  Hopefully  the success will make them smarter in the quarters ahead

194689,416205,TFC,SunTrust  STI  Beats On Q2 Earnings  Provision Increases,opinion,"A rise in revenues drove SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI   Inc  s second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 89 cents per share  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents  Also  the figure was in line with the prior year tally  The reported quarter result excluded 5 cents of benefit from discrete items 
	Results reflected an improvement in net interest income benefiting from the Dec 2015 rate hike and a rise in non interest income  Further  growth in loans and deposits acted as a tailwind  However  a jump in provision for credit losses and marginal rise in operating expenses were the downsides 
	Net income available to common shareholders was  475 million  up 2  year over year 






Improving Net Interest Income Drove Results
	Total revenue  fully tax equivalent basis  grew 7  from the prior year quarter to  2 22 billion  Further  the reported figure was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 14 billion 
	Net interest income  FTE basis  surged 10  year over year to  1 32 billion  The rise was attributable to loan growth and a higher net interest margin  NIM  
	Further  NIM was up 13 basis points  bps  year over year to 2 99   reflecting higher benchmark interest rates and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio 
	Non interest income was  898 million  up 3  from the prior year quarter  The rise was largely driven by higher mortgage related revenues and  44 million net asset related gains  partially offset by decline in capital markets and wealth management related income 
	Non interest expenses inched up 1  from the year ago quarter to  1 35 billion  The increase was due to a rise in all expense components except outside processing and software costs  net occupancy expenses and other non interest expenses Deteriorating Credit Quality
	Total non performing assets were  1 billion as of Jun 30  2016  up 52  from the prior year quarter  The increase was mainly due to downgrades in certain energy related loans  Non performing loans increased 31 bps year over year to 0 67  of total loans held for investment 
	Also  provision for credit losses surged drastically to  146 million from  26 million in the year ago quarter  The significant rise was due to higher energy related charge offs  moderating asset quality improvements and loan growth  Further  rate of net charge offs increased 13 bps year over year to 0 39  of total average loans held for investment Strong Balance Sheet
	As of Jun 30  2016  SunTrust had total assets of  199 1 billion  while shareholders  equity summed  24 5 billion  representing 12  of total assets  As of Jun 30  2016  loans grew 7  year over year to  141 7 billion  Total consumer and commercial deposits rose 5  year over year to  151 8 billion 
	SunTrust s estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III  on a fully phased in basis  was 9 84  as of Jun 30  2016 Share Repurchase
	During the quarter  SunTrust bought back shares worth  175 million Our Viewpoint
	We believe that SunTrust remains well positioned for future growth given its favorable deposit mix  continued expense discipline and enhanced credit quality  Also  the company s steady capital deployment activities look impressive 
	Though efficient cost containment efforts continue to ease pressure on the bottom line  exposure to risky assets and heightened regulatory pressure will likely continue weighing on the profitability in the near term

194707,416223,TFC,4 Banks Set To Beat Earnings Despite Tough Sector Backdrop,opinion,"U S  banks  forming a broader part of the financial sector  always draw maximum attention  The industry backdrop for banks remained tough in the first two quarters of 2014  and the third quarter was no different 
Weaker consumer and corporate activities  lackluster mortgage banking activities  soft trading volumes  restructuring expenses and mounting legal costs continue to put significant pressure on bottom line growth  Also  stringent regulations continue to affect banks  investment activities and lead to a rise in compliance costs  Stricter capital requirements further add to the woes 
Moreover  growth in interest income is expected to remain subdued owing to sluggish loan growth and persistent pressure on net interest margins from a still low rate environment  Further  improvement in non interest revenues is likely to be hampered by lower mortgage banking income and continued downturn in fixed income and currencies and commodities  FICC   However  investment banking should support fee income to some extent  driven by continued strength in M A and IPO activities 
Additionally  expense control initiatives  through streamlining of businesses and job cuts  as well as stable balance sheets will serve as catalysts  Also  favorable equity market and gradually improving macroeconomic factors  falling unemployment rates and stabilizing housing markets  are expected to act as tailwinds 
Nevertheless  Major Banks seem to have suffered the most during the quarter with an expected year over year earnings decline of 21 6   However  Banks and Thrifts seem to have performed well and could witness 12 5  earnings growth

194708,416224,TFC,Cost Saving Initiatives Make Devon Stand Out,opinion,"Devon Energy Corp  NYSE  NYSE DVN  reported its first quarter results on May 5 and it was a bit uninspiring  DVN reported a net loss of  3 6 billion during the first quarter  compared with the profit of  324 million that the company reported during the same quarter a year ago  In addition  it reported total operating revenues of about  3 27 billion for the quarter  compared with the  3 73 billion it generated during the prior year quarter  These results certainly raise a question of if investors can still trust this company  Let s look a bit into the company to see  For what it is  it would be unfair to single out Devon for criticism  Investors have to understand that it would be quite difficult to be profitable in the current oil and gas landscape  For the sake of reference  its close competitor Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE  NYSE CHK  reported a net loss of  3 782 billion for the first quarter  The main reason for the glut of losses in the oil and gas space is that oil companies usually have a set minimum crude oil price upon which they commission their exploration projects   in order to be profitable   And with crude oil having declined over 50 percent over the past year  it would be extremely difficult for oil explorers to remain profitable  While this a red light  investor should focus on other performance metrics for now  as the situation right now is a bit above the control of the company  Moreover  with oil prices largely determined by demand and supply trends  the oil market debacle certainly won t last long  since the current oil boom will also not last forever  We ll only have to wait to see how long that would be   In the meantime  let s focus on some features of Devon that shows that the company can survive even if oil prices never quite return to pre July 2014 levels  Cost savings Initiatives  The company said in the first quarter report that it was able to reduce operating cost by nine percent on a year over year basis  Beyond the fact that an overall reduction in operating cost is great on its own  investor also need to appreciate that the company was able to effect the cost reduction  across all regions of the company s portfolio   In addition  that Devon was able to achieve such cost saving while doing record production is impressive  If nothing else  it shows that the company has a working strategy for reducing its costs  If there is one thing that the current situation in the oil market has taught us  it is that oil companies have to work on cutting their cost   consciously  I believe Devon is nailing it on this front  You d understand this by thinking about the benefits of seeking out really convenient mortgage terms from firms like BB T Mortgage  NYSE BBT   Following the cost reduction in the first quarter  the company says it now expects a cash cost savings of about  170 million for the entire 2015  If Devon can continue with such cost reduction across all of its portfolio  then it s certainly molding itself into a value play  Focusing on low cost high yield assets  Having experienced cost reduction across all of its portfolio  one thing that is evident is that the company is focusing its business on low cost high yield assets  Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb echoed this point in its latest letter to    We believe the company has significant scope for improvement on operational execution as management begins to focus its capital in fewer  higher return areas   wrote Loeb  Loeb was specifically referring to three areas including the Permian Basin  the Eagleford shale and the CanaWoodford  Again  this sort of discipline to focus only on high return areas shows that company has what it takes to survive in a sector where falling prices necessitates cost reductions  Following the first quarter result  the company says it now expects its capital spending to be between  3 9 and  4 1 billion compared to the previous guidance of  4 1 to  4 4 billion  
Loeb s hedge fund increased its position in Devon to benefit from the company s improving operational efficiency  Third Point isn t the only Hedge fund that thinks Devon offers a value proposition  Soros Fund Management LLC  which manages George Soros  investments  initiated a position in the energy company during the fourth quarter of last year  For Soros  Fund to have done that in a period where investing in oil related companies is discouraging only goes to validate what Loeb says   in my opinion 
Below is a list of ten notable institutional investors that have taken advantage of declined oil prices to buy  more  shares of Devon Source of Funds  information   Investor Takeaway Since the start of the decline in oil prices  DVN stock has fallen from close to  80 per share to the region of  65 per share  Factoring the cost saving initiatives of Devon with its focus on operational efficiency through high return areas  I believe the dip presents an opportunity to buy at a discount for long term gains ",2015-05-15,Craig Adeyanju,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cost-savings-initiatives-make-devon-stand-out-251928,251928
