144376,365891,MCHP,Pressure for 2020 as U S  companies report end of weak profit year,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    As major U S  corporations prepare to close the books on a lackluster year of profit growth  they may need to shore up confidence that 2020 will show significant improvement to keep the stock market s rally going 
Wall Street surged to record highs last week  partly reflecting growing hopes for a resolution to U S  President Donald Trump s tariff war with China 
Investors are anxious to find out whether that will bolster the case for a pickup in earnings growth after the S P 500 s  SPX  29  gain in 2019 occurred despite anemic profit growth in the first three quarters 
Fourth quarter S P 500 earnings are expected to have declined 0 6  year over year  which would mark the second straight quarterly decline  or a profit recession  the last of which occurred in 2015 2016  Yet  earnings are seen climbing about 10  in 2020  and strategists say that growth is needed to sustain Wall Street s rally 
 If the outlook we re getting for 2020 is similar  to 2019   maybe we will hit a point where investors decide to take a pause   said Michael O Rourke  chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford  Connecticut   But we ll need several large companies to indicate some type of slowing

With JPMorgan Chase  N JPM    Citigroup   N C  and other big banks kicking off the fourth quarter reporting season this week  investors are likely to focus less on recent earnings and more on corporate outlooks for 2020 in light of Trump s so called Phase 1 trade deal  which is scheduled to be signed this week 
Investors got a potential early preview on Monday  when semiconductor industry bellwether Microchip Technology  O MCHP  said it believes the December quarter represented the bottom of a downturn it has been suffering   barring any negative developments on the U S  China trade front or unexpected fallout from geopolitical events  
That has helped push the Philadelphia Semiconductor index  SOX  up 0 7  last week after surging 60  last year 
If most companies end up beating analysts  earnings forecasts  as often happens  the S P 500 could end up posting a small profit gain for the fourth quarter 
Still  the stock market s strong performance  also super charged by expectations of continued low interest rates  has stretched earnings multiples 
 We better enter 2020 with a running head start on earnings because there certainly was not much last year   said Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago 
 Given that we are not going to get much P E expansion this year   we can t do that twice in a row unless we continue to slash rates   we are going to need to see outlooks improve  
The benchmark index is trading at the equivalent of 18 times earnings expected over the next 12 months  according to Refinitiv s Datastream  That is up from a forward earnings multiple of 16 in early October and roughly 14 at the end of 2018 
After surging 50  in the past 12 months  the S P 500 technology sector  SPLRCT  has a PE above 21  up from 19 in early October  Tech led gains among sectors last year 
 We still don t have the profits to subtantiate the market s recent performance  But if we get more chip companies coming out and saying that things are getting better  that would be huge   said Daniel Morgan  a portfolio manager who specializes in tech stocks at Synovus Trust in Atlanta

Tariffs imposed on imports from China and other trading partners have cost U S  companies  46 billion since February 2018  and U S  exports of goods hit by retaliatory tariffs have fallen sharply  according to an analysis of Commerce Department data 
Strategists say uncertainty about the trade situation has caused some companies to be cautious with their big investments in buildings and equipment 
S P 500 capital expenditures grew just 3 3  in the third quarter of 2019 versus the year ago quarter  and growth is well off the gains in 2018  which was helped by the U S  tax cut package  The tax cuts also boosted corporate share buybacks to record levels  according to S P Dow Jones data 
Investors may also be watchful for comments from energy companies on the impact of recent tensions between the United States and Iran  which caused a brief jump in oil prices 
Energy sector earnings are expected to jump 23 8  in 2020 after an estimated drop of 29 4  in 2019 ",2020-01-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pressure-for-2020-as-us-companies-report-end-of-weak-profit-year-2057541,2057541
144379,365894,MCHP,Microchip Technology  MCHP  Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,news,"Microchip Technology  NASDAQ MCHP Q3 2020 Earnings CallFeb 04  2020  5 00 p m  ETContents   Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood day  everyone  and welcome to this Microchip s third quarter fiscal 2020 financial results conference call  As a reminder  today s call is being recorded  At this time  I would like to turn the call over to Mr  Eric Bjornholt  chief financial officer  Sir  please begin Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  and good afternoon  everyone  During the course of this conference call  we will be making projections and other forward looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company  We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions  and that actual events or results may differ materially  We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip s business and results of operations  In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi  Microchip s chairman and CEO  and Ganesh Moorthy  Microchip s president and COO  I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance  and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance  We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions  We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non GAAP measures We have posted a full GAAP to non GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at   which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non GAAP results  We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website  I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018  we adopted the new GAAP revenue recognition standard  which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors versus our historical revenue recognition policy  where revenue on such transactions were deferred until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer  As discussed in previous earnings conference call  we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue plus distribution sell through activity  And each quarter  we ll provide a metric for this called end market demand in our earnings release  Therefore  along with our GAAP and non GAAP results  based on distribution sell in  we will also provide investors with our end market demand based on distribution sell out  but will not provide a P L based on end market demand  End market demand in the December 2019 quarter was  1 324 billion  end market demand was about  36 1 million more than our GAAP revenue in the December 2019 quarter  I will now go through some of the operating results  including net sales  gross margin and operating expenses  I will be referring to these results on a non GAAP basis  which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities  share based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our press release  Net sales in the December quarter were  1 287 billion  which was down 3 76  sequentially and near the high end of our updated revenue guidance provided on January 6  2020  We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales and end market demand by product line and geography on our website for your reference  On a non GAAP basis  gross margins were 61 5   operating expenses were 26 4   and operating income was 35 1  and above the high end of our guidance  Non GAAP net income was  340 8 million  Non GAAP earnings per diluted share was  1 32  which was above the high end of our last provided non GAAP EPS guidance from December 3  2019 of  1 30  On a GAAP basis  gross margins were 61  and include the impact of  5 7 million of share based compensation expense  Total operating expenses were  654 3 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of  248 7 million  special charges of  17 8 million   10 9 million of acquisition related and other costs and share based compensation of  37 8 million  The GAAP net income was  311 1 million or  1 20 per diluted share  Our December quarter of GAAP tax benefit was significantly positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the intra group transfer of certain intellectual property rights  The non GAAP cash tax rate was 6  in the December quarter  We expect our non GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal  20 to be about 6   exclusive of any transition tax  any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the Microsemi operations and the Microchip s global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years  We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U S  interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low  The future cash tax payments associated with the transition tax is expected to be about  245 million and will be paid over the next six years  We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the investor relations page of our website  Our inventory balance at December 31  2019  was  708 8 million  We had 129 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter  down two days from the prior quarter s level  Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 28 days compared to 30 days at the end of September  We ve only had one quarter in the past 15 years  which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013  where our days of inventory at distribution have been at lower than the current levels  The cash flow from operating activities was  395 5 million in the December quarter  As of December 31  the consolidated cash and total investment position was  402 3 million  We paid down  257 million of total debt in the December quarter  and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by  254 2 million  Over the last six full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over  8 billion in debt to do so  we have paid down  1 986 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash generation beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt  We have accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period  which we feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business  We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years  Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was  503 4 million  and our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was  2 125 billion  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA  excluding our very long dated convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity like in nature  was 4 58 at December 31  2019  Our dividend payment in the December quarter was  87 7 million  Capital expenditures were  14 1 million in the December 2019 quarter  We expect between  20 million and  25 million in capital spending in the March quarter  and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between  76 million and  81 million  We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced  We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business  particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories  Depreciation expense in the December quarter was  41 4 million  I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter  Ganesh  Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer Thank you  Eric  and good afternoon  everyone  Before I get started  I d like to remind you that the product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end market demand  which is how Microchip measures its performance internally  Let s start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers  Our microcontroller business was sequentially down 1 1  as compared to the September quarter  We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontrollers  including next generation Bluetooth 5 0 dual mode audio solutions  production ready open source tools for managing our Adaptec Smart Storage offerings and industry support for development of the Open Compute Project s Accelerator Infrastructure through our PCIe switches  Microcontrollers represented 53 6  of our end market demand in the December quarter  Moving to analog  Our analog business was sequentially down 3 6  as compared to the September quarter  During the quarter  we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products  including the IEEE 802 3bt compliant power over Ethernet injectors and midspans that enable up to 90 watts of power without changing switches or cable  Analog represented 28 1  of our end market demand in the December quarter  Our FPGA business was sequentially flat as compared to the September quarter  During the quarter  we introduced a radiation tolerant Polarfire FPGA for space and other high reliability applications as well as the early access program for the Polarfire system on chip FPGA  offering the world s first hardened real time Linux capable  risk five based microprocessor subsystem  Design wins for the Polarfire family continued to grow strongly  and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family  FPGA represented 6 9  for end market demand in the December quarter  Our licensing  memory and other product line  which we refer to as LMO  was sequentially down 0 7  as compared to the September quarter  During the quarter  we enable    we delivered a new family of electrically erasable RAM products  providing cost effective alternatives to nonvolatile RAM solutions and a number of memory densities  LMO represented 11 3  of our end market demand in the December quarter  An update regarding coronavirus and what we re seeing  First  all our employees are safe  and that remains our highest priority  We implemented travel bans in and out of China  Hong Kong and Taiwan two weeks ago  We also implemented self quarantine requirements for anyone who may have traveled to these countries  mandatory medical assessment and clearance for anyone who may have symptoms  a screening questionnaire for all external visitors to any Microchip facility and common sense preventive sanitizing steps on a continuous basis in all our facilities worldwide  As you well know  most provinces in China have extended the Chinese New Year holidays to February 9  Hubei province  where Wuhan is located  has extended the holidays to February 13  Our manufacturing footprint in China is small  and we expect little impact to our operations from this extension  Also at this time  we do not anticipate any significant supply chain issues for materials sourced from China  Some of our customers could be affected by the extended Chinese New Year holidays  It is too early to determine what impact there may be as most are not yet back from the extended holidays  Because Chinese New Year this year was early in the quarter  there is more time for our customers to catch up lost production within the quarter  We also believe there is slack in manufacturing capacity  which can be of help while recovering lost production  These outbreaks are unpredictable  and there may yet be other twists and turns to come in the days ahead  We continue to process the news daily as well as monitor information from the center for disease control and the World Health Organization  We will adapt our response as needed and focus on the things that we can control  Finally  over the last few months  we started to share six megatrends that we believe provide significant growth opportunities for Microchip over the next five to 10 years  and I d like to summarize them  First  the 5G infrastructure rollout  which is just getting started and has a decade ahead of it  Each prior generation of wireless infrastructure deployment  2G  3G and 4G  lasted for about 10 years  The Internet of Things comprised of smart  connected and secured end nodes is picking up steam  especially for industrial IOT  when there are compelling business models for customers to make money  save money and mitigate risk  Third  for data centers  The data center demand  the store and process data is exploding as data is created at a hyper exponential rate  To put this in perspective  estimates are that 90  of the world s data was created in just the last two years  and that trend continues unabated  Fourth  electric and hybrid vehicles are writing a wave of consumer and regulatory forces  which are driving substantial investment in technology and capacity  Fifth is the Advanced Driver Assist  which is already a growth application and its proliferation to more car models and its natural progression to increasing levels of autonomous driving  Sixth is finally the artificial intelligence and machine learning  which we see as another explosive growth area  not only in the cloud  but even more so at the edge  These megatrends cut across the diverse end markets we serve and guide our product development priorities  We believe these megatrends  in conjunction with our total system solutions go to market approach  will provide key opportunities for organic growth in the coming years  With that  let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward  Steve Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Ganesh  and good afternoon  everyone  Today  I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2020  I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020  Our December quarter was an interesting one in which we revised the midpoint of our guidance upwards twice  Once on December 3  2019  prior to the Credit Suisse conference and second on January 6  2020  prior to JPMorgan conference  Our final December quarter GAAP net sales were on the high end of our latest guidance and came in at  1 287 billion  down 3 76  sequentially  Our end market demand based on sell through was  36 million higher than GAAP sales  which we believe shows that the channel was continuing to manage their working capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty  December was the seventh consecutive quarter where our sell through revenue was higher than our sell in revenue  Our consolidated non GAAP gross margin of 61 5  was just above the high end of our guidance  Our consolidated non GAAP operating margin of 35 1  was also just above the high end of our guidance  Our consolidated non GAAP earnings per share was  1 32  which was also above the high end of our revised guidance  So overall  December quarter turned out to be a lot better than originally guided  On non GAAP basis  this was also our 117th consecutive profitable quarter  In the December quarter  we paid down  257 million of our debt  Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about  2 billion  The pace of debt payments has been strong despite the weakened uncertain business conditions  underlining the strong cash generation characteristics of our business as well as our active efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies  Now before I provide you guidance for the March quarter  let me comment on some of the inflection points that we saw during the December quarter  Our December quarter bookings were up double digit percentage over the September quarter bookings that resulted in our starting backlog for March quarter to be up double digit percentage over the starting backlog for the December quarter  Our starting backlog was up in each of the geographies of North America  Europe and Asia  From an end market perspective  we saw strength in data centers and start of a recovery in industrial and automotive  Continuing on the inflection points  the book to bill ratio for December quarter was well above one after multiple quarters of book to bill being below one  Our distributor inventory at the end of September was already at a low level and lowest in 15 years  except one quarter in fiscal year  13  In December quarter  the distribution inventory went even lower  During December quarter  we saw increased level of customer requested pull ins  many of its required factory expedite  Seeing these multiple signs of inflection point  we call the December quarter to be a bottom for Microchip for this cycle  barring any negative developments on the U S  China trade front or the impact of coronavirus  Now I turn to guidance for March quarter  The backlog from March quarter that started out quite strong continue to fill in during the month of January  Taking all these factors into consideration and after rolling up revenue expectations from sales regions as well as business units  we expect GAAP net sales  based on sell in revenue recognition for our products  to be up between 2  to 9  sequentially in the March 2020 quarter  The midpoint of our guidance for the March 2020 quarter reflects what we believe our business can deliver  assuming no extraordinary events  However  the wider than normal guidance range is to help account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving coronavirus situation  We are still in the early days of how this situation is playing out  We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play out for the coronavirus situation  and what the consequent business impact may be  But we believe that our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios  Regarding capex  we expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with a capex of between  76 million and  81 million  a significant reduction from fiscal year  19 capex of  229 million  This is consistent with what we have said before that our capex is divided between growth capital  maintenance capital and new products and technology capital in a fiscal year  like 2020  in which our net sales declined  the growth capital  which is the largest portion of the capex  declines to virtually nothing  And therefore  the total capex declined significantly  For December quarter  it should be for March quarter  For March quarter  we expect our non GAAP gross margin to be between 61 5  and 61 9  of sales  We expect non GAAP operating expenses to be between 25  and 26 2  of sales  We expect non GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35 3  and 36 9  of sales  and we expect our non GAAP earnings per share to be between  1 35 per share to  1 51 per share  Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions  including amortization of intangibles  restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions  Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its reserves on a non GAAP basis  except for net sales  which will be on a GAAP basis  We believe that non GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters  and we request that the analysts continue to report their non GAAP estimates to first call  With this  operator  will you please poll for questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thank you  Steve  just a question on the expedite activity  Can you just maybe put that into context with currently kind of where your lead times are and things you re looking to do to maybe kind of address that as business improves Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So during this down cycle  we built a substantial amount of inventory that is held in the die bank  So when an order comes in  it s really taking the die from the die bank and processing it through  which can be anywhere to as low as three weeks to as much as six  seven weeks  depending on where it has to go inside or outside or what difficult package or assembly test it might be  What we are finding is that customers stationed a fair amount of backlog just outside the quarter  And then when they need the product  they expedite into the quarter  This way  they kind of have both choices  They could not take it in the quarter and leave it out or push it out further  Or if they need it  ask us to pull it in  We ve been seeing this strange phenomenon now  not only this quarter  we ve been seeing it for some time  but it really became even more accentuated  So there s a fair amount of backlog sitting outside the quarter in April  and customers are expediting it into the quarter  Does that answer your question Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Yes  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Thank you for taking my question  Steve  I m curious  what are you expecting your distributors to do in the March quarter  I think you re giving a net sales outlook  So any color on sell in and sell out trends would be helpful  And in general  what are they saying to you  Why are they taking down Microchip inventory to such low levels because it s such an outlier  and we don t hear of any of your other peers  their inventory is being taken down to similarly low levels Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  I don t really know if as we speak  distributors are taking down inventory further  but they have in the last seven quarters or so through December  We don t really have a guidance for the March quarter on sell through  We can t really provide both ends of the guidance  It s just too much work  So we re providing the sell in guidance that we have given you  And in the December quarter  when we provided the guidance  we expected that distributors will reverse the trend and will start to build some inventory toward normalization  It did not happen in December  We re expecting it would happen again in March  but there s no guarantee  Distributors will do what they will do  I think part of the reason is  for 30 years  a culture at Microchip  in our business unit  sales organization up and down to the change with the distribution  Our conversations with the distributors are winning designs  creating a large funnel and pulling those designs to production and creating sales well  That s how we pay our salespeople  that s how we pay our business units  that s how all the bonuses are structured  And we don t really have a whole lot of conversations regarding what we give into the distribution  That has always been less important to us because we manage our business based on sell through  So distributors take the inventory what they want to run their business and based on getting returns for their business  In contrast  I think we see many of our peers and competitors are more focused on sell in revenue recognition  where they may make deals to put more product into distribution and arresting the fall of the inventory that way Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer I would add one more thing  We ve always had low lead times on our products  And I think that gives distributors an opportunity to run the inventory to whatever the lowest level they think they can get away with  while continuing to focus on sell through  So short lead times give them the opportunity to carry less inventory as well Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I would also add that sometime we charge expedite charges for expediting the product  So sometime expedite charges require us to spend weekends  pay overtime or pay expedites for shipping  going through hand carry products and all sorts of charging can incur  And we often pass those to the customers  It doesn t move the needle in terms of revenue  But if somebody wants to expedite the parts  it s not always free Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst But you re not assuming any restocking benefit  any major restocking benefit in March Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We have no way to model it Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Gary Mobley    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Hey guys  Thanks for taking my question  I want to ask about your relative performance in the microcontroller segment  It looks like for the full calendar year 2019  you outperformed the microcontroller market in terms of sales growth  If you believe in the SIA sales metrics  But in the second half of the year  it looks like    in particular  in the fourth calendar quarter  it looks like you might have underperformed the market  To what should we attribute that to  This is just sort of a short term disruption or anything to look into their long term Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer I m not sure what data is that you are referring to  So we were sequentially down 1 1  on microcontrollers  September to December  If you look at the year over year numbers  on microcontrollers  we re down about 5   5 5   somewhere in that neighborhood  The story is not written  We don t see any annualized numbers that are out yet  maybe SIA has some early numbers  We ll get that by March  April  and we ll  at the next conference call  have the typical Gartner 2019 numbers  There s nothing in our business that has any indication that something was better in the first half and got worse in the second half Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think if you look at the third quarter results sequentially and compared it to a very large competitor  I think we substantially outgrew them  So   Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer Either on quarter or by year over year Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James Chris Caso    Raymond James    Analyst Yes  Thank you  Good evening  A question with regard to gross margins  and assuming we are    have started recovery  we d hope to see some gross margin improvement as a result  Perhaps you could answer it in terms of production utilization levels with some of the better order rates  has that caused you to change any production levels  And then from a cost standpoint  as we go forward  I think you still have some integration benefits still to come  Could you help to quantify those  and when they kick in and how it helps leverage  if indeed we re in a recovery Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer Sure  This is Eric  So in the December quarter  we incurred about a  16 million factory underutilization charge that was reflected in our cost of sales  That was up about  7 million quarter on quarter  We expect that charge to be lower in the March quarter  particularly in our back end assembly and test operation  we re running the factories higher  Steve talked about in an earlier response that our die bank is pretty healthy  But back end operations  we ve been training  finished goods and looking to run the factories harder this quarter  which should help on the gross margin and the guidance that we re giving  So that s a piece of it  We continue to run our factories as efficiently as we can  We re continuing to invest to bring some of the outsourced assembly and test in house at a moderate rate  and all those things are going to benefit gross margin long term and lead us to our long term guidance  which is to get to about 63  non GAAP gross margins as a long term model versus the 61 7  we re guiding to at the midpoint of guidance for the current quarter Chris Caso    Raymond James    Analyst All right  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey William Stein    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Similar topic  only not just gross on operating as well  Maybe  Eric  you can take a step back and frame up relative to where you are now  And contemplating your longer term goals  what s the path to getting there  Is it just a modest amount of revenue recovery is mix part of the equation  is there still restructuring for Microsemi  I know you re still bringing capacity in house  It seems to us that it seems fairly likely that you ll be able to exceed these long term targets  given the revenue level that you re achieving today relative to what the next peak could be  for example Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer OK  Thank you  So I think I ve kind of touched on gross margin so far  and we ve been told by others that they think that s a conservative forecast  but we re not going to update that model until we get to the target  And on opex  we re guiding the current quarter to be between 25  and 26 2  of sales  and our long term model is 22 5   I would say we have been pretty conservative in how we ve been managing the business during this current cycle  And with that  we need to make sure that we re making the appropriate investment  whether it s in R D  support functions  technical sales  outreach to the customers to make sure we drive the long term health of the business and some of our variable compensation programs too will kick back in as revenue grows  So we have confidence in the long term model  which is just above 40  operating margins  and we ve got ways to go when we re guiding the current quarter at the midpoint of guidance to about 36 1   So I d say be patient  we do need revenue growth to get there  But I think we re well positioned with the investments that we ve made to drive to higher levels than what we re seeing today Operator Operator instructions  Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Financial Group Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Financial Group    Analyst Hi  Thanks very much Steve  I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the source of strength in bookings  whether end markets or geos  I believe last earnings call  you had indicated that China was stronger in terms of geos  So any updates on that front would be helpful  Thank you Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So I think from an end market perspective  we said that data center has been strong all along  and we are seeing a start of a recovery in the industrial market and the automotive market  The communication market remains weak  and the appliance market remains weak  And aerospace and defense is going to always lumpy and it s hard to call  From a geographical perspective  yes  we saw strength in the China market last quarter  but you would see the weakness in China market this quarter driven by the Lunar New Year  And nobody knows what is going to happen with the coronavirus  So this quarter  you would see stronger U S  and Europe and weaker China Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Financial Group    Analyst Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham   Company Raji Gill    Needham and Company    Analyst Yes  Thank you  If we think about the seasonality in the business now that we have some time  How do we think about it coming out of the bottom of the cycle and kind of perhaps entering into mid cycle recovery  excluding the impact of the coronavirus  I m just trying to get a sense of the seasonality  acquisitions post the bottom of the cycle Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think Raji  seasonality is still hard to measure where all of the acquisitions that we have completed  The events that have happened in the last couple of years  the    all the trade tension situation  general economic conditions  now the coronavirus  Prior to that  we had a significant inventory correction event on  especially the Microsemi inventory  We really haven t finished enough quarters in a healthy business environment to peg a seasonality  So  I would think it still remains difficult Raji Gill    Needham and Company    Analyst Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from Craig Ellis with B  Riley FBR Craig Ellis    B  Riley FBR    Analyst Yes  Thanks for taking the question  Congratulations on the good execution  I wanted to go back to some of the comments around the performance on debt reduction  which  over the last six quarters at almost  2 billion  is very strong  The question is  perhaps  both to you  Eric  and you  Steve  As you look ahead and given the trajectory you re on  it seems like you could be at a three times net debt to EBITDA level and as soon as four quarters or so  So how do you think about deploying the cash to create value for shareholders when you get to that level  would a vast majority of available cash will go to debt pay down  Or would you start looking at other things  and what would the priorities be at that point  Thank you Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let me take that  and Eric can add to it  First of all  I don t think I have looked at a model  which will take the leverage down to three times in four quarters  That seems awfully aggressive  Although I don t know what assumption you are making in the revenue growth of the recovery  it will largely depend on that  But basically  yes  we need to bring the debt leverage below three handle  kind of have it somewhere in the high twos  Once we get there  then we ll still be generating somewhere of the order of well over  1 billion of free cash per quarter  and we need to figure out what we do  I mean we haven t been in that situation in quite a long time  You have obvious choices  You could pay down more debt and bring leverage down further  But more preferably  you could increase the dividend  You can start a buyback program  And that all  assuming that there is not a further M A possibility  We have said before that we think by the time we come up for air  majority of the company is the smaller companies that we would like to buy  probably would have been bought  And there isn t as much more opportunity there  but there could be one more possibly  But secondly  we think that the remaining assets are very expensive  There is a large amount of M A bid on them already because every small companies really on sale  And we don t really pay that kind of multiple that we have seen paid in the recent deals  Cyprus as well as some of the deals  Those multiples were way  way too high for our tests  So if we cannot find a reasonable other acquisition  then our focus will switch to other uses of cash  including higher dividend  more stock buyback and possibly some more debt pay down Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer I think what I am going to add to that is just kind of a short term view here is because I know we will get this question a lot is what do we expect for that pay down in the current quarter  the March quarter  And really  we expect that to be somewhere between  225 million and  250 million  Last quarter  it was  257 million  But our starting accounts receivable balance is lower just because revenue was down last quarter  So really to get some tailwinds behind us  From a revenue perspective  as the top line grows  I think EBITDA will start growing nicely  And that is going to help with the leverage metrics coming down  but it kind of depends on what the environment is going to be over the course of the next year if we were able to get to that three times number that you mentioned  I think we need some pretty good revenue growth Craig Ellis    B  Riley FBR    Analyst Thanks guys Operator Operator Instructions  And our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi Chris Danely    Citi    Analyst Thanks  Steve  you mentioned that some customers were expediting orders out of the June quarter into this quarter  So do you think that the June quarter could be at risk of a little bit of a disappointment  like we re routing from the June quarter to pay the March quarter  And then further to that  you talked a little bit about lead times  Do you think that there is risk of extended lead times if this expediting continues Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The lead times are not at risk short term because we have a fair amount of die inventory  and there s a fair amount of capacity slack in the system since the revenues are down year over year  The backlog bottomed out some time ago  and the total extended backlog is really growing nicely  So when people are taking backlog from June quarter moving into March quarter  that s not putting June quarter at risk  There is a higher and higher backlog  The overall backlog is growing  Book to bill was strongly positive  So it put a very large amount of total backlog in the system Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer Chris  we had expedited in the December quarter  where people have placed backlog in the March quarter and pulled it in  You re seeing a stronger March quarter despite that  So as you go into an up an upward trend in the business  it is not unnatural  We ve seen it in other cycles where customers start to see their business recovering and wanting to have products sooner than they had originally planned for Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer Yes  And in addition to those orders that are being pulled in by customers requesting them into the current quarter  we re also receiving orders that are just within our normal published lead times  and that can create some expedite activity also Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer Often with short lead times Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  And Chris  this phenomenon is not a new one  We ve seen it before in prior cycles  and we ve been seeing it in this cycle  It s    I kind of call it  have your cake and eat it too  So customers will place an order  where they are still in the cancellation or push out window  And if they don t want it  if the business is not strong  they can push it out or leave it out  But if their business is stronger than they needed  then they ask us to expedite it  kind of have their cake and eat it too  It s not a new phenomenon  But we are seeing it quite accentuated right now  and that s why I called it out Chris Danely    Citi    Analyst OK  Thanks a lot guys OperatorOur next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler Harsh Kumar    Piper Sandler    Analyst Yes  Hey Steve  I was curious with the sudden pickup in China  Are you aware of any areas of shortages  not just in your business  but in the industry overall Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I m not seeing any shortages  I mean  China right now is shutdown  So you really wouldn t get any data  and they were shut down for the Chinese New Year  They re just about coming back  but most provinces have extended until February 9  But prior to going for the Chinese New Year  no  we were not experiencing any shortages Harsh Kumar    Piper Sandler    Analyst Thanks guys OperatorOur next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Thanks for the question  Eric  perhaps asked another way  If you could talk about Atmel and Microsemi  bringing them in house  Remind us kind of where we are front end and back end  And then also the gross margin benefits that you would get there  Also  how you re able to do this in such a small capex envelope as well  Thanks Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer OK  So there s a couple of pieces to that  So we did tighten our investment criteria in terms of making those capital investments over the course of the last year when business was difficult  And so we shorten the window  the payback window from a cash flow perspective from two years down to a year  And we really haven t changed that at this point in time  So that s one of the reasons it s been lower  And this is a very detailed work  So it s package by package  part by part  And none of these investments are needle movers  But in aggregate  they do help gross margins slowly over time  So I think that s responsive to your question  unless these guys have anything else they d like to add Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think there s then the percentage we haven t said and outside for fab  assembly and tests Christopher Rolland    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Yes  So fab is 39  internal  assembly is 45  and test is 54  Harsh Kumar    Piper Sandler    Analyst That s useful Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer And we would expect those assembly and test percentages to increase over time as we gradually make these investments OperatorOur next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    Analyst Good afternoon guys  Thanks for taking my question  Congrats on the strong start to 2020  I know lead times are still pretty short  But given the strong bookings trends coming off of the depressed September quarter  strong bookings thus far here in the March quarter and maybe some backlog build for June  existing out the potential issues for coronavirus  But do you think you re setting up given the backlog that you re seeing  at least for a seasonal June quarter  which is typically one of your seasonally strongest quarters Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We are not giving guidance or commenting on the June quarter  especially in the light of significant uncertainty because of the coronavirus  Remove those uncertainties and let s say there s no impact and business comes back and the virus is contained rapidly and all that  then your assessment for the June quarter would be correct Eric Bjornholt    Chief Financial Officer Yes  And I think I would just add that we are very well positioned from a capacity perspective to be able to respond quickly to upside if that develops Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    Analyst Got it  And then  I guess  on that note  back in early January when you did your update  it didn t sound like you were going to be increasing front end utilizations near term just because you guys have pretty substantial die bank  But let s say  as the much quarter progresses and the backlog is indicating the potential for normal seasonal growth for June and September  I assume the team would start to ramp capacity utilization  say  in the back half of this quarter  Is that kind of the right way to think about the potential timing of utilizations going up Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So this is Steve  Let me take that  I think let s start from the back end first then we ll come to the front end  The back end utilization is going up as we speak  And as we ramp  it will continue to go up because we depleted the finished goods  And when the orders are strong  we ve got to take the die bank and finish them  So that will continue to have a positive effect on gross margin  pretty much starting now  When you look at the front end  the front end still has a fair amount of die bank  but there also you got to separate it on the production we do inside versus the production we buy from outside  The inventory and the products we buy from outside was depleted to a lower level  And there  we are increasing the buy as we speak  But there s not a utilization impact of that because that was being done outside  What we were doing inside  that s where we have the substantial die bank  And I think it will at least take it a few more quarters before we have to start increasing the production in our fabs Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    Analyst Got it  OK  But then the lower end  the underutilization charges here in the March quarter is simply because you are filling out your packaging and test assembly utilizations are going up  right  Is that the primary driver for the lower underutilization charges Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  There s always lots of moving parts  mix and all that  But yes  there is a new phenomenon where even in the December quarter  we were depleting finished goods  We were a quarter back end utilization was lower than the September quarter  And the March quarter will be up significantly from the December quarter  I wanted to add one more comment on the question you asked regarding the June quarter seasonality  how it would be  And the comment was made that June quarter will at least be seasonal  I would say  I hope that one of these quarters  current quarter as well as June quarter and September quarter are well above seasonal because the inventories are so low  And if I take any Qs from any prior recoveries  whether it was from SaaS or the recovery from 2009 cycle or any other cycle recovery  usually  you got two or three quarters of well above seasonal recovery that takes the business back to the old heights and then goes from there  So I d like to think that any kind of forecast here becomes very conservative Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    Analyst Yes  I thought that s a fair point  Steve Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho Securities    Analyst I was wondering  as you look at your business  I was wondering if you can give us some color by markets  in markets  automotive  industrial  how do you see that playing out to the rest of the year Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer Thanks  So as Steve mentioned  we re starting to see automotive and industrial picking up from the bottom that they were at  They had pretty bad years in 2019  And our expectation is that barring any outside events as we go through 2020  both those end markets should see continued improvement Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho Securities    Analyst Got it  And on the industrial and other end markets  do you see a similar trend into the back half  Or do you see a stronger first half year or   Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer So my comment was for both automotive and industrial  We ve talked about data center  It was strong  It remains strong  We don t see anything that suggests it s different  There may be some communication market changes that are driven by what happens with coronavirus  We don t know  But there is a large 5G investment cycle that is starting  And then as far as defense and aerospace tends to be pretty steady and how it goes  It remained steady with where it s at  And then the consumer cycle  we have yet to see if we ll see some benefits  It needs further trade resolution for it to see any significant benefits  but nothing new to report on that  on the consumer end of the market Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho Securities    Analyst Right  Great  Thanks OperatorOur last question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse Group John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst Yes  Thanks for letting me get in  I ve been jumping around calls  so I apologize if this is a repeat  But Steve  if you kind of look at the operating model for the business  Historically  you guys have always made good progress and then kind of taking a step back as you ve made acquisitions to then kind of move forward again  I m just kind of curious  if we go to an extended period where you re not sort of in the acquisition game  How should we be thinking about operating margin targets and incremental gross and op margins for the business over time Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So John  no  you are very correct that we make substantial progress in gross and operating margin after an acquisition  And then when we do another acquisition  most times  we re not buying businesses that are over 60  gross margin and 40  operating margins  So our overall company margin  gross and operating  drop  And then we work back up few steps only to take a fall again when we buy the next acquisition  Now if you make the assumption that for an extended period of time  we were to not do another acquisition  then first thing that would happen is that we will reach our operating model  So our operating model to remind everyone is 63  gross margin and 22 5  operating expenses  leading to a 40 5  operating profit  So two ends of it  First  the gross margin  We re guiding 61 7  gross margin this quarter  So it s 130 basis points away  If you just take the underutilization charge of  16 million  that pretty much gets you there  almost  The second issue is the operating expense  So operating expense  basically  we re guiding 25  to 26 2   And there is a huge leverage there with the revenue increase  The current revenue I think  were a couple of hundred million dollars behind that past record  very round number  So once you gain that  you have a significant leverage with the operating expense comes down  Some leverage still remains in integration of Microsemi  with all these go lives and all that  that are happening  which will take another nine months  But once we get all that done  then you have achieved gross margin as well as the operating expense and you have reached the model  Now if your question is  where does the model go  Do we continue to go higher in gross margin and continue to grow higher in operating margin  For that  get in line  and we ll talk about it when we get there John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst That s helpful  And then just secondly  on Microsemi  With an acquisition  you kind of made as the industry was going into a correction  and you re talking a little bit about kind of the expense leverage there  I m just kind of curious from a revenue leverage  I mean  one of the things you guys have always done well as you bought these assets is going and kind of apply a better pricing discipline to the business  Is there still more to go with the Microsemi acquisition  Or has that mostly played out Ganesh Moorthy    President and Chief Operating Officer First of all  I don t think we had the same pricing discipline issues in Microsemi as we did at Atmel  Microsemi  just to remind you  was gross margins that were right around 60  when we did the acquisition  The product lines at Microsemi are extremely sticky products  and many of them have very long life cycles  And to that extent  those margins will stay high  The product line revenues will stay high  Now in the time we have owned Microsemi started to work on  so how are we going to take advantage of Microsemi s position in the end markets they were strong in  data center communications and aerospace and defense  to be able to sell a more complete portfolio  And that work is well under way and reverse how can we take Microsemi products into the end market that Microchip was strong in prior to the acquisition  automotive  industrial and home appliances  And that work is going in  Now we have a six   seven quarter window  where the environment has been weak  And as we emerge from a weak environment and we go into a more normal environment  all the hard work that has been done will begin to play itself out  And so I think there are revenue synergies yet to come  But in part  it s work to be done  and a lot of that is under way and has been for some time  But a lot of it has to come as the environment strengthens Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And John  I think if you study some of the past cycles  I know you and other analysts are very good studying the past cycles  What really happens is nobody believes the depth of the downturn  And the estimates always stay high and they get cut multiple times  In this cycle  the estimates fully have been cut four times not only for Microchip  but for the industry and various other players  could be more than four times  And then when the reverse happens  the estimates always go higher  We can raise  we can raise  we can raise for many quarters  I have seen this in prior cycles because nobody has the confidence to get the revenue or guide the revenue to be higher than seasonal  and it continues for many quarters in the other direction  That s what I m hoping for  but not guiding to OperatorAnd at this time  there are no further questions in the queue  So I would like to turn the call back over to Mr  Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks Steve Sanghi    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  we want to thank everyone for attending this call  and we re going to about three different conferences  I think  this quarter  So we ll see some of you at those conferences  Thank you Operator Operator signoff  Duration  58

Texas Instruments  which has the largest number of customers and the broadest product range in the chip industry  warned that demand is slowing across many of its markets  That was bad news for investors who had already seen anxieties about a sales slowdown erase about 10 percent from the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in October  The index fell another 2 3 percent at 9 52 a m  in New York and is now on track for its biggest monthly decline since November 2008 
 We re heading into a softer market   Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said on the Texas Instruments earnings call  The company plans to respond by being disciplined in its operating plans and reduce wafer production to avoid oversupply 
Deteriorating bookings and an upturn in cancellations could pose a threat to semiconductor peers  as well  Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note  Rolland  who carries a positive rating on Texas Instruments  cites Maxim Integrated Products Inc  NASDAQ MXIM   ON Semiconductor Corp   NXP Semiconductors  Cypress Semiconductor  Knowles and Microchip Technology  NASDAQ MCHP  Inc  among the chipmakers that  may fare worse  
Texas Instrument s  guidance bodes poorly for the group  particularly as their low lead times and consignment programs were supposed to make them more cycle resistant than most   Rolland writes   We worry for the lesser operators  
Texas Instruments fell as much as 7 percent Wednesday to its lowest intraday price in a year  MKS Instruments  which supplies gear used in semiconductor production  looked to add to the bad news with a fourth quarter revenue forecast that missed the lowest analyst estimate  Shares of MKS tumbled as much as 7 5 percent before turning higher

144464,365979,MCHP,U S  stocks mark new intraday highs amid bullish and bearish factors,news,"Investing com   Wall Street bounced back from the prior day s slight losses on Tuesday with the S P and Nasdaq both hitting new intraday highs in morning trade as investors weighed bullish and bearish factors 
At 15 35GMT or 11 35AM ET  the Dow Jones gained 47 points  or 0 26   while the S P 500 advanced 5 points  or 0 24   and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 21 points  or 0 41  
As part of the bullish side of the argument  market participants were taking note of a growing earnings momentum as the second quarter earnings season winds down this week 
The slew of earnings out priced into stocks on Tuesday was largely positive 
Among big movers  Endo International PLC  NASDAQ ENDP  helped lead the S P 500 higher with gains of close to 28  after both the top and bottom line beat estimates 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  jumped more than 15  despite worse than expected earnings as the Canadian drugmaker backed its full year guidance 
 Red Robin Gourmet  Burgers Inc  NASDAQ RRGB  soared more than 10  after presenting second quarter earnings and forecasting full year revenue to rise 5  
Microchip Technology Incorporated  NASDAQ MCHP  jumped 8  on Tuesday after its fiscal first quarter revenue beat consensus 
On the downside   Wayfair Inc   NYSE W  and  LendingClub Corp   NYSE LC  tumbled 17  and 4  after reporting wider than expected losses 
In that context  all eyes would be on Walt Disney s numbers after the close 
Also adding to bullish sentiment in global stocks were central bank policies 
To the contrary of the easing from monetary authorities in the U K   euro zone  Japan or China  market participants were continuing to weigh the possibility that the Federal Reserve  Fed  could return to the path of policy normalization 
However  Fed funds futures gave just a 50 3  chance for an increase at the end of the year on Tuesday 
From the bearish perspective  and not unlike comments from some Fed officials themselves  investors were concerned over the prospects for the global economy plagued with subdued growth and the possible impact on U S  corporate earnings 
Among other bearish factors  volatility continued to move lower with the VIX down another 3  on Tuesday  trading near lows not seen since mid 2014 
Regardless  investor sentiment continued to be optimistic with both the S P and Nasdaq trading at new all time intraday highs  though oil was having a rough time following up on Monday s 3  rise 
Hopes for some kind of production freeze agreement among OPEC members in informal discussions to take place at the end of September were weighed against continued concern over the global supply gut as investors looked forward to fresh weekly information on U S  stockpiles of crude and refined products 
The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day  while Wednesday s government report could show crude stockpiles fell by 1 0 million barrels in the week ended August 5 
U S  crude futures gained 0 23  to  43 12 by 15 36GMT  or 11 36AM ET  while Brent oil slipped 0 09  to  45 35 
On Tuesday s economic front  second quarter nonfarm productivity unexpectedly fell for a third consecutive quarter  the longest stretch since 1979  causing concern over corporate profits 
Unit labor costs for the April to June period increased at a brisker pace than expected 
The  dilemma  is that a faster pace of labor compensation than productivity implies that prices would either need to be passed on or could squeeze firm s profit 
June wholesale inventories  meanwhile  increased at a faster than expected 0 3  pace  suggesting that second quarter gross domestic product could be upwardly revised

144487,366002,MCHP,Chipmaker CSR rejects Microchip approach  shares soar,news,"By Paul Sandle LONDON  Reuters    Britain s CSR  L CSR  has rebuffed an approach from Microchip Technology  O MCHP   saying that the undisclosed price proposed by Microchip was not enough if its U S  rival wants to bolster its role in the  Internet of Things  with the chipmaker s radio technology 
 The price proposed by Microchip has been rejected and the board is considering its options for the company   CSR said in a short statement on Thursday 
Shares of CSR  which had fallen 9 percent in the year to date  closed up 36 percent to 780 pence  valuing the company at 1 3 billion pounds   2 2 billion  
CSR  short for Cambridge Silicon Radio  specializes in connectivity  Its chips are used in products such as speaker docks and Apple owned Beats headphones 
It recently developed smarter Bluetooth technology that connects multiple devices in the home  enabling people to control lighting and heating using a smartphone  an example of the  Internet of Things  
CSR s role in the developing sector makes it an attractive target for larger chipmakers that are seeing fewer opportunities for growth in smartphones 
Microchip  which makes memory and analog chips  confirmed in a statement late Thursday that it has held talks with CSR 
 The discussions between the parties are at a very preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made   Microchip said 
Analysts said that a purchase of CSR could cost Microchip nearly 10 times the  328 5 million that it agreed to pay to buy Taiwanese wireless product maker ISSC Technologies Corp in May 
Alex Jarvis at Peel Hunt  the top rated analyst covering the stock  said CSR was one of her key picks as a takeover target 
 Firstly  it s about large vendors finding profit centers outside handsets  and secondly it s about part of the convergence towards Internet of Things  focusing on big areas like home entertainment and automation  and that trend happening in automotive as well   she said 
CSR s chief executive  Joep van Beurden  has been shifting the company s focus to more profitable areas such as music  audio and automotive  with less reliance on products like digital cameras 
He sold CSR s mobile phone technology business  where it was losing ground to rivals like Qualcomm  O QCOM   to Samsung Electronics Co  KS 005930  two years ago for  310 million 
Jarvis said the turnaround has put CSR in a relatively strong position  and its favorable UK tax rate also made it an attractive target for U S  companies 
CSR issued the statement after the Financial Times  in a report on its website  said the company was talking to a potential suitor about a deal that could value it at about  3 billion 
Jarvis said a price of around 11 pounds a share  valuing the company at about  3 billion  would be  not out of kilter  
Under British takeover rules  Microchip has until Sept  25 to either announce a firm offer for CSR or walk away 
Microchip s shares closed up 0 8 percent at  48 02 on the Nasdaq

144537,366052,MCHP,Microchip Technology  MCHP  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Microchip Technology  MCHP  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 32 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 26 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 66 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 76   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 43  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Microchip Tech  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry  posted revenues of  1 29 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 06   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 42 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Microchip Tech shares have lost about 6 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Microchip Tech 
While Microchip Tech has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

144580,366095,MCHP,Top Momentum Anomaly Stocks To Buy On Phase One Trade Deal,opinion,The U S  market rally kicked into higher gear on Thursday as investors shifted focus to corporate earnings after an initial trade deal with China  The Dow added 267 44 points to hit 29 297 64  a day after closing above 29 000 for the first time  The S P climbed 27 52 points to 3 316 81 and the technology heavy Nasdaq jumped 98 43 points to 9 357 13 On Wednesday  the formal signing of a phase one deal between the world s two biggest economies put the so called trade war on hold as far as many investors are concerned  President Trump called the agreement  a momentous step toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade  and one that  rights the wrong of the past  China s chief trade negotiator  vice premier Liu He said that the deal was  conducive to world peace and prosperity   Per the agreement  China will increase its purchases of U S  agricultural  manufacturing and energy products  along with services  by more than  200 billion over the next two years It further comprises commitments by China to enforce intellectual property theft laws and a  bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution arrangement  that will encourage the United States and China to work jointly to resolve allegations of patent and copyright infringement  Not to forget  the deal is a phased achievement and does not mean that the trade dispute is settled once and for all Analysts expect company earnings to continue impressing on the back of robust business investment and emerging market economies  However  concerns about the impact of higher corporate taxes on profits could rise in the run up to the U S  presidential election  This apart  rising wages are likely to reduce profit margins over the next several years With these in mind  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can cause more damage to a portfolio s return than a downturn  When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is likely to continue in that direction  There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in prices On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes  So  basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time  which exists before the mean reversion occurs i e  before prices become rational again Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors

144583,366098,MCHP,Microchip Technology  MCHP  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"The market expects Microchip Technology  MCHP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 27 billion  down 10  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 47  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Microchip Tech 
For Microchip Tech  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Microchip Tech will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Microchip Tech would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 43  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

144602,366117,MCHP,Here s Why Microchip Technology  MCHP  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Microchip Technology  MCHP   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Microchip Technology currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if MCHP is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this chipmaker holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For MCHP  shares are up 5 31  over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry is up 0 74  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 7  compares favorably with the industry s 5 44  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Microchip Technology have increased 13 73  over the past quarter  and have gained 49 8  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 11 27  and 28 99   respectively 
Investors should also take note of MCHP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  MCHP is averaging 2 486 899 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with MCHP 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost MCHP s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 36 to  5 47 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that MCHP is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Microchip Technology on your short list ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-microchip-technology-mchp-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200498718,200498718

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Microchip Tech 
For Microchip Tech  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microchip Tech will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Microchip Tech would post earnings of  1 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 41  delivering a surprise of  2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Microchip Tech 
For Microchip Tech  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Microchip Tech will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Microchip Tech would post earnings of  1 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 81  delivering a surprise of  4 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Microchip Tech doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/microchip-technology-mchp-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200380597,200380597

144673,366188,MCHP,Is Microchip Technology  MCHP  A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Microchip Technology Incorporated   NASDAQ MCHP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Microchip Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 16 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Microchip Technology s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Microchip Technology has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Microchip Technology stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Microchip Technology has a P S ratio of about 3 7  While this is a bit higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 0 right now  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MCHP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Microchip Technology currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Microchip Technology a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Microchip Technology is 0 8  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 0  which is better than the industry average of 9 9  Clearly  MCHP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Microchip Technology might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives MCHP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current fiscal quarter as well as the fiscal full year has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMicrochip Technology is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 28   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Medical Stocks to Buy NowThe greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization

investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that rake in higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to

added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued

144746,366261,MCHP,5 Solid Dividend Growth Stocks Below  100,opinion,"Dividend growth stocks lead to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past year Top Zacks Rank

144796,366311,MCHP,3 Stocks With Impressive Growth Rates ,opinion,"As today s market rally shows  stocks still want to move higher  If it weren t for North Korea and domestic politics  then no one would even be worried about the  fear gauge   Instead  we d be talking about the fantastic earnings season we just had  or the improving jobs picture  or the Fed taking its sweet time in raising rates  If you can keep your head while all your fellow investors are losing theirs  then there is still plenty of money to be made 
Therefore  the  screen is as lucrative as ever  This is a tool that looks for Zacks Rank  1s  Strong Buys  that have a Zacks Style Score of  A  for Growth and projected EPS growth of 20  or more  If the market is going to keep chopping around as it moves higher  then these stocks could make sure you re always prepared for the dips and rallies 
Today s article has three stocks from this screen that were beating the market when stocks were soaring  and should continue to do so regardless of which way the tides take us next 
Ultra Clean Holdings   
It s always great when a stock beats the market  which is what this screen is all about   but it s even better when it eclipses its own highly ranked industry  The electronics   manufacturing machinery space is already outperforming the market with a gain of nearly 22  this year   and Ultra Clean Holdings  UCTT  has left its own industry in the dust  The company  which develops systems for the semiconductor equipment and flat panel industries  has soared approximately 140  this year 
Late last month  UCTT announced its fifth straight positive surprise  and 12th out of the last 13  with second quarter earnings of 62 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24   It now has a four quarter average beat of 27 7   Revenue skyrocketed by nearly 76  from last year to  228 3 million  the Zacks Consensus Estimate was only calling for  213 million 
Earnings estimates have taken off over the past month because UCTT offered a third quarter guidance that was well ahead of expectations  The company expects earnings per share between 62 cents and 68 cents for the quarter  while we were only expecting around 39 cents at the time  The revenue guidance of  235 million to  245 million was also well in front of Zacks expectations at  193 million 
Given such an overshoot in the guidance  it s no surprise that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter soared more than 68   The outlooks for this year and next year are also on the rise  At the moment  we expect UCTT to earn  2 22 per share this year  marking an advance of 29  in the past month as all four analysts raised their estimates  It s also up 6 2  in just the past week  As for next year  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 30 has gained 20 4  in 30 days and 3 1  in 7 days 
 Ultra Clean Holdings  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Microchip Technology   
Back on June 5  Microchip Technology  MCHP  offered an updated guidance for its fiscal first quarter which it completely trounced earlier this month with the official release  The company  a provider of microcontroller  mixed signal  analog and Flash IP solutions  has been reporting better than expected releases for two years now  and is outperforming its industry with a year to date improvement of practically 29  
MCHP was expecting non GAAP earnings per share between  1 22 and  1 26  but it ended up being  1 31  The result also bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 5  while soaring 56  from last year  Net sales jumped 15 2  from last year to  972 1 million  which again was ahead of the company s guidance at  943 3 million to  956 8 million  The company stated that this quarterly performance represents an acceleration of our organic growth with its Microchip 2 0 initiative 
The company expects fiscal second quarter earnings per share between  1 33 and  1 37  At the moment  the Zacks Consensus is right in the middle at  1 35  having advanced more than 7  in the past month  Net sales are forecasted to make it all the way  1 001 3 billion  which marks a 14 6  improvement on a year over year basis 
Earnings estimates have moved upward in the past 30 days with strong agreement among the analysts  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year  ending March 2018  is at  5 26 per share right now  or nearly 7  better than a month earlier  Seven of the 9 covering analysts contributed to this enhancement by raising their expectations  As for next year  ending March 2019   analysts see earnings per share of  5 67  marking an advance of 6 8  in 30 days  Again  agreement was strong as 6 of 8 covering analysts raised their estimates 
 Microchip Technology Incorporated  NASDAQ MCHP  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Arista Networks   
All you need is one look at the momentum displayed by Arista Networks  ANET  and you know that this company is at the cutting edge of something big  In this case  ANET is a leader in software driven cloud networking solutions for large datacenter and computer environments  It has been a public company for only about three years now  and it has never missed quarterly earnings expectations 
Earlier this month  it reported earnings of  1 34 per share for the second quarter  which was more than 41  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a four quarter average beat of 22 8   That makes 13 straight quarters of positive surprises  The result also beat last year by an impressive 81 1   Revenues soared by 50 8  to  405 2 million thanks to the expanding cloud networking market amid rising demand for scalable infrastructure 
Shares of ANET have soared nearly 78  so far in 2017  reaching into the  170 range  Looking toward the third quarter  the company expects revenue between  405 million and  420 million  But it s not just investors or management that are expecting big things moving forward  analysts have been raising earnings estimates sharply since its earnings report  For both 2017 and 2018  eleven of 12 covering analysts boosted their expectations 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has jumped 17  in the past 30 days to  4 66 per share  Then  analysts expect earnings to jump nearly 15  more to  5 35 per share next year  That consensus is up 14 3  in the past month 
 Arista Networks  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking Secret
Since 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars

144819,366334,MCHP,PetMed Express  Boston Beer  Marvell Technology  Microchip Technology And Cypress Semiconductor Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   July 07  2017   PetMed Express  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Boston Beer Company  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Marvell Technology  NASDAQ         Microchip Technology  NASDAQ        and Cypress Semiconductor  NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	With the NASDAQ Composite breaking down over the last several days it feels weird to name a NASDAQ stock as my Bull of the Day  However  while the tech heavy index has succumbed to selling pressure since early June  this stock has held its own  That sort of relative strength in the face of a depressed investment landscape is one of the many reasons this stock is at the top of my list 

PetMed Express  NASDAQ       operates as a pet pharmacy in the United States  The company markets prescription and non prescription pet medications  health products  and supplies for dogs and cats to retail customers  It provides non prescription medications and supplies  such as flea and tick control products  bone and joint care products  vitamins  treats  nutritional supplements  hygiene products  and supplies  and prescription medications  including heartworm preventatives  flea and tick preventatives  arthritis  thyroid  diabetes  pain medications  antibiotics  and other specialty medications  as well as generic substitutes 

	PetMed Express is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock in an industry that s currently ranked in the Top 16  of our Zacks Industry Rank  It also has a Growth Style Score of B  Part of the reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the recent earnings estimate revisions analysts have made over the last 30 days  The bullishness of these revisions can be seen in the change of our Zacks Consensus Estimates  Just 60 days go  analysts were expecting 33 cents EPS for the current quarter and  1 10 for the current year  This number has jumped to 40 cents for the current quarter and  1 25 for the year as a direct result of positive earnings estimate revisions 

  

	The beer business has seen its fair share of changes over the last few years  There have been two major themes across the business  consolidation and craft beer  An industry that used to be spread out across several rival brands has been shrunk to a handful of very large players  Even Miller and Budweiser are under the same roof 

	Then there s the upstart craft beer business  Smaller breweries started popping up all over the US creating a whole new menu of choices for consumers  Larger manufacturers had to adapt to new flavors or buy up the smaller craft brews to keep pace 

	Lagging behind these sweeping changes is today s Bear of the DayBoston Beer Company  NYSE         Don t get me wrong  I love a cold Sam Adams  but when you see the numbers on the stock you may not want to crack your investment account open 

	The Boston Beer Company  Inc  produces and sells alcohol beverages primarily in the United States  Its flagship beer is Samuel Adams Boston Lager  The company sells approximately 60 beers under the Samuel Adams and the Sam Adams brands  20 hard cider beverages under the Angry Orchard brand  13 flavored malt beverages under the Twisted Tea brand  and 4 hard seltzer beverages under the Truly Spiked   Sparkling brand name  as well as approximately 40 beers under A S Brewing trade name  It markets and sells its products to a network of approximately 350 wholesalers  who in turn sell to retailers  such as pubs  restaurants  grocery stores  convenience stores  package stores  stadiums  and other retail outlets in Canada  Europe  Israel  Australia  New Zealand  the Caribbean  the Pacific Rim  Mexico  and Central and South America 

	Rather than break down the technical chart like I typically do  the easiest way to tell the story of Boston Beer Company is to look at the Price and Consensus chart from Zacks  Here you can see the steady growth year over year that helped propel the stock to over  300 per share in early 2015  Then everything took a turn for the worse  Estimates started to come down  growth began to evaporate and the stock tumbled

3  Internet of Things  Stocks to Buy Now

	One of the strongest corners of the market this year has been the semiconductors industry  Throughout the chip making market  companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer  including an increased demand for small  high powered chips that enable  Internet of Things   IoT  devices 

	For those that don t know  the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices  Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices 

	For example  consumer level IoT products include things like Amazon s  AMZN  Echo  smart speaker   wearable motion and activity tracking products  and advanced in car technology  On the commercial side of the IoT market  industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency 

 Also Read     

	As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow  semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit  With that said  we ve found three already strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth 

1  Marvell Technology   NASDAQ      

	Marvell Technology is a leading designer  developer and supplier of mixed signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits  The company s  EZ Connect  platform is used by a variety of global customers in the home automation  wearables  automotive  and industrial industries  After Marvell surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25  in its most recent quarter  estimate revisions began pouring in for the company s current quarter and full year earnings  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marvell s full year earnings calls for EPS growth of more than 118   This has helped the stock gain a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  

2  Microchip Technology   NASDAQ      

	Microchp Technology is a manufacturer of microcontroller  memory  and analog chips  The company is a leader in several IoT related fields  including automotive and wireless connectivity  This is another Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  and our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 26  and revenue growth of 12  this fiscal year  Shares are up over 30  year to date  but this stock could break even higher given the right catalyst  and it might have just that  Indeed  last month  the company upped its sales and EPS guidance for 1Q18  sending shares higher 

3  Cypress Semiconductor   NASDAQ      

	Cypress Semiconductor is a leading provider of high performance digital and mixed signal integrated circuits  Just last year  the company shelled out  550 million to acquire Broadcom s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its  WICED  Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry  Cypress is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   which pairs very well with its  A  grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system 

Bottom Line

	The Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world  Home automation products are fun  In car technology is cool 

	And while these specific products are interesting  the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products  The Internet of Things needs semiconductors to function  and as the IoT grows  so too will semiconductor companies 

	The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify semiconductor companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things  but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics

Move the Driehaus Way  Buy These 5 Momentum Stocks

	Investors with higher risk tolerance generally strive to use strategies that help in scooping up awesome returns mainly from momentum stocks  Using the  buy high and sell higher  principle  Richard Driehaus formulated a strong momentum strategy  Driehaus s pioneering momentum investing earned him a place in the Barron s All Century Team 

	The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns 

A Detailed Look into the Driehaus Strategy

	Regarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy 

	It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 

	Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term 

Screening Parameters 

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

5 Top Ranked Stocks with Strong Sales Growth to Buy Now 

	Sales growth is a major financial indicator  which is often neglected while searching for a profitable investment strategy  In the current market scenario  marked by changing customer preferences and habits  evolving needs  demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment  maintaining stable sales growth is vital for any business 
	Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive revenues  Notably  revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business 
	It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit briefly  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
	So  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation  It remains a major stock selection criterion as management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings  Thus  the P S ratio is subject to lesser influence than the Price to Earnings ratio 
	Sales growth in isolation  however  does not assure success  A consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Selecting the Winning Stocks
	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry   This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening Marriott International  Inc   NASDAQ        based in Bethesda  MD  operates  franchises  and licenses hotels and timeshare properties  It has a long term expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 8 9   The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 Applied Materials  Inc   NASDAQ       provides manufacturing equipment  services  and software to the semiconductor  display  and related industries  This Santa Clara  CA based company currently has long term expected EPS growth rate of 16 6  and holds a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

Follow Driehaus   Pick These 5 Best Rated Momentum Stocks 

	Richard Driehaus  better known as the pioneer of momentum investing  developed a  buy high and sell higher  strategy  The best thing about Driehaus  strategy is that it has the potential to yield impressive returns  Notably  the success of the investing strategy earned Driehaus a place in Barron s All Century Team 

	The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with high risk appetite may think of using the Driehaus strategy to boost their portfolio returns 

A Brief Study of Driehaus  Strategy

	Regarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio based on Driehaus  philosophy 

	It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 

	Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term 

Screening Parameters

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

  Zacks Rank equal to  1

	 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    

	  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2 

	 Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  

	   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median 

	 Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  

	  Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5 

	 Positive EPS surprise indicates potential  

	   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks 

	 High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  

	  Momentum Score equal to or less than B

	 Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success  

	These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7 896 stocks to only 19 

	Here are five of the 19 stocks that passed the screen 

Pool Corporation   NASDAQ        distributes swimming pool supplies and related products in South America  North America  Australia and Europe  The company has a Momentum Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 19 9  

Walker   Dunlop  Inc    NYSE        is engaged in providing commercial real estate financial services in the U S  The company has a Momentum Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 29 8

5 Semiconductor Stocks That Warrant a Second Look

	Much has been said about semiconductor stocks lately  with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued  Neither position can be completely ruled out  But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential 

	And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank  which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group  sub industry  that it s in  In fact  Zacks studies have shown that the top 50  of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 

	So today  we are going to take a closer look at the    which is in the top 10  of Zacks ranked industries 

	The group has slightly outperformed the S P 500  having appreciated 5 5  compared to the 4 8  for the S P 500 

	Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high  up 31 4    Gross profit  up 26 3  in 2016  and net income before non recurring items  up 16 4   show similar trends  However  the industry is investing heavily in R D and SG A  up 65 0  in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years  and unlike in the past  it s tapping into the debt market to do it  interest expenses are up 134 5  in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years 

	A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter  Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014  Net income before non recurring items has risen since Mar 2016  As with the annual trend  the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend  using depreciation as a proxy   as well as rising interest rates 

	If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning  artificial intelligence  self driving cars  IoT  industrial and medical technology  drones  the list is almost never ending   it s clear that this is a growth segment  So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases  they may not be what value buyers are looking for

end of the company s expected range of  800 0  840 0 million  Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  819 0 million Revenues in the quarter were impacted by overall weakness in the computing and smartphone markets  partially offset by accelerating momentum in the automotive market Revenues by End MarketAutomotive accounted for 40  of total revenue  Segment revenues were up 9  on a sequential basis  driven by strong demand for automotive image sensors  Also  power regulation solutions for infotainment and body electronic module applications led to the strong revenue performance in the first quarter Industrial Military Aerospace Medical contributed 22  to total revenue  down 7  from the prior quarter  The company witnessed broad based weakness in the industrial market due to lower demand in the security segment Communications  both networking and wireless  accounted for 17  of revenues and declined 10  on a sequential basis  The decline was attributed to weakness in the premium segment of the smartphone market and seasonality Consumer brought in 11  of total revenue  down 11  sequentially  The decline was due to normal seasonality and steep inventory correction in the action and sports camera market Computing generated 11  of total revenue  down 10  from the last quarter due to weakness in overall markets like hard disk drives and power supplies MarginsPro forma gross margin was 33 7   up 50 basis points  bps  sequentially but down 78 bps year over year  The sequential increase was largely driven by higher utilization rates and an improved product mix

adjusted basis but included stock based compensation  Our calculation may differ from the company s presentation due to the inclusion exclusion of some items that were not considered by management On a GAAP basis  the company recorded net income of  36 0 million or 9 cents per share compared with  54 1 million or 13 cents per share in the previous quarter and  55 1 million or 13 cents per share in

Top 5 Stocks with Solid Earnings Acceleration

Earnings are perhaps the most significant metric for an organization  Substantial earnings growth indicates the affluence of a company  Earnings are essentially revenues that the company makes after subtracting cost of production over a given period of time  Upbeat earnings results generally lead to an increase in the share price 

But instead of looking only at the most recent quarter s earnings  one should also focus on earnings acceleration  And why is this so  It s because earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price 

Spotting Future Outperformers

Earnings acceleration is basically incrementally growing earnings per share  EPS  of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period  it can be called earnings acceleration 

Moreover  picking stocks on the basis of earnings growth will lead you to pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  However  earnings acceleration will help you to select stocks that have yet to see significant investor attention and the consequent solid price increase  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 

Increasing the percentage of earnings growth can often be the difference between good stocks and great stocks  It means that the company is basically sound and has been on the right track for a sustained period of time  On the other hand  sideways percentage of earnings growth can potentially signal a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times send prices down 

Hence  investment in stocks having solid earnings acceleration is a profitable strategy 

The Winning Strategy 

Let s look for stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 

EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1    The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  

EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2    The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  

EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3    The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  

In addition to this  we have added 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This screens out the low priced stocks 

Average 20 day volume greater than or equal to 50 000   High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity

145040,366555,MCHP,CDW Corp   CDW  Q1 Earnings  Stock To Disappoint Again ,opinion,"CDW Corporation   NASDAQ CDW   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 4  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 2 82   Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business  government  education and healthcare customers primarily in the U S  and Canada 
Growth in customer channels and consistent strategic achievements are positive couple of factors that should drive the company s performance  Additionally  CDW s robust product portfolio and product refreshes continue to drive growth 
The company s exposure in the high end corporate desktop and digital education implementation space also remains a positive  Moreover  its strong position at medium to large businesses  focus on small   medium businesses and customer additions to grow market share are encouraging 
However  the latest report on worldwide IT spending by Gartner raises concerns about CDW s near term performance  The research firm expects worldwide IT spending to increase just 0 6  year over year in 2016 to  3 54 trillion due to the stronger dollar 
Notably  2015 witnessed the largest U S  dollar drop in IT spending  since the research firm started tracking the expenses  Last year  the worldwide IT spending declined approximately 5 8  year over year or  216 billion to  3 52 trillion 
Gartner also predicts that 2014 worldwide IT spending levels of about  3 74 billion will not be surpassed until 2019  These predictions may undermine CDW s to be reported quarterly results 
Moreover  a highly leveraged balance sheet  competition from Insight Enterprises Inc   NSIT  and PC Connection  Inc   and pricing pressures remain headwinds 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 63 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  CDW carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   As it is  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies that you may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Fitbit Inc    NYSE FIT    with an Earnings ESP of  175 00  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Benefitfocus Inc    NASDAQ BNFT    with an Earnings ESP of  4 00  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Microchip Technology Inc    NASDAQ MCHP    with an Earnings ESP of  3 33  and a Zacks Rank  2

145041,366556,MCHP,What s In Store For FireEye  FEYE  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  Last quarter  the company posted narrower than expected loss  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
FireEye  headquartered in Milpitas  CA  is a global provider of web  email  file and malware security to both enterprises and governments 
The company reported mixed fourth quarter results  wherein its bottom line compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  but the top line missed the same  Despite the persistent macro uncertainty  the company seems optimistic based on a healthy security market  strong product line up  deal wins and investment plans  which should boost results in the to be reported quarter 
During the quarter  FireEye acquired iSIGHT Partners  David DeWalt  FireEye s CEO and chairman of the board stated   This acquisition extends FireEye s intelligence lead with an offering no one else in the industry can match   Therefore  the deal will boost FireEye s cyber security suite and improve its competitive dynamics 
Also  FireEye acquire Invotas  a firm specializing in improving response times after attacks  during the quarter  Invotas  lead product   Security Orchestrator   has been designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs 
Furthermore  FireEye recently launched a new product of its own  FireEye Essentials  This product is a lower cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management Platform  With this offering  the company intends to target smaller  midmarket companies 
These moves are important as they indicate FireEye s efforts on moving past the enterprise level end point protection products it had started with  Also  these factors are likely to aid its results in the to be reported quarter 
However  an uncertain economic environment  competition from the likes of Palo Alto Networks Inc    NYSE PANW   and Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR   and unfavorable currency translations remain concerns 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that FireEye is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for FireEye is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 89 cents 
Zacks Rank  FireEye has a Zacks Rank  2  Though this increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum
