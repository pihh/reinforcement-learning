12946,234461,UIS,5 Top Small Cap Stocks Priced Below  20 For Strong Returns ,opinion,By mid January  it was more than evident that small caps were having their best year since 1987  The surge continued for the rest of the month and also persisted in February  But by mid March  prospects for small caps were noticeably cloudier However  it may be too early to write off small caps for the year  With Europe and China showing signs of weakness  the domestic economy looks decidedly stronger  This will provide a big boost to small caps since they are mostly domestically focused Widespread optimism over the trade deal is another factor influencing investors to bet on higher risk categories like small caps  This is why it makes sense to bet on attractively priced small cap stocks since they are poised to surge even higher Surge in First Two Months  Slump in MarchThe Russell 2000 had gained more than 8  by Jan 18 this year  a far cry from last year  the worst for the category since 2008 s Great Recession  The index went on to gain 18  through Mar 1  even as the S P 500 increased 12  over the same period In effect  small caps reaped the biggest dividends of this year s equity market surge  However  in the last two weeks  the Russell 2000 lost more than 2   even as the broader S P 500 inched up around 0 5  The extent of their divergence has been the highest for the year and has coincided with some rather dismal economic data  In February  employers created the fewest jobs in 17 months  Further  the latest ISM survey showed that American manufacturing was growing at its slowest pace since Trump won the U S  presidential election Economic Resilience  Trade Deal to Boost Small CapsThe naysayers are already claiming that the recent downturn in small caps presages the coming of a larger stock market debacle  But the fact is that it is too early to write off the small cap category It is true that small caps are more domestically focused than their S P 500 counterparts  whose members garner around 40  of their revenues from overseas  They are therefore decidedly more susceptible to domestic economic weaknesses  which have been witnessed off late But it is also true that the U S  economy has shown great resilience even when other major economies are struggling  While several S P 500 companies have raised concerns about Europe and China in their fourth quarter transcripts  no such worries about the United States have been forthcoming Domestic economic strength is also evident from the latest reading of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index  which rose to 97 8 in February  Further  an uptick in risk taking propensity was witnessed on last Friday This was primarily due to fresh optimism about a trade deal which could provide new life to a long running market rally  The positive sentiment was primarily generated by Trump s latest statement about a  very responsible and reasonable China    This in turn would also go on to boost riskier categories like small caps Our ChoicesThe recent weakness in small caps detracts in no way from the fact that the category has enjoyed an excellent run for much of the year  The domestic economy has shown great resilience at a time when other major economies are facing several problems  This should provide a major boost to such a domestically focused category Additionally  there is fresh optimism over a trade deal between the United States and China  This could breathe new life into a market rally  increasing the risk taking propensity of investors  This would also be beneficial for a category like small caps We have selected stocks which are priced below  20 and have enjoyed strong gains year to date  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where

12948,234463,UIS,Is Unisys Corporation  UIS  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Unisys Corporation   NYSE UIS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Unisys Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5 88  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 24  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Unisys Corporation s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 5 99  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 41  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Unisys Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 5 79  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Unisys Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 30  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 30 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Unisys Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes UIS a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 1 89  which is much better than the industry average of 15 99  Clearly  UIS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Unisys Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A  This gives UIS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen 4 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Unisys Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this mixed trend  the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineUnisys Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  top 27  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 7 stocks to watch

12989,234504,UIS,4 Stocks To Bet On New Analyst Coverage,opinion,Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  plays a significant role in interpreting information pertaining to capital markets  thereby creating value for investors  Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might trigger misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  In fact  coverage initiation usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it However  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Impact on PriceIt is interesting to note that the price movement is generally a function of recommendations from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst issues a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as

13007,234522,UIS,Should Value Investors Pick Unisys  UIS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Unisys Inc    NYSE UIS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Unisys has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Unisys s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computers  IT  Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Unisys has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  UIS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Unisys currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Unisys a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its Price to Cash flow  P CF  ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 1 3  which is far better than the industry average of 14 4  Clearly  UIS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Unisys might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C  This gives UIS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen no up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined by 48 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Unisys Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineUnisys is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 28  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Computer IT Services industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge  With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research  It s not the one

13014,234529,UIS,Will March Spark Equity Gains  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,Following a splendid start to the year  investors have just traversed what was the toughest month for stocks in recent times  In February  stocks entered correction territory  albeit for a short period  Following a brief recovery  the month ended on a torrid note with losses triggered by inflationary and tariff related fears Empirical evidence tells us that February typically is the third worst performing month for the S P 500  something that has been proven consistently since 1945  At the same time  March is considered one of the two best months of the year for markets  This is why investors would do well to invest in winning stocks that continued to gain in a difficult month and still sport a strong upside March Spells Success for StocksMarch has historically been a good month for investors and analysts believe that after a dismal February  this could be the time when stocks once again start rallying  In any case since 1945  February has proved to be the third worst performing month for the S P 500  This time around  the index ended February down 3 9  after the 10  decline witnessed in January  February also ended the market s 10 month winning streak  the longest since February 1959   At the same time  since 1945  the S P index has been up 66  of this time in March  Similarly  it has gained 69  in April  which is considered the second best month  S P 500 has registered an average gain of 1 46  in March since 1983  And if the 90 years of market history  from 1928 2017  is taken into consideration  the S P 500 was up 61  of this time in March  while it was up 63  of this time in April  When the market reflected gains in March  the average advance was 3 6   Similarly  when the market suffered losses  the average decline was 3 4  Inflation  Tariff Worries OverstatedThe U S  economy is fast recovering and given the continued optimism  March might yet again prove to be a great month  The year was off to a great start with the market touching record highs in January  February saw a pullback when markets entered correction territory  And with this  investor expectations are once at realistic levels However  challenges like growing fears of rising inflation and a resultant increase in the pace of rate hikes linger  The Fed is expected to raises interest rates on Mar 21 and come up with fresh forecasts for inflation and interest rates  It could also signal more interest rate hikes than expected earlier That said  the personal consumption expenditures price index  PCE  index rose 0 4  in January  although the yearly increase stayed flat at 1 7  for the third consecutive month  the government said Thursday  Excluding the volatile energy and food components  the Fed s preferred inflation measure  the core PCE index  increased 0 3 in January  However  the 12 month advance in the core rate was still flat at 1 5  for the fourth consecutive month  Thus  despite inflation rising over the last few years  it remains well below the Fed s target of 2  On the other hand  President Donald Trump announced Thursday his intentions of imposing import tariffs on steel and aluminum  This has triggered widespread worries of a trade war with countries across the world as a retaliatory action  However  such a specter could only become reality if the Trump administration extends protection of this sort across a range of other industries  This seems unlikely at this point  since steel and aluminum tariffs were arrived at after much vacillation  Hence  a section of market watchers continue to believe that fears of a trade war are a tad overblown Our ChoicesFebruary proved to be one of the toughest months for investors  At the same time  empirical data shows that March is the third best performing month for stocks  A tough February coupled with inflationary and tariff related fears might make investors a shade jittery but there aren t immediate reasons to worry  as March might turn out to good for stocks Adding stocks that performed well even in February s harsh environment and possess strong upside potential to your portfolio looks like a smart move at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a good VGM score  You can see Unisys Corporation

Finisar Corporation  NASDAQ FNSR  had a big day not only during the session  but in after hours  up 1 89 or 5 86   to 34 13  on 3 8 million shares traded and up another 6   or 2 09 in after hours  so about 4 points up on Thursday  It had a big pop on earnings  a pullback  and it came right back up to the 36 40 range  Swing trade targets are 35 and 39  It hit the 35 dollar target  so now it may be headed to 39  It has 5 2 days to cover  
Lsb Industries  NYSE LXU  is moving  and popped on Thursday  up 88 cents  or 10   to 9 35  on nearly a million shares traded  It looks like it s headed higher  This is the highest close this stock has had since Sept  If it can get it up through resistance at right about 9 70  it could very well be a 12 dollar stock  It has 9 days to cover on the short side 
Nektar Therapeutics  NASDAQ NKTR  is a stock that I really like  It got up near 20 in Sept  and then collapsed  It did rebound  but retested the lows  and on Thursday  it was moving nicely  up 62 cents  or 5   to 12 95  on 1 4 million shares traded  breaking out of a flag and closing near the upper end of the range on big volume  I put a swing out on it  I do believe this stock is going to make it back to the 14 14 1 2 zone  and then 15  or more 
Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan  NYSE POT  was up just 33 cents  or 2   to 19 38  on 7 7 million shares traded on Thursday  but it s coming right up to resistance at the 19 38 spike high from March  If it gets through there that will have completed the base  I will be looking for 21  22 1 2  and much more

13051,234566,UIS,5 Stocks To Buy On New Analyst Coverage,opinion,A lack of information creates inefficiencies that might result in stocks being misrepresented  over  or under valued   Here  analysts play a vital role in investment decisions as they provide significant data  So  investors look forward to coverage initiation of stocks Coverage initiation of a stock by analyst s  usually depicts bigger investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  A new coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investors  focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t love to produce something that is already in demand However  the average change in broker recommendation is more preferable than a single recommendation change Analyst Coverage   Price MovementInterestingly  the price movement is generally a function of the recommendations from the new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  The number of increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy  but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof  Here are the other screening parameters Prices greater than or equal to 5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors Average Daily

under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  A new coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investors  focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t love to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks It is needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is more preferable than a single recommendation change How does Analyst Coverage Influence Stock Price The price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from the new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  The number of increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy  but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof  Here are the other screening parameters Prices greater than or equal to 5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here are five of the eight stocks that passed the screen John Bean Technologies Corporation   NYSE JBT    a

13074,234589,UIS,The Basics Of Support And Resistance,opinion,When it comes to trading the financial markets  support and resistance levels are the basis of almost all technical analysis charting patterns In the simplest terms  support and resistance levels are where the forces of supply and demand meet  They can be extremely obvious on some financial charts  or hard to spot without many years of experience on others Support and resistance levels are found in financial charts  from stocks  commodities  indexes  options  interest rates  even ETF and mutual fund charts  They are powerful trading tools when used correctly and with risk management When the price of a stock  or stock market index  moves lower  it is because more traders are selling than buying  This tells us that supply is increasing but demand is not  Selling is seen as bearish When the price of a stock or stock market index moves higher  it is because more traders are buying than selling  Supply is decreasing while demand is increasing  Buying is seen as bullish For this report we will look at individual stocks SupportWhen a stock reaches a point at which there are no more sellers  and the balance tips to buyers  prices begin to rise  This creates a support level that technical analysts will watch in the future as it may offer clues to future market moves  Not all levels created by reversals in price wind up being tested again  However those that do may react to the resistance or support level The best way to visualize a support level is with a chart  Below is a weekly chart of AmerisourceBergen  ABC   You can easily see the bottom when the 2008 bear market lows were reached in November of 2008 But then in March of 2009  after a substantial rally off the November lows the stock ended at about  19 00 a share  AmerisourceBergen had again declined to that prior bear market low  This time when it reached the low the stock immediately reversed  The sellers evaporated and buyers jumped in  Why  Because the stock had reached an obvious support level and then showed that there were no more sellers to push prices lower Buyers jumped in to the market and the stock price reversed midweek and zoomed higher  That  14 00 level acted as powerful support when sellers could not push this stock lower  When sellers gave up  there were only buyers left and the stock soared Traders watching this chart had a huge advantage as they could buy AmerisourceBergen and place a sell stop just below the strong support level thus minimizing risk Notice how the advance stalled for several months  June July  when the  19 00 level was reached in June  This was where the stock originally reversed from resistance  in January  and traders began to sell as the level was reached  But then AmerisourceBergen broke out above resistance  the January highs  and you can see how quickly sellers evaporated and buyers reentered the market and powered this stock higher  Again  it was all about support and resistance ResistanceThe reverse of support occurs when a stock reaches a point at which there are no more buyers  and the balance tips to sellers  prices begin to fall  This creates a resistance level that technical analysts will watch in the future as it may offer clues to future market moves  Not all levels created by reversals in price wind up being tested again  However those that do may react to the resistance or support level  Below is a daily chart of Unysis Corp  UIS  showing the last year of trading  After the bear market ended  Unysis entered an advance that remained strong until the beginning of 2010  At that point  around  40 00 a share  buyers decreased and sellers began to dominate the trading for Unysis  eventually pushing prices to a low around  28 00 a share in early February 2010  This created a strong resistance level at the  40 00 levelSellers dominated and pushed prices down to about  28 00 a share where selling stopped and buyers again stepped in  The reversal to the upside  occurring at  28 00 a share in early February  created a new support level  At this point the sellers pulled back and buyers stepped in  pushing prices back towards the previous high at  40 00  In mid March the  40 00 level was again reached and prices reversed  Resistance at  40 00 a share was strong enough to again push prices lower  No matter the reason  whether it was fundamentals  a news event or a reversal in the general stock market  it makes no difference   40 00 is now a strong and tested resistance level As a trader  a short position could have been entered after prices began to reverse the second time in mid March  using the  40 00 resistance level as a buy stop to reduce risk If prices continue to decline for Unysis  they will eventually again reach  28 00  Should they reverse to the upside we will have a new support level  Should they break through the  28 00 level and move lower  that would point to lower lows ahead as support has been broken Again a trade could be taken using support at  28 00 for a bullish trade  after the stock reverses to the upside  and using  28 00 as a sell stop to control risk  If support at  28 00 was broken to the downside  a short trade could be taken using  28 00 as a buy stop to control risk Should prices rally from here and eventually push above the  40 00 level  it would be a breakout for Unysis  A low risk trade could be entered using the old resistance level at  40 00 a share as a sell stop thus creating a low risk bullish trade ConclusionAs you can see from the above charts  support or resistance can be used in many ways to set up trades  And this is just using the very basics of support and resistance  There are many trading tools based on support and resistance that can help pinpoint trades Support or resistance levels can also reverse  A support level  example  28 00 in the Unysis chart above  would become resistance if prices continued lower in the future and eventually broke below  28 00  The same applies in the reverse  If resistance is broken  say the  40 00 level is surpassed in the future  that level then becomes support Most technical analysis tools use support and resistance in some form  Many traders use support and resistance exclusively in their trading The above may seem confusing at first if you are new to looking at chart patterns  If you are used to doing so the above is old hat and you see these patterns without even thinking about it  Eventually it becomes second nature ,2012-12-16,Frank

Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ AGIO  popped to 76 98  before backing off and closing at 73 83 on Wednesday  up 92 cents  or 1 26   on nearly a million shares  It wasn t a great close  but you can see that as a new all time high  it appears  Post IPO all time high  I m still looking for some more upside  If the market cooperates  this stock could get up to 90  The first target is 80  and then 88 90  It needs strong momentum 
Natus Medical Inc   NASDAQ BABY  is a stock we traded back in Oct 2013 when it broke out  consolidated  had a nice swing trade put on it that worked  consolidated for six months  popped  consolidated for a couple more months  broke out  pulled back  and was a little choppy  but on Wednesday  it popped 55 cents  or 1 7   on 865 000  That s the biggest volume since Jan  It got up to 33 20  which is a new all time high 
BioFuel Energy Corp   BioFuel Energy Corp  NASDAQ BIOF   has been working well for us  You can see the snapback from my recommendation down in the 5 3 4 range  It had a target of 8 00 on Tuesday  which it hit and backed off  and on Wednesday  it had a nice inside day  Even though the volume was low it was an up day  up 34 cents  or 4 6   on 559 000 shares traded  It may be pausing in here  Hopefully  the better it looks in terms of hard pauses  The next target is 9 00 
Regulus Therapeutics Inc   NASDAQ RGLS  had a spectacular day on Wednesday on strong hepatitis C drug news  This stock exploded  almost 200  at one point  from the 6 00  and change  level  which is where it closed on Tuesday  to as high as 18 33 on Wednesday pre market  and then it pulled back to as low as 11 13  However  it closed at 13 75  up 6 98  or 103   on 20 million shares  If it can get back above 15 15 20  I think this stock will be an 18 19 dollar stock  So keep an eye on this one

Achillion Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ACHN  popped out of its pattern on Tuesday  got up to 12 62  but it closed rather poorly  in my opinion  at 11 94  or 17 cents  and only 1 44   on 6 6 million shares  The truth is it s a lot of stock  but it didn t close well  It could be a sign of distribution  but I don t think that s the case  A lot of cross concepts for sure  but it s still holding its moving averages  and it has broken back out  and closed right on resistance at the 11 94 12 00 range  So let s just see if there s a follow through  and if there is  I m looking for a retest of the 13 80 range  and then 15 00

FireEye  Inc   NASDAQ FEYE  is one of the two security stocks that I like as I m looking at security software companies  It s been up  it s been down  it s been up  it s been down  and so on  but overall  a nice big base pattern is forming  I could propel this stock to the 50 s 60 s down the road  but for now  I m looking to see if we can test and take out the 36 1 2 37 range  and then 41 would be my next target 
VASCO Data Security International  NASDAQ VDSI  had a great day on Tuesday  It opened at 21 55  got up to 24 34  and closed at 23 73  up 5 44 or 30   on 4 4 million shares  That may be the biggest volume this stock has had in six or seven years  On the long term charts  it shows big basing action  a spike up at the 44 range  and the long term target would be up there  But  for now  I m looking for it to carry forward to 25  and then we ll see if it will punch through and make higher highs  For now  even if it stalls in that range and consolidates  I m eventually looking for the high 20 s and mid 30 s

Cisco announced a number of alliances at MWC 2018 
It has signed a Joint Purpose Agreement with Telenor to accelerate digital transformation in Norway with the goal of building a smart city model based on IoT for public safety and customer connectivity in a highly secure environment  This will therefore also result in new revenue opportunities for the two 
Cisco also announced a Memorandum of Understanding  MOU  with TIM  the leading service provider in Italy that is somewhat broader than the one with Telenor  The goal here is to create next generation solutions and services targeted at the cybersecurity  IoT  Industry 4 0  Smart Cities and 5G segments  Their shared capabilities will be used in the digital transformation of companies  the public sector and services targeted at citizens  They will also be utilized to develop a partner ecosystem leveraging 5G  Cisco has also joined the TIM  WCAP start up acceleration program to boost overall innovation in the region

Cisco signed an agreement with Vodafone  LON VOD  that is related to network slicing segment routing  or creating a software defined virtual network within the physical network that can be made to always choose the route with the shortest end to end latency  One big advantage of this system is that it intuitively restores connectivity in under 50 milliseconds if an issue occurs by rerouting traffic automatically 

 
At the event  it also signed deals with two Indian companies 
Its agreement with Bharti Airtel  India s largest telecom is intended to deepen their collaboration in the Self Organizing Network  SON  by integrating it with other data sources and machine learning capabilities  This will enable dynamic adjustment of the network when there is an exponential increase in voice and data traffic  India s mobile data consumption reportedly surpassed usage of the U S  and China in 2017 
Its collaboration with Reliance Jio  another telecom  is also an expansion of their earlier agreement that built an all IP network using Cisco technologies  It is designed to bring multi access edge computing to the Reliance network  enabling a superior video experience  The technology integrates the content delivery network  CDN  into the mobile LTE network with edge caches closer to users that can reduce latency and improve performance 
According to the Cisco Visual Networking Index Forecast 2016 2021  video will comprise 82  of all IP network traffic by 2021  So with these technologies  Cisco is attempting to get right in the middle of things

13126,234641,UIS,4 Stocks To Watch  SOLO  CRON  LSCC  NVTA ,opinion,"The market had a fairly good trading day on Wednesday  finishing higher  After some strong early action  and then a pullback  they firmed up  A lot of stocks we follow are doing well  a couple of them explosively  Let s start off here with the chart of the day 
Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp   SOLO 
SOLO was up 2 99  or 223 13   to 4 33  on over 40 million shares traded on Wednesday  In after hours it was up another 1 17 or 27   going from 4 33 to 5 50  before moving into a coil pattern  When you see a chart that looks like this  pop  coil  pop coil  pop flag  run up  flag  flag  just know  it s one of those charts that last all day  The way you stay in the chart is by staying in the pattern and continuing to raise your stops  Net net  this chart had a huge run up  a huge explosive move  it was up against resistance and took out the 4 33 area  You might see this stock move  potentially  as high as the 6 7 range as early as Thursday  It got up to almost 6 00 in after hours  I wouldn t be shocked to see a follow through  but I wouldn t chase this stock 
After a monster run that took Cronos Group Inc   CRON  from 9 3 4 to the 26 range  it pulled back in a very neat  orderly wedge  and on Wednesday  it closed up 78 cents  or 4   to 20 45  on over 17 million shares  Obviously  you want to stop it just under 18 65  75  because it can come down to 17 1 2  even 15 1 2 again  But  for now  if this wedge breaks to the upside  I would not be shocked if this stock made a run to the high 30 s  in the 36 area 
Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  LSCC 
LSCC had an incredible day on Wednesday with a blowout earnings report  taking it for a run up 2 42  or 291 2   to 10 60  on 15 million shares  That s as big a day I ve ever seen on this stock  It s at the top of the channel near long term lateral resistance  If it starts to run  look for 15  23  25  and so on  as targets going forward 
Invitae Corporation  NVTA 
NVTA has a beautiful bottom with a right handed  extended platform flag holding the 50  and popping 1 10  or 8   to 15 65  on 2 2 million shares on Wednesday  Keep an eye on this one  If it makes a move through 16  targets are 18 1 2 and 22 1 2
