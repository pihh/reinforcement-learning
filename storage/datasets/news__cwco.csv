20918,242433,CWCO,Why It Is Worth Investing In Water Now,opinion,"This might surprise you  but water is a fantastic investment 
Take water utility stocks like American Water Works  NYSE AWK  and  Consolidated Water  Co Ltd  NASDAQ CWCO   for example  In the past six months alone  their stocks have shot up 19  and 28   respectively 
Industrial water companies like Danaher Corporation  NYSE DHR  are also on a great run  Danaher has climbed 10  in the last six months 





That s pretty substantial  especially compared to the S P 500 s 3  gain during this stretch 
Water Stocks Offer a Safe Haven
Stock market volatility is part of the reason water stocks are doing so well right now 
You probably know that US stocks have had a rollercoaster year  In August alone  there were five days when the S P 500 rose or fell 1    This only happened on eight days during all of 2018  
Add in trade wars  the impeachment circus  a yield curve inversion  and you get a lot of nervous investors 
At the same time  stocks are flirting with all time highs  And we re at the tail end of the longest bull market in US history  So investors are rightfully skittish 
When stock market risk rises  investors flock to safe and reliable stocks  And water stocks fit that bill 
Water utilities are my favorite type of water stock  These companies process and deliver water to cities and towns  They re often highly regulated  which limits profits  But it also keeps out competition 
Water infrastructure and equipment companies are another good option  These companies work with water utilities and the industrial and commercial sectors to improve water treatment and transport options 
Either way  you want some exposure to the water industry right now 
People Always Need Water
Remember when stocks fell 20  between September and December last year 
Water stocks bucked the trend  In fact   California Water Service Group   NYSE CWT  and American States Water Company  NYSE AWR  rose 8 2  and 4 7   respectively  during that period 





Same story for water infrastructure firm  Aquaventure Holdings LLC   NYSE WAAS 
 WAAS   While the S P 500 was in freefall  AquaVenture shot up 9 0  
Meanwhile  Brazilian water giant  Sabesp   NYSE SBS  beat them all  soaring 32  





This all makes sense when you think about it  People always need water  period  That doesn t change when the broader market is heading south 
Less Than a Penny Per Gallon
Of course  water is essential for sustaining all life on Earth  So  it s no surprise that water infrastructure  treatment  and transportation companies run very stable businesses 
On top of that  long term trends like population growth and a shrinking supply of fresh water from rivers  lakes  and aquifers can only push demand and prices higher 
However  right now  water in the US is downright cheap  The average price is about  1 50 per 1 000 gallons  or less than a penny per gallon 
But you can still make a lot of money off it 
There are 327 million people in the US today  That figure could climb as high as 440 million by 2050 
Meanwhile  Americans use 80 to 100 gallons of water per day  on average  So we need every last drop of water we can find 
This is why the US government is investing heavily in water infrastructure  By 2027  investment in municipal water infrastructure will rise 11   And private spending on drinking water infrastructure will total  60 billion  according to accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Over the next 25 years  total spending on wastewater treatment alone will exceed  10 billion a year 
These steady and predictable investments help make US water stocks some of the safest investments on the market 
The Best Ways to Invest in Water Right Now
There are a handful of ways to invest in water  For income investors like us  the best route is water utilities like American Water Works  AWK  and Consolidated Water Co   CWCO  
Water infrastructure companies like  Xylem  Inc  NYSE XYL  also offer solid opportunities 
Although it has underperformed the S P 500 and water utilities year to date  it has beaten the market over the last 36 months 
If you prefer the ETF route  my favorite is the Invesco PowerShares Water Resources  NASDAQ PHO   It holds everything from utilities to infrastructure companies  and it pays a small 0 5  dividend yield 
That said  I usually prefer buying individual stocks  since they offer more upside  But for investors who want a broad slice of the water market  an ETF is a suitable choice 
Either way  water belongs in every income investors  portfolio ",2019-11-10,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-it-is-worth-investing-in-water-now-200484057,200484057

and severe doubts regarding resolution to eight month old trade war between the United States and China were the primary reasons behind the rout Negative sentiment has dented investor confidence to such an extent that strong consumer spending and labor market data have failed to instill optimism  At this juncture  it will be prudent to invest in defensive industry stocks like utilities with a

to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand  As a result  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market condition Notably  year to date  S P 500 s Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  gained 7 2   just behind the 9 5  increase of

demand for utility services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand

20981,242496,CWCO,Stock Market Volatility Intensifies  5 Great Utility Picks ,opinion,Wall Street witnessed a sharp decline on Nov 20 as a result of intensifying market turmoil  The broad based market decline which emanated from concerns over future growth prospects of high tech companies has escalated further owing to conflicting news on trade war front  expectations of higher interest rates in near future and apprehensions regarding an impending global economic slowdown Negative sentiments have dented investor confidence to such an extent that strong third quarter earnings results have failed to instill optimism  At this juncture  it will be prudent to invest in defensive industry stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential Wall Street Tumbles on TuesdayOn Nov 20  all three major stock indexes   the Dow 30  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   plunged 2 2   1 8  and 1 7   respectively  In fact  these three indexes have plummeted 2 6   2 6  and 5 4   respectively  so far in November  Notably  in October  these three indexes had declined 5 1   6 9  and 9 2   respectively Moreover  Nasdaq is already grappling in correction territory while the benchmark S P 500 is just 4 points away of its correction territory  Meanwhile  the blue chip Dow has declined more than 2 500 points from its all time high registered in Oct 3 Additionally  both the Dow and S P 500 are in negative territory year to date while Nasdaq Composite is just hovering around it  Notably  this week  starting from Nov 19  has had the worst start to a Thanksgiving week for both the Dow and S P 500 since 2011  For Nasdaq  this had been the worst start to Thanksgiving week since 2000 Why Utility Stocks The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for utility services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand Consequently  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market condition  Moreover  Utility business is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows   Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that add to their attractiveness to income oriented investors Utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which give their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been plaguing the other industries of late Notably  in the last three months  S P 500 s Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  gained 1 1   Barring a gain of

20982,242497,CWCO,Yield Curve Inversion Spooks Markets  5 Utility Picks,opinion,On Dec 4  U S  markets suffered their worst reversal since October with investors waking up to a brand new headwind  For the first time in more than a decade  yields on Treasuries with shorter maturities exceeded longer dated issues on Dec 3  In other words  the yield curve experienced an inversion  Traditionally  such a phenomenon heralds the coming of a severe economic downturn The trend continued into Tuesday and is likely to prevail in an environment where the Federal Reserve is firm on tightening the monetary environment  Utilities stocks were the biggest gainers of yesterday s trading session Their superior diving yields and steady revenues make them good choices in a tough economic environment  Investing in this class of stocks would make for a smart move right now Why Does Yield Curve Inversion Happen On Dec 3  the yield on the three year Treasury note exceeded the return on its five year counterpart for the first time since 2007  The phenomenon continued on Dec 4  with the yield on the 2 year Treasury note surpassing the return on the 5 year note  Yields on other longer dated securities tumbled  with the 10 year Treasury yield falling below 3  With returns on shorter duration securities exceeding those with longer maturity periods  the yield curve has inverted  This brings us to the yield curve itself  a graph of rates payable by government bonds until the principal amount has been paid  Usually  this graph slopes upward since long term rates exceed short term returns This means that when the yield curve inverts  short term rates are exceeding their long term counterparts  In other words  long term bonds are in high demand  a phenomenon which pushes down their yields  This is because investors are taking a negative view of short term economic prospects  Does This Imply that a Recession is Up Ahead For this very reason  an inverted yield curve has historically been a reliable indicator of recession  But optimists think that the most crucial yield gap  the one between the 3 month and 1 year government notes has not inverted  They take this to imply that an economic downturn is unlikely in the near future But investment manager Doubleline s CEO Jeffrey Gundlach thinks the inversion witnessed recently is a clear sign that the  economy is poised to weaken   Speaking to Reuters   bond king  Gundlach added that  the totally flat Treasury note curve is predicting softer future growth  and  will stay the Fed s hand  His views have been echoed by Arthur Estrella  known for his seminal study of the predictive nature of the yield curve  Estrella has said that the flattening of this curve is a matter of great concern  Such a phenomenon is usually shortly followed by a recession Estrella thinks that if the Fed continues its rate hikes after December  an inversion of the spread between the 10 month and 3 month treasury securities is in the cards  This would virtually guarantee that a recession would follow in its wake Our ChoicesThe jury may still be out on what the recent yield curve inversion signals  as far as experts are concerned  But markets seemed to have made up their minds on Tuesday  with the Dow suffering an 800 point loss  Utilities closed at their highest level in a year with investors reaching for safe havens The above average dividend yields and steady revenues make this class of stocks great options at a time when a downturn looks near  Adding them to your portfolio would make for a prudent choice  We have

back of robust output in utilities and mines  One of the major reasons behind the strong gains made by utilities was the extreme cold weather that swept across the country That said  year to date

Yield  4   Consolidated Water operates seawater desalination plants and water distribution systems in areas where potable water is scarce  The company has operations in the Cayman Islands  Belize  the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas  Water is supplied under long term  fixed price contracts in these lucrative resort markets    The company s shares have plummeted 40  in two years and sit just above  7 today  A major cause was a drawn out legal battle with British Virgin Islands  authorities regarding contract prices and improvements to a jointly owned plant  However  this situation is nearing resolution  Last month  the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court ruled in favor of Consolidated Water  ordering the government to pay  10 4 million on the water claim and compensate the company for facility improvements  The British Virgin Islands government has 42 days to appeal the verdict    Consolidated s earnings grew 18  to  2 3 million in the first quarter of 2012 from  2 0 million a year earlier because of additional capacity provided by the recently expanded Bahamas plant  Consolidated Water is also building a treatment facility in Mexico that will be the largest in its portfolio  able to process 100 million gallons a day  Analysts expect capacity additions to drive 20  yearly earnings growth for the next five years    Consolidated Water is valued at only 0 8 of book value and yields about 4   The company has  33 5 million in cash  only  15 5 million of debt and a manageable dividend payout at 68  of earnings  The last dividend increase was a 7  bump three years ago  to a  0 30 annual rate per share  2  BP plc  NYSE  BP   Yield  5   Integrated energy giant BP has suffered through tough times because of its lead role in the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010  BP has spent much of the last 18 months dealing with the fallout  but has made noteworthy progress this year    Last month  BP settled economic and personal injury claims associated with the disaster for  7 8 billion  While the company still faces litigation for environmental damage  BP has set aside  37 billion to settle these claims    BP is in the process of selling off  38 billion of assets to pay legal settlements and for other purposes  but has significant new production coming online next year that will more than offset lost production from asset sales  The company has world class reserves of 18 1 billion barrels and a 19 year record of replacing 100  of production from reserves    In the last 12 months  BP has delivered EBITDA totaling  42 billion and  24 billion of net profits  Analysts think BP can produce 5  earnings gains in each of the next five years    BP shares fell about 50  after the spill from  60 to  29  but have since recovered to  37  Dividends were suspended during the crisis  but the company restored payments last year and raised the dividend by 14  this year to a  1 92 annual rate  Shares yield about 5  and payout is modest at 23  of earnings  BP trades at a low price to earnings  P E  ratio of 5 and at a 30  discount to industry peers  which suggests plenty of upside for patient investors    3  Navios Maritime Partners LP  NYSE  NMM  Yield  15  This Greek shipping company is a fallen angel due to Europe s sovereign debt crisis  Navios owns a fleet of 18 ocean going vessels that transport dry bulk commodities such as iron ore  coal and grain    Shipping companies have been hurt by Europe s weak economy  but Navios is faring better than most because of its long term contracts  averaging four years  and many customers in emerging markets  EBITDA improved 14  to  36 8 million in the first quarter of 2012 from  32 4 million a year earlier  but earnings per share dropped to  0 30 from  0 35 because of dilution from a stock offering  However  analysts forecast 6  annual earnings growth longer term    Shares have declined 32  in the last 12 months  mostly  as I said  because of the trouble in Greece   which sent the yield soaring above 15   Navios has increased distributions four years in a row to the current  1 76 annual rate    Risks to consider  BP has set aside  38 billion for legal claims  but its liability could be higher  A trial to resolve claims against BP and its drilling partners is scheduled for January 2013  Because it is a micro cap stock  Consolidated Water may have greater price volatility than the overall market  Navios Maritime Partners is a Limited Partnership and must distribute the majority of its income to investors  which may leave little cash for growth     My top pick overall is BP  The company is a cash machine  with huge production and reserves while targeting 50  growth in cash flow by 2014  Consolidated Water has more risk  but higher growth  while Navios Maritime Partners is a cyclical play on a recovering European economy BY Lisa

21147,242662,CWCO,2 Companies To Watch  Ekso Bionics And Consolidated Water Co ,opinion,"One of Wall Street s cardinal sins is a  set it and forget it  mentality  What I mean by that is there s often a flurry of interest in specific stocks and then  nothing 
That s too bad  because the devil  as they say  is always in the details 
As we have discussed many times at Total Wealth  you ve got to check in on what you own periodically to ensure a given stock  bond  or ETF  a  still meets your objectives and risk tolerance  and b  that the reasons you bought it are still valid 
I call this the    simply because you want to make sure you re on track not just when you buy something  but every day you own it 
So  in that spirit  let s check in on two of our favorite unstoppable trend recommendations today 
Both  I m excited to report  remain compelling buys 
A New CEO Means New Business
Let s start with Ekso Bionics Holding  OTC EKSO   our favorite unstoppable technology trend play 
The company announced yesterday that CEO Nathan Harding is stepping down after almost 13 years at the helm and that he is being replaced effective immediately by Ekso s former President and Chief Commercialization Officer Thomas Looby 
That s a great move and one I m happy to see 
Let me explain 
CEOs come and go for a variety of reasons  Sometimes it s not under great circumstances  as was the case with former McDonald s  N MCD  CEO Don Thompson  who left the then struggling fast food giant under pressure in 2015 
But most of the time  particularly in young companies like Ekso  it s a good thing  because a changing of the guard means that the business is preparing itself for still greater things 
Apple  O AAPL   for example  has changed CEOs five times since 1977  not counting interim appointments due to Steve Jobs  declining health  Each time  the shift has been to achieve still greater potential 
Case in point  CEO John Sculley took over from Mike Markula at a time when marketing was critical to Apple s survival and the company just couldn t achieve the traction it needed  He took sales from  800 million to more than  8 billion using experience drawn from his tenure at PepsiCo  N PEP   another great company known for its marketing prowess 
Despite the fact that Ekso is a fraction of the size  that s exactly the kind of move Ekso needs 
Harding has been a fabulous startup leader  He s done the impossible and made some very powerful inroads with regards to key markets  contracts and technology development  But now it s time to leapfrog that experience as the company transitions to more of an operating   as opposed to startup   mentality 
I spoke with Looby earlier this week and there s no doubt in my mind he s got the chops  Before joining Ekso in 2014  Looby served as Chief Marketing Officer of Given Imaging  a company that s since been acquired by Medtronic  N MDT  for  49 9 billion 
The other thing to keep in mind about a transition like this is that small startup companies often make these moves in preparation for major capital market events like additional offerings  key partnerships  or even strategic acquisitions  Obviously I have no idea what the specifics are here but my experience tells me that we re in for some very exciting developments in the months ahead if I m correct 
Speaking of which  Ekso announced last week that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  awarded it another exoskeleton contract   the company s fourth  Like earlier contracts  this one focuses on the agency s Web Warrior program  with the intention of producing a flexible exoskeleton designed to help the wearer carry loads while expending minimal energy  potentially saving lives in combat 
It s worth noting that DARPA has a  2 97 billion budget  or more than 1 000 times the revenue Ekso reported in Q3 last year  If Ekso continues winning DARPA contracts the way it has to date  I could see the company building up relationships that will be hard for its competitors to replicate  and even larger contracts down the line 
Meanwhile  another respected institution with deep pockets has turned to Ekso  The Kessler Foundation  which awarded  2 24 million in grants last year in its mission to transform the lives of people with disabilities  has announced it s putting  1 million towards studying Ekso s GT exoskeleton  which was built for the purpose of helping stroke patients  Kessler is a global leader in rehabilitation research  so a positive conclusion in its study of how the GT helps stroke victims will carry real weight   and perhaps trigger the medical market penetration Ekso wants and I think is possible 
The company s trifecta of focus   military  industrial  and medical markets   gives it far more profit potential than alternatives I ve evaluated  As does the company s 37  gross profit margin 
Buying a Key Supplier to Tap New Markets
Now let s turn our attention to Consolidated Water Co  Ltd   O CWCO  
The seawater desalination plant and water distribution company continues to broaden operations as expected 
The big news here is that CWCO has acquired 51  of Aerex Industries  an OEM supplier for municipal and industrial water treatment  for  7 7 million in cash  This not only gives the company more control over a key supplier  but also a platform from which to broaden marketing relationships inside the United States 
I fully expect the company to leverage this by selling membrane separation equipment  filtration equipment  and piping to U S  municipalities and industrial facilities  many of whom regard U S  origin as part of the Request for Proposal  RFP  and bidding process  I m certain the company s American Society of Mechanical Engineers  ASME  accreditation will come in helpful  too 
The company reports earnings in mid March  and I m keen to see what they ve got on tap   pun absolutely intended 
In closing  keep in mind both of these companies are speculative recommendations intended to compliment a properly disciplined and structured investment program 
A 1 000  gain won t mean much if you can t stay in the game ",2016-02-28,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-important-updates-on-ekso-bionics-inc.-and-consolidated-water-co.-200119703,200119703
