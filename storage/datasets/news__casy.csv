30121,251636,CASY,A Santa Rally Or A Year End Pullback In Offing  5 Top Picks,opinion,U S  stocks are firing on all cylinders with major stock indexes hitting new highs a record number of times in 2019  Year to date  the three major stock indexes   the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite   have rallied 20 3   25 3  and 30 6   respectively  By any means  this is an impressive performance after a pathetic 2018 when all these indexes finished in the red At present  Wall Street seems unstoppable despite any concrete resolution to the more than a year old U S  China trade conflict  However  as we enter in the final month of 2019  the investor circle is busy guessing whether a Santa rally or a year end pull back is in store Conditions Ripe for a Santa RallyA Santa Claus rally is a typical Wall Street phenomenon associated with unusually strong stock market gains during the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year  Per Dow Jones Market Data  the Dow and the S P 500 have gained 1 4  and 1 3   respectively  on average since 1950 during this period Several economists and financial experts believe that the situation is conducive this year for a Santa rally  A fundamentally stable U S  economy  which is growing for the longest span of 11 years  albeit with some loss in pace  and a dovish monetary stance adopted by the Fed in 2019 are the two major drivers of Wall Street The central bank cut benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in 2019 and indicated maintaining a stable monetary policy in the near future   Furthermore  the government bond yield curve has steadied  eliminating fears of an impending recession Furthermore  the U S  GDP growth rate did not fall below 2  in the first three quarters of 2019  buoyed by strong consumer spending  which constitutes more than 70  of the economy  Additionally  a solid labor market and gradual wage growth offset drop in business spending and manufacturing activities U S  China Trade Conflict Remains a Hurdle  At present  the only stumbling block for a smooth Santa rally is the unresolved trade war with China  On Oct 11  President Donald Trump said that the two countries were close to signing a phase one trade deal  However  nothing concrete happened till the end of November  though both sides expressed their desire to reach an amicable solution soon On Nov 27  President Trump signed two bills supporting the Hong Kong protesters  despite China s repeated objections  China threatened to retaliate   It is a stark hegemonic practice   a severe interference in Hong Kong affairs  which are China s internal affairs  China will take strong counter measures  per the country s foreign ministry Notably  the phase one deal needs to be signed by Dec 15  which the U S  government set to impose a new round of tariff on  160 billion of Chinese goods  The Trump administration can also raise tariff rate on  250 billion of Chinese goods already under U S  tariff  On Nov 29  Reuters reported that the U S  government may expand its power to stop more foreign shipments of products with U S  technology to China s telecom giant Huawei Technologies Our Top PicksWhile a Santa rally can push stock indexes to finish the year with record high gains  intensification of trade conflict can result in a stock market plunge  at least for a short period of time

30126,251641,CASY,Kroger  KR  To Report Q3 Earnings As Amazon Guns For Supermarket Space ,opinion,"Kroger   NYSE KR   will report its third quarter financial performance before the opening bell on Thursday  December 5  The supermarket giant s shares have struggled to gain traction in 2019  having moved roughly sideways 
Investors hope Kroger will post strong quarterly results that will send the stock into the green for the year  Meanwhile  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   has ramped up its efforts to establish itself in the supermarket space  which has many worried 
Kroger Adjusts to the Modern Market 
Kroger is poised to compete against Amazon in the grab and go space  Amazon Go stores saw the success of grab and go items firsthand as the convenient items helped drive sales and traffic in the stores  Amazon Go stores are physical stores that allow users to buy their desired products in person and pay with their Amazon account  which eliminates registers and waiting in a check out line 
Conventional convenience stores have also noted an uptick in food sales as companies like Casey s General Stores   NASDAQ CASY   have noted the value its prepared food brings to its bottom line  As the grab and go market continues to grow  it could be an area Kroger might need to address 
Kroger must also focus on improving its online operations as more grocery shopping moves to the digital marketplace  The percentage of consumers regularly shopping for groceries online nearly doubled this year  according to a survey  Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Target   NYSE TGT   have both been key contributors to the online groceries  growth as their same day fulfillment services have been a hit with consumers 
In response to the emerging market  Kroger has aggressively expanded its online grocery operations and it now reaches 95  of its footprint with either pickup or delivery  The supermarket giant also elected to waive its  4 95 fee in some of its stores in hopes of attracting a larger audience 

Will Kroger Fold Under Pressure  
While online grocery shopping is growing substantially  only about 6  of all grocery purchases are made online  Kroger also boasts an established physical store footprint with nearly 2 800 grocery stores  which gives it a substantial head start over Amazon  Kroger can also optimize its physical stores to prepare grab and go items that can drive more traffic in its stores 
The company has also launched a test program of a new shelf display system  The enhanced display for grocery environment  or EDGE  allows shoppers to learn more about a certain food s nutritional value  which could be a hit with more health conscious shoppers  Kroger has also started to build its first automated warehouse that will fill online grocery orders 
Kroger s struggles to gain any steam this year has kept its valuation at a discount as it trades around 12X its forward earnings compared to the industry average of over 13X forward earnings  In addition to its valuation  Kroger pays dividend with a solid 2 3  yield that can help shareholders during stagnant times like these 
In Q2  Kroger s total sales rose to  28 2 billion from  28 billion in the year ago quarter and earnings rallied 7 32  to  0 44 per share  Identical Sales without fuel grew 2 2  and digital sales grew 31  
Our Q3 estimates call for earnings to come in right on par with last year s figure of  0 48 per share and for sales to pop 1 43  to  28 07 billion  Supermarket sales without fuel are projected to grow 6 85  to  24 9 billion and identical supermarket sales  excluding fuel  is predicted to be 2 25  
Looking ahead to the full fiscal year  our estimates forecast a bottom line rally of 4 3  to  2 20 per share and a top line jump of 1  to  122 4 billion 
Bottom Line 
The supermarket space has become even more competitive with Amazon s continued efforts to establish itself in the industry  The online innovation Amazon brings will force grocer s like Kroger to adjust their operations 
However  the online grocery market is still in its infancy  which gives Kroger more time to adopt a digital strategy  In the meantime  Kroger has piloted some tech innovations in its stores that might improve the consumer experience

30193,251708,CASY,Bet On These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Avoid Debt Traps,opinion,In the complex world of investment  understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial  With capital being one of the basic factors of production  companies   especially those facing a dearth of resources   need exogenous funds to finance their corporate expenses  run operations smoothly as well as expand the realm of their business Among equity and debt  the two most common options used to boost a company s future earnings  the latter is the more popular one  This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing In fact  statistics indicate that the United States  the richest economy in the world  is the biggest borrower  Notably  huge spending on wars  big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation s burden over the years  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal debt will rise to 92  of the economy s GDP in 2029 from 78  currently Nevertheless  this should not discourage investors from spending on U S  stocks since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country leads others  What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution  thus avoiding the ones that carry high debt loads Here comes the significance of leverage  better to say financial leverage  which indicates the degree to which a company utilizes debt to boost its operations and earn escalated profit margins  Usually investors tend to avoid companies bearing a higher degree of financial leverage to avoid falling into debt traps The next question is how to measure a company s degree of financial leverage  To this end  several leverage ratios have been constructed as efficient tools to evaluate a company s credit level to support prudent equity investments  The most popular among them is the debt to equity ratio Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company With the Q3 reporting cycle gaining steam recently  an investor must be looking for solid growth stocks  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth  without considering their debt level  might not be a wise move  As uncertainty can hit the global equity market any time  it is reasonable to expect that investors will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen Manulife Financial   NYSE MFC    The company is one of the three dominant life insurers in Canada  It delivered average positive earnings surprise of 4 95  in the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank  2 Gibraltar Industries   NASDAQ ROCK    It is a leading manufacturer and distributor of building products for the industrial  infrastructure and residential markets  The company currently holds a Zacks Rank of 2 and delivered average positive earnings surprise 0 01  for the last four quarters Caseys General Stores   NASDAQ CASY    It is a chain of convenience stores  It came up with average positive earnings surprise of 30 15  in the preceding four quarters and holds a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Steelcase   NYSE SCS    The company is a designer and

Leverage Stocks to Keep Losses at BayLeverage is an investment strategy adopted by corporations wherein borrowed capital is used to expand operations and amplify possible returns from risk capital  Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance capital projects Now a comparative analysis of the theory of cost of capital reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  So  debt financing remains the preferred option for corporates However  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect a company s bottom line Therefore  choosing a less debt ridden stock should be an appropriate option for a risk averse investor   And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which can measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Investors must be looking for stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth in the last couple of quarters  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth  without considering their debt level  is not a wise move For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or

30274,251789,CASY,What September Doldrums  Here s Why Stocks Are Moving Higher,opinion,September was supposed to be a rocky month for stocks  According to Dow Jones Market Data  since 1937  both the S P 500 and the Dow averaged a loss of 1   The Nasdaq Composite  as incepted in 1971  averaged a loss of 0 5   CFRA added that the broader S P 500 has averaged a 1  decline  particularly  in September since 1946 What s more  traditionally September is gloomier after a downbeat August  It was a wild month for the stock market  with the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq registering a loss of 1 8   1 7  and 2 6   respectively  By the way  this marked the worst August performance for the bourses since 2015 And whenever the S P 500 loses more than 1 5  in August  the Dow declines an average 1 1  in September  while the Nasdaq has seen an average drop of 0 8   The S P 500  itself  continued its losing run  declined 0 9  But pleasantly  such historical statistics have been squashed by the stock market so far this month  The S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq have already gained more than 3  each  From the ECB stimulus to trade optimism  everything is helping stocks eke out gains  And let s admit that recession may be coming but it isn t right around the corner What Happened So Far in September The ECB has launched fresh stimulus packages in an attempt to prevent a sluggish Eurozone economy from grinding to a halt  The ECB confirmed that it would trim its deposit rate  the interest paid to commercial banks when they place funds with the central bank  by 0 1 percentage points to an all time low of  0 5   At the same time  the ECB has announced a massive new bond buying program  The central bank s quantitative easing  QE  program will involve 20 billion euros   21 9 billion  per month of net asset purchases for as long as required And as the ECB adds more stimuli  the pressure is mounting on the Fed to do the same  President Trump has already called for the Fed to cut rates to boost the U S  economy  In fact  now an overwhelming majority of observers are seeing an imminent rate cut on August s soft employment report Slowdown in the U S  private sector job scenario in August will no doubt keep the Fed on track to lower its benchmark rate by at least a quarter percentage again later this month  The U S  economy added just 130 000 jobs  almost 28 000 less than analysts  expectations and 29 000 lower than July levels  By the way  August s job addition was the lowest in three months giving ample hints that the intensifying U S  China trade dispute has taken a toll on economic expansion On the trade front  Beijing has lifted tariffs on some U S  products amid the trade tensions  As a show of goodwill  Trump too delayed tariff hikes against China  Per South China Morning Post citing the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council  the exemptions on U S  goods will take effect on Sep 17  The products don t include big ticket items like agricultural products  but it does include items such as alfalfa pellets  fish feed and medical linear accelerators  to name a few Trump reciprocated by announcing a delay in implementation of higher tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods  Trump tweeted that tariff hikes from 25  to 30  will now go into effect on Oct 15 rather than the previously scheduled Oct 1 Last but not the least  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below the 2 year Treasury note a few weeks ago  raising concerns about a possible recession in the near term  But  yield curve inversion lasted for only three days  according to the Treasury department  So  the risk of an imminent recession diminishes  And with consumers remaining confident about their well being and the economy growing at a steady pace  investors can easily ignore the recession argument at least for the time being 4 Winning PicksThanks to the aforesaid positives  the U S  stock market continues to edge higher  Banking on such bullish sentiments

no doubt keep the Fed on track to lower its benchmark rate by at least a quarter percentage again later this month  The U S  economy added just 130 000 jobs  almost 28 000 less than analysts  expectations and 29 000 lower than July levels  By the way  August s job addition was the lowest in three months giving ample hints that the intensifying U S  China trade dispute has taken a toll on economic expansion On the trade front  Beijing has lifted tariffs on some U S  products amid the trade tensions  As a show of goodwill  Trump too delayed tariff hikes against China  Per South China Morning Post citing the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council  the exemptions on U S  goods will take effect on Sep 17  The products don t include big ticket items like agricultural products  but it does include items such as alfalfa pellets  fish feed and medical linear accelerators  to name a few Trump reciprocated by announcing a delay in implementation of higher tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods  Trump tweeted that tariff hikes from 25  to 30  will now go into effect on Oct 15 rather than the previously scheduled Oct 1 Last but not the least  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below the 2 year Treasury note a few weeks ago  raising concerns about a possible recession in the near term  But  yield curve inversion lasted for only three days  according to the Treasury department  So  the risk of an imminent recession diminishes  And with consumers remaining confident about their well being and the economy growing at a steady pace  investors can easily ignore the recession argument at least for the time being 4 Winning PicksThanks to the aforesaid positives  the U S  stock market continues to edge higher  Banking on such bullish sentiments  investing in solid

30320,251835,CASY,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Keep Losses At Bay,opinion,Leverage is an investment strategy adopted by corporations wherein borrowed capital is used to expand operations and amplify possible returns from risk capital  Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance capital projects Now a comparative analysis of the theory of cost of capital reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  So  debt financing remains the preferred option for corporates However  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect a company s bottom line Therefore  choosing a less debt ridden stock should be an appropriate option for a risk averse investor   And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which can measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Investors must be looking for stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth in the last couple of quarters  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth  without considering their debt level  is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen MDU Resources Group   NYSE MDU    The company provides value added natural resource products and related

30321,251836,CASY,4 Domestic Stocks To Buy On Global Economic Uncertainties,opinion,The global economic outlook remains lackluster  dragged down by a string of economic and political huddles  While most of the economic woes are tied to the ongoing U S  China trade war  political issues in many countries stem out of their respective government policies  Dampening growth in emerging economies also pose a threat  In such a scenario  one could focus on the U S  economy and domestic companies  which have been shielded so far to a large extent  Major Emerging Economies Aren t in Good ShapeEmerging economies that are taking a toll on global markets are China and India  China is a crucial market for companies worldwide  The trade conflict that started between the United States and China last year in July doesn t seem to have a definitive end Although latest  state that the two countries plan to go back to the negotiating table  China s economy has already been hurt by the incumbent tariffs  This slowdown in China s economy is affecting the purchasing power of its people  which in turn is resulting in lower demand Also  India is facing a rather sharp and persisting economic slowdown for the last 18 months  The reasons are decline in business confidence and consumption demand  record high unemployment  and introduction of the new goods and services tax that had compelled foreign institutional investors to pull money out from the Indian equity market and park them in safe havens like government bonds Growth in Eurozone is StalledGermany s economy is nearing an imminent recession  with business confidence in the country falling to its lowest level since November 2012  The economy contracted by 0 1  in Q2  and is expected to slow further in Q3  A major  for this slowdown is the U S  China trade war Secondly  the uncertainty hovering over Britain s policies ahead is already pulling down investment and GDP growth  The British economy sank 0 2  in Q2  dipping for the first time in seven years  If the United Kingdom parts with the European Union without a deal  the effect on UK s and the global economy would be vast Political   Economic Crisis WorldwideIn addition  an increasing number of countries have already stepped into recession or are at the brink of it  Prominent among these are Iran  Venezuela  Argentina  Turkey and South Africa  Growing unrest on the political front  increasing debt and economic uncertainties are a few reasons for the crisis faced by these countries U S  Economy Still Looks PromisingNo matter how much worrying the international economic and political scenario might be  the U S  economy appears as though it still has room to run Firstly  the U S  economy added as many as 164 000 new jobs in July  per the Labor department  Job growth across sectors was broad based  with professional and technical services  healthcare  social assistance and financial activities adding a decent numbers of new positions  July marked a record high total labor force of 163 4 million Secondly  wages also rose at an annualized basis of 3 2   Unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3 7  Lastly  consumer confidence also rebounded in July after sliding in June  The consumer confidence index rose to 135 7 last month  which is the highest level since November  It is notable that a glum global economic outlook and trade worries haven t affected consumer spending  which accounts for more than 70  of economic activity in the United States Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  chosen four domestic stocks that may be less affected by the economic and political crisis worldwide  You may consider adding these to your portfolio  All of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  Casey s General Stores  Inc

30410,251925,CASY,Can Brown Forman  BF B  Beat On Q1 Earnings Amid Tariff Woes ,opinion,"Brown Forman Corporation  is set to release first quarter fiscal 2020 results on Aug 28  before the market opens Notably  the leading producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages delivered positive earnings surprise in the last eight quarters  The company s average earnings beat in the trailing four quarters was 6 9  Brown Forman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement How Are Estimates FaringThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s fiscal first quarter earnings is pegged at 37 cents  which suggests a 9 8  decline from the year ago quarter s reported figure  Notably  the consensus mark has remained unchanged in the past 30 days  The consensus mark for fiscal first quarter sales is pegged at  772 2 million  indicating 0 8  growth from the prior year quarter s reported number Factors at PlayBrown Forman is witnessing a positive earnings surprise trend on its robust brand portfolio  expansion plans  product innovation and shareholder friendly initiatives  The company is experiencing solid improvement in underlying sales  owing to broad based growth across geographies and balanced contribution from brand portfolio  Its underlying sales improved for the 11th straight time in the last reported quarter Notably  the company is gaining from sustained sales growth in its portfolio of premium spirit brands  particularly bourbon and tequila  Additionally  international expansion for the Jack Daniel s trademark remains a major contributor to sales growth  These trends are again likely to aid the company s first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings and sales outcomes Additionally  we expect its continued focus on pricing  product innovation and expanding operations in emerging markets to boost operational performance and strengthen market position  This should reflect meaningful gains in the upcoming quarterly release While the company s top and bottom line performances have remained favorable in the past several quarters  retaliatory tariffs imposed on American spirits are affecting top and bottom lines to some extent  Further  higher tariffs and input costs have been denting the company s margin performance It witnessed impacts of cost of tariff on underlying net sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019  apart from impacts on cost of sales and gross margin  Underlying net sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 included negative impact of nearly one percentage point from lower net prices to distributors in certain markets to offset additional tariff related costs Additionally  the company s gross margin reflected impacts of tariff related costs in the last few quarters  In fiscal 2019  gross margin contracted 260 bps  of which decline of 160 bps was due to tariffs and most of the remaining was attributed to higher input costs  including agave and wood  Clearly  tariff related costs are likely to pose headwinds for the company s first quarter fiscal 2020 performance as well One key reason why tariff increases are largely hurting Brown Forman is its widespread presence in international markets  which significantly contributes to total sales  Further  the company produces most spirits in the United States  which is attracting larger exports to foreign lands  Notably  Brown Forman s products account for nearly 60  of the American whiskey business in Europe  resulting in large exports Consequently  the cost of tariffs on American whiskey implemented by the European Union in response to the U S  tariff increases is hurting Brown Forman s performance  Moreover  its American whiskey strategy mainly focuses on building a market for its super premium brands  such as Gentleman Jack and Woodford Reserve in Europe  With business in Europe being a large part of the strategy  it expects the tariffs implemented by the European Union to be a hindrance for its American whiskey strategy in the near term The sheer consequences of higher tariffs are reflected in the company s guidance for fiscal 2020  It expects gross margin for fiscal 2020 to be impacted by the persistence of tariffs and higher input cost related headwinds  This is likely to result in a 200 bps decline in gross margin in fiscal 2020  The company expects impacts of tariff related costs to persist throughout fiscal 2020  whereas it witnessed the same in seven months in fiscal 2019  Additionally  it expects higher input costs  primarily related to agave as well as ongoing wood inflation  to be an even greater drag on the gross margin in fiscal 2020  Backed by this bleak outlook for fiscal 2020  we expect visible impacts of the aforementioned headwinds in the fiscal first quarter In addition to tariff woes  Brown Forman s cross border presence exposes it to negative impacts of adverse currency rates  In fiscal 2019  unfavorable currency rates impacted net sales by nearly 2 percentage points and operating income by 3 points  Moreover  we expect these headwinds to continue in fiscal 2020  with the fiscal first quarter being no exception Nevertheless  the company remains confident that it will capitalize on its American Whiskey strategy while benefiting from investments in its brands  portfolio over the years  Amid tariff related woes  these positives can keep Brown Forman going A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not predict that Brown Forman is likely to beat earnings estimates in first quarter fiscal 2020  This is because a stock needs to have   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

30422,251937,CASY,Strong Retail Earnings Overshadow Yield Inversion  5 Picks,opinion,Wall Street overcomes concerns about government yield curve inversion buoyed by strong retail sector earnings  On Aug 21  the yields on 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasury Notes inverted for a brief period of time in the afternoon  Although  government yield curve steadied at closing  the yield inversion took place for the second time within a week  For many economists  yield inversion of the main yield curve is a clear signal of an upcoming recession Notably  on Aug 14  the yield inversion between the 2 year and 10 year bonds happened for the first time since December 2005  Wall Street saw a rout that day following the bond market development  However  on Aug 21  all the major stock indexes      the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite      rallied 0 9   0 8  and 0 9   respectively  Strong earnings results from several retailers boosted investors  confidence in risky assets like equities Strong Retail EarningsThe retail sector has so far reported strong earnings results for the second quarter of 2019  surprising several industry watchers  who were initially expecting weak performance from this sector  Several retailers have added value to their offering like giving more emphasis to ecommerce businesses  quick response and lowering delivery times  which helped them to report solid results On Aug 21  Target Corp    NYSE TGT    Lowe s Companies Inc    NYSE LOW   and The Home Depot Inc    NYSE HD   reported strong earnings results  which overshadowed the negative effects of yield curve inversion  Earlier  retail giants like Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT    The Est e Lauder Companies Inc    NYSE EL   and many other retailers reported better than expected results Robust Consumer SpendingThe most important positive feature of second quarter U S  GDP is that personal consumption expenditure jumped 4 3   the highest since the fourth quarter of 2017  after growing a mere 1 1  in the previous quarter On Aug 15  the Department of Commerce reported a 0 7  jump in retail sales in July compared with 0 3  in June and the consensus estimate of 0 2   Notably  online retail sales rose 2 8   Moreover  core retail sales  excluding sales at auto dealers and gasoline stations  increased 1  in July  surpassing June s rise of 0 3  and the consensus estimate of 0 4  The above scenario clearly shows that U S  consumer spending has remained robust so far in the third quarter after it rebounded in the second quarter  Notably  consumer spending constitutes around 70  of the U S  GDP  Therefore  strong consumer spending indicates that the U S  economy  which is currently in its record 11th year of expansion  will maintain momentum   Economy to Support Earnings in Near TermA strong labor market with impressive job additions and an unemployment rate at the lowest level in 50 year  steady growth of worker s productivity and consequently wages  and muted inflation  which stayed below Fed s target 2  level will act as catalyst for U S  consumers  going forward  Importantly  the year old trade dispute with China  which has worsened in May  failed to deter consumer confidence Moreover  recently released economic data such as durable goods orders  industrial production  and manufacturing and service PMI indicate that the fundamentals of the economy are not as bad as projected by some economists Likewise  expectation for second quarter earnings has gradually increased as against a contraction forecast at the beginning of the reporting cycle  A solid foothold in

30525,252040,CASY,Can Dollar Tree  DLTR  Q2 Earnings Beat Despite Soft Margins ,opinion,"Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   is slated to release second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Aug 29  before the market opens  In the preceding quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0 9   However  it reported earnings beat in two of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 0 4  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement How Are Estimates Faring The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s fiscal second quarter earnings is pegged at 86 cents  indicating a 25 2  decline from the figure reported in the year ago quarter  Moreover  the consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days  For quarterly sales  the consensus estimate stands at  5 72 billion  implying 3 6  growth from the prior year quarter number Dollar Tree  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors at PlayDollar Tree is going through a rough phase  which was clear from its soft bottom line results in the last reported quarter along with soft margins trend  The company posted dismal earnings in first quarter fiscal 2019  wherein the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and fell year over year  Moreover  it reported the fifth straight quarter of soft gross and operating margin due to persistent cost pressures arising from higher domestic freight and investments in store wages Notably  lower initial markup at Family Dollar  increased domestic freight and distribution costs  a decline in the Family Dollar segment and rise in occupancy costs related to increased rent expenses for Family Dollar stores scheduled to close in 2019 impacted gross margin in the last reported quarter  Further  higher SG A expenses  owing to operating and corporate expenses for the consolidation of store support centers  payroll costs linked to investment in store hourly payroll and higher legal fees  hurt operating margin in the same quarter  We expect the company s second quarter fiscal 2019 results to reflect pronounced impacts from the aforementioned costs  which should keep margins soft In addition to higher costs for the newly negotiated freight rates  the company expects that continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets  states increasing minimum wages and the completion of its ongoing initiatives will weigh on margins in fiscal 2019  Notably  Dollar Tree predicts domestic freight costs  as a percentage of sales  to increase in the first half of the fiscal year and then flatten out in the second half Moreover  the company narrowed its earnings view for fiscal 2019  after witnessing soft bottom line in the fiscal first quarter  It now estimates consolidated net sales of  23 51  23 83 billion compared with the previously stated  23 45  23 87 billion  Comps are anticipated to grow in a low single digit along with nearly 1  rise in square footage  Earnings are envisioned to be  4 77  5 07 per share compared with  4 85  5 25 stated previously The company s earnings guidance includes discrete expenses of about  95 million related to the Family Dollar store optimization initiative and store support center consolidation  Additionally  it includes  30 million  or 10 cents per share  store closure costs to be incurred in the fiscal second quarter as well as  15 million  or 5 cents per share  of import freight costs due to higher freight rates based on negotiations in April Moreover  the company estimates calendar shifts  relating to the anticipated six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas  to affect sales in the fiscal fourth quarter  The estimated softness in fiscal 2019 might also result from some weakness in the fiscal second quarter Additionally  the company s guidance reflects continued impacts of Section 301 tariffs of 25  on List 1  2  and 3 goods  However  it does not include the potential tariffs on List 4 goods  which  if implemented  may impact its business Though the company s near term view looks grim  its initiatives like Dollar Tree Plus  test and store optimization efforts are encouraging  Backed by a robust comps trend that reflects strength in Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners  the company is likely to gain significantly  Management expects store optimization measures to lift comps by up to 1 5   after its implementation by the end of fiscal 2019  These efforts should aid results in the long run A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict that Dollar Tree is likely to beat earnings estimates in second quarter fiscal 2019  This is because a stock needs to have   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Dollar Tree currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  11 48   which make surprise prediction unlikely  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Caseys General Stores  Inc    NASDAQ CASY   presently has an Earnings ESP of  8 43  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Target Corporation   NYSE TGT   currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 04  and a Zacks Rank  2 Burlington Stores  Inc    NYSE BURL   has an Earnings ESP of  1 13  and a Zacks Rank  2 at present Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than MarijuanaAmericans spend an estimated  150 billion in this industry every year  more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana Now that 8 states have fully legalized it  with several more states following close behind   Zacks has

as approximately 75  of the fuel sold at own stores Q4 Earnings Impress Wall StreetCASY stock soared over 10  on June 11 after reporting fourth quarter results that beat expectations Earnings of 68 cents per share easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents per share  while revenues of  2 178 billion climbed 4 3  year over year  Notably  same store sales increased 5 7  from the prior year period CEO Terry Handley attributed this recent growth to things like new store openings  gross profit margin expansion  and efficient management of the company s operating expenses  The entire team demonstrated a focused effort to drive the business forward while working diligently to build out new capabilities that will support future earnings growth   Handley said Casey s also launched its new e commerce site last quarter  as well as implemented a fuel price optimization platform in its stores  And in fiscal 2020  the company has plans to roll out a mobile app and in store order and price optimization systems CASY is On the MoveSince January  shares of CASY have jumped over 26  compared to the S P 500 s return of roughly 20  Earnings estimates have since been rising

for a broader retail sector stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep CASY on your shortlist   The Michaels Companies Inc  is a retail chain that specializes in arts and crafts  The company

Recollections  Studio Decor  Bead Landing  Creatology  Ashland  Celebrate It  Art Minds  Artist s Loft  Craft Smart  Loops   Threads  and Imagin8  Q1 Earnings   Guidance DisappointsLast month  shares of MIK fell over 16  when the company reported first quarter results and forward looking guidance that left investors wanting Earnings of 31 cents did meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate  but fell 21  year over year  Revenues of  1 09 billion came in just below our consensus estimate and declined 6  from the prior year period  Comparable store sales fell 2 9  primarily due to a decrease in customer transactions Despite Q2 earnings guidance falling in line with analyst projections  Michaels slashed its full year bottom line outlook from roughly  2 40 per share to  2 35 per share  The company still expects revenues of  5 21 billion for the year  While our first quarter results were within our range of expectations for the quarter  we are not satisfied and are taking steps to improve our performance   said Mark Cosby  Interim CEO On the call with analysts  Cosby commented that fixing Michaels  current issues will  take time   saying  The erosion of our value perception didn t happen overnight  and we know it will take time to win back the confidence of our customers  But we are confident that the steps we are taking to stabilize and improve our value perception will contribute to better performance in Q2 and the second half of 2019  Estimates Keep FallingAnalysts have since turned bearish on Michaels  with eight cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  Earnings are expected to remain flat for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 14 cents during that same time period from  2 49 to  2 35 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2021  Though earnings growth could bounce back into positive territory  our consensus estimate has dropped 15 cents in the past two months MIK is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Shares of the retailer have fallen over 30  since January compared to the S P 500 s gain of about 20  Bottom LineLooking ahead  Michaels will need to focus on improving customer support and bringing back the lost value that Cosby talked about on the conference call  Additionally  moving away from heavy promotion and discount marketing will also be key for the retailer If Michaels can figure out a way to improve its fundamentals going forward  it could potentially prove to be a real value for those bargain stock hunters  Shares are currently trading at only 3 7X forward earnings estimates Additional

30582,252097,CASY,5 Top Stocks To Buy As Retail Sales Defy Expectations,opinion,On Jul 1  the Department of Commerce released retail sales figures for May  which exceeded expectations by a wide margin  The report comes on the back of strong payroll numbers for June and an increase in inflation  Together  this bunch of bullish data has successfully addressed lingering concerns about the state of U S  economic expansion June marks the third consecutive gain for the retail sales metric  all of which have been rather substantial  This series of data indicates that consumer spending likely picked up in the second quarter after increasing at its most sluggish pace for the year in the January March period  With American consumers remaining confident  it makes good sense to invest in select retail stocks Sales Surge Marks Third Consecutive Increase In June  retail sales increased 0 4   blowing past the consensus estimate of 0 2   U S  consumers purchased more motor vehicles and a slew of other goods  including building materials and furniture  Auto sales advanced 0 7   identical to the increase experienced in May  Meanwhile  service station sales dropped 2 8   reflecting falling gasoline prices Retail sales also increased by 3 4  from the same period last year  Additionally  core retail sales  which exclude autos  gasoline  food services and building materials  increased 0 7   This metric  most closely corresponds to the consumer spending component of GDP  Core retail sales were revised upward for May to reflect a 0 6  increase rather than the previously reported 0 4    Nonstore Retailers  Restaurants Lead GainsIn June  online and mail order sales led the gains  increasing 1 7   which was in line with May s increase  This was closely followed by sales at food services and drinking places  which increased by 0 9   Miscellaneous store retailers also experienced a 0 6  uptick in sales Significant gains were also experienced in the health and personal care category  receipts for which increased 0 5   Sales for building materials  and clothing and accessories increased by an identical amount  Food and beverage stores  and furniture and home furnishing stores also witnessed a 0 5  increase in receipts Our ChoicesRobust retail sales numbers for June have successfully dispelled recent fears about the U S  economy  Strong consumer spending is now likely to extend the current economic expansion even further  The retail sector will gain significantly from such trends Investing in retail stocks looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning

30586,252101,CASY,Dodge Market Volatility With 5 Stocks Of Low Beta Value,opinion,It is a common belief in the investment world that only risky stocks generate high returns  However  this works well only during bullish market conditions In this article  we have developed a strategy that clearly shows that one can generate high returns from portfolios or securities with lower connection to market volatility Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months  You can see  Here are five of the 24 stocks that fit the bill Headquartered in Austin  TX  Chuy s Holdings Inc   NASDAQ CHUY   is among the leading operators of full service restaurants  Through 2019 and 2020  the company is likely to earnings growth of 6 8  and 8 9   respectively Casey s General Stores Inc   NASDAQ CASY    headquartered in Ankeny  IA  is primarily involved in operating convenience stores  The company managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the prior four quarters  For fiscal years 2020 and 2021  the stock is likely to see respective earnings growth of 6 9  and 6 4  Headquartered in Washington  District of Columbia  FTI Consulting Inc   NYSE FCN   primarily offers services related to business advisory  For 2019  the stock is likely to see earnings growth of 35 5  RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd    NYSE RNR    headquartered in Pembroke  Bermuda  is primarily a provider of products associated with insurance and reinsurance  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the prior four quarters  For 2019  the stock is likely to see earnings growth of 54 4  Kinross Gold Corporation   NYSE KGC    headquartered in Toronto  Canada  is mainly involved in exploiting and developing gold resources  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 66 7   For 2019 and 2020  the stock is likely to see earnings growth of 140  and 22 9   respectively You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading  Further  you can also create your own strategies and test them first before taking the investment plunge The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   ,2019-08-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dodge-market-volatility-with-5-stocks-of-low-beta-value-200454231,200454231

talking about hedge funds  but rather the huge institutions that manage billions or even hundreds of billions of dollars for pensions  municipalities  foundations  university endowments and other giant entities This is the investment realm where the managers don t care much about a flashy name or an exciting story  They care about returns  consistent  market beating returns  Although the objectives vary from fund to fund  they tend to have a relatively long time horizon and also to be fairly risk averse Because of their sheer size  small increases in returns over time translates to huge amounts of money   but of course  losses mean huge amounts of money gone  putting the fortunes of retirees  students and charities at risk   Conservative  investing is the name of the game Casey s General Stores operates roughly 2 100 convenience stores in 16 midwestern states  Though it s far from a glamorous  high tech story  87  of Casey s shares are held by institutions because the company consistently produces quality results  even as it expands While gasoline sales are the most visible part of the operation  it s the groceries  snacks and drinks that really drive profits  In the most recent quarter  fuel sales accounted for 64  of total gross revenues  but because of razor thin margins of just 20 cents gallon  7 3    fuels only contributed 23  of net revenues   after the cost of goods sold In comparison  Groceries sold at gross margins of 32  and Prepared Food and Fountain Drinks enjoyed gross margins of 64   With clean and inviting locations and its own lines of high margin food items  Casey s has become a go to spot for its customers to pick up their favorite beverage as well as breakfasts  lunches  and more  Today s Bear of the Day is an example of how even apparently well positioned US companies have suffered from the impact of the trade wars In the summer of 2018  Polaris Industries looked to be a winner in the tit for tat tariff battle between the US and international trading partners including Canada  Mexico  the EU and China  Polaris enjoyed a lower reliance than most of its competitors on imports for the source of raw materials as well as on exports for sales of finished goods When President Trump singled out US motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson for the decision to shift some manufacturing overseas to avoid tariffs  Polaris and its Indian brand of American made cruiser cycles looked poised to benefit from the resulting Harley boycotts Record low unemployment and rising average hourly wages also promised to support sales of Polaris  entire line of motorcycles  ATVs  snowmobiles and watercraft Unfortunately  the increase in sales never materialized and Polaris instead saw a sales slump in the second half of 2018 Motorcycle sales were especially disappointing  Harley Davidson did in fact lose significant revenues and ceded market share to Indian  but a decline in the industry as a whole still took a bite out of sales  Big motorcycles look to be falling out of favor with consumers as baby boomers age out of riding   flooding the market with lightly used bikes   and younger riders shift towards smaller lighter cycles  leaving cruiser manufacturers licking their wounds An ill advised investment in a three wheeled motorcycle called the Slingshot has likewise been a big disappointment for Polaris In fact  sales of all kinds of powersports equipment have been below expectations of just a year ago  Though it s difficult to hang the blame on a single factor  the continuing trade war with China is definitely playing a part  This is one of the vicious realities of trade disputes   even the companies who appear at first to be largely immune from the direct impact of tariffs and restrictive trade practices end up suffering eventually in indirect ways In the case of Polaris  the general slowdown caused by the trade war and the prospect of a global recession have had a chilling effect on customer s willingness to make large purchases  especially for leisure activities Though Polaris hasn t missed an earnings estimate in three tears  those estimates have been sliding lately as analysts revise downward  earning Polaris a Zacks rank  5  Strong Sell  3 Tech Stocks Under  10 to Buy NowAt Zacks  we try to avoid labeling stocks as  cheap  or  expensive   Instead  we opt to look beyond a stock s face value  and our system puts an emphasis on earnings estimate revisions to find stocks that will hopefully be winners for investors With that said  low priced stocks can still be attractive to investors as they present the chance to take a larger position in a company  which they might not be able to in higher priced stocks   When searching for these low priced stocks  we still look for similar trends in growth  value  and momentum  Then we apply the Zacks Rank to properly analyze the potential that these companies have  We are also aware of the latest sector trends and make sure to cover all of the hottest industries Today we ve highlighted three stocks that fall into the broad  technology  sector  Each of these three stocks is currently trading for less than  10 a share and holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  at the moment 1  Zix Corporation Prior Close   8 31 USDZix is an email security firm that specializes in data loss prevention  threat protection  email

terms of earnings beats  and shares are starting to behave as one might expect from a growth and momentum pick On top of that  MEET still looks pretty cheap at the moment  especially considering that it is profitable and is trading at 19 7X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 30X average  The Meet Group has also experienced strong upward earnings estimate revision activity recently that helps it earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  3  Identiv  Inc Prior Close   4 60      INVE is a security technology provider that caters to

30860,252375,CASY,Brinker s  EAT  Traffic Driving Efforts To Drive Q2 Earnings,opinion,Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT   is scheduled to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 29  before the market opens The company s ambitious expansion plans  along with sales building  digital  operational and remodeling initiatives  are likely to have favored top line growth in the fiscal second quarter while focus on franchising and other operational excellence may have driven earnings in the to be reported quarter The company has recorded earnings growth of 11 9   9 2   14 9  and 22 5  in the past four respective quarters  thereby  setting an upside trend  Moreover  the company s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in five of the trailing six quarters  the average beat being 7 2  Backed by this solid earnings trend  shares of Brinker have gained 21 5  over the past year  outperforming the  s 5 6  rally Let us delve deeper to find out how the company s results will shape up in the fiscal second quarter Sales Building Efforts to Drive Top Line GrowthBrinker remains steadfast in its goal to drive traffic and revenues through a range of sales building initiatives  These include streamlining of menu and its innovation  strengthening value proposition  better food presentation  advertising campaigns  kitchen system optimization  and the introduction of a better service platform Particularly  emphasizing on menu innovation to propel revenues  the company started a plan   Vision 2020   in 2016  focusing on menu innovation in Chili s  continuous improvement in service and atmosphere to differentiate the brand  and gain market traction to achieve long term earnings per share growth target of 10 15  Meanwhile  Brinker s remodeling efforts gained momentum  leading to improvement in sales  Notably  the company continues to invest in its reimage program  In fact  in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  it invested in a brand wide reimage program that will drive traffic and comps over the next three years  Brinker s remodeling initiative is thus expected to continue to invigorate its potential as a brand and augment guests  experience Backed by rigorous top line initiatives  Brinker witnessed 1 9  revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  This trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal second quarter as well  Subsequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at  778 8 million  reflecting 1 6  year over year growth Bottom line Picture ImpressiveIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Brinker recorded earnings growth of 11 9  year over year  Also  the consensus estimate pegs earnings at 89 cents for the fiscal second quarter  suggesting 2 3  growth from the year ago quarter  We believe that the company s earnings are favored by the focus on franchising Unlike most peers  Brinker used to focus on company owned restaurants to gain full control over its operations and profits  However  to survive in an industry that depends largely on franchising  the company started to pursue expansion through franchisees and partnerships  For instance  Brinker acquired 103 franchised Chili s Grill and Bar restaurants from Pepper Dining Holding Corp  in 2015  Notably  in fiscal 2017  Brinker s franchise operated locations increased 40   Strong growth should continue to boost top and bottom lines of the company What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not show that Brinker is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Brinker has an Earnings

30918,252433,CASY,TJX Companies  TJX  Boasts Solid Comps  Freight Costs High ,opinion,The TJX Companies  Inc    NYSE TJX   is grappling with high wage and freight costs as well as adverse currency fluctuations  In third quarter fiscal 2019  the company performed disappointingly  which has hurt investors  sentiment  A glimpse at this stock s price trend also reveals that it has underperformed the industry in the past six months  Shares of this Framingham  MA based company have lost approximately 5 2  compared with the  s 1 7  decline Nevertheless  the company s strategies to enhance brand performance across sales channels have been benefiting TJX Companies and aiding its comparable store sales  comps  growth  Further  the company is on track with merchandising and marketing strategies to boost revenues  That said  let s take a closer look at the factors impacting the company s performance Hurdles in TJX Companies  PathIncreased wage costs have long been a worry for TJX Companies  In the third quarter of fiscal 2019  the company witnessed escalated freight and supply chain costs  which along with other factors dented the gross margin  Wage increases and higher freight costs are expected to negatively impact earnings per share growth by 5  in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019  Moreover  the gross margin is expected to contract year over year in both the periods Also  TJX Companies provides goods at discounted prices  Notably  it has been selling coveted apparel brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Marc Jacobs at lower prices than those offered by others  Despite rising product costs  TJX Companies  being an off price retailer  cannot increase the price of its products  which might lead to lower margins Additionally  the company s solid international presence keeps it exposed to risks associated with adverse currency fluctuations  During the third quarter  net sales growth included a 1  adverse impact from currency movements  while bottom line growth was hit to the tune of 7   Further  foreign currency headwinds are expected to hurt net sales growth by 1  in the fourth quarter Can Efforts Aid a Turnaround TJX Companies  strong merchandising and brand strategies combined with effective marketing efforts have been fuelling top line growth  The company regularly opens stores and expands rapidly across the United States  Europe and Canada  While many retailers are resorting to store closures  TJX Companies added around 102 stores in the third quarter and plans to continue expanding its store base to about 6 100 stores in the long term Moreover  TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen e commerce business  TJX Companies  off price model along with its strategic store locations  impressive brands

loyalty programs  Incidentally  TJX Companies  aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums  TV  radio and social media  have been boosting traffic at its stores Apart from this  the company has been reporting positive comps for a while now  In the last reported quarter  TJX Companies  consolidated comps grew 7  year over year  fuelled by increased customer traffic at all segments  Management is particularly impressed with the performance of its largest division   Marmaxx  Notably  the third quarter marked the 17th straight period of high customer traffic for both Marmaxx and the company as a whole In fact  all the segments reported higher comps  courtesy of consumers  favorable response to the company s brands and impressive merchandise assortments at reasonable prices Further  management is optimistic about fiscal 2019 performance and focuses on implementing its sales initiatives to attract traffic  TJX Companies  stores are also expected to benefit from solid merchandise assortment and brands  Such upsides combined with a solid business momentum led management to raise its earnings guidance for the fiscal year Backed by these

30952,252467,CASY,Casey s  Hasbro  TD And E TRADE Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 5  2018    Casey s General Stores   NASDAQ CASY   as the Bull of the Day  Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on TD Ameritrade Holding   NASDAQ AMTD   and E TRADE Financial Corp    NASDAQ ETFC   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  Woof  After that rough day in the market I bet that most of you are wondering if the bear market is back  I don t believe it is  and neither do many investors who are astutely seeking opportunities  In a market like this  it s important to not just blindly throw money at stocks  Rather  you need to be calculated and buy based on fundamentals  Among those  earnings should be one of your main targets  And not just earnings in the form of a great P E valuation  but earnings growth  Today  I ve picked a Bull of the Day based on a strong earnings story Today s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Casey s General Stores  Casey s General Stores  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  operates convenience stores under the Casey s and Casey s General Store names  The company s stores offer a selection of food  including freshly prepared foods  such as pizza  donuts  and sandwiches  beverage and tobacco products  health and beauty aids  automotive products  school supplies  housewares  and pet supplies  and other nonfood items  Its stores also provide fuel for sale on a self service basis Casey s is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry that ranks in the Top 1  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is over the last 30 days  analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter and next year  The bullish sentiment has pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate from  1 57 to  1 62 for the current quarter while next year s number has gone from  4 89 to  5 03  Picking a Bear of the Day after the blood bath we ve seen in the market feels like kicking a dead horse  So many stocks were crushed in the aftermath of yesterday s selloff that it s easy to find one that s down in the dumps  That s not the purpose of the Bear of the Day  The purpose is to point out stocks that have seen earnings estimate revisions to the down side  While price is a fickle beast  earnings trends take a long time to develop  Today I m pointing out one of those negative earnings stories for our Bear of the Day Today s Bear of the Day is Hasbro  Hasbro  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  operates as a play and entertainment company  The company s U S  and Canada segment markets and sells action figures  arts and crafts  and creative play products  electronic toys and related electronic interactive products  fashion and other dolls  infant products  play sets  preschool toys  plush products  and sports action blasters and accessories  and vehicles and toy related specialty products  as well as traditional board games  and trading card and role playing games primarily in the United States and Canada Currently  Hasbro is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is the series of negative revisions over the last sixty days  Seven analysts have cut their estimates for the current year and next year  The bearish moves have cut the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from  4 72 to  4 22 while next year s number has come down from  5 38 to  5 09  That negative pressure has put the stock under some serious stress Additional content TD Ameritrade or E TRADE  Which Is the Better Stock Benefits from an improving economy and higher interest rates have positioned the investment bank industry well  As such  performance of investment banks  which are part of the Zacks Finance sector  was quite impressive in third quarter 2018 Therefore  we are focusing on two major investment banks  namely TD Ameritrade Holding and E TRADE Financial Corp   with market capitalization of  30 6 billion and  13 3 billion  respectively  Both are part of the same industry  which has a Zacks Industry Rank  59  top 23    Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 In the quarters ahead  both TD Ameritrade and E TRADE are expected to continue benefiting from increase in interest rates  TD Ameritrade carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while E TRADE sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here Though both investment brokers have similar business trends  an insight into the financials will help decide which investment option is better Price PerformanceBoth banks have outperformed the industry  down 15 8   year to date  witnessing stellar growth  While shares of TD Ameritrade have rallied 7   E TRADE has risen 6 7   So  TD Ameritrade has performed better than E TRADE  Dividend YieldBoth the companies have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments and share purchases to enhance shareholder value TD Ameritrade announced 43  dividend hike in October  Further  the company has a share buyback authorization in place  It has a dividend yield of 2 23  Recently  E TRADE initiated dividend payment  Further  the company has a share repurchase authorization in place  It has a dividend yield of 1 07  As visible in the above charts  TD Ameritrade has an edge over E TRADE  Not only is TD Ameritrade s dividend yield better than E TRADE but is also above the industry average of 0 89  Return on Equity  ROE ROE is a measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds  TD Ameritrade s ROE for the trailing 12 month period is 24 54  while that for E TRADE is 15 45  compared with the industry s level of 11 89   Therefore  TD Ameritrade reinvests its earnings more efficiently Earnings Estimate Revisions   Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings of TD Ameritrade has moved up 1  over the past 30 days  Meanwhile  the same for E TRADE has jumped 1 3  for this year during the same time frame Moreover  fiscal 2019 earnings for TD Ameritrade are projected to jump 18 9  year over year  For E TRADE  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 85 for 2018  reflecting a year over year increase of a massive 75 8  Hence  E TRADE reflects better earnings growth prospects Sales GrowthSales for TD Ameritrade for fiscal 2019 are projected to increase 8 1  year over year to  5 9 billion  For E TRADE  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 9 billion for 2018  indicating year over year growth of 22 1  Therefore  E TRADE has an edge here as well ValuationTD Ameritrade has a VGM Score of B  while E TRADE has a VGM Score of C  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  offer the best upside potential Therefore  TD Ameritrade holds an edge over E TRADE here Our TakeOur comparative analysis shows that E TRADE is better positioned than TD Ameritrade in terms of sales and earnings growth expectations  However  TD Ameritrade wins on price performance  reinvestment potential  dividend yield and valuation Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to

30988,252503,CASY,Holiday Retail Sales Off To A Strong Start  5 Great Picks ,opinion,Retail sales increased in November  indicating that holiday season buying was off to a stellar start  Further  the increase in retail sales for October was revised significantly higher  The jump in sales also dispelled lingering concerns about the state of the economy  They also indicate that fourth quarter expansion could exceed the initial set of modest projections A slide in spending at service stations was largely a result of a decline in gasoline prices  However  this was a positive development for consumers since it raised their purchasing power substantially  With only the first part of the holiday season out of the way  retail sales are set to remain robust over the next few months  This is why it makes good sense to invest in retail stocks at this time Strong November Sales Negate Slowdown FearsAccording to the Department of Commerce  retail sales increased 0 2  in the month of November  in line with the consensus estimate  More significantly  October s initial increase of 0 8  was revised upward to reflect an increase of 1 1   Taken together  these increases suggest that the economy has started the fourth quarter on a far stronger note than initially estimated Further  core retail sales  which exclude the impact of gasoline  automobiles  building materials and food services  increased 0 9   This is significantly higher than the 0 7  increase for October  which in itself has been upwardly revised  This metric closely corresponds to the consumer spending component of GDP The report will do much to dispel fears created by a yield curve inversion and heavy losses on Wall Street  Another factor negating economic concerns is the labor market s ruddy health  Last week s data on jobless claims shows that the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits has once again fallen to a 49 year low Sales on Track to Meet Holiday Season ProjectionsPer the National Retail Federation s  NRF  estimates  holiday retail sales for November and December are projected to increase between 4 3  and 4 8  year over year to between 717 45 billion and  720 89 billion  Incidentally  seasonally adjusted retail sales for October increased 0 7  on a monthly basis and were up 5  on a yearly basis This means that retail numbers for the first half of the holiday shopping season are on course to match the NRF s forecast  These figures exclude the impact of auto  gas station and restaurant sales Coming back to the Commerce Department numbers for November  unadjusted retail sales increased 4 2  year over year  Service station sales plummeted 2 3   the largest drop since 2017  According to the Energy Information Administration  gas prices have declined to 40 cents per gallon since October  leading to the slump in gas station receipts Headline sales numbers were powered by a 2 3  surge in online sales  Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores increased 1 2   Electronics and appliance stores reported a 1 4  rise in sales  Auto sales  which account for around 20  of all retail sales  inched up 0 2   Sales at department stores and miscellaneous store retailers each increased 0 4    Our ChoicesNovember s increase in retail sales indicates that consumer spending has retained sufficient steam during the fourth quarter  This in turn is being supported by a robust labor market with jobless claims falling to a 49 year low last week These trends are also likely to continue supporting the economy in the near term  This is why it makes sense to invest in retail stocks  especially the categories that have gained substantially last month  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Asbury Automotive Group  Inc    NYSE ABG   is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States Asbury Automotive carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a VGM Score of A  The

Warren Buffett was recently giving television interviews because Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  bought a 38 6  stake in Pilot Flying J travel centers  which is the largest travel center company in North America  with 750 locations and 27 000 employees 
When you heard the news  you might have been thinking   travel centers  That s so boring  
After all  this is a world filled with electric cars  1 hour home delivery  ride sharing  Airbnb  AI and social media 
What are the lessons value investors can learn from what Warren Buffett is buying 
3 Investing Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett
1      Boring is beautiful  Sometimes the  ho hum  companies are what turn out to be the cash generating superstars  Take Pilot Flying J  for instance  It s not just a travel center  but it also operates 279 restaurants making it the 10th largest restaurant franchise in America 
2     Buy companies that are profitable  Sounds simple  right  But many don t do it 
3     Buy building block companies  Buffett likes to buy companies that operate in the shadows that few people give a second thought to  Travel centers is one of those  A railroad is another 
Tracey thought about these lessons and then wondered  what stocks fit into these parameters right now 
There s not really a screen for stocks Warren Buffett would like that are building block companies  profitable and boring 
But she did find 5 stocks that have Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong  Buy    2  Buy  and  3  Hold  that fit into the parameters  Not all are classic value stocks  however  but they each fit into Buffett s lessons

3     Casey s General Stores  Nasdaq    NASDAQ CASY       operates small town convenience stores that sell gas and food in the Midwest  Because it operates in towns under 5 000  it often is the only pizza provider in town  As a result  it s now the 5th largest pizza chain in the country

31005,252520,CASY,Wal Mart  WMT  Hits 52 Week High  Grocery Stocks Follow,opinion,"Shares of Walmart   NYSE WMT   soared to a new 52 week high on Tuesday morning after the big box retailer provided strong new sales and revenue goals for fiscal 2019  This positive outlook helped send the rest of the industry  including Target   NYSE TGT   and Costco   NASDAQ COST    higher as well 
On the same day the retail giant hosts its annual meeting for the investment community  Walmart reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018 and announced a new share buyback program  What has investors more excited  however  is the fact that Walmart expects its net sales will grow around or above 3  in fiscal 2019  spurred by a 40  jump in U S  e commerce sales 
This push includes plans to add 1 000 more online grocery locations domestically  The retail giant  known for its sprawling and somewhat drab stores  wants to spend money to remodel stores and bolster its online presence over building new locations 
Instead of adding more locations at home  Walmart is set to open stores in new and growing markets abroad  The company expects to open less than 25 U S  stores total in fiscal 2019  while opening roughly 225 locations in faster growing regions  such as China and Mexico  The company is already offering one hour delivery from select Chinese locations 
 We re combining the accessibility of our stores with e commerce to provide new and exciting ways for customers to shop   Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement 
 We re proud of the progress we re making  We re equipping our associates with training and technology so they will continue to innovate in our stores  clubs and through e commerce to find ways to deliver an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers that is easy  fast  friendly and fun  
The new  longer term confidence from one of the biggest retail companies in the world based on a commitment to emerging markets and a heavy focus on online selling has helped renew many investors  confidence in the  250 billion company 
Walmart saw its stock price gain almost 2  premarket  and its shares have surged over 4 50  since then to touch a new 52 week intraday trading high of  84 46 per share 
Walmart s ability to pivot its business slightly to help fend off Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   push into every inch of retail  including the grocery business  has also helped pull the rest of the industry up on Tuesday 
Shares of fellow big box retailer Costco popped over 1 50   while Target stock climbed almost 2  
Smaller grocery chains also benefited from Walmart s announcement  Shares of Casey s General Stores   NASDAQ CASY   and Sprouts Farmers Market   NASDAQ SFM   both gained over 1   while Ingles Markets   NASDAQ IMKTA   jumped over 2 10   Weis Markets   NYSE WMK   and Smart   Final Stores   NYSE SFS   both saw their stock prices surge over 2

31095,252610,CASY,Are Traditional Convenience Stores Threatened By Amazon Go ,opinion," If you want to make money in this market  follow the customer     Jim Cramer
If survival of the fittest is the bid  then the buzzword  no cashier convenience store   is a serious threat to all traditional brick and mortar retail giants  While the concept takes us to the next level of retail shopping  it s also time that investors wake up to this reality and cash in on its prospects 
All About Comfort Buying
This new line of convenience stores introduced by e commerce giant Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   through its  Project Como  earlier this year has started to win attention  
And why not  Very subtly the concept addresses modern consumers  changing pattern of behavior  We are talking about that growing set of customers who are in the vicious cycle of taking up professional challenges to earn more money and ending up exhausted with no time for comfort or family 
Amazon Go at a Glance
Termed as Amazon Go  this no queue checkout counter grocery store is going to be a windfall for customers who are too worn out to stand in long lines at physical cash counters or are baffled at complicated self checking counters 
This convenience store will offer all kinds of perishable items and grocery essentials as well as drive up destinations where subscribers can pick up their orders and have them brought to their cars  All that s needed is the installation of the Amazon Go app to one s cell phone 
This  Just Walk Out technology  will automatically detect products picked up  And when shopping is complete  one can just leave the store  After a while  money will be charged online from the Amazon account of the customer 
What Investors Should Do
While the public opening of Amazon Go is scheduled for early 2017  the entire retail fraternity is keeping an eye on Project Como which has the ability to completely shatter the traditional brick and mortar convenience stores 
While apparently the retail grocery chain industry is expected to be gloomy over the next few months  there s a huge opportunity out there for the investors  So  instead of being myopic  you need to come out of your shell and bet on this trend changing consumer pattern  recognize stocks that will be affected the most and act ahead of the market  And it looks like a winning deal 
Once again coming to Jim Cramer s version of investing   I love behavior change investing  It can be incredibly lucrative  and when you have a behavior change theme you can use selloffs to pick stocks based on those changes  
The introduction of Amazon Go will hit hard Amazon s direct brick and mortar retail peer Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT    A number of other convenient store stocksare also at stake 
According to a Seeking Alpha article  this store roll out by Amazon will definitely impact convenience store chains such as Casey s General Stores  Inc    NASDAQ CASY    Murphy USA Inc    NYSE MUSA   and CST Brands  Inc    NYSE CST   as well as drug store chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ WBA    Rite Aid Corporation   NYSE RAD   and pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health Corp    NYSE CVS    
It will also create pricing pressure on sensitive grocery store chains like The Kroger Co    NYSE KR    SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   or Ingles Markets  Inc   NASDAQ IMKTA   
So  for investors who vouch on success stories as well as fundamental strength and growth trends of the premium retail market mammoths  there is a caveat  The growth curve of these companies may radically change in the coming days unless there is a massive makeover in their business models 
In fact  if we take a few stocks and judge their share price movement  we will get a rough idea on how the announcement of Project Como in April has already started to affect them 
Kroger  Since the beginning of April  share price of Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Kroger has declined  The stock is trading much below the Zacks categorized Food Drug Retail Wholesale industry  Year to date  the stock has lost 21 3  as compared to the broader market s loss of 0 7   We expect this trend to continue with the official launch of Amazon Go 

Rite Aid  The story is the same for retail giant Rite Aid  This stock traded neck on neck with the Food Drug Retail Wholesale industry till May 2016  However  it has underperformed the industry since then  With solid second quarter fiscal 2017 performance the stock again started to gain 
However  we believe the company s share price will take a beating once Amazon Go is introduced  Meanwhile we are on the sidelines on how beneficial Walgreens Boots  plan to acquire Rite Aid will prove for both the companies amid this doldrums  Rite Aid currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  

SUPERVALU  Grocery giant SUPERVALU which is already witnessing difficulties in producing revenue growth is expected to be hurt by Amazon Go   Since the announcement by Amazon  this Zacks Rank  3 stock has persistently underperformed the broader Zacks categorized Food industry having lost 11 48  compared to the 1 73  loss of the broader industry 

Walgreens Boots and CVS Health  While these two popular Retail   Pharmacies and Drug Stores companies  prescription drug business are expected to remain unscathed by Amazon Go  their over the counter  OTC  drug business is threatened  With Amazon s facility to pick physically and pay online  customers will definitely go for its drug stores instead of these traditional drug retail chains until some special facilities are offered 
Conclusion
The scope of long term growth is enormous for stocks that form an inherent part of lifestyle of new age consumers and evolve accordingly  We suggest investors to keep a tab on those stocks  This of course does not call for a complete overhaul of the existing portfolio as we still do not know how the traditional retail giants are preparing to brace themselves against the odds

CASY Technical Analysis

CASY opened trading yesterday at  116 80 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  116 37  CASY closed trading yesterday at  116 50 and crashed down after market to  112 00  equivalent to a 4  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time CASY traded below these levels we have to go back to May 3rd when it traded at  110 49 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down CASY had been in an overall upward trend dating back to March 9th when it traded at  108 02  CASY has a float of 38 78 million shares and traded 1 60 times the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see CASY open trading on Tuesday below  113 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 50 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

31100,252615,CASY,Grocery Stocks  KR  COST  Sink On Amazon Whole Foods Approval,opinion,"Shares of several grocery store chains  including Kroger and Costco  tumbled on Thursday after Amazon s purchase of Whole Foods became official 
Deal
The Federal Trade Commission  the online retail behemoth s purchase of the organic grocer  which was first announced in mid June  The FTC determined Amazon s acquisition passed U S  antitrust laws  shortly after Whole Foods  shareholders formally approved the  13 7 billion deal 
 Based on our investigation  we have decided not to pursue this matter further   the Commission said in a statement late Wednesday   Of course  the FTC always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted  
Initial Plans
Aside from adding roughly 470 organic grocery stores in North America and the United Kingdom to its ever growing list of diversified assets  Amazon wasted little time in making its initial Whole Foods plans known 
The Texas based chain grew in popularity because of its wide selection of natural and organic offerings  but they often came with steep price tags  So naturally  one of Amazon s first major steps  which will begin as soon as Monday  is to lower Whole Foods  prices and soon  it will make Amazon Prime the grocery store s customer rewards program 
 Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality   we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market s long held commitment to the highest standards   CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer Jeff Wilke said in a  
Lost In The Super Market
Whole Foods is far from the biggest grocery store chain in the U S   and its deal with Amazon will not change that at least not in the foreseeable future  But the FTC approval sent investors fleeing from grocery store stocks as long term disruption in the grocery sector seems possible  if not inevitable 
Shares of Costco   NASDAQ COST   fell by over 5  on Thursday  while Target    NYSE TGT   with its large grocery business  dipped by 3 99   Kroger   NYSE KR    which also owns multiple grocery subsidiaries  share prices tanked by 7 71  and nearly touched its 52 week low 
Less well known chains such as Casey s General Stores   NASDAQ CASY    Weis Markets  WMK   and Village Super Market   NASDAQ VLGEA   all saw their stock prices fall by over 1 60   Shares of Ingles Markets   NASDAQ IMKTA   fell by 3 54   while Smart   Final Stores   NYSE SFS   dipped by 2 76  
Sprouts Farmers Market   NASDAQ SFM   saw its stock price crash 6 95  and shares of SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   dropped by 6 60  
Whole Foods   NASDAQ WFM   stock gained 0 72   but Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   stock price took a hit and closed down 0 58  on Thursday  also read    
Bottom Line
Grocery Store chains don t likely need to fear for their short term stability or even viability  But  if the industry does not begin to make changes to their business models going forward  Amazon s Whole Foods and its new lower organic food prices could make life a lot harder especially if investors continue to flee the allies

31101,252616,CASY,Grocery Stocks Sink After Kroger  KR  Reports Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Kroger   NYSE KR   plummeted after the company reported its second quarter earnings on Friday morning  The grocery store giant s big profit decline helped send much of the rest of the grocery industry down as well 
Kroger s second quarter revenues jumped 3 8  to  27 6 billion  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  27 4 billion  The company s same store sales  excluding Kroger s fuel centers  gained 0 7   However  Kroger s profits sunk nearly 8  to  0 39 a share  which missed our estimate of  0 40 a share 
The biggest supermarket chain in the U S  saw its margins shrink due to increased competition from other grocers  which forced Kroger to cut prices 
On Friday  shares of Kroger dropped by nearly 10  to hit a new 52 week intraday trading low of  20 41  Kroger s stock price was already down almost 30  over the last year  But the grocery chain remained positive  at least in the short term  despite the increased pressure 
 As our business continues to improve  we remain committed to delivering on our guidance in 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018   Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement 
The bad news for Kroger is that it began slashing prices well before Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   acquisition of Whole Foods became official  And the e commerce giant s presence in the grocery industry might have contributed to Kroger s decision to stop providing long term guidance 
 In this dynamic operating environment  we will continue to provide annual guidance as we have done for many years but will no longer provide longer term guidance   McMullen continued 
Grocery Industry 
Amazon wasted little time lowering prices at Whole Foods  on everything from milk and cheese to meat  fish  and eggs 
On top of cheaper groceries  Amazon s move into the industry threatens to shake up how people shop in general  The undisputed online retail king s purchase of Whole Foods has the potential to shift grocery shoppers to online ordering and delivery much sooner than if they had moved into the sector on their own 
Kroger s disappointing second quarter results  along with the fear of increased competition from new players  helped send shares of Costco   NASDAQ COST   down over 2  on Friday  Shares of Target   NYSE TGT    which has a substantial grocery business  dipped by 3 68  
Shares of Casey s General Stores   NASDAQ CASY   and Ingles Markets   NASDAQ IMKTA   both fell by around 1 5   Sprouts Farmers Market   NASDAQ SFM   saw its stock price dip 2 1 
Weis Markets   NYSE WMK   stock sunk 4 77   while shares of Smart   Final Stores   NYSE SFS   and SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   plummeted 8 61  and 7 30   respectively 
Bottom Line
Not all grocery store chains need to fear in the near term  but if the industry does not begin to make changes to its business model soon  Amazon s Whole Foods deal could make life a whole lot harder

2     Buy companies that are profitable  Sounds simple  right  But many don t do it 
3     Buy building block companies  Buffett likes to buy companies that operate in the shadows that few people give a second thought to  Travel centers is one of those  A railroad is another 
Tracey thought about these lessons and then wondered  what stocks fit into these parameters right now

31113,252628,CASY,5 Dividend Growth Stocks Showering Shareholders With Cash,opinion,"One way to  is by checking the weekly list of dividend increases  I also find helpful to monitor the annual raises for dividend growth stocks that are on my list for further research  It is great to see companies I have bought reward me with rising dividend income many years after I had made the decision to invest in the first place 
With dividend growth investing  you do all the work in stock selection upfront  After that  a well diversified portfolio should shower its owner with a growing stream of dividend income for decades 
Over the past week  several companies raised their quarterly dividends  The companies include 
Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  operates as a general merchandise retailer  The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 7 10  to 60 cents share  This  has raised dividends for 49 years in a row  The ten year dividend growth rate is 19 60  year  Target trades at 13 20 times forward earnings and yields 3 50  
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH  operates as a diversified health and well being company in the United States  The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 25  to 60 cents share  This dividend stock has raised dividends for 7 years in a row  The ten year dividend growth rate is 62 10  year  Such a high rate of dividend growth is normal for companies in the first phase  UnitedHealth Group trades at 17 60 times forward earnings and yields 1 80  
 Casey s General Stores Inc   NASDAQ CASY   together with its subsidiaries  operates convenience stores under the Casey s General Store name in 14 Midwestern states  primarily Iowa  Missouri  and Illinois  The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 9 10  to 24 cents share  This dividend achiever has raised dividends for 17 years in a row  The ten year dividend growth rate is 17 30  year  Casey s trades at 20 50 times forward earnings and yields 0 80  
FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  provides transportation  e commerce  and business services in the United States and internationally  The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 60  to 40 cents share  This dividend achiever has raised dividends for 15 years in a row  The ten year dividend growth rate is 11 20  year  FedEx trades at 14 90 times forward earnings and yields 1   I have not been a fan of FedEx or rival United Parcel Services  NYSE UPS  due to the lack of growth in earnings per share over the past decade 
C  R  Bard Inc   NYSE BCR   together with its subsidiaries  designs  manufactures  packages  distributes  and sells medical  surgical  diagnostic  and patient care devices worldwide  The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 8 30  to 26 cents share  This dividend champion has raised dividends for 45 years in a row  The ten year dividend growth rate is 6 30  year  C  R  Bard trades at 22 20 times forward earnings and yields 0 50  
Sometimes  dividend increases also remind me of  I may have made  Mistakes of omission are situations where I have liked a certain company  but never really pulled the trigger on it due to stubbornness on my part  In retrospect it is easy to give myself a hard time  since I have over eight years of experience in writing and analyzing dividend growth stocks  Some of the lessons I have learned after those years are easy see in retrospect 
One such mistake is C  R  Bard  which has always had a low current yield  However  the company has consistently been able to grow earnings and dividends  and delivered exceptional returns to its shareholders  Earnings per share went from  2 55 in 2006 and are scheduled to exceed  10 in 2016  The reason I never bought the stock was due to the low current yield  Please learn from my mistake and do not forget the  growth  part of the dividend growth strategy

31212,252727,CASY,Casey  General Stores  At The Bat,opinion,"The story goes that that the Muddville 9 were losing by 2 runs heading into the bottom of the last inning  With two men on base in scoring position  Mighty Casey  the confident star player comes up to bat  He lets two pitches go by for strikes  sure he only needs one pitch  Then when the third pitch comes flying in he swings and misses  The Muddville team loses   There is no joy in Muddville   mighty Casey has struck out  

The poem    was popular over 125 years ago  Casey failed then  But Caseys General Stores Inc  NASDAQ CASY  has another opportunity now How will it end this time 



The chart above shows the run up from September through January in Caseys stock price  Since then though the stock pulled back just over 50  of the move up before basing and then moving back higher  On a broad scale  this establishes a possible AB CD pattern that would target a move over 107 by mid September  Strong and confident with a bullish RSI and a rising MACD  like Casey of 1888 
But its the shorter timescale that brings the poem to mind  Anything can happen in any at bat even though the sum total over a season is great  The stock potential to 107 is like that  but with the current  at bat  the Hammer that formed in the bull flag as it hit interim resistance at 92  A lot of room to the upside  but will Caseys strike out trying to break that flag this at bat  Look for 90 90 as a first step and then a move over 92  The company reports earnings next June 8th before the open  If Caseys strikes out this time  perhaps that at bat will be the one

31213,252728,CASY,Currency Wars Take Spotlight,opinion,"Much ado was made of China s surprise 3  devaluation of their currency last week  But keep in mind  the yuan is pegged to the dollar  and with the dollar so strong  every major floating currency and commodity is down a lot more than that  Deflation is now a real threat  Then  there is the suddenly resolved issue of Greece s debt  along with the worry of a domino like fall of the entire Eurozone   Also  with earnings season drawing to a close  it is evident that both revenues and earnings are down from the same quarter last year  and yet about 70  of S P 500 companies beat earnings expectations  albeit at a lowered bar   Overall  the lack of revenue growth combined with relatively high equity valuations  P E multiple around 17x on the S P 500  seems to indicate little room for stock price appreciation through rising multiples 
Yes  mixed signals abound  paralyzing investors  It can be hard to gauge which crisis is truly relevant and which is not  Nevertheless  equity valuations are not irrationally exuberant and given that stocks tend to price expectations for six months out  there is optimism that GDP and revenue growth will accelerate in the coming quarters  Moreover  where else are you going to invest your liquid assets  So  equities are neither selling off nor breaking out  and thus we continue to plod along with this historically lengthy consolidation period 

In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 

Market overview 

As the world s largest manufacturing nation  China consumes and stockpiles commodities of all sorts  so the threat of a slowing of its growth has hurt commodity prices  which were already falling due to the stronger dollar  China has long pegged its currency to the dollar  which was fine while the dollar was weak  but in this new strong dollar era  The China Miracle of hyper growth was suddenly threatened  and thus they felt the need to manually do what the market cannot  For comparison  over the same period  since 10 31 2014  that the yuan has fallen  3 5   the yen is down more than  17   the euro  16   the Canadian dollar  16   and the peso  20  

No  despite what the doomsayers would have you believe  the dollar s status as the world s reserve currency isn t going away anytime soon  In fact  its strength becomes self perpetuating as it becomes even more of a magnet for plentiful global liquidity looking for both safety and stability  i e   both return of capital and return on capital  

China  on the other hand  seems to be suspected by both the Chinese and global investors to be a house of cards  kept aloft by unbridled growth magically engineered by the political elite  producing massive amounts of cash for the well connected in search of safe haven investments abroad   And there is certainly no shortage of young Chinese students driving Maserati s while attending California colleges   Much of this cash is flowing into U S  Treasuries and real estate 

Witness the 10 year Treasury yield closing Friday at 2 20  and the 30 year at 2 84   The Fed finds itself in the awkward position of desperately wanting to begin the process of normalizing the short term fed funds rate  but risking further strengthening of the dollar  to the detriment of corporate earnings and commodity prices  and further flattening the yield curve   Of course  the Fed holds over  2 trillion in long dated bonds and notes from its QE programs that could be unwound if necessary to push up those longer term yields  After all  those assets will need to be unwound eventually  

As you recall  last fall Japan launched into an aggressive QE that quickly led to a global currency war  race to debase  and to other central banks  policies that tend to overshoot their intended targets  In turn  global stock investors have responded by driving up equity prices by huge amounts in their local currencies  Winners have included stock markets in China  Ireland  Denmark  Israel  Japan  Hungary  Italy  Germany  France  Netherlands  and Belgium  while the losers have included stock markets in Saudi Arabia  Canada  Thailand  Chile  Australia  Mexico  Indonesia  Greece  Brazil  and Colombia  Notably  Russia has seen mixed returns  with equity markets up  18  in local rubles but down  25  when converted to US dollars  as the ruble has weakened by about 43  against the dollar since the new currency wars essentially began on 10 31 2014  

How does this all impact us here in the U S   Of course  as consumers  our strong dollars are buying a lot more on the world scale  Commodity prices  including oil  of course  are low  and imports are increasingly affordable  But the flip side is that our large multinationals are struggling with the headwinds of selling into overseas markets  with revenues in local currencies being repatriated into fewer dollars  which inhibits top line growth 

On the other hand  small caps that sell mostly into domestic markets can thrive  at least in theory  The problem  however  is that the economy is broad and intertwined  and large cap multinationals that use small cap vendors may choose to cut back on purchases  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  is one example  and concerns about its sales into China has pushed down some terrific semiconductor firms like Sabrient favorites Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS   Avago Technologies  NASDAQ AVGO   and Qorvo  NASDAQ QRVO   which are some of its top suppliers  So  things are not so clear cut  You still have to pick and choose 

The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last Friday at 12 83  and remains well below the 15 fear threshold and well below the 20 panic threshold that has held as resistance throughout the summer  There s no immediate indication of imminent panic selling  but also no apparent catalyst to turn such complacency into higher prices 

Furthermore  with market leadership and breadth so narrow  the need for skilled stock picking from among the highest quality companies is paramount   that is  those having a solid business model  products that dominate their space and a strong product pipeline  improving margins and organic growth  and attractive forward valuation for strong  and realistic  growth expectations  as well as solid earnings quality and conservative accounting practices  including strong balance sheet  free cash flow  and cash on hand 

On that note  last week we launched our first mid year version of our Baker s Dozen top picks list based on our proven growth at a reasonable price  aka  GARP  model  Like the January portfolio  which we have been publishing since 2009   it is being offered as a unit investment trust by First Trust Portfolios 

SPY chart review 

The SPDR S P 500 Trust  NYSE SPY  closed Friday at 209 42  The long standing bullish uptrend line shown  which has essentially been in place since late September 2011  has given way as of the end of June  with a brief attempt in July to recover it  Now it appears to be forming something of a neutral pennant  with a new breakout or breakdown likely imminent  The 50 day and 100 day simple moving averages have converged around 210  and the 200 day is not far below near 208  Friday provided a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern  but oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic remain in a somewhat neutral position that still could go either way  Major support is just below at the critical 200 day SMA  which is still rising bullishly   followed by recent support around 204 205  then round number support at the 200 price level  This historic sideways consolidation period  ever since the February bounce to new highs  appears to be bounded by 204 205 on the bottom and 212 214 at the top  and so price remains right in the middle with no clear indication as to direction  My guess would be to the upside 



After peering over the edge of a mighty cliff  the small cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  offered up a bullish engulfing candle on Friday  and oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastics are all pointing up bullishly  indicating that we might see a bounce up to retest support turned resistance at the 200 day SMA 

Latest sector rankings  

Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 

In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 

Outlook score is forward looking  while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 


Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 

1  Healthcare remains in the top spot with an Outlook score of 83  primarily due to highly favorable sentiment among Wall Street analysts  net upward revisions to earnings estimates   solid return ratios  and a strong forward long term growth rate  although its forward P E remains pricey  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  moves into second place with a score of 64  but it is tightly bunched with Financial and Utilities with scores of 63 and 62  Technology rounds out the top five  and these are the only ones scoring above 50 

2  Energy remains at the bottom with an Outlook score of 6  Energy scores poorly in most factors of the GARP model across the board  In particular  Wall Street continues to slash estimates  and yet the sector still displays by far the highest forward P E and a negative forward long term growth rate  Basic Materials takes the other spot in the bottom two with a 26  Even though the sector displays one of the lowest forward P Es  Wall Street continues to slash forward earnings estimates as commodity prices continue to struggle 

3  Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial displays the top score of 58  followed by Healthcare and Technology  Energy saw its Bull score jump to 57  Utilities is the lowest at 47  The top bottom spread is only 11 points  still reflecting high sector correlations on particularly strong market days  i e   broad risk on buying   It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 

4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the top score of 67  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Basic Materials scores the lowest at 41  The top bottom spread is a robust 26 points  which reflects quite low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  which is good  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 

5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities scores the highest  but Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  is close behind and has the best Bull Bear balance  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Basic Materials is by far the worst 

6  After looking defensive last week  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings appear to be back to neutral  Although all weather Healthcare tops the list  with defensive sectors Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  also in the top four  Financial is clawing its way back up  Basic Materials and Energy are mired at the bottom due to expected persistence of low commodities prices  It looks like a 3 tier ranking  with Healthcare by itself at the top  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 

Stock and ETF Ideas 

Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   still reflects a neutral bias and suggests holding Healthcare  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Financial  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below its 50 day but still above its 200 day simple moving average  

Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Healthcare  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Financial sectors include iShares Global Healthcare ETF  NYSE IXJ   PowerShares DWA Consumer Staples Momentum Portfolio  NYSE PSL   and First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund  NASDAQ QABA   Notably  the two equity ETFs with the highest Outlook scores in our system are both heavily weighted in airlines   the SPDR S P Transportation ETF Trust  NYSE XTN  and the US Global Jets ETF  NYSE JETS  

For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Healthcare  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Financial sectors include United Health Services  NYSE UHS   Hospira  NYSE HSP   Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL   Casey s General Stores  NASDAQ CASY   Signature Bank  NASDAQ SBNY   and Home Bancshares  NASDAQ HOMB  

If you prefer to take a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Industrial  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model continues to suggest holding Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare  in that order 

IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

31214,252729,CASY,4 GARP Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio Returns,opinion,"If you re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing  try out the GARP strategy which targets growth at a reasonable price  Rather than investing in both value and growth stocks like blend investors do  investors following GARP would love to invest in undervalued stocks that offer solid growth prospects too 
This strategy is best suited for an environment where major benchmarks are witnessing a strong rebound in the latter half of a particular time frame after plunging in the first half 
GARP  Best of Value   Growth Investing  
Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing  the ideal range of these metrics are different from what value and growth investing consider  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not 
In case of P E ratio  investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors  However  they avoid picking companies with extremely high price to earnings ratios  On the other hand  like value investors  GARP investors give precedence to low P B ratios  A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks 
The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years  Unlike growth investors  GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy 
Return on equity  ROE  is another growth metric used in GARP strategy  This strategy considers those stocks that have higher ROE compared to the industry average as strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks   
In order to make GARP strategy more profitable  we have only considered those with a favorable Zacks Rank as well as good value and growth scores  Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
Screening Parameters
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  
  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  
  Value and growth scores less than or equal to B Value as well as growth scores of either  A  or  B  indicate that the stock is poised to offer the best of both worlds
