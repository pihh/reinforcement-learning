2315,223830,CVCY,The Dis Uniting Of America,opinion,We come together as Americans when confronting common disasters and common threats  such as occurred in Boston on Monday  but we continue to split apart economically  Anyone who wants to understand the dis uniting of America needs to see how dramatically we re segregating geographically by income and wealth  Today I m giving a Town Hall talk in Fresno  in the center of California s Central Valley  where the official unemployment rate is 15 4 percent and median family earns under  40 000  The so called  recovery  is barely in evidence  As the crow flies Fresno is not that far from California s high tech enclaves of Google  Intel  Facebook  and Apple  or from the entertainment capital of Hollywood  but they might as well be different worlds   Being wealthy in modern America means you don t come across anyone who isn t  and being poor and lower middle class means you re surrounded by others who are just as hard up  Upward mobility   the old notion that anyone can make it with enough guts and gumption   is less of a reality  The  in America will become a poor adult is higher now than it was 30 years ago  and higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom  which has a long history of class rigidity   is in now in poverty  but you wouldn t know that in Washington  where our representatives are now busily cutting safety nets children depend on  or in many state capitals that continue to slash budgets for education and social services  Many of America s wealthy don t see why they should pay more taxes to support the less advantaged because they have no idea what it means to be less advantaged  while many in America s middle class can t afford to pay more because their real wages continue to decline  Our thoughts turn to Boston   as they should  But Fresno and other places like it across America remain ignored ,2013-04-18,Robert B.

2317,223832,CVCY,Is Central Valley  CVCY  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Central Valley Community Bancorp   NASDAQ CVCY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Central Valley has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 89  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 28  While Central Valley s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 13 84 over the past five years  it stands well below the highs for the stock  indicating scope for entry  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 77  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should point out that Central Valley has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 46  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Central Valley s P CF ratio of 9 53 is much lower than the Zacks Banks West industry average of 15 86  which indicates that the stock is quite undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Central Valley currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Central Valley a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Central Valley might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives CVCY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite mixed at best  The current quarter estimates have seen one downward revision with no upward revisions in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revision This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 5 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen 2 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Central Valley Community Bancorp Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCentral Valley is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 39  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  Further  over the past two years  the industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

2318,223833,CVCY,Why Central Valley Community  CVCY  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report  Consider Central Valley Community Bancorp   NASDAQ CVCY    a firm in the Banks   West industry  which could be a great candidate for another beat This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  In fact  in these reports  CVCY has beaten estimates by at least 10  in both cases  suggesting it has a nice short term history of crushing expectations Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago  CVCY expected to post earnings of 31 cents per share  while it actually produced earnings of 40 cents per share  a beat of 29   Meanwhile  for the most recent quarter  the company looked to deliver earnings of 32 cents per share  when it actually delivered earnings of 36 cents per share  representing 12 5  positive surprise Central Valley Community Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise   Thanks in part to this history  recent estimates have been moving higher for Central Valley Community  In fact  the  for CVCY is positive  which is a great sign of a coming beat After all  the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus  looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late  suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This is the case for CVCY  as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of  56 1   so another beat could be around the corner This is particularly true when you consider that CVCY has a great Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile  You can see  When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP  of the time  so it seems pretty likely that CVCYcould see another beat at its next report  especially if recent trends are any guide 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia  AIDS  muscular dystrophy  hemophilia  and other conditions New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline  Early investors could realize exceptional profits ,2018-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-central-valley-community-cvcy-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200278382,200278382

Though Central Valley might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives CVCY a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while current year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 12 8  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has nudged up 1 3   in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Central Valley Community Bancorp Price and Consensus   Due to this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCentral Valley is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 21  out of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2019-10-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-central-valley-cvcy-stock-now-200478954,200478954
