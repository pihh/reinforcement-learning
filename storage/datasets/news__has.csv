Chris Hill  It s Wednesday  January 15th  Welcome to Market Foolery  I m Chris Hill  With me in studio  Mr  Bill Barker  Thanks for being here 
Bill Barker  Thanks for having me 
Hill  Earnings season  I wouldn t say it s heating up  but it s getting started  We re going to get into a little bit of earnings  We ve got some more holiday sales  And we ve got some CEOs to discuss  But let s start with Goldman Sachs  because shares of Goldman Sachs are hitting a 52 week high this morning after fourth quarter revenue came in just shy of  10 billion  That is 23  higher than a year ago  It was not all sunshine and rainbows for Goldman Sachs  though  because on the downside  they have a legal bill somewhere just north of  1 billion that they re paying  Is that run of the mill legal stuff  Or is there some big thing going on with them where they need more lawyers than usual 
Barker  Yeah  it s the 1MDB  whatever the acronym is for that scandal  When you say that it s hitting a 52 week high  it sounds like this is mostly a sunshine and rainbows story  Just looking over where Goldman has been and how the stock has done  this is a company that  it s underperformed over the last 3   5   10   and 15 year periods  Now  you go back 10 years  you re still heavily in the financial crisis era  so underperforming the market by nearly 10  a year over that period of time might be the effect of where the stock was  But this has really not been something thing that has benefited shareholders over the long term  I would say the miss on earnings was attributable in part to a higher compensation ratio  What Goldman Sachs has done well is compensate its employees  more so than its shareholders  and also its litigants now  too 
Hill   laughs  So you re saying  if you work for Goldman Sachs   
Barker  It s been a good 10  15 years   laughs 
Hill     either as a lawyer or some other type of job  then you re probably happier than the average shareholder who has owned this stock for the past 5  10 years 
Barker  It was Michael Lewis  friend of yours  close personal friend of yours   
Hill  Not a close personal friend  Someone I ve interviewed a few times 
Barker  And it s been friendly 
Hill  Yes 
Barker  The interviews have been friendly 
Hill  Well  he s a friendly guy 
Barker  Yeah  So  he s a friend of yours  in a sense  Anyway  he wrote back in the day  I believe in Liar s Poker  that Goldman Sachs and other bond traders were in the blessed part of the economy of people who could charge whatever they wanted for their services  I mean  it was a pithier line than that  but that summed it up  He  having worked there  and having succeeded  as that being his first job out of college   
Hill  Was he at Goldman  I thought it was at Salomon Brothers 
Barker  Oh  he was at Salomon Brothers  Now I ve messed up the whole story by misusing facts 
Hill  I would say we ll edit this out  but I think longtime listeners know we re not editing this out 
Barker  No  I mean  I ve corrected you a few times  You ve let me correct you  So  yes  you re right  But it s the same category  the employees of Salomon back in the day  Goldman  up to present  of well compensated people whose compensation did not make sense to Michael Lewis based on the work that he was doing for them 
Hill  But it s nice work if you can get it  You can charge whatever you want 
Barker  Well  it s the compensation part  Now  there are long hours  Don t want to make it seem like there is a free lunch for that  But nevertheless  again  compensation was part of the equation here on the missed bottom line 
Hill  It really does seem like  when you step back and you look at Goldman Sachs and the other big investment banks    you can throw Citigroup in there  Bank of America  whoever else you want    investors  if they re interested in owning shares of some business in the financial industry  that you really are better off  not just from a clarity standpoint  because you can understand businesses like Visa and MasterCard with greater clarity than you can with investment banks like Goldman Sachs  because there s always that black box quality to their earnings  but you do better as a shareholder  It s not just   Oh  I can understand this business better as a nice little bonus   You d much rather have been a shareholder of Visa or MasterCard over the past 5  10 years than of Goldman Sachs 
Barker  Yeah  Goldman is addressing that  in part  I think they re having their first investor day in a couple of weeks where they re going to go over financial targets and try to correct the black box ness of their model  which has mostly been to just say   Look  we re doing our thing  Don t ask us a lot of questions  
Hill  I m not going to hold my breath on that one  I m not going to hold my breath on the Goldman Sachs investor day being some amazing amount of sunshine into how they do business 
Barker  But I bet the food s good 
Hill  Oh  yeah  the food s probably great  Yeah 
Shares of Target down 7  this morning  CEO Brian Cornell called Target s holiday sales disappointing and said  and I m quoting   The company faced challenges throughout November and December in key seasonal merchandise categories   I m a little surprised by this  for a couple of reasons  The larger one being that Target has been a very good operator in the retail space over the past year or so  The second  more specific reason is that going into the holiday season  if you were going to bet on any retailer when it came to toys  you were going to bet on Target  They were opening the mini Disney shops within some of their locations  They were powering the Toys R Us website  If anyone was set up to succeed with toys  it was Target  So the fact that toys were one of the areas where they had disappointing results  that s a little surprising 
Barker  Well  you may be right to have bet on Target if you were going to bet on toys  because the data that they shared was  for the month  toys were approximately flat year over year  but that still represented market share gains  So they were doing better  according to their numbers  which are taken from the industry trade group on toy sales  than the competition  Not by a lot  but they took a little bit of market share  You re seeing Hasbro get hit by this report as well  because the implication here is  if you re flat and you re getting market share  then the total number for toys is down year over year  and that includes not a lot of inflation but a little bit of inflation  so that is not a good sign for Hasbro  And I think everybody s just lamenting the fact that baby Yoda wasn t out there 
Hill   laughs  It really does seem like a miss  It seems like an avoidable miss 
Barker  But here we are  talking about it  We re just giving more fuel to The Mandalorian by talking about   Wow  think of the baby Yoda toys you could have sold   And now  people who are listening are thinking   I have to go watch The Mandalorian   That s the only way to get any baby Yoda  which everybody wants 
Hill  You know what  All evidence to this point is that a lot of people have already watched The Mandalorian and have seen baby Yoda  Worth pointing out that Walmart shares are down a little bit  You mentioned Hasbro being down  Best Buy shares are down on no news  Walmart is down on no news  It s  I m assuming  related to Target being as big as it is and having this kind of   it s not a big stumble  but it s enough of a stumble  When the CEO comes out and says   This is disappointing   then I think it s reasonable to see a little bit of a sell off  But I m now even more interested to see what Walmart s holiday sales look like when they announce them 
Barker  Yeah  The category breakdown that was provided in the November December comp sales by Target showed electronic sales down 6   No surprise that Best Buy is going to be down on that news  Other things were up  It s a diversified business in the sense that there are a lot of different categories there  Beauty was up 7   apparel was up 5   Those numbers aren t too bad  You re not seeing apparel retailers getting clubbed today  But they were exposed to all the different categories  Some were up  some were down  The thing is  Target is down  the stock is down 7   something like that  at the moment  It s still up 75  over the last 12 months  More than doubled from the Christmastime lows of last year  So  all right  stock takes a little bit of a breather 
Hill  Well  and also  Jim Mueller and I talked about this the other day  comp sales to this point are still positive  The expectation ws that it was going to be north of 5   instead  it s like 1 5   Target did reiterate  they expect to have their 11th straight quarter of sales growth  That s probably going to hold up  But  as Jim Mueller and I were talking about the other day  even just from an optics standpoint  there s a difference between   Well  we were expecting comps near 6   Instead  they re at 1 5    That still is better than   We were expecting comp sales of plus 3   They re going to come in negative 2    When you go from positive to negative  it s just worse than the actual number 
Barker  Yeah  And the details are interesting here  of course  I think the broader story  they talked about their digital sales  comparable digital sales up 19  year over year  So it s a part of the larger story that people are getting more online  less in person  or  if they are in person  they re doing it through order online  pick up in store  that sort of thing  So Target is making the right transitions  But it is hard being a retailer 
Hill  We talked about this on Motley Fool Money last week  We got an email question from a listener  You get the chance to shadow a CEO for a month  Who do you choose and why  Emily Flippen talked about Jack Dorsey  because she said   I feel like I would get to study two companies in Twitter and Square   Andy Cross talked about Elon Musk  Ron Gross mentioned Warren Buffett  Who would you shadow if you got the chance 
Barker  Well  first  I m just trying to figure out whether to take the bait on the respective size of living space 
Hill  No  no  Don t take the bait  Be bigger than that  Be bigger than me 
Barker  I m leaning toward being bigger than that 
Hill  That s the move 
Barker  But I m working through where to go with that in my mind 
Hill  Let s move on  Listeners will know you re the bigger man 
Barker  I ll probably work something in along the way here  I ll try to be subtle about it  Who d you go with  I m putting you on the spot 
Hill  I didn t mention anyone on Motley Fool Money  but in thinking about this   
Barker  Are you now thinking about it for the first time 
Hill  No  I m thinking about it for the second time  I thought about this earlier today  The first person who popped into mind was Kevin Johnson from Starbucks  But if I followed him around for a month    first of all  if I got to shadow a CEO  they would need to be very patient and indulge lots of questions from me  And so I m worried that if I shadow Kevin Johnson at Starbucks  a stock that I have owned for 20 years and business that I love  I feel like pretty much every day  I would not be able to stop myself from asking him about the food  Just asking questions about   Really  what s with the food  What else have you tried  What are you working on  What s in the lab  Don t tell me about the Roastery  I m not interested in the Roastery   Once  we can go by the Roastery and check it out  but I m more interested in the food  And I think he d get sick of me pretty quickly 
So  the other two people I thought of were Jeff Bezos    because I feel like Bezos would be an exercise in both retail  studying retail  but also how he views the future  And the other one    I don t own shares of Ulta Beauty  but the job that Mary Dillon has done leading Ulta Beauty is one of the most impressive bits of corporate leadership I ve seen in the last few years  Because  as you said about Target  retail is hard  and Ulta Beauty is an amazing business succeeding  in terms of traditional bricks and mortar store count  they also have the membership model  I feel like  in terms of learning  I think I would learn a lot from Mary Dillon  and hopefully I wouldn t bug the hell out of her in the way that I absolutely would bug the hell out of Kevin Johnson 
Barker  So you re weighing it based on how annoying you would be to respective CEOs 
Hill  That s part of my calculus  yeah  Really  with Kevin Johnson  every single day  at some point  we d be talking about food 
Barker   Have we talked about food today  Kevin   He s like   You want to get lunch   You re like   No  Not at Starbucks  no  
Hill   No  I d like to revisit the La Boulange incident  the acquisition of La Boulange  the promises that were made  and the ultimate failure of that  
Barker   And can we talk about Krispy Kreme no longer being available  What s up with that  
Hill  Yes  And he would rightfully say   You know I wasn t CEO then   I know 
Barker  Krispy Kreme still exists  though  and you could partner with them  What about that  Ask every day 
Hill  Yeah 
Barker  About how many donuts do you eat in a year 
Hill  In a year 
Barker  Yeah 
Hill  I would say less than 200  I was going to say less than 300  but probably less than 200 
Barker  Over under line is like 185 
Hill  Hold on a second  Are we counting Munchkins  Are we saying  if you eat four Munchkins  that s a donut  Because that s basically how the math works  Because if we re doing that  then the number s higher  Because I don t eat a lot of donuts  I eat plenty of Munchkins 
Barker  All right  well  to answer the question   
Hill   laughs  No one s listening at this point 
Barker  We say that  and then the two people who are listening always chime in   I was still listening   and it s usually the guy  or the woman  who s still listening  To him or her  we say   
Hill  Thanks 
Barker  Thank you  I m going with Oscar Munoz 
Hill  United Airlines 
Barker  Yes 
Hill  Do tell 
Barker  Well  first of all  my hope is that by shadowing him  we re getting on the planes a lot and going to some fun places  I say that in part because he s about to retire in May of this year  And so I think that seeing somebody go through the transition from CEO to chairman and handing over the reins  that would be an interesting part of it  especially if a lot of it occurs at exciting places around the world that you can get to by plane  preferably by flying first class on United or its partner airlines  So that s a big chunk of it 
But he s been very successful  He was noted by PR Week as Communicator of the Year  Now  that was right before United got into the headlines for the passenger incident where somebody was dragged off the plane  and they did terribly on the communication of that  So I think somebody who has both received the accolades and the criticism  at the end of this part of their career  and is walking off the stage  I think from a winning position  nevertheless  I d like to know some of what he learned from that experience 
And I think that the industry as it relates to government regulatory bodies and dealing with unions and dealing with customer service and the cyclicality of it and the Boeing issues    I think that the number of different things that you would be exposed to would be a lot more than your coffee and donuts thing with Starbucks  I mean  I m drinking coffee right now  I m not flying  People know I m a fan of coffee  but I think that the diversity of topics that you would get to see would be fascinating 
Hill  I agree with all of that  but I am wondering if 2  of the reason you would want to follow Munoz is  you have it in your head that you would get frequent flyer miles for all of the flights you take with him 
Barker  But I d be frequently flying  according to this vision of mine  Whether I get the miles to fly more    I d be sick of flying by the end of it  First of all  I d have been everywhere   laughs  According to my vision of Oscar Munoz s job of telling me about his work  He d be like   Hey  Buenos Aires tomorrow    Sounds good  
Hill  Even if that s true  even if this vision of yours comes true  how do you think that would fly at home 
Barker  Much jealousy 
Hill  You finish your month with Munoz  and it s like   Hey  next year  I was thinking we could take a trip to      and you d be like   Ah  I ve been there    laughs 
Barker   laughs   I ve been there  That s a place you only want to go to once  Once a year  anyway   Yeah  I don t know  You re just bringing me down  man  I thought my idea was pretty good 
Hill  No  no  I think your idea is really good  I absolutely agree with what you said about Munoz from a communications standpoint  There are plenty of CEOs across a range of industries who could learn a lot from Munoz  just purely from the standpoint of how to interact with the media  how to put forth a message for the public  It makes sense to me that he got that honor from the PR people   
Barker  Then they tried to take it back  You can t really take it back  all it is is an article in the magazine  But I think they said afterwards   Hey  if we were giving this now   after the incident where United really didn t do a good job on communicating regarding this passenger being hauled off  and the social media elements of that  and they said   We would not have given it to him at this point   So he s seen both sides  of doing the job well and suffering the consequences of missteps 
Hill  I don t disagree with that  but I do think that Munoz as a communicator had far more wins than losses 
Barker  Right  yes 
Hill  Bill Barker  thanks for being here 
Barker  Thank you

114517,336032,HAS,Why Target s Weak Toy Sales Aren t Necessarily Bad News for Mattel and Hasbro,news,"Target  NYSE TGT  reported lower than expected holiday sales on Jan  15  with toys among the weakest product categories  Shares of toymakers Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  and Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  fell 4 6  and 2 1   respectively  on the news  But this report doesn t mean people are no longer buying Barbie dolls or Monopoly games  and it isn t signaling some sort of toy Armageddon  It means shoppers are buying toys in different places  notably online 
Target s online sales are growing  but Target still is primarily a brick and mortar retailer  third quarter comparable sales gains of 4 5  reflected 2 8  growth in stores and a 1 7 percentage point contribution from digital sales  And according to a pre holiday survey by Civic Science  online retailers were set to win sales during the season  The report predicted 47  of adults would do their toy shopping at an online only retailer such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   The study also showed that shoppers with Amazon Prime memberships were more than 200  more likely to make most of their toy purchases online compared to those without Prime  Amazon s own holiday report supported this data  with the retail giant saying toys were among its best selling items 

The demise of Toys R Us
As a matter of fact  in spite of Target s flat toy sales this holiday season  the outlook for toy sales is looking up  The NPD Group predicts total toy industry dollar sales to pick up this year and expects this growth to continue throughout 2021  The industry posted a 2  sales drop in 2018 after four years of growth  but again  the declines aren t linked to a disinterest in toy purchases  Instead  the demise of Toys R Us explains at least some of the weakness in 2018 as toymakers lost a major retail seller of their products  And sales performance in the first half of last year    a 9  drop    was hurt by the unfavorable comparisons to the prior year due to the Toys R Us liquidation sale 
Considering all of these elements  the landscape for toymakers looks a lot better than it did a year or so ago  Now the big question is  Which toymakers are set to emerge as leaders in this renewed toy marketplace 
Recent trade deal could help Hasbro
The recent Phase 1 trade deal with China could make a big difference for Hasbro s outlook  The company  which reported earnings that missed analysts  estimates in the third quarter  said its operations were hurt by the trade war between the U S  and China  the source of about two thirds of the company s products  Hasbro has pledged to reduce the share of its manufacturing sourcing from China to 50  by the end of this year  In other positive news  Hasbro recently completed the acquisition of Entertainment One  The company s film and TV expertise will surely bolster Hasbro s identity as an entertainment company as well as bring it globally popular brands like Peppa Pig  Hasbro said the deal will be accretive to adjusted EPS    minus one time transaction costs and intangible amortization related to the purchase    in the first year following the transaction 
Hasbro shares gained 30  last year  but there is room for 10  upside  according to Wall Street s average price estimate  The consensus has a buy rating on the stock  Considering these factors and the fact that Hasbro has paid investors dividends every year since 1981 and has lifted the dividend over the past six years  investors can expect growth as well as dividends from Hasbro 
A smoother quarter for Mattel
Mattel  which didn t note any impact from the U S  China trade war in its latest earnings report  had a smoother quarter than Hasbro and has surpassed analysts  estimates in the past four quarters  Still  revenue came in slightly lower than revenue at Hasbro    net sales of  1 48 billion versus Hasbro s  1 58 billion  Mattel s famous asset  Barbie  posted a 10  increase in sales  and action figures and games also saw gains  As for payouts to investors  Mattel hasn t offered a dividend since 2017 
Mattel shares rose 36  last year and are trading a few cents higher than Wall Street s average price estimate  Most analysts recommend buying the shares  and though there isn t a strong reason to not buy Mattel  Hasbro s dividend payments  expansion in the entertainment business  and near term share growth potential make it a bit more attractive at this stage 
That said  both Mattel and Hasbro should benefit from the rebound in the toy industry predicted for this year  The absence of a major toy seller like Toys R Us is a headwind for any toymaker  but if Mattel  Hasbro  and others can effectively market their products through online platforms  better days are on the horizon ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkz9c,2064215
114520,336035,HAS,3 Ways Hasbro Is Evolving in Order to Grow Its Toy Business,news,"Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  is one of the largest and most progressive global toy companies  It owns a portfolio of beloved toy brands  including Monopoly  Play Doh  Power Rangers  and My Little Pony  Results from the first nine months of 2019 were solid  Though revenue was only up 3 2  year over year  Hasbro managed to increase its operating profit by 44 0   and adjusted net earnings per share were up 12 3  year over year 
Shares of the company hit an all time high of  124 per share in July 2019 before settling down to its current level of  106  and shareholders enjoyed a 30  capital gain last year  This great performance is not without reason though    the company has demonstrated its ability to evolve with the times by leveraging its strengths as a toy company to create multiple streams of income  Its recent acquisition of Entertainment One for  4 billion will further strengthen its stable of brands and has the potential to boost revenue and profit growth even more  The company reports its fourth quarter and full year earnings on Feb  11 
In fact  the division with the highest growth rate of 23  year over year  for the first nine months of 2019  was the entertainment  licensing  and digital division  underscoring the importance of tapping into tie ups and licenses to generate an alternative source of revenue  Here is a look at three ways Hasbro has evolved  and how it s been able to grow its toy business over time 

Live play and events
Brand building is always an important aspect of marketing  and Hasbro tied up with two partners  Kingsmen Creatives and Kilburn Live  during 2019 to build up their best selling Nerf blaster brand  A licensing agreement was signed back in Feb  2018 with Kingsmen Creatives in Singapore to open Nerf Family Entertainment Centers  FEC  across Asia  Kingsmen will conceptualize  create  build  and operate these centers while paying Hasbro a licensing fee for using the Nerf brand  The world s first Nerf FEC opened in Singapore in Oct  2019   Hasbro has also expanded the licensing agreement to eventually bring these centers to the U S  market  The first U S  based Nerf FEC is slated to begin operations in 2020 and will bring in even more licensing revenue for Hasbro 
Hasbro s partnership with Kilburn Live involves a new entertainment touring event  Nerf Challenge  The attraction was open from Dec  7  2019 through Jan  5  2020 in Los Angeles and featured a 50 000 square foot arena with obstacles and play areas for an action packed experience 
Nerf Challenge will be rolling out across multiples cities in the U S  and Canada during the year  This focus on live play and events for Hasbro s iconic toy brand helps the company better connect with and engage its loyal fan base  encouraging repeat purchases and strengthening brand identity 
Leveraging Hasbro s existing IP
Hasbro is leveraging its popular brands such as Power Rangers and My Little Pony by monetizing the brands  intellectual property  In Hasbro s latest earnings call  CEO Brian Goldner described how toy revenue was boosted by movie releases and successful TV series runs  The release of Bumblebee boosted Transformers revenues  while a new series featuring Power Rangers received high ratings 
A My Little Pony animated feature is being planned for 2021 in partnership with Paramount  This brand has grown over the last 10 years into a global lifestyle franchise with billions in sales  Hasbro needs to reimagine the brand  invest in content  and release a movie with a new  refreshed storyline that will capture the hearts  and wallets  of its young fans 
These methods are lucrative as kids love a great story that involves their favorite lovable characters  With movie and TV series tie ins with movie studios  Hasbro can open up a strong source of recurring revenue 
Esports potential
A third area that Hasbro is working on is in multiplayer video games and esports  According to a late 2019 presentation made by Christian Cocks  president of the Wizards of the Coast gaming division  Hasbro intends to be a leading publisher of fantasy games across any platform  The company has two key gaming brands  Magic  The Gathering and Dungeons   Dragons  The former boasts around 40 million players and double digit annual revenue growth over the past 10 years  The launch of Magic  The Gathering Arena has sought to further connect players from around the world in a massive  multiplayer online adventure experience 
The idea is to eventually launch this platform in the esports world  creating a viable and potentially rewarding new revenue stream for Hasbro  With the overall esports market expected to reach  2 2 billion by 2023 and growing at a compound annual rate of 18 6  from 2018 to 2023  there is massive potential for Hasbro to tap into this opportunity with its iconic brands 
Investors are in for an exciting time as the above three initiatives take root  Though Hasbro shares are trading at a premium valuation of 25 times forward earnings estimates  it s clear that many investors are optimistic about the company s potential and willing to pay for that growth  Hasbro s reputation as an innovative toy manufacturer should allow it to prove naysayers wrong and help it to propel revenue and net income to new records ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plf4i,2065080

 We continue to believe that the market s appreciation of the Q3 results is likely a reflection of relief that the earnings outlook continues to be favorable and stable despite a challenging global growth backdrop  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for the 469 S P 500 companies that have reported results already are down  1 2  from the year earlier level on  4 3  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 57 6  beating revenue estimates  While earnings growth is below what we had seen for this group of companies in other recent periods  revenue growth is only modestly tracking below what this same group achieved in the preceding period  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is within the historical range  though revenue beats on the lower side  The Q3 reporting cycle is predominantly over  with all of the reports in for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  The Retail sector is the only one that still has a significant number of reports still to come  For the Retail sector  we now have Q3 results from 92 7  of the sector s market cap in the index  Total earnings for these sector companies are up  1 8  from the same period last year on  9 9  growth in revenues  with 63  beating EPS estimates and 51 9  beating revenue estimates  The Retail sector s Q3 earnings performance has been weaker than what we saw from the same companies in the June quarter  with the proportion of sector companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking below what other recent periods  For the Tech sector  we now have Q3 results from 92 5  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Tech companies are down  6 0  on  2 3  higher revenues  with 78 6  beating EPS estimates and 67 9  beating revenue estimates  This is weaker performance than we have seen from the group in the first half of the year  For Q3 as a whole  combining the results from the 469 index members that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down  1 7  on  4 2  higher revenues  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Energy   34 4   and Basic Materials   28 5   sectors  Tech sector earnings are expected to be down  7 5   Excluding the Technology sector  total Q3 earnings would be up  0 1    Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Business Services   16 2    Transportation   8 2    Utilities   10 2    Medical   7 1    Finance   3 0   and Construction   6 4    Q3 earnings for the index would be down  2 9  on an ex Finance basis  For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q3 results from 542 companies or 90 2  of the index s total membership  Total earnings or aggregate net income for these companies are down  20 6  from the same period last year on  2 3  higher revenues  with 61 4  beating EPS estimates and 57 7  beating revenue estimates  Looking at Q3 as a whole for the small cap index  total Q3 earnings are expected to be down  19 6  from the same period last year on  3 3  higher revenues  This would follow declines of  11 5  and  16 7  in 2019 Q2 and Q1  respectively  Total 2019 earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  1 5  on  2 4  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 1  earnings growth on  9 3  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  8 3  on  4 3  higher revenues  Estimates for the current period  2019 Q4  and next year  2020  have been steadily coming down   The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 19 5X and index close  as of November 19th  is  160 30  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  173 57 for 2020  P E of 18 0X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with the 2019 growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of November 20th  2019 
We now have Q3 results from 469 S P 500 members that combined account for 96 6  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these 469 index members are down  1 2  from the same period last year  4 3  higher revenues  with 72 7  beating EPS estimates and 57 6  beating revenue estimates 
The two sets of comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context  first the growth rates for these 469 index members 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And then the proportion of these companies beating estimates 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The earnings growth for these 469 index members   1 2   is weaker than what we saw from this same sample of results in other recent periods  but revenue growth is only modestly below what we saw from the same group of companies in the first half of the year  
We knew all along that earnings growth would be challenged in Q3  as it had been in the first half of the year  and that s what these results show 
The proportion of these companies beating estimates  particularly EPS estimates  was earlier tracking above historical trends  But this has moderated somewhat in recent days  with the Q3 EPS beats percentage now within the historical range  
The market has generally been appreciative of the Q3 results  A major reason for the favorable stock market reception for these Q3 results is likely relief that the feared flood of negative guidance has not come to fruition 
This fear was more in market sentiment than actual estimates for 2019 Q4 and beyond  Driving this fear was the negative impact of the trade issue on business confidence and growing signs of economic weakness in key regions of the world  including the domestic factory space 
The market s relieved response is likely the best explanation for the stock market performance of otherwise ordinary reports from the likes of Fastenal  FAST   United Rentals  URI  and many others  including Caterpillar  CAT   That said  the market hasn t been forgiving of companies that guide lower  as we saw with Texas Instruments  TXN   Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   HAS  and others   
Overall Expectations for Q3   Beyond 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 2 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  but is expected to be down  1 7  in Q3 and has been steadily going down in recent days for the last quarter of the year  at  3 3  currently  
My sense is that actual Q3 growth will most likely be in the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year by the time we are closing the books on the Q3 reporting cycle  
The chart below puts earnings and revenue growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

114526,336041,HAS,Pakistan defends Chinese investment after U S  official s criticism,news,"ISLAMABAD  Reuters    Pakistan on Thursday rejected criticism of the  60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor  CPEC   after a visiting U S  official was quoted expressing apprehension over the plan 
While Pakistan has continuously defended Chinese investment  it has also attempted to mend relations with the United States  Prime Minister Imran Khan and U S  President Donald Trump have held at least three one on one meetings over the last six months  the latest on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday 
U S  officials have repeatedly criticized CPEC  under which Beijing has pledged about  60 billion for infrastructure in Pakistan  central to China s wider Belt and Road initiative to develop land and sea trade routes in Asia and beyond 
Washington says the project is not sufficiently transparent and will saddle Pakistan with the burden of expensive Chinese loans  Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that Alice Wells  U S  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs  had made similar remarks at a closed door think tank event in Pakistan on Tuesday 
Asked about the U S  official s comments  Pakistan s foreign office spokeswoman  Aisha Farooqui  said CPEC was a transformational project for Pakistan  and completing it was the government s highest priority 
 To claim that CPEC is always in the form of loans and other forms of financing often non concessional with sovereign guarantees is not based on facts   Farooqui said during her weekly briefing 
Before coming to power  Khan had also questioned the transparency of CPEC projects and expressed concern over Pakistan s rising debt burden  Since winning the 2018 election  he has tended to avoid such remarks  although some ministers in his cabinet have spoken of the need to renegotiate some deals 
The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad  in a statement on Wednesday  said   The U S  is obsessed with the story it  has  made for CPEC  
 If the U S  truly cares about the development and prosperity of Pakistan and this region  it should bring cash and funds  promote win win cooperation on the basis of mutual respect  fairness and justice  rather than act as a world policeman  spreading rumors and provoking China Pakistan relations  ",2020-01-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/pakistan-defends-chinese-investment-after-us-officials-criticism-2066115,2066115

Adding to the woes  Toys  R  US liquidated its U S  operations last year that resulted in a tectonic shift in the retail landscape for toys  All these companies earned majority of their revenues from

enormous growth potential in China and Brazil as the countries have a huge population of kids aged 0 to 14 years  Per U S  Toy Industry Association  out of Brazil s population of 200 million  45 7

114531,336046,HAS,India raises import taxes in move set to spook some foreign firms,news,"By Aditya Kalra and Chandini Monnappa
NEW DELHI BENGALURU  Reuters    India on Saturday raised taxes on imports of goods such as electronic items  toys and furniture  aiming to give impetus to domestic manufacturing in a move that will hit Sweden s IKEA and other foreign firms 
The measures  announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 2020 21 budget  come amid criticism from some companies that India has increasingly resorted to protectionist rules that discriminate against foreign companies 
Listing the new taxes  the government said they were in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi s  Make in India  program aimed at promoting domestic industry 
Taxes on imports of items including kitchenware  fans and small electrical appliances will be doubled to 20   while the levy on furniture including seats  lamps and mattresses will be raised to 25  from 20  
IKEA s India CEO Peter Betzel said the company was disappointed with the increase   We are further evaluating the impact of the hike on our total business   he said  IKEA  which has committed more than 1 5 billion euros   1 7 billion  in India investments  imports roughly 75  of goods sold in the country 
Sitharaman defended the decision  saying the rationale was that if certain goods were being manufactured locally at  equal quality  if not better   then  we had no reason to import  
Taxes on imported toys would be tripled to 60   a move one industry executive said could hit imports of toys made by firms such as Lego  Hasbro  O HAS  and Mattel  O MAT   and boost smuggling of unbranded toys from abroad 
 It s a protectionist move   said the executive 
The new tariffs also come as India and the United States try to resolve trade differences and have been at odds over certain tariffs  Washington has been urging India to not impose trade barriers that restrict growth of American firms 
The government also said a tax of 5  will be imposed on imported medical device imports to fund health infrastructure  The measure could hit firms such as Abbott  N ABT  which are already battling price caps imposed by the government

114551,336066,HAS,The Evolving Earnings Picture,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points 
 The market s appreciation of the Q3 results is likely a reflection of relief that the earnings outlook has not taken as much of a hit as many appeared to fear following growing evidence of a global economic slowdown  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for the 403 S P 500 companies that have reported results already are down  1 7  from the year earlier level on  4 0  higher revenues  with 73 0  beating EPS estimates and 58 1  beating revenue estimates  While earnings growth is below what we had seen for this group of companies in other recent periods  revenue growth is only modestly tracking below what this same group achieved in the preceding period  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is within the historical range  though revenue beats on the lower side  For the Tech sector  we now have Q3 results from 84 3  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Tech companies are down  6 6  on  3 1  higher revenues  with 82 6  beating EPS estimates and 67 4  beating revenue estimates  This is weaker performance than we have seen from the group in the first half of the year  For the Finance sector  we now have all the results in  the reporting cycle has ended for three other sectors   Total earnings for these Finance companies are up  3 0  on  9 3  higher revenues  with 72 2  beating EPS estimates and 70 1  beating revenue estimates  This is a notably better performance than we saw from the group in the first half of the year  For Q3 as a whole  combining the results from the 403 index members that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down  2 4  on  4 1  higher revenues  Q3 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Energy   35 1   and Basic Materials   28 6   sectors  Tech sector earnings are expected to be down  7 9   Excluding the Technology sector  total Q3 earnings would be down  0 2    Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Business Services   13 2    Transportation   8 2    Utilities   9 3    Medical   6 7    Finance   3 0   and Construction   5 1    Q3 earnings for the index would be down  3 7  on an ex Finance basis  For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q3 results from 419 companies or 69 7  of the index s total membership  Total earnings or aggregate net income for these companies are down  18 2  from the same period last year on  0 9  higher revenues  with 66 1  beating EPS estimates and 56 6  beating revenue estimates  Looking at Q3 as a whole for the small cap index  total Q3 earnings are expected to be down  22 4  from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues  This would follow declines of  12 6  and  18  in 2019 Q2 and Q1  respectively  Total 2019 earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  1 3  on  2 2  higher revenues  which would follow the  23 0  earnings growth on  9 2  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  8 5  on  4 7  higher revenues    The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 19 2X and index close  as of November 5th  is  160 36  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  174 01 for 2020  P E of 17 7X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with the 2019 growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of November 6th  2019 
We now have Q3 results from 403 S P 500 members that combined account for 86 0  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these 403 index members are down  1 7  from the same period last year  4 0  higher revenues  with 73 0  beating EPS estimates and 58 1  beating revenue estimates 
The two sets of comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context  first the growth rates for these 403 index members 
 
 
 
 
And then the proportion of these companies beating estimates 
 
 
 
 
The earnings growth for these 403 index members   1 7   is weaker than what we saw from this same sample of results in other recent periods  but revenue growth is only modestly below what we saw from the same group of companies in the first half of the year  
We knew all along that earnings growth would be challenged in Q3  as it had been in the first half of the year  and that s what these results show 
The proportion of these companies beating estimates  particularly EPS estimates  was earlier tracking above historical trends  But this has moderated somewhat in recent days  with the Q3 EPS beats percentage now within the historical range  
The market has generally been appreciative of the Q3 results  A major reason for the favorable stock market reception for these Q3 results is likely relief that the feared flood of negative guidance has not come to fruition 
This fear was more in market sentiment than actual estimates for 2019 Q4 and beyond  Driving this fear was the negative impact of the trade issue on business confidence and growing signs of economic weakness in key regions of the world  including the domestic factory space 
The market s relieved response is likely the best explanation for the stock market performance of otherwise ordinary reports from the likes of Fastenal  FAST   United Rentals  URI  and many others  including Caterpillar  CAT   That said  the market hasn t been forgiving of companies that guide lower  as we saw with Texas Instruments  TXN   Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   HAS  and others   
Overall Expectations for Q3   Beyond 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 2 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  but is expected to be down  2 4  in Q3 and has been steadily going down in recent days for the last quarter of the year  at  2 6  currently  
My sense is that actual Q3 growth will most likely be in the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year by the time we are closing the books on the Q3 reporting cycle   
The chart below puts earnings and revenue growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

114553,336068,HAS,Wal Mart  Cisco Systems  Nvidia  Ford And Hasbro Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 11 2019   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Wal Mart   NYSE WMT    Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO    Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA    Ford   NYSE F   and Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   Were Q3 Earnings Estimates Too Low The popular narrative about the Q3 earnings season is that the actual results look better only relative to the very low levels to which estimates had fallen  In other words  consensus EPS and revenue estimates were too easy to beat But had that been the case  the beats percentages should have been a lot higher than what we actually saw  With results from 447 S P 500 members or 89 4  of the index s total membership already out  we have the numbers to speak for themselves  For the 447 S P 500 members that have reported results through Friday  November 8th  72 5  are beating EPS estimates and 57 9  are beating revenue estimates Over the last 12 quarters  the low EPS beats percentage for these 447 index members was 66 9   2018 Q4  and the high was 79 9   2018 Q2   with an average EPS beats percentage of 75   The EPS beats percentage in Q3 started out very high  but currently remains towards the high end of this 12 quarter range On the revenues side  the beats percentage for this group of 347 index members has been as low as 48 3   2015 Q3  and as high as 75 4   2018 Q1  over the preceding 12 quarter period  As is the case with the EPS beats percentage  the Q3 revenue beats percentage remains within this historical range  though admittedly towards the lower end of that range  What this means is that Q3 estimates were likely just about right  neither too low  nor too high With only 53 S P 500 members still to report Q3 results  these conclusions about Q3 estimates will likely carry through to the end of this reporting season We have almost 450 companies on the docket reporting results this week  including 15 S P 500 members  This week s docket includes Wal Mart  Cisco Systems  Nvidia and others  So  what explains the market s favorable reaction to Q3 results Many in the market appeared to fear a notable uptick in negative guidance for Q4 and beyond  in the wake of renewed signs of deceleration in the global and U S  economy  Weak guidance from a number of companies like Ford  Hasbro and others reflect this reality But a preponderance of negative guidance from across all major sectors has failed to materialize  In other words  there is no material deterioration in the earnings picture relative to what was expected earlier  Q3 results and guidance for the current and coming quarters has been better than  feared  That said  estimates for the current and coming quarters has been coming down since the Q3 earnings season got underway Even more significant on the revisions front is how estimates for full year 2020 are shaping up  There has been no growth in 2019  but the market has been banking on growth resuming next year The above negative revisions trend for full year 2020 is still within historical ranges  but a significant acceleration in estimate cuts will likely be a major negative for market expectations S P 500 Scorecard  as of Friday  November 1st  2019 We now have Q3 results from 447 S P 500 members or 89 4  of the index s total membership  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these 447 companies are down  1 5  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues  with 72 5  beating EPS estimates and 57 9  beating revenue estimates  Looking at Q3 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 447 index members with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings  or aggregate net income  is expected to be down  1 9  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues Tough comparisons to last year when growth was boosted by the tax cut legislation were all along expected to weigh on earnings growth in 2019  Moderating U S  economic growth and notable slowdowns in other major global economic regions are having a further negative impact  Uncertainty about the global trade regime and growing resort to tariffs are not helping matters either My sense is that the final Q3 earnings growth rate will be the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year  For an in depth look at the overall earnings picture and expectations for Q3 and beyond  please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report     The Evolving Earnings

114570,336085,HAS,Room For Upgrades On Hasbro Stock As Earnings Near,opinion,"Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS  stock is slightly in the red today at  120 78  and we are looking ahead to the toymaker s quarterly results  slated for before the bell tomorrow  Oct  22  Below we will take a closer look at the equity s long term performance on the charts  and see what the options market is pricing in for the stock s post earnings move 
Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  stock has made exceptional improvement since January  now up 48  in 2019  With no fewer than two massive bull gaps and support at both the 70 day and 100 day moving averages  the security is now on its way back to record high territory above the  120 mark 
 
In terms of the company s earnings history  Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  stock closed higher after five of the past eight reports  including a more than 14  surge in April  This quarter  the options market is eyeing an 11 3  swing for HAS  larger than usual in comparison to its average 7 8  move over the past two years 
Despite its positive long term price action  plenty of pessimism still surrounds the retailer  Five analysts still sport a tepid  hold  recommendation  and in the options pits  bears look to be at play 
Specifically  the stock s 10 day put call volume ratio of 2 70 at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Cboe Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   Ranking in the 80  annual percentile  this indicates HAS puts have been purchased over calls at a faster than normal clip in the past two weeks 
Echoing this  near term options traders are also put skewed at the moment  based on the stock s Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 2 55  This reading ranks in the highest percentile of its annual range  showing such a preference for short term puts over calls is rare  What s more  peak put open interest sits at the January 2020 110 strike  where over 4 400 contracts reside

114571,336086,HAS,A Better Than Expected Earnings Picture,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points  The market s appreciation of the Q3 results thus far is likely a reflection of relief that has not taken as much of a hit as many appeared to fear following growing evidence of global economic slowdown  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for the 124 S P 500 companies that have reported results already are down  2 4  on  3 1  higher revenues  with 82 3  beating EPS estimates and 63 7  beating revenue estimates  While earnings growth is below what we had seen for this group of companies in other recent periods  revenue growth is actually modestly above what this same group achieved in the preceding period  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is the highest since Q2 2018 For the Finance sector  we now have Q3 results from 51 8  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Finance companies are down  1 4  on  3 7  higher revenues  with 83 8  beating EPS estimates and 75 7  beating revenue estimates  This is a notably better performance than we have seen from the group in the first half of the year For Q3 as a whole  combining the results from the 124 index members that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings are expected to be down 4 3  on 3 9  higher revenues Q3 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Energy   34 8    Basic Materials   23 3    Technology   11   and Aerospace   12 8  sectors  Excluding the Technology sector  total Q3 earnings would be down  2 2  Sectors with positive earnings growth in Q3 include Business Services   7 2    Transportation   7    Utilities   4 6    Finance   5   and Construction   4 3    Q3 earnings for the index would be down  6 7  on an ex Finance basis For the small cap S P 600 index  we now have Q3 results from 72 companies or 12  of the index s total membership  Total earnings or aggregate net income for these companies are down 4 3  from the same period last year on 2 3  higher revenues  with 80 6  beating EPS estimates and 62 5  beating revenue estimates It is still early going for the small cap index  but the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is notably higher relative to other recent periods Looking at Q3 as a whole for the small cap index  total Q3 earnings are expected to be down 20 7  from the same period last year on 2 7  higher revenues  This would follow declines of 12 6  and 18  in 2019 Q2 and Q1  respectively Total 2019 earnings or aggregate net income for the S P 500 index are expected to be down 1  on 2 5  higher revenues  which would follow the 23 1  earnings growth on 9 1  higher revenues in 2018  Growth is expected to resume in 2020  with earnings growth of  8 9  on  4 7  higher revenues The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2019 P E of 18 7X and index close  as of October 22nd  is  160 58  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  174 91 for2020  P E of 17 1X   The multiples for 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year Worries about the duration of the current economic cycle are not reflected in consensus earnings estimates for next year and beyond  with the 2019 growth challenge primarily a function of tough comparisons to last year s tax cut driven record earnings Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of October 23rd  2019 
We now have Q3 results from 124 S P 500 members that combined account for 29 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these 124 index members are down 2 4  from the same period last year on 3 1  higher revenues  with 82 3  beating EPS estimates and 63 7  beating revenue estimates 
The two sets of comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context  first the growth rates for these 124 index members 

And then the proportion of these companies beating estimates 

The earnings growth for these 124 index members   2 4   is weaker than what we saw from this same sample of results in other recent periods  but revenue growth is tracking modestly above what the same group of companies were able to produce in the preceding period 
We knew all along that earnings growth would be challenged in Q3  as it had been in the first half of the year  and that s what these results show 
That said  a notably bigger proportion of companies are beating EPS estimates at this stage of the reporting cycle  In fact  the EPS and revenue beats percentages are the highest since 2018 Q2  likely reconfirming that Q3 estimates were on the low side 
This easy to beat aspect of Q3 estimates partly explains the market s generally positive reaction to these releases  But the more significant explanation for the favorable stock market reception for these Q3 results is likely relief that the feared flood of negative guidance has not come to fruition 
This fear was more in market sentiment than actual estimates for 2019 Q4 and beyond  Driving this fear was the negative impact of the trade issue on business confidence and growing signs of economic weakness in key regions of the world  including the domestic factory space 
The market s relieved response is likely the best explanation for the stock market performance of otherwise ordinary reports from the likes of Fastenal  FAST   United Rentals  URI  and many others  including Caterpillar  CAT   That said  the market hasn t been forgiving of companies that guide lower  as we saw with Texas Instruments  TXN   Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   HAS  and others suggest 
Overall Expectations for Q3   Beyond
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 2 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 

As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the first two quarters of the year  but is expected to be down 4 3  in the current period and has turned modestly negative for the last quarter of the year 
My sense is that actual Q3 growth will most likely be in the vicinity of what we saw in the first half of the year by the time we are closing the books on the Q3 reporting cycle 
The chart below puts earnings and revenue growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 

The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for next year remain stable or start coming down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant revisions to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  This  coupled with the ongoing economic weakness in Europe  China and elsewhere likely represent downside risks to the growth outlook

114596,336111,HAS, Toy Story 4  delivers surprise revenue rise for Mattel,news," Reuters     Mattel Inc   O MAT  reported a surprise rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday  as the success of the latest  Toy Story  movie boosted demand for its action figures and a makeover of Barbie lifted sales of the iconic dolls  sending its shares up 5  
The toymaker also achieved its full year cost savings target six months ahead of schedule and posted a much smaller loss  as the company benefits from making toys modeled on big Hollywood titles and revitalizing the 60 year old Barbie brand with variants based on popular celebrities and role models 
Worldwide sales in the action figures  building sets and games segment jumped over 20  in the second quarter  while they rose about 9  in the Barbie unit 
 Toy Story 4  circles around a group of toys  voiced by Hollywood A listers Tom Hanks and Tim Allen  has made over  860 million worldwide 
Mattel is working to become the  partner of choice  for more entertainment companies  Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz told Reuters 
 Historically  it wasn t an area we were focused on but going forward we are looking to do more  The success of  Toy Story  is an example of our capabilities   he said 
Mattel s rival  Hasbro Inc   O HAS  earlier this week also beat quarterly profit and sales estimates on demand for action toys based on  Avengers  Endgame   reflecting the toy industry s shift away from developing new original properties to chasing big entertainment titles to grab kids  attention 
The company s second quarter revenue rose 2 3  to  860 1 million  while analysts  on average had estimated a 3 3  drop 
Gross sales in North America increased 1  to  447 4 million  also beating analysts  estimates 
The company exceeded its savings target for the year  achieving  754 million in the first six months  compared with its initial target of at least  650 million 
Mattel said it expects to achieve another  100 million in savings by the end of 2019 
The company s loss narrowed to  108 million  or 31 cents per share  in the three months ended June 30  from  240 9 million or 70 cents per share  a year earlier 
On an adjusted basis  Mattel reported a loss of 25 cents per share  Analysts had expected a loss of 40 cents per share  but it was not immediately clear if the figures were comparable ",2019-07-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/toy-story-4-delivers-surprise-revenue-rise-for-mattel-1935207,1935207
114597,336112,HAS,Trump s Tariff Delay on Toys Has Hasbro Breathing Sigh of Relief,news," Bloomberg      Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS   has a message to the Trump administration after the decision to put off imposing tariffs  Thanks for listening 
The toymaker said in an email to Bloomberg that an announced delay in the levies until Dec  15 on some products will help it mitigate the impact on U S  consumers during the upcoming holiday season  The change will also give the company more time to update global sourcing plans 
The decision to delay some of the tariffs from Sept  1 was an attempt to spare consumers some pain during the holiday season  President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday  Consumer goods prices have already been on the rise  and retailers unable to swallow the tariff hikes were expected to raise prices on impacted products ahead of the critical holiday period 
 We appreciate the administration listening to our concerns   spokeswoman Julie Duffy said 
Hasbro gained 4  to  117 65 at 1 37 p m  in New York  on pace for its biggest gain in three weeks  while fellow toymaker  Mattel Inc   NASDAQ MAT   was up 4 9  to  11 54 
The Toy Association  an industry trade group  echoed Hasbro s message  saying that the delay  saved the holiday season  while adding that tariffs are the wrong approach to U S  China trade relations 
Toy companies are especially sensitive to fluctuations in the holiday shopping season  with the bulk of their sales coming in the second half of the year 
Consumer groups are still concerned  however  since the delay kicks the can down the road and doesn t resolve the fundamental uncertainty that companies have faced since trade tensions with China flared up 
 What we really need is an effective strategy to address China s unfair trade practices by working with our allies instead of using unilateral tariffs that cost American jobs and hurt consumers   David French  a spokesman for the National Retail Federation  said

114632,336147,HAS,Has Hasbro  HAS  Outpaced Other Consumer Discretionary Stocks This Year ,opinion,"The Consumer Discretionary group has plenty of great stocks  but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers  Has Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  been one of those stocks this year  Let s take a closer look at the stock s year to date performance to find out 
Hasbro is one of 246 companies in the Consumer Discretionary group  The Consumer Discretionary group currently sits at  14 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  HAS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HAS s full year earnings has moved 5 28  higher  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
Based on the latest available data  HAS has gained about 44 49  so far this year  At the same time  Consumer Discretionary stocks have gained an average of 16 28   This means that Hasbro is performing better than its sector in terms of year to date returns 
Breaking things down more  HAS is a member of the Toys   Games   Hobbies industry  which includes 8 individual companies and currently sits at  88 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 19 55  so far this year  so HAS is performing better in this area 
Going forward  investors interested in Consumer Discretionary stocks should continue to pay close attention to HAS as it looks to continue its solid performance ",2019-09-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-hasbro-has-outpaced-other-consumer-discretionary-stocks-this-year-200468703,200468703
114633,336148,HAS,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Hasbro  HAS  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Hasbro currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if HAS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this toy maker holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For HAS  shares are up 1 01  over the past week while the Zacks Toys   Games   Hobbies industry is down 0 84  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 05  compares favorably with the industry s 2 02  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Hasbro have increased 8 21  over the past quarter  and have gained 11 38  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  0 31  and 2 56   respectively 
Investors should also take note of HAS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  HAS is averaging 772 528 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with HAS 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost HAS s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 71 to  4 79 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that HAS is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Hasbro on your short list ",2019-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-hasbro-has-is-a-great-choice-200469895,200469895

114662,336177,HAS,Things You Must Know Before NIKE s  NKE  Q1 Earnings Results,opinion,"NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   is slated to release first quarter fiscal 2020 results on Sep 24  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this leading sports apparel retailer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of nearly 6 1   This breached its otherwise spectacular earnings record  Notably  the earnings miss in fourth quarter fiscal 2019 marked its first negative surprise  after 28 straight beats  In the trailing four quarters  the company recorded average positive earnings surprise of 6 4   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at 71 cents  reflecting year over year growth of nearly 6   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the fiscal first quarter has remained unchanged in the past 30 days NIKE  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Moreover  NIKE has outperformed the broader sector in the past month  indicating a positive sentiment ahead of the earnings release  During the same period  shares of the company have gained 7 6  compared with the  sector s growth of 4 9   Additionally  shares of NIKE have witnessed an improvement of 17 8  year to date 
 

Factors at PlayDespite reporting an earnings miss in the last reported quarter  the company s strong earnings and sales track record is supported by the solid execution of Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on direct to customer business  NIKE s performance graph is also influenced by strength in international and NIKE Direct businesses alongside momentum in North America  The company has recorded top line beat in the past nine straight quarters  These factors should continue to drive its top and bottom line performances in the to be reported quarter Notably  NIKE s North America business returned to healthy  sustainable growth in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  The momentum continued throughout fiscal 2019  with revenue growth of 6  in the first quarter  9  in the second quarter  and 7  in both third and fourth quarters  Continued growth in NIKE Digital and significant share gains across its wholesale partners boosted the segment s performance  Further  growth was driven by continued innovation in footwear and strong demand in apparel  The company s wholesale and NIKE Digital businesses witnessed double digit growth in North America Further  NIKE app revenues in North America are witnessing triple digit growth  The company expects the momentum in North America to continue  driven by strong pipeline of innovative products  brand recognition and creation of digitally led consumer experiences  Synergies from this business should contribute meaningfully to top line growth again in first quarter fiscal 2020 Moreover  the company remains focused on accelerating digital advantage as part of capitalizing on its 2X Direct strategy  with the Consumer Direct Offense plan  It demonstrated strong progress on this strategy in fiscal 2019  with robust digital growth within Direct  NIKE also continues to leverage on its mobile apps  which are part of digital growth In fiscal 2019  the company invested more than  1 billion in new capabilities and consumer concepts  This included significant investments in the sneakers app  the NIKE app  new store concepts that leverage digital  NIKE Plus membership platform  and enterprise wide data and analytics capabilities that are likely to serve consumers in new and better ways  Notably  the NIKE Direct business drove nearly 50  of incremental revenue growth in fiscal 2019  with 35  currency neutral growth in NIKE digital The company expects digital commerce  own and partnered to account for at least 30  of sales by 2023  Looking ahead  it expects to expand the digital footprint  with the launch of NIKE app in 13 additional countries in EMEA  Greater China and across APLA in fiscal 2020 Additionally  it will continue to invest in new store concepts that leverage digital  as clear from investments in two new innovative stores in New York and Shanghai  Further  it is investing in the smaller digitally enhanced store format NIKE Live and the NIKE Plus membership platform  Continued investments in digital platforms position the company for increased profitability in the fiscal first quarter and beyond However  higher SG A expenses from increased demand creation expenses and operating overheads are likely to remain a drag  Further  higher product costs and supply chain investments continue to offset gross margin expansion in the past few quarters  The unfavorable currency environment due to the global trade and geopolitical dynamics are also likely to weigh on the company s sales Expectations for Upcoming Quarter   Fiscal 2020NIKE expects to continue investing in key capabilities to aid digital transformation and deliver robust growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond  It expects results for fiscal 2020 to be driven by brand recognition  robust innovation pipeline  and positive response from Nike Direct and wholesale partners   The company expects to witness revenue growth in a high single digit and gross margin expansion in fiscal 2020  Further  it anticipates delivering broad based growth across all geographies  which should be within long term targets For first quarter fiscal 2020  the company expects revenue growth to be in line to slightly above the level witnessed in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  On a currency neutral basis  revenue growth is expected to be in a high single digit On the cost and margin front  the company expects gross margin to expand 50 bps in fiscal 2020  However  gross margin growth for the year is likely to be partly offset by currency headwinds  supply chain investments such as RFID and expansion of Air manufacturing innovation  These factors are likely to mar gross margin by about 50 bps  which is included in the company s guidance  Gross margin for the fiscal first quarter is estimated to be flat to expand 25 bps  fueled by robust growth in NIKE Direct and strong full price sales Moreover  the company expects only slight SG A leverage in fiscal 2020 as gains from productivity initiatives will be partly offset by costs related to investments  It expects SG A expenses to increase in line with revenue growth in fiscal 2020  In the fiscal first quarter  the company expects SG A expenses to increase in a high single digit  in line with currency neutral revenue growth Further  we expect NIKE s top and bottom line performances in first quarter fiscal 2020 to be dampened by adverse currency rates  In the fiscal first quarter  the company expects unfavorable currency rates to hurt currency neutral revenues by 4 percentage points  Additionally  currency headwinds are expected to mar gross margin by 50 70 bps in the fiscal first quarter What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs

114676,336191,HAS,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  The Strange Case of PG E Stock
As usual  the earnings calendar thins out on Friday  but there are still companies of note reporting 
The most interesting will likely be Pacific Gas   Electric  NYSE PCG   which is in the rare position of having filed bankruptcy only to see its stock remain above 12 month lows 
PG E filed for Chapter 11 protection at the end of January in anticipation of liabilities for California wildfires 
The stock is down about 70  in the last three months  trading around  13 50  which is well above its 52 week low of  5 07 seen at the height of the liability concern 
For earnings  the company is expected to post a profit of 63 cents per share on revenue of about  4 3 billion  according to Investing com estimates 
Also reporting tomorrow will be toymaker Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  
Analysts forecast quarterly earnings of  1 68 a share  with sales of about  1 5 billion 
Any discussions of the impact of the trade war between the U S  and China will be carefully parsed  as toys are one of the products hit hard by tariffs  Both countries are still at an impasse as a March deadline looms 
2  Rig Count May Counter Politics
Oil prices were weaker today on geopolitics  as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak poured cold water over Saudi Arabia s reported hopes to lure Moscow and the group of 10 non OPEC oil producers it leads into a formal pact 
But tomorrow traders get more data on which to hang their hats 
The Baker Hughes rig count arrives tomorrow at 1 PM ET  18 00 GMT  
The rig reading has been volatile lately  rising by 10 units and falling by 21 in the previous two weeks  And while the current number may mark a nine month low  it is still higher than a year ago  when only 765 rigs were active 
Reuters suggested that last week s rig count drop could be due to some drillers following through with plans from last year to spend less on new oil wells when crude prices were crashing to the low  40s 
3  Watch for Trade Jawboning
Investors should be on the lookout for any updates or comments from officials on the U S  China trade war tomorrow 
There was pessimism about progress today after CNBC reported that a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was  highly unlikely  before the March 1 deadline set by the U S  for reaching a trade deal 
But there were signals Thursday that the tariff increases could be delayed 
Often when the market struggles following discouraging trade news  bulls can count on a tweet from Trump or optimistic comments from administration officials to spark hopes for progress ",2019-02-07,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1772708,1772708

The Dow plummeted Wednesday as U S  China trade war uncertainty mounts amid broader global economic worries  Wall Street and investors were also likely nervous to see the yield on the 10 year U S  Treasury note slip below 2 year yields  This so called yield curve inversion happened for the first time since 2007  which has some worried about a pending recession 
Many analysts  traders  and economists view the inverted yield curve as a recession warning  But these signs may have become less reliable due to the Federal Reserve s quantitative easing  Meanwhile  shares of Macy s fell 5  Thursday morning after they tumbled Wednesday following disappointing quarterly financial results  Macy s has failed to impress investors and attract shoppers in the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   age  with J C  Penney   NYSE JCP    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    and other department stores facing similar struggles

114727,336242,HAS,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  United States Cellular  Kirkland Lake Gold  Hasbro And Molina Healthcare,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   July 30  2019   Stocks in this week s article are United States Cellular Corporation   NYSE USM    Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd    TSX KL    Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS   and Molina Healthcare  Inc    NYSE MOH   Bet on These 4 Liquid Stocks for a Lucrative PortfolioLiquidity is an important yardstick that investors should pay attention to  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately

However  that top Zacks Industry Rank only popped higher in the last three weeks 
That is one tell 
This current industry rise is about a batch of super strong Q2 earnings reports

114730,336245,HAS,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Hasbro  HAS ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this toy maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Hasbro is 9 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 22 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 20 8  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Hasbro has an S TA ratio of 0 9  which means that the company gets  0 9 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 78  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Hasbro looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 8 9  this year versus the industry average of 4 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Hasbro  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Hasbro a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Hasbro well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-hasbro-has-200449036,200449036

114751,336266,HAS,CBS CEO Moonves resigns amid new allegations of sexual misconduct,news,By Kenneth Li  Reuters    Leslie Moonves  the top executive at CBS Corp  NYSE CBS  since 2006 and a major figure at the broadcast network and media company for more than two decades  resigned on Sunday amid a new wave of allegations against him of sexual assault and harassment  His departure as chairman  CEO and president was confirmed by the company in a statement coinciding with its announcement of a deal to end litigation against majority CBS shareholder Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc for control of CBS  Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello will take over as interim CEO as the board searches for a replacement  according to the announcement  The settlements end years of uncertainty over the future of CBS and could potentially open the door to future deals  The announcement came after six more women accused Moonves of sexual assault and harassment in a report published on Sunday in the New Yorker magazine  The newly disclosed incidents  which the women said occurred between the 1980s and early 2000s  included claims of forced sex  Moonves exposing himself and his alleged use of physical violence and intimidation   Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am  Effective immediately I will no longer be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CBS   Moonves said in a statement on Sunday   Moonves  who turned CBS from an aging radio and TV broadcaster into a successful provider of shows to digital platforms  was expected to reap an estimated  100 million in severance  But Moonves  68  could end up with nothing pending an investigation into the allegations of violence against women conducted by law firms hired by an independent committee of the CBS board of directors  CBS said it and Moonves will donate  20 million of Moonves  severance to organizations supporting the  MeToo movement   Today s resolution will benefit all shareholders  allowing us to focus on the business of running CBS   and transforming it for the future   Redstone said in a statement   We are confident in Joe s ability to serve as acting CEO and delighted to welcome our new directors  who bring valuable and diverse expertise and a strong commitment to corporate governance   National Amusements agreed to avoid pressing for a merger of CBS and Viacom  which is also controlled by National Amusements  for at least two years  In earlier court filings  NAI had dropped support for a deal before it was sued in May by CBS for control of the company  The settlement does not preclude other parties from suggesting a merger or bringing other potential transactions to the board  one source said  Five current independent directors and one National Amusements affiliated director have stepped down from the board of directors and six new directors have been elected  the company said  Three of the new board members are women  each considered a trailblazer in their respective fields  bringing the total to six on the 13 member board  They are  Candace Beinecke  a senior partner at international law firm Hughes Hubbard   Reed  Barbara Byrne  a retired vice chairman of investment banking at  Barclays   LON BARC   and Susan Schuman  CEO of SYPartners  a business consultancy  Also new to the board are  Richard Parsons  former chairman of  Citigroup   NYSE C  and Time Warner  Brian Goldner  CEO of Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   and Strauss Zelnick  CEO of Take Two Interactive TTWO O  CBS said the board will schedule its annual shareholders meeting no later than Nov  30   DAMAGE DONE  Reports of a potential big payout to Moonves drew fire from advocacy groups   CBS  as you sit in a room debating next steps to rectify the damage done  remember that the world is watching  We will accept nothing less than full transparency of the investigation s findings  a commitment to real change across all levels of CBS management and no reward for Les Moonves   Time s Up  a campaign against workplace sexual misconduct  said in a statement  CBS said details of the litigation settlement and the Moonves agreement will be disclosed in an upcoming regulatory filing  In a statement to the New Yorker  Moonves acknowledged three of the newly described encounters  but said they were consensual   Full Story   The appalling accusations in this article are untrue   Moonves told the New Yorker   What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS  And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women   CBS said on Sunday it takes such allegations very seriously   The CBS Board of Directors is committed to a thorough and independent investigation of the allegations  and that investigation is actively underway   the media company s board said in a statement   This version of the story has been refiled to correct last name of Chief

114754,336269,HAS,Hasbro  HAS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 51 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 3  
Revenues are expected to be  966 76 million  up 6 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro 
For Hasbro  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hasbro would post a loss of  0 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 21  delivering a surprise of  362 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hasbro doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hasbro-has-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200440187,200440187

matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

114764,336279,HAS,Bet On These 4 Liquid Stocks For A Lucrative Portfolio,opinion,Liquidity is an important yardstick that investors should pay attention to  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see   Growth Score less than or equal to B Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other

Beyond Earnings Growth  Bet on Earnings Beats for These 5 Stocks
 Plain and simple earnings growth may no longer entice investors  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big it is  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most and leads one to a lucrative investment 
What is Earnings Beat 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
This is because investors always try to take positions ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with stellar performances  Now  since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation  their estimates act as investment leads 
Why to Give Earnings Beat So Much of Precedence 
After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt 
Also  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s consistency in surpassing estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release

114798,336313,HAS,Solid Demand For Educational Toys To Drive Toys   Games Industry,opinion,The  industry comprises companies that design  manufacture and sell various games and toys  While traditional toymakers primarily focus on marketing and selling action figures  accessories  dolls  youth electronics  and arts and crafts  a few companies also develop and market content as well as services on video game consoles  personal computers and mobile Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Amid the decline in sales of traditional toys  robust demand for educational toys comes as a ray of hope for the industry  Per Market Study Report  the educational toys market is likely to witness CAGR of approximately 5 2  over the next five years  The global educational toys industry is likely to garner  34 200 million in revenues by 2024  a sharp increase from  21 991 48 million in 2015  Rise in demand for architectural  visual programming and eco friendly toys is driving growth of the educational toys market  The Toys  R  Us bankruptcy in September 2017 had left toymakers like Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   Inc   HAS   Mattel  NASDAQ MAT   Inc   MAT  and JAKKS Pacific  JAKK  in a mess  Adding to the woes  Toys  R  US liquidated its U S  operations last year that resulted in a tectonic shift in the retail landscape for toys  All these companies earned the majority of their revenues from sales to Toys  R  Us  Dissolution of such a big retailer affected sales of every industry player  Further  per   U S  retail sales of toys generated  21 6 billion in 2018  down 2  from 2017  Moreover  Innovation is the key to growth for the toy industry  Making toys that interest children and help them develop at the same time is a challenge for toymakers  Intense competition from a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment  including video games  MP3 players  tablets  smartphones and other electronic devices is a pressing concern  In order to fight the sales slump owing to the liquidation of Toys  R  Us  industry players are banking on new distribution methods  development of digital play components  exploration of ventures with other industries and focusing on international expansion  The industry has enormous growth potential in China and Brazil as both the countries have a huge population of kids aged 0 to 14 years  Per U S  Toy Industry Association  out of Brazil s population of 200 million  45 7 million are children under 14 years  Meanwhile  China has 236 million kids below 14 years  Emerging markets offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets  Though traditional toy makers are struggling at the moment  video game developers like Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   Inc   ATVI   Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA   EA  and

114813,336328,HAS,5 Top S P 500 Stocks To Fly High Despite Market Volatility,opinion,After posting an impressive rally in the first four months of 2019  Wall Street faced a severe downturn in May  Abrupt breakdown of U S  China trade negotiations plus several weak economic data of April and May dented investors  confidence to a large extent  However  the situation improved in the beginning of June after the Fed Chairman s indication of a possible cut in benchmark interest rate The benchmark S P 500 Index followed the same pattern  During the first four months of this year  the index recorded the largest gain in 30 years  In May  it plunged only to recover some lost ground in the first week of June U S  China Trade Conflict ContinuesSo far  the U S  government has imposed 25  tariffs on  250 billion Chinese goods while China has retaliated with 25  tariff on  170 billion of U S  exports  It does not stop there  President Trump has expressed his desire to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion Chinese products  if the Chinese President fail to meet him in a negotiation during upcoming G 20 summit Additionally  on May 15  the Trump administration blacklisted Chinese behemoth Huawei Technologies from doing business with U S  counterparts  As a retaliatory move  China has decided to stop exporting rare earth minerals to the United States These are crucial inputs for developing high tech products like smartphones  computer memory chips and rechargeable batteries as well as defense related aerospace products  China has a near monopoly of producing these minerals and almost 80  of these minerals are exported by China to the United States Fundamentals of S P 500 Index Remain StrongIn May  the S P 500 tumbled 6 6   Sudden break down of U S  China trade negotiations and Trump s threat to impose tariff on Mexico were the main culprits of the Wall Street rout  Notably  per Ben Carlson  of Ritholtz Wealth Management  a pullback of 5  or more in a month on the S P 500 Index happened in 65 of the last 70 years  So  a sudden shock last month may well be the much needed correction to the four month long rally However  the broad market index recovered the lost ground to a large extent with a gain of 4 4  in the first week of June  The turnaround of the index was primarily owing to strong market expectation of a rate cut by the Fed  Year to date  the index is up a significant 15 2  On Jun 10  the S P 500 climbed 0 5  to close at 2 886 73  This is higher than both the 200 day and 50 day moving averages of 2 775 04 and 2 871 90  respectively  for the index  These two technical barriers are psychologically important as they provide long term and short term support levels of the index  Moreover  the S P 500 is at present little more than 1 6

prominent peers like Mattel   NASDAQ MAT   and JAKKS Pacific   NASDAQ JAKK    Hasbro has been the first to gauge the disaster that the liquidation of Toys  R  Us brought  Evidently  Hasbro started testing waters with franchise partnerships and launch of digital games The company returned to profit in   after incurring losses in the trailing three quarters  Its shares have gained 30 2  so far this year  outperforming the  s 10  rally  Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been revised upward by 4 9  over the past two months  reflecting analysts  confidence surrounding its

which suggests that now is the right time to pick the stock Sales Building Initiatives to Drive Top LineHasbro has a supreme gaming portfolio and it is refining gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms like face to face gaming  off the board gaming and digital gaming experiences in mobile  Robust performances of DUNGEONS and DRAGONS  JENGA  DUEL MASTER  and DON T STEP IN IT bode well for the gaming category  Notably  gaming revenues increased in the International  and Entertainment and Licensing segments in the first quarter of 2019  Given a strong product lineup and a greater focus on entertainment backed products  Hasbro s Entertainment and Licensing segment is poised for growth Meanwhile  the company continues to invest in innovation  It partnered with Paramount to enhance storytelling and content capabilities  Also  the company invested in Boulder Media   its animation studio   and increased digital capacities to drive sales  Hasbro continues to release Transformers Franchise in all forms of entertainment   including movies  television and digital expressions  Given the company s several innovative and productive plans for Transformers franchise over the next 10 years  revenues are expected to grow On the product innovation front  Hasbro launched several social games  Among those  Dungeons   Dragons was particularly successful  With the launch of DROPMIX  the company further strengthened its digital gaming revenues Backed by these efforts  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hasbro s revenues in 2019 is pegged at  5 billion  suggesting an 8 4  rise from the year ago quarter s reported figure Cost Containment AidsIn the first quarter of 2019  the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased 10 bps to 35 5   Selling  distribution and administration expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  were 30 8   marking a sharp decline from 45 8  in the prior year quarter  The decrease in costs resulted from Hasbro s various efforts to channelize its products in a cost effective manner  Subsequently  the consensus estimate for the company s earnings in 2019 is pegged at  4 53  indicating 17 7  growth from the prior year quarter s reported figure Undervalued Compared With PeersLooking at Hasbro s forward 12 month Price to Earnings  P E  ratio  investors may be willing to pay more premium as the company seems undervalued compared with its peers  Its forward 12 month P E is 22 1x  which is below the high of 23 1x scaled over the past five years  The industry s ratio  on the contrary  stands at 25 9 Growth in Emerging Markets Bodes WellIn addition to growing brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses  Hasbro seeks to grow its international business by expanding into emerging markets in Eastern Europe  Asia  and Latin and South America  Emerging markets offer greater opportunities for revenue growth than developed markets and have been contributing to a significant share of Hasbro s revenues  given its investments in advertising and other brand building efforts In fact  despite difficult operating conditions in some key markets  Hasbro s emerging brands  revenues  excluding Fx impact  have increased consistently since 2012  In the first quarter of 2019  emerging brands  revenues increased 22  year over year  following gain of 5  in fourth quarter 2018  We expect the overall positive scenario to continue in 2019  Over the next few years  Hasbro expects emerging markets to grow in double digits  backed by innovation in products  entertainment and market

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG    Arconic Inc    NYSE ARNC    Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS    Illumina Inc    NASDAQ ILMN   and Jefferies Financial Group Inc    NYSE JEF   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Top S P 500 Stocks to Fly High Despite Market VolatilityAfter posting an impressive rally in the first four months of 2019  Wall Street faced a severe downturn in May  Abrupt breakdown of U S  China trade negotiations plus several weak economic data of April and May dented investors  confidence to a large extent  However  the situation improved in the beginning of June after the Fed Chairman s indication of a possible cut in benchmark interest rate The benchmark S P 500 Index followed the same pattern  During the first four months of this year  the index recorded the largest gain in 30 years  In May  it plunged only to recover some lost ground in the first week of June U S  China Trade Conflict ContinuesSo far  the U S  government has imposed 25  tariffs on  250 billion Chinese goods while China has retaliated with 25  tariff on  170 billion of U S  exports  It does not stop there  President Trump has expressed his desire to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion Chinese products  if the Chinese President fail to meet him in a negotiation during upcoming G 20 summit Additionally  on May 15  the Trump administration blacklisted Chinese behemoth Huawei Technologies from doing business with U S  counterparts  As a retaliatory move  China has decided to stop exporting rare earth minerals to the United States These are crucial inputs for developing high tech products like smartphones  computer memory chips and rechargeable batteries as well as defense related aerospace products  China has a near monopoly of producing these minerals and almost 80  of these minerals are exported by China to the United States Fundamentals of S P 500 Index Remain StrongIn May  the S P 500 tumbled 6 6   Sudden break down of U S  China trade negotiations and Trump s threat to impose tariff on Mexico were the main culprits of the Wall Street rout  Notably  per Ben Carlson  of Ritholtz Wealth Management  a pullback of 5  or more in a month on the S P 500 Index happened in 65 of the last 70 years  So  a sudden shock last month may well be the much needed correction to the four month long rally However  the broad market index recovered the lost ground to a large extent with a gain of 4 4  in the first week of June  The turnaround of the index was primarily owing to strong market expectation of a rate cut by the Fed  Year to date  the index is up a significant 15 2  On Jun 10  the S P 500 climbed 0 5  to close at 2 886 73  This is higher than both the 200 day and 50 day moving averages of 2 775 04 and 2 871 90  respectively  for the index  These two technical barriers are psychologically important as they provide long term and short term support levels of the index  Moreover  the S P 500 is at present little

Trade Spat  Declining DemandThe U S  China trade debacle has escalated since U S  President Donald Trump has lifted tariffs from 10  to 25  on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  China struck back with tariff hikes on  60 billion worth of U S  goods While the toy industry has so far been guarded from trade hostilities  the days ahead may not be as unchallenging  believes the Toy Association  This is because about 3 billion toys are sold in the United States each year  with 85  of those coming from China  In fact  per the U S  International Trade Commission  toys  puzzles and more were among the major commodities imported from China in 2018 Toymakers Have Reasons to FretToymakers are apprehensive about their profit margin  given the threat of cost escalation  Since the 25  tariff covers a good range of consumer products  it is likely to impact discretionary spending and in turn affect demand for toys Leading U S  toymaker Hasbro  Inc  has shown serious apprehension about the tariff implementation  The company raked in significant profits from China in the first quarter of 2019  Avengers and Bumblebee have seen strong demand in China  About two thirds of its total production originates from the mainland  which is concerning  Also  shifting the entire production base in the United States is a difficult task for the company at the moment However  the company has started limiting expansion in China  per Brian D Goldner  the chief executive of Hasbro  It plans to reduce Chinese manufacturing for the U S  market to less than one third within the next five years Nevertheless  given China s solid supply chain  high quality product and prudent pricing  Hasbro will continue to manufacture in the country  The company plans to market the products in emerging countries like India and Vietnam Mattel  Inc has been suffering massive losses and the situation is expected to worsen if tariffs are imposed on China produced toys  The company relies heavily on China as up to 65  of its production is based there  Per Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz  bumped up costs due to tariffs will not only hurt the company but also drive away vendors  retailers and consumers Everything Else That s Not RightApart from the trade hostility  the industry is grappling with soft consumer demand  The liquidation of Toys  R  Us  the largest retailer for traditional toys  has been weighing on companies like Hasbro  Mattel and JAKKS Pacific for long  The industry is expected to grow at a much slower pace for some time Meanwhile  toy manufacturers battle stiff competition from a broad array of alternative modes of entertainment including MP3 players  tablets  smartphones and other electronic devices  Video game developers such as Electronic Arts also pose a threat to traditional toymakers Another factor affecting demand for these brands is age compression  Kids nowadays are move on much faster and get bored easily  For instance  demand for some toys that were preferred by kids aged three to nine years has narrowed down to the band of three to six Our TakeWhile the overall near term scenario for the toy industry is not perky  the silver lining rests on the fact that these companies are trying to foray into markets beyond China and the United States  Demand for toys in the emerging markets has gone up significantly  signaling untapped opportunity for toymakers Moreover  most toys have been shipped before the new tariff implementation  which suggests that toymakers may not face dearth of demand this year after all The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of

114823,336338,HAS,Lego builds foundations in China classrooms as old markets slow,news,"By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    Danish toymaker Lego is hoping to build a following with Chinese parents by promoting its place in the classroom as well as the toy box  The firm  famous for its brightly colored building blocks  is working with local education departments  state schools and the private education providers to get kids playing with Lego as a way to boost motor skills  creativity and attention spans  The educational push in China goes beyond what Lego does in other markets  in part a nod to the country s disciplined focus on learning but also a reflection of how the market is booming in importance as growth in the United States and Europe slows  It also taps into the desires of Chinese parents to give their children a competitive edge   even at a young age  Deng Xianyu  48  has been buying her 8 year old son Lego blocks since he was 2 and now sends him to Lego classes every weekend  She said she likes that the students learn specific skills such as computing and science as they play   If it was just putting blocks together  I don t think that would be totally necessary   said Deng Xianyu  48   But I think it is great that they do coding  as part of the  classes   The focus on learning  in a market notorious for its rigid exam oriented education system and piles of homework  could help Lego in China as business elsewhere softens  In September  Lego said it would lay off 8 percent of its staff and revamp its business after reporting its first sales decline in more than a decade  with weakness especially in the United States and Europe  Its most recent revenue figures  for the first half of 2017  showed a decline of 5 percent to 14 9 billion Danish krone   2 5 billion at the current exchange rate  compared with the same period in 2016  China s toy market was estimated at about  9 6 billion last year  growing close to 10 percent against 2016  according to the China Toy and Juvenile Products Association  And the preschool segment of its for profit education market alone is expected to reach 540 billion yuan   85 20 billion  by 2020  In China  Lego competes with the likes of  Mattel Inc   O MAT    Hasbro Inc   O HAS  and local market leader Alpha Group  SZ 002292   It opened a local plant in 2016 and last month signed a deal with tech giant Tencent  HK 0700  to develop games  Education with a streak of fun is also an attractive goal for local education bodies and schools as they look to broaden their curriculums   We see that there s a lot of interest in terms of in the government and interest in educational communities to develop children s creativity  to develop some of the soft skills like global collaboration  problem solving  communication   Lego s chief marketing officer  Julia Goldin  told Reuters in Beijing   These are  of course  all the skills that they develop through Lego   TIME TO PLAY  The building blocks are especially attractive to younger parents in major cities  who are more receptive to the Western idea of  free play    especially if it comes with an educational sheen  Kevin Xing  a translator in Beijing  spends 10 000 yuan per year sending his six year old son to classes at a Lego training center  In 2016  the two traveled to Shanghai for a Lego building competition   Practically speaking  it s not like piano  taekwondo or English classes   you don t see an immediately tangible impact with Lego right away   said Xing  adding that he was motivated more by his son s enjoyment and long term development    So I keep paying for  the classes  anyway   he said  Lego  via its education arm   which it says is kept separate from its commercial toy business   and major shareholder Lego Foundation work with academic centers such as Beijing s Tsinghua University and other education bodies  China s Ministry of Education and Lego also collaborated on an  innovative talents training program   in which more than 10 000 grade school teachers take part annually    We are engaging with the government   Jacob Kragh  general manager of Lego in China  told Reuters in an interview in Beijing  adding this was mostly related to  curriculum development and teacher training   The education business aims to  generate a new and more progressive way of teaching science  technology  engineering  and math    highly prized subjects in China often studied by the country s political and business elite  That could be of interest to parents who are worried about their children falling behind in a highly competitive school system   Kids still live in a very rigid system where they are sleep deprived and don t have much time to play   said Yang Dongping  dean of Beijing based 21st Century Education Research Institute  Tu Qiaoliu  a primary school teacher in the port city of Ningbo  said her school had created a Lego project with one giant wall and smaller ones for each class   We chose Lego because teachers believe the toys can help kids grow and develop   she said  Lego China head Kragh said the education business did not actively try to sell Legos to consumers  But parents said there was a clearly pressure to buy if their kids enjoyed the classes  A box of Lego classic blocks with 790 pieces costs 499 yuan   78 82  at Lego s official China online store on Alibaba s  N BABA  Tmall  versus  59 99 at its U S  online store   Though kids can play Lego in class  my son still asks me to buy him Lego when he gets back home   said Xing  the parent   It is quite costly     1   6 3382 Chinese yuan renminbi

114834,336349,HAS,Beyond Earnings Growth  Bet On Beat With These 5 Stocks ,opinion,"Plain and simple earnings growth may no longer entice investors  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big it is  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most and leads one to a lucrative investment 
What is Earnings Beat 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
This is becauseinvestors always try to take positions ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with stellar performances  Now  since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation  their estimates act as investment leads 
Why to Give Earnings Beat So Much of Precedence 
After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt 
Also  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s consistency in surpassing estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 5   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 10   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 10   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 5   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 11 
Here are five out of the 11 stocks 
OSI Systems  Inc    NASDAQ OSIS    This Zacks Rank  1 company is a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems  and components for critical applications in the homeland security  healthcare  defense  and aerospace industries  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 33    You can see

114849,336364,HAS,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Hasbro  HAS  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this toy maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Hasbro is 12 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 15 7  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Hasbro has an S TA ratio of 0 88  which means that the company gets  0 88 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 79  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Hasbro is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 8 2  this year versus the industry average of 1 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Hasbro have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Hasbro has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

114863,336378,HAS,Hasbro posts surprise revenue drop as Star Wars toys fail to shine,news," Reuters    Toymaker  Hasbro Inc   O HAS  reported a surprise fall in quarterly revenue on Wednesday due to a decline in sales of its toys based on the Star Wars franchise and the lingering impact of the bankruptcy of retailer Toys  R  Us 
The company s shares fell 3 2 percent to  90 94 before the bell  The toy industry was jolted by the retailer s collapse last October  forcing Hasbro  rival Mattel  O MAT  and other toy makers to find other outlets for sales during the all important holiday season 
The maker of My Little Pony and Nerf guns  had prewarned in October that holiday sales would be hit by the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us   one of biggest sellers of Hasbro s toys 
Hasbro has focused on linking its toys to big movie franchises like Star Wars and The Avengers  which have created a new generation of young fans through video games and apps 
However  2017 was the worst year for movie ticket sales since 1992  according to Box Office Mojo  as moviegoers lost interest in sequels  in turn affecting the market for toys based on movie characters like Iron Man and Luke Skywalker 
 A decline in Partner Brands and Europe revenues resulted in us not meeting our fourth quarter revenue expectations   Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said 
Net revenue from the company s partner brands unit  which includes toys based on movie franchises  fell 21 percent to  342 9 million 
 Our Partner Brands estimate of  8  could be too high as Stars Wars could have been below expectations   D A  Davidson analyst Linda Weiser wrote in a pre earnings note 
The Pawtucket  Rhode Island based company s revenue fell 2 1 percent to  1 6 billion  while analysts had expected it to rise to  1 72 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Excluding items  the company earned  2 30 per share 
Hasbro reported a net loss attributable to the company of  5 3 million  or 4 cents per share  in the fourth quarter ended Dec  31  due to a  296 5 million charge related to the U S  tax overhaul

114883,336398,HAS,Analysts Estimate Hasbro  HAS  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This toy maker is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  180  
Revenues are expected to be  673 77 million  down 5 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 43  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro 
For Hasbro  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of  1 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 33  delivering a surprise of  20 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hasbro doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-hasbro-has-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200407248,200407248

114891,336406,HAS,Toymaker Lego wins Chinese copyright case against brick imitators,news,"COPENHAGEN  Reuters    Lego has won a landmark case in China against two companies that manufactured and sold toys almost identical to its LEGO Friends range but branded Bela  the Danish toymaker said 
It is the first time that Lego has succeeded in a copyright competition case in China  where copies of its colorful bricks and figures have been a recurrent problem as it seeks to gain share in the  31 billion toys and games market 
Earlier this year  the Beijing Higher Court passed a ruling that recognized the Lego logo and name in Chinese as  well known  trademarks in China  putting the toymaker in a better position to act against infringement of its trademarks 
The China Shantou Intermediate People s Court had ruled that  certain Bela products infringed upon the copyrights of the Lego Group and that manufacturing and selling of those products constituted acts of unfair competition   Lego said in a statement on Thursday 
The court also decided that Lego is protected under Chinese  anti unfair competition law  for  the distinctive and unique appearance of certain decorative aspects of its packaging across particular product lines  in this case  LEGO Friends  
Capturing the imaginations of Chinese children with its bricks is key to reviving growth for the unlisted company after disappointing revenues in its core U S  and European markets has brought an end to a decade long sales boom 
Lego  whose name is derived from the Danish  leg godt  meaning  play well   is competing with Barbie maker  Mattel Inc   O MAT  and Hasbro  O HAS   the firm behind My Little Pony  for a slice of the Chinese market 
The case was filed against two Chinese companies  which had been manufacturing and selling Bela products that were almost identical to Lego s  They will now have to stop copying Lego s packaging and logos  it said 
 We think this is very important for the continued development of a favorable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market   Lego s vice president of legal affairs  Peter Thorslund Kjaer said ",2017-12-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/toymaker-lego-wins-chinese-copyright-case-against-brick-imitators-963821,963821

114915,336430,HAS,Sanderson Farms  Hasbro  BlackBerry  Twitter And Facebook Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   March 1  2019    Sanderson Farms   NASDAQ SAFM   as the Bull of the Day  Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BlackBerry Limited   NYSE BB    Twitter  Inc    NYSE TWTR   and Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 
 
Sanderson Farmsis a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and the Bull of the Day  As an Aggressive Growth Stock Strategist here at Zacks  I like names that have a lot of growth potential to them   SAFM looks almost more like a value play  but that if just for the time being 
Description
Sanderson Farms  Inc  is engaged in the production  processing  marketing and distribution of fresh  frozen and minimally prepared chicken  As a company  Sanderson Farms is committed to adopting a fresh approach in everything that it does  Not only where products are concerned  but company wide as well  Though the company has grown in size  it still adheres to the same hometown values of honesty  integrity and innovation that were established when the Sanderson family founded the company as a small feed  seed and farm supply business 
Earnings History
This is not what I expected to see from a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  as the company has missed each of the last four reports   The last two saw negative earnings surprises of 49  and 46  
Estimate Revisions
I see some crazy moves in estimates which may contribute to the shift in the Zacks Rank   30 Days ago  the current quarter was looking at a loss of  2 41  but that number was slashed to a loss of  1 82   
The next quarter was looking at a loss of  0 49 but that flipped to a gain of  0 80    That is a huge move higher 
Valuation
I know I mentioned that value players might like this  but they will hate the earnings multiple   I see a 120x forward earnings multiple and 85x trailing number   The price to book multiple  however  is very reasonable at only 2x   The price to sales of 0 8x is also very low 
 
Hasbro is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and in this Bear of the Day article we will take a look at why that is the case  The first thing I do when looking at a Bear is to review who they are and what they do 
Description
Hasbro  Inc  is a global play and entertainment company committed to creating the World s Best Play Experiences  From toys and games to television  movies  digital gaming and consumer products  Hasbro offers a variety of ways for audiences to experience its iconic brands  including NERF  MY LITTLE PONY  TRANSFORMERS  PLAY DOH  MONOPOLY  LITTLEST PET SHOP and MAGIC  THE GATHERING  as well as premier partner brands 
Through Hasbro Studios and its film labels  Allspark Pictures and Allspark Animation  the Company is building its brands globally through great storytelling and content on all screens  Hasbro is committed to making the world a better place for children and their families through corporate social responsibility and philanthropy 
Earnings History
I see a poor earnings history with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports  The most recent miss was a 20  negative earnings surprise and before that  there was a 13 8  negative earnings surprise 
Estimates Falling
This is the main reason a stock falls to the lowest Zacks Rank   I see the current quarter moving from a gain of 18 cents 30 days ago to a loss of two cents   That is a huge shift lower 
The 2019 number has also slid  from  5 14 to  4 49  
When estimates fall  the Zacks Rank tends to follow

BlackBerry Charges Twitter with Patent Infringement
BlackBerry Limitedhas reportedly filed a fresh lawsuit for alleged patent infringement  The latest litigation process involves Twitter  Inc  and follows similar such cases against Facebook  Inc  and others 
The suit filed in the U S  District Court in Los Angeles alleges that Twitter has violated six BlackBerry patents  including pioneering features like push notifications  mobile advertising techniques and the capability to silence notifications for a message thread  The Canadian technology firm has further accused Twitter of unlawfully utilizing some of the  functionality enhancing features  that made  BlackBerry s products such a critical and commercial success  to siphon off its customers 
In March 2018  BlackBerry had filed a patent infringement case against Facebook  alleging violations related to certain messaging features  including unread message notifications and messaging in games  It also accused Facebook of breaching its patents pertaining to security  user interface features  battery efficient status updates  timestamps and the act of tagging family and friends in photographs  This was followed by a similar lawsuit against Snap in the very next month 
Both these cases are still pending in the court as U S  District Judge George Wu allowed BlackBerry to pursue most of its infringement claims  It remains to be seen whether the case against Twitter is forwarded to the same judge as all the lawsuits are related to each other  Although the company spokesperson has refused to comment on this issue  experts widely believe that legal compensation and monetary damages are likely to be awarded if the charges are found to be true 
Incidentally  the stock has underperformed the  with an average decline of 28 7  in the past year while the latter fell 6 7  
BlackBerry exited its smartphone business in 2016  and has since focused mostly on software to manage mobile devices and enterprise mobility management  The company delivers one of the most secure end to end mobile enterprise solutions in the market through a broad portfolio of products and services  It offers an end to end software and services platform for the Enterprise of Things  which includes computers  vehicles  sensors  equipment and other connected endpoints within the enterprise that communicate with each other to enable smart business processes 
In addition  the company leverages its extensive technology portfolio to extend the best in class security and reliability features  These include a unified endpoint management solution that provides comprehensive multiplatform device  application and content management with integrated security and connectivity  embedded systems  enterprise applications and related services  With the rapid growth of connected endpoints  often referred to as Internet of Things  security has become increasingly important to thwart data theft  BlackBerry has created a niche for itself in this domain and seeks to strengthen its position with innovative safety features 
BlackBerry currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019

Who wouldn t  Our annual Top 10s have beaten the market with amazing regularity  In 2018  while the market dropped  5 2   the portfolio scored well into double digits overall with individual stocks rising as high as  61 5   And from 2012 2017  while the market boomed  126 3  Zacks  Top 10s reached an even more sensational  181 9

114919,336434,HAS,GW  Hasbro  Salesforce  American Express And Intuit Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 22  2019    GW Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GWPH   as the Bull of the Day  Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Salesforce   NYSE CRM    American Express   NYSE AXP   and Intuit   NASDAQ INTU   Here is a synopsis of all six stocks  GW Pharmaceuticalsjust delivered initial launch sales numbers for the first FDA approved cannabis derived drug  Epidiolex  which was created and tested starting four years ago for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy The company surprised investors and analysts with the launch which achieved  4 7 million in Epidiolex sales just for November and December  far surpassing the consensus of  2 5 million  Other key metrics in the press release on February 26              First plant derived cannabinoid pharmaceutical ever approved by FDA and first ever approved medicine in the U S  for Dravet syndrome          Approximately 4 500 new patient enrollment forms in first two month selling period          Over 500 physicians have generated dispensed prescriptions in first two month selling period          Demand coming from major centers of excellence and local epilepsy clinics          Pharmacy distribution network expanded from initial 5 specialty pharmacies to over 130 distribution points          Approximately 900 expanded access program and open label extension patients expected to migrate to commercial product by end of Q2 2019 According to Piper Jaffray analyst Danielle Brill  GW Pharmaceutical metrics indicate a  hugely successful  Epidiolex launch  The analyst noted that Epidiolex revenues of  4 7 million for the first quarter of commercial launch even beat her optimistic call for  3 7 million  In her post earnings research note titled  Epidiolex Metrics Signify a Hugely Successful Launch   Brill noted that Q4 was obviously a shortened quarter with the early November sales launch and including two holiday weeks  Refill rates were likely very low due to protracted initial turnaround times  The analyst expects to see  significant  revenue growth in the coming quarters and she reiterated her Overweight rating on shares as the stock traded 14  higher on 3X the normal volume on Feb 27  A Cannabis Drug Success 20 Years in the MakingGW Pharma was founded in the UK in 1998 by two physicians  Geoffrey Guy and Brian Whittle  Their mission right from the start was to research and develop cannabinoid medicines  with particular emphasis on ailments of the central nervous system  CNS   In 2010 they achieved approval in the UK for the first cannabinoid treatment for Multiple Sclerosis  This long track record of success gave US regulators confidence in the science and R D of GW When the FDA approved Epidiolex in June of 2018 for Dravet syndrome  they called it an  important scientific advance   And this paved the way for the US Drug Enforcement Agency  DEA  to move the drug to the safest level in the controlled substance classification system This is important because marijuana itself remains a Schedule I drug which means it is classified as having little medicinal value and could be dangerous and or addictive  Now  the first approved cannabinoid medicine is seeing sales estimates rise rapidly as other CNS health indications could be served by the GW pipeline  Some investment bank analysts see sales as high as  500 million for the company in 2020  That would represent a 3300  revenue ramp in just 2 years from 2018 s  15 million and means the GW pipeline could be poised for  blockbuster  status  or potentially worth at least  1 billion in sales  The CBD Free for AllThere are over 100 cannabinoid compounds in the marijuana plant that could be used for medicinal research  In a sense  GW Pharma could be seen as an important trail blazer with its successful approval and launch of Epidiolex  In two investor presentations I did for Zacks followers before the GW earnings report  I emphasized this  trail blazer  role and also the significance of insurance companies as key partners in the patient physician payer alliance  While there are over 20 FDA approved epilepsy drugs on the market  even the ones for orphan conditions like Dravet and Lennox Gastaut syndromes  the two that Epidiolex can treat  don t work for every family  So for patients and physicians to have the flexibility from payers to try the new cannabinoid treatments is a tremendous opportunity for all  including GW  The other larger issue I ve raised is that these stakeholders don t want to look for medical solutions in the wild west of CBD products now available on the internet without a prescription  For young children with specific diseases  there is  no supplement  for the tested and regulated efficacy  safety  and quality of a doctor prescribed dosage  To wit  when Justin Gover  the CEO of GW Pharmaceuticals  was on CNBC s Mad Money after the company report he explained to host Jim Cramer that  Epidiolex is different from other CBD options    We do real science and produce medicines with safety and efficacy    Epidiolex is not marijuana  it is CBD approved by the FDA  We re only reporting two months of sales  so some caution is warranted    we re at the beginning of the journey with Epidiolex and looking at other uses for it   After the report  i bank Stifel Nicolaus raised their sales estimate for this year from  122 million to  136 5 million  And they raised their PT from  179 to  191  I was telling long term healthcare investors 2 weeks ago to consider nibbling on some shares under  150  I wish I had myself  This will be one to accumulate on pullbacks as the science and the sales have proven worthy of a blockbuster trajectory  Hasbrois a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and in this Bear of the Day article we will take a look at why that is the case  The first thing I do when looking at a Bear is to review who they are and what they do DescriptionHasbro  Inc  is a global play and entertainment company

three of the last four reports  The most recent miss was a 20  negative earnings surprise and before that  there was a 13 8  negative earnings surprise Estimates FallingThis is the main reason a stock falls to the lowest Zacks Rank   I see the current quarter moving from a gain of 18 cents 30 days ago to a loss of two cents   That is a huge shift lower The 2019 number has also slid  from  5 14 to

Salesforce offers software and web based services that allow companies to operate in today s connected age  which is hardly cyclical or trendy   Companies across every industry  in every geography

114941,336456,HAS,Earnings Preview  Hasbro  HAS  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27  
Revenues are expected to be  1 52 billion  down 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9 2  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro 
For Hasbro  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 47  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of  2 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  13 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hasbro doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-hasbro-has-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200382681,200382681

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  20 83   A quarter ago  it was expected that this toy maker would post earnings of  2 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  13 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Hasbro  which belongs to the Zacks Toys   Games   Hobbies industry  posted revenues of  1 39 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 83   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 60 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Hasbro shares have added about 11 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8  
What s Next for Hasbro 
While Hasbro has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hasbro was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 18 on  747 16 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 14 on  5 14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Toys   Games   Hobbies is currently in the top 12  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hasbro-has-q4-earnings-and-revenues-miss-estimates-200385686,200385686

114968,336483,HAS,Estimize s Expected Earnings Surprises For The Second Peak Week,opinion,"Before we visit this week s expected earnings and revenue beats and misses  let s quickly recap our picks from last week 
Last week our data pointed to Grubhub Inc  NYSE GRUB   Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD   Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  and Align Technology Inc  NASDAQ ALGN  all as potential beats on the top and bottom line  all did exactly that  with the exception of Twitter which reported in line on EPS  As for the misses  toymakers HAS and MAT were both expected to be losers  but in fact  Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  was able to put up a beat  while Mattel Inc  NASDAQ MAT did in fact miss  SAVE was also expected to be a miss  but eked out a positive surprise on profits  but missed on revenues 
Now onto our picks for the second peak week of the Q2 2018 earnings season 
The Beats
To determine possible positive surprises we look for companies that have the following characteristics  1  Large positive deltas vs  Wall Street 2  Significant upward revisions momentum into the report 3  Positive YoY growth expectations 4  A long history of beating 5  A long history of Estimize accuracy vs  the Street 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT 
Industrials   Machinery   Reports July 30  before the open 
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share  EPS  of  2 76 when Caterpillar reports on Monday morning  revised upward by 12  in the last 3 months and 4  higher than Wall Street s  2 66  Revenues are also expected to come in higher at  13 83B as compared to the sell side s consensus of  13 77B  a number that has been revised upward by 5  since last quarter    Year over year  YoY  EPS and revenue growth are expected to come in healthy at 85  and 22   respectively  This is a name that tends to beat the Estimize consensus 74  of the time on EPS  and that Estimize is more accurate than Wall Street on 70  of the time on EPS and 59  on Revenue 

Caterpillar is often seen as a proxy for global growth  and after nearly two years of declining profits from Q4 2014   Q2 2016  the machinery company has been making a comeback due to the recovery of commodity prices and a strong global economy  After reporting a positive surprise in Q1  CAT significantly raised full year EPS guidance to a range of  10 25    11 25 from  8 25    9 25 due to increased sales volumes  better pricing trends  a strong backlog and growth across segments such as energy and transportation  What could possible dampen all of this growth  Tariffs  Caterpillar mentioned the negative impact steel tariffs would have on material costs during their Q1 presentation  and will likely address it once again on tomorrow s call 
Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU 
Information Technology   Internet   Software Services   Reports July 31  after the close 
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share  EPS  of  2 77 when Baidu reports on Tuesday  revised upward by 8  in the last 3 months and 5  higher than Wall Street s  2 63  Revenues are also expected to come in higher at  4 1B as compared to the sell side s consensus of  4 0B  a number that has been revised upward by 7  since last quarter    Year over year  YoY  EPS and revenue growth are expected to come in healthy at 17  and 32   respectively  This is a name that tends to beat the Estimize consensus 59  of the time on EPS and 93  on revenues  and that Estimize is more accurate than Wall Street on 70  of the time on EPS and 85  on Revenue 

The Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  of China has put up triple digit profit growth and revenue growth of 27   in the last four quarters thanks to improved advertising in news feeds among other things  Ad revenues are expected to continue to grow throughout 2018 along with an expanding user base  The Chinese search giant is also investing heavily in AI technology to aid advertising efforts  by more appropriately matching ads to users 
Fortinet Inc  NASDAQ FTNT 
Information Technology   Software   Reports August 1  after the close 
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share  EPS  of  0 37 when Fortinet reports on Wednesday  revised upward by 14  in the last 3 months and 5  higher than Wall Street s  0 35  Revenues are also expected to come in higher at  429M as compared to the sell side s consensus of  425 5M  Year over year  YoY  EPS and revenue growth are expected to come in healthy at 38  and 18   respectively  This is a name that tends to beat the Estimize consensus 54  of the time on EPS and 73  on revenues  and that Estimize is more accurate than Wall Street on 73  of the time on EPS and 85  on Revenue 
T
This cybersecurity name continues to benefit from widespread data breaches  as corporations and governments increase spending on software to prevent future instances  Q1 saw impressive YoY EPS growth of 94   and revenue growth of 17   and although Billings missed the Estimize consensus  they were still up 15  from the year prior on the back of growing subscriptions  Fortinet is making significant investments in AI capabilities to help identify and respond to attacks more quickly and efficiently 
The Misses
To determine possible negative surprises we look for companies that have the following characteristics  1  Large negative deltas vs  Wall Street 2  Significant downward revisions momentum into the report 3  Negative YoY growth expectations 4  A long history of missing 5  A long history of Estimize accuracy vs  the Street
Papa John s International Inc  NASDAQ PZZA 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure    Estimated  to report July 31  after the close  PZZA has not confirmed yet  Estimate based on historical report date 
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share  EPS  of  0 50 when Papa John s reports on Tuesday  revised down by 11  in the last 3 months and lower than Wall Street s  0 52  Revenues are also expected to come in lower at  420M as compared to the sell side s consensus of  422 5M  a number that has been revised downward by 4  since last quarter  Year over year  YoY  EPS and revenue growth are expected to come in at  23  and  3   respectively  PZZA tends to only beat the Estimize consensus 50  of the time  and Estimize is more accurate on EPS 60  of the time  and 81  of the time on revenues 

Repeated PR gaffes by Papa John s founder and now ousted chairman have been detrimental to the company s fundamentals  After a controversial statement on the NFL back in November  and more recently the use of a racial slur on a company call  profits and revenues for the pizza chain have been slowly declining for the last two quarters  with no expectation to improve in Q2  North American System Wide Comparable Sales have been falling since Q2 2017  with the Estimize consensus calling for  4  in Q2 due to decreasing foot traffic 
Qorvo Inc  NASDAQ QRVO 
Information Technology   Semiconductors   Reports August 1  after the close 
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share  EPS  of  0 72 when Qorvo reports on Wednesday  revised down by 73  in the last 3 months and lower than Wall Street s  0 76  Revenues are also expected to come in lower at  642 3M as compared to the sell side s consensus of  655M  a number that has been revised downward by 14  since last quarter  Year over year  YoY  EPS and revenue growth are expected to come in at  17  and 0   respectively  Estimize is more accurate on EPS 71  of the time  and 81  of the time on revenues 

Despite beats from peers AMD  INTC and TXN last week  the same is not expected of Qorvo when they report on Wednesday  The semiconductor is anticipated to report a decline in YoY profits for the first time in over a year  mostly driven by gross margins which are expected to fall 7  for the quarter  Muted iPhone demand for the quarter is the main culprit of lower expectations  but many analysts believe that will turn around in the second half of the year  with profit growth expectations of 9  for calendar Q3 2018 and 18  for Q4  Analysts at KeyBanc  who recently upgraded the stock  think this is due to robust smartphone trends in China  improving iPhone demand  and increasing market share vs  peer Skyworks

114970,336485,HAS,Mattel Options Traders Target Rare Earnings Win,opinion,"Mattel  Inc   NASDAQ MAT  fell out of the gate this morning due to disappointing quarterly results from toymaking peer Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   However  the stock has since bounced back  adding 0 6  to trade at  14 30  as the company prepares for its own earnings release scheduled for after the close on Thursday  Oct  25  But even though MAT shares have a rocky post earnings trading history  options traders are betting bullishly ahead of the event 
Specifically  there s been very unusual activity today at the weekly 11 9 15 strike call  where almost 6 600 contracts have traded  compared to fewer than 300 at the next most popular option  Data gives the impression of buy to open activity  which would mean these bulls see Mattel stock rising above  15 over the next two weeks 
As was alluded to earlier  such bullish activity would be betting against a break of the recent post earnings trend out of MAT  The security has closed in the red the day after earnings in five of the past eight quarters  including a 4 2  drop back in July  and a 8 9  decline this time last year  Overall  the stock has averaged a one day post earnings move of 8 4  in the past two years  but this time around the options market is expecting almost twice that move  with traders pricing in a 16 5  swing for Friday s session 
Before today  options activity had been more of what you d might expect on the equity  That is  data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  shows put buying has almost doubled call buying during the past 10 days

114972,336487,HAS,Hasbro  Best Buy  Hess  Molina Health And Tetra Tech Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 5  2018    highlights Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   as the Bull of the Day  Best Buy   NYSE BBY   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onTop Zacks Stock Pick  Hess Corp    NYSE HES    Molina Health   NYSE MOH   and Tetra Tech   NASDAQ TTEK   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Despite selling on Friday  stocks posted a better stretch last week as investors looked to rebound from a largely brutal October  If a bottom has been found  major indexes could be in store for solid gains to finish the year  Nevertheless  companies with slumping earnings outlooks and questionable valuations should still be avoided Toymaker Hasbro looks to be one such stock  Hasbro makes toys  games  and various other entertainment products  and it certainly has an impressive portfolio of brands  From Nerf and Monopoly to Transformers and many popular licensed products  there is no doubt that Hasbro is a heavyweight in the toy industry But unfortunately  the company has hit a rough patch and does not look like a viable investment right now  We should start with its latest earnings report  which was delivered just two weeks ago Hasbro reported poor Q3 earnings  missing Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines  Earnings of  1 93 per share lagged the consensus by more than 30 cents and slumped 8  from the year ago period  while revenues fell 12  to touch just  1 57 billion  Analysts were looking for  1 71 billion in revenue from the company The toymaker has struggled since the liquidation of Toys  R  Us  and it has apparently not found a suitable replacement to that key retailer  Hasbro s balance sheet has also suffered recently  with cash and cash equivalents slumping to  907 million from the  1 24 billion it has last year around this time  The company is now facing long term debt of  1 69 billion Hasbro s poor quarter led to swift and noticeable adjustment to its earnings outlook for upcoming periods  as analysts were quick to revise their estimates to the downside  As the market looks to recover from a tough October  investors will be looking forward to the upcoming holiday shopping period and eyeing strong retail companies that are about to enter their busiest season  One great retailer that sticks out right now is Best Buy Best Buy is a leading retailer of consumer electronics and high tech home goods  It owns brick and mortar stores  online platforms  and the Geek Squad service unit  The company is in the middle of its growth plan  titled  Best Buy 2020  Building the New Blue  This program aims to explore new expansion and cost optimization opportunities  Best Buy is developing omni channel capabilities  upgrading its supply chain  and reinforcing partnerships with specific vendors  Moreover  the company is continuing to invest in core areas like appliances  health  smart home  and tech support  It is also rejuvenating its mobile phone department Now  an improving earnings outlook has earned the stock a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and recent pullbacks in the broader market have given investors the chance to scoop up shares at an even more reasonable valuation Latest Earnings   OutlookBest Buy reported its Q2 earnings results on August 28  The retailer notched adjust profits of  0 91 per share  easily topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 and improving nearly 32  from the year ago period  Revenue for the period was  9 4 billion  which also beat estimates and surged 5  on a year over year basis Enterprise comparable sales increased 6  in the quarter  adding to the 5  growth it tallied in that segment last year  Domestic comparable online sales surged 10   and overall  domestic comps were up 6  Best Buy s balance sheet looked healthy at the end of the quarter  The company had about  1 9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and just  801 million in long term debt  Management pledged to buy back a total of  1 5 billion worth of shares in the current fiscal year The strong quarter inspired Best Buy to lift its guidance for the rest of the year  Management now expected Enterprise revenue to grow 3 5  to 4 5   up from previous guidance of nearly flat to up 2   Earnings are projected to total  4 95 per share to  5 10 per share  which compared favorably to the Zacks Consensus Estimate  which stood at  5 01 at the time The strong earnings beat and guidance led to positive earnings estimate revisions  inspiring the company s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  position  But investors will find that there are at least a few more reasons to like BBY right now Additional content A

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Hasbro due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Hasbro s Q3 Earnings   Revenues Lag EstimatesHasbro reported dismal third quarter 2018 results  wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Adjusted earnings of  1 93 per share lagged the consensus mark of  2 24  The bottom line also declined 7 7  from the prior year quarter s number Net revenues totaled  1 569 7 million  which missed the consensus estimate of  1 714 million and also decreased 12 4  from the prior year quarter  The decline in revenues can be primarily attributed to the liquidation of Toys  R  Us in the United States  Europe and the Asia Pacific  International revenues  mostly in Europe  were impacted by change in consumer shopping behaviors Brand Portfolio PerformancesThe Franchise Brand posted revenues of  847 7 million  down 5  year over year  Notably  increase in sales at MONOPOLY  MAGIC  THE GATHERING  PLAY DOH and BABY ALIVE was overshadowed by a dismal performance at other Franchise Brands  including NERF  MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS  In the United States and Canada  Franchise Brand revenues increased marginally  The Entertainment and Licensing segment also witnessed an increase in Franchise Brand revenues  However  the international segment declined in the quarter Partner Brand revenues slumped 37  to  305 8 million due to a decline at all other Partner Brands except MARVEL and BEYBLADE  Apart from the United States and Canada  Partner Brand revenues declined at the International segment The Hasbro Gaming revenues came in at  280 8 million  up 0 2  on a year over year basis  Robust performances of DUNGEONS and DRAGONS  JENGA  DUEL MASTER and DON T STEP IN IT were overshadowed by the weakness at PIE FACE and other properties  Hasbro Gaming revenues increased in both the United States and Canada segment but decreased in the International  and the Entertainment and Licensing segments  Notably  the company s total gaming category in the quarter under review was up 5  to  447 8 million Emerging Brands revenues increased 2  year over year to  135 3 million Segmental PerformanceRegionally  net revenues from the United States and Canada segment decreased 7  to  924 2 million  The segmental performance was primarily impacted by the Toys  R  Us liquidation  However  operating profit margin expanded 260 bps year over year owing to favorable product mix and lower administrative and royalty expenses International segment revenues summed  560 7 million  down 24  year over year  The decline was primarily due to Toys  R  Us U K  liquidation and the company s efforts to clear unsold inventory in Europe  The segment recorded operating profit of  66 3 million compared with  132 million in the third quarter of 2017 However  the Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues grew 45  year over year to  84 8 million  backed by multi year digital streaming agreement for Hasbro television programming as well as revenues from 2017 My Little Pony  The Movie  Also  the segment s operating profit margin expanded to 39 7  from 28 9  in the prior year quarter Operating HighlightsHasbro s cost of sales  as a percentage of net revenues  increased 100 bps to 41 8   Meanwhile  selling  distribution and administration expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  were 17 4  flat year over year  Overall operating margin contracted 10 bps to 20  year over year in the quarter under review Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30  2018  amounted to  907 1 million  down from  1 24 billion as of Oct 1  2017  At the end of the reported quarter  inventories totaled  610 9 million compared with  629 1 million in the prior year quarter Long term debt increased to nearly  1 694 7 million as of Sep 30  2018  from  1 693 3 million as of Oct 1  2017 Hasbro s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 63 cents per common share  The dividend will be payable Nov 15  2018  to its shareholders of record at the close of business as of Nov 1  2018 In the third quarter  the company repurchased 801 466 shares for  79 5 million  At the end of the reported quarter   485 7 million was available under the current share repurchase authorization

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Hasbro has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-11-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hasbro-has-down-01-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound-200361510,200361510
114979,336494,HAS,MAT Or JAKK  Which Toymaker Has Better Chances Of Survival   revised ,opinion,"The U S  toy industry was shaken by the Toys  R  US bankruptcy that occurred in 2017  The overall industry started regaining its strength but suffered a heavy blow when Toys  R  US liquidated its operations in the United States 
Being the largest toy retailer  Toys  R  US could not keep up with the changing dynamics of the retail landscape  where online shopping is being preferred over traditional brick and mortar stores  Subsequently  it faced intense competition from the likes of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Walmart   NYSE WMT    and failed to compete on price and shopping convenience  Toys  R  Us was burdened with  5 billion debt 
Leading U S  toymakers like Hasbro  Inc    NASDAQ HAS    Mattel  Inc    NASDAQ MAT   and JAKKS Pacific  Inc    NASDAQ JAKK   were much affected by the setback as a considerable portion of their revenues were generated from sales to Toys  R  Us 
Both Mattel and JAKKs Pacific currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Let s find out which toymaker has better chances of a comeback  You can see  
Where Does Mattel Stand 
Though Mattel has seen growth in its flagship Barbie brand year over year both domestically and worldwide  the company has recently lost its Disney Princess and Frozen lines to Hasbro  Moreover  Toys  R  Us used to constitute roughly 15 20  of Mattel s domestic sales  which need to be revived by the company 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 97 cents per share for the current year while sales are estimated to fall 8 4  year over year  Mattel s net profit margin in the trailing 12 months is a negative 18  compared with the industry s 6 2   Moreover  a negative return on equity  ROE  of 65 3  compares unfavorably with the industry s 13 5  
Mattel s suspension of its quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share  starting in the fourth quarter of 2017  did not go well with investors  Shares of the company have lost 24 4  in the past year compared with the  s collective decline of 19 1  during the same time frame 
Although Mattel is trying to focus on product innovation and fortify its digital capabilities  with better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives  we need to wait and see if the company can do better in the near term 
Is JAKKS Pacific Better Off 
JAKKS Pacific s scale is much narrower than that of Mattel  Further  the company s dependence on Toys  R  Us was much less  While this may be a reason for the company s better survival  we note that JAKKS Pacific is plagued with soft consumer demand  The consensus estimate for sales in 2018 indicates a year over year decline of 8 7   Additionally   current year loss is estimated to be  1 47 per share 
Meanwhile  the company has a negative ROE of 56 1  while its net margin in the trailing 12 months is a negative 12 2   The company s shares have declined 9 4  over the past year 
However  JAKKS Pacific has emerged as a diversified consumer products company  buoyed by a string of acquisitions over the past several years   We consider the company s ability to successfully identify  close and integrate acquisitions to be one of its primary competitive advantages  Meanwhile  JAKKS Pacific has collaborations with Disney  Skechers  Nickelodeon  Cabbage Patch Kids and Chico to manufacture toys  and merchandise related to these brands  The company recently extended its global master toy licensing partnership with Nintendo  which positions it better among peers 
Bottom Line
It is needless to mention that none of the companies holds any promises in terms of earnings growth in the current year  However  we believe that JAKK Pacific is placed better than Mattel when it comes to debt and dependence on Toys  R  US  Further  JAKK Pacific is ahead of Mattel in terms of product innovation and acquisitions  which may help it revive its flagging fortunes

115002,336517,HAS,Top Research Reports For Johnson   Johnson  Honeywell   Morgan Stanley,opinion,"Tuesday  April 24  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Honeywell  HON  and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Johnson   Johnson s shares have lost  12 1  in the last three months  underperforming the  9 6  decline of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  J J beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the first quarter and upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018  
Though quite a few key products in J J s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  the Zacks analyst thinks new products in all segments  successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top line growth  
J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions  Share buybacks and restructuring initiatives should provide bottom line support  Headwinds like generics  pricing pressure  sluggish growth in the Medical Device segment and soft global market conditions remain

Shares of Buy ranked Honeywell have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the last one year  increasing  14 9  vs  a  12 8  decline  Honeywell s first quarter 2018 earnings trumped expectations and rose 17 5  year over year  
The impressive performance can primarily be attributed to solid performances from each of the four segments of the company  The Zacks analyst likes the company s diligent focus on working capital management  free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet amid a challenging macroeconomic environment  
With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity  Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high growth regions  Also  the company s balanced mix of long  and short cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high growth regions auger well on a long term perspective  However  the company is susceptible to material price inflation  which might hurt its profitability 
 You can   
Buy ranked Morgan Stanley s shares have underperformed the Zacks Investment Banking industry over the last six months   6 2  vs   12 4    Yet  the company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  beating expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  Its first quarter 2018 results reflect a rebound in trading activities and improvement in advisory fees  
The company s efforts to lower balance sheet risk and strengthen wealth management operations along with cost saving initiatives will continue to support growth  While higher interest expenses and muted investment banking performance are expected to hurt the company s top line growth  lower tax rates will aid profitability in the quarters ahead  Also  it will continue enhancing shareholder value through robust capital deployment activities

115012,336527,HAS,This Stock Has Incredible Seasonality,opinion,"There is seasonality in the financial markets and then there is seasonality in the financial markets  And then there s Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  
What follows is based on original work from Brooke Thackery 
Two Seasonal Trends in Hasbro
As a though experiment  let s construct a simple 2 rule model for trading Hasbro  ticker HAS  using only a calendar 
Trend  1
 If the current month is January through May OR October  November or December
THEN Trend  1 equals 2 otherwise Trend  1 equals 0
Trend  2
 If today is the first or second trading day of the month OR today is one of the last 6 trading days of the month
THEN Trend  2    1 otherwise Trend  2   0
Putting these two trends together into a Model we can state that on any given trading day The Hasbro Seasonal Model can read 0   1   2 or 3
Does it matter  You be the judge 
Results
All results use price only data starting on 12 18 84 through 5 31 2018  No dividends  no commissions  no taxes  A summary of cumulative results appears in Figure 1 

Figure 1   Cumulative Results for Seasonally favorable and unfavorable periods versus Buy and Hold  12 14 1988 5 31 2018 
Figure 2 displays the  growth  of  1 000 invested in HAS when the Model   0 

Figure 2   Growth of  1 000 invested in ticker HAS only when the Model above   0  12 14 1988 5 31 2018

Figure 3   HAS only when the Model above   0  12 14 1988 5 31 2018 
Figure 4 displays year by year results

Before getting too carried away it should be noted that the Model   0 Version of this experienced a maximum drawdown of  60  in the Crash of 1987 and has had three drawdowns  including that one in excess of  40   for the record  buy and hold experienced a maximum drawdown of  75     Let s face it  most traders cannot  and probably should not  ride those kind of waves 
Summary
For the record  I am not recommending that anybody start actively trading HAS based on the calendar  Sorry folks   For Educational Purposes Only  here at JayOnTheMarkets com 
That said  there are two important points to consider 
 The results   generated using nothing but a calendar   are pretty amazing  average 12 month   gain    27  
 The results are also extremely      volatile  standard deviation of 12 month returns   35  with a maximum drawdown of  60  is NOT for the faint of heart 
Whether or not there is an actual trading opportunity here is a valid question and is not for me to answer 
The real point to consider is the underlying concept of seasonality and recognizing that the results detailed above  27  average 12 months  were generated using nothing more than a calendar

The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share  EPS  of  0 99 when Spirit Airlines reports on Thursday  revised downward by 5  in the last 3 months and 9  lower than Wall Street s  1 09  Revenues are also expected to come in lower at  845 5M as compared to the sell side s consensus of  851 8M  a number that has been revised downward by 1  since last quarter  Year over year  YoY  EPS and revenue growth are expected to come in at  13  and 21   respectively  SAVE tends to beat the Estimize EPS consensus 70  of the time but revenues only 35  of the time  Estimize is more accurate on both 60  of the time 

While most of the the major airlines beat Wall Street expectations already this quarter  Delta  United and American all mentioned the pinch of higher oil costs  While those larger carriers have options to hedge against higher oil prices such as passing those costs along to the consumer  Spirit really has no way to hedge as an ultra low cost carrier that counts fuel as it s biggest expense

2  Global stocks mixed

115077,336592,HAS,A Little Known Fact  Individual Stocks Exhibit Seasonal Trends Of Their Own ,opinion,"You have probably heard about the Halloween effect or the autumn rally  The former term refers to the fact that stocks on average tend to perform significantly worse in the summer months than in the winter months  the latter term describes the typically very strong advance in stocks before the turn of the year 
Both phenomena apply to the broad stock market  i e  the benchmark indexes 
A number of individual stocks have their own  seasons  
However  certain individual stocks can diverge from the indexes and exhibit seasonal patterns of their own  I will illustrate this with an example 
Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   seasonal strength from February to April 
I have picked Hasbro  a manufacturer of toys headquartered in Pawtucket  Rhode Island  US  You are very likely familiar with one of the company s products  Monopoly  a board game originally made by Parker Bros   
Take a look at the typical pattern the stock exhibits in the course of a calendar year  which can be discerned at a glance on a seasonal chart  The chart below is calculated by averaging the performance of the stock over the past 20 years  The horizontal axis depicts the time of the year  the vertical axis the level of the seasonal pattern  indexed to 100  

As the chart shows  Hasbro typically rallies very strongly in the three months to the end of April  but on the other hand the stock s seasonal pattern indicates that it tends to lose ground over the rest of the year 
The time period associated with the strongest seasonal performance is highlighted on the chart  It begins on January 31 and ends on May 2 
Hasbro s very positive performance at this time of the year diverges from that of benchmark indexes like the S P 500  In seasonal terms  the latter typically barely rises in February  while it usually displays significant strength at the end of the year 
How frequent were rallies in Hasbro during the seasonally strong period  After all  it is theoretically possible that an outstanding performance in just a single year was responsible for this strong gain 
Hasbro rose in 16 of 20 cases from January to May
The bar chart below depicts the average return delivered by Hasbro shares in the relevant time period from January 31 to May 2 in every year since 1998  Red bars indicate years in which negative returns were generated  green bars indicate years with positive returns 

On just four occasions the stock posted small losses   Source  Seasonax 
As can be seen  the green bars predominate both in terms of size and frequency  There were 16 rallies  while relatively small price declines were recorded in the remaining four years 
In short  the gains were widely distributed 
Take advantage of the strongest seasonal periods
As you can see  individual stocks can exhibit seasonal patterns of their own  This means that a great many more seasonal patterns exist in the stock market than the indexes alone would suggest 
Where can one obtain information on the seasonal trends of individual stocks  Call up  APPS SEASON  on your Bloomberg Professional Terminal  or enter the App Studio in the Thomson Reuters Eikon menu and call up the Seasonax App from there  You can select any listed stock by entering its symbol into the text field of the app and quickly identify the most promising seasonal patterns 
You can also examine how your preferred stocks respond to numerous events such as for instance the release of important economic data  or monetary policy decisions by the Fed ",2018-02-08,Dimitri Speck,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-little-known-fact-individual-stocks-exhibit-seasonal-trends-of-their-own-200288236,200288236

115105,336620,HAS,Here s Why These Toymakers Might Kill Your Christmas Spirit,opinion,As Christmas is just around the corner  investors might take more interest in the toys and games space  The holiday season usually marks the most profitable time of the year for the industry  with the second half of the year accounting for two thirds of net sales As per the latest report from The NPD Group  Inc  an American market research company  the U S  toy industry saw a 3  rise in its dollar sales in the first nine months of 2017  As per a July report by the NPD Group  sales are estimated to grow approximately 4 5  in the full year  Also  the release of popular flicks like Star Wars  The Last Jedi is likely to fuel industry growth However  leading U S  toymakers like Hasbro  Inc    NASDAQ HAS    Mattel  Inc    NASDAQ MAT   and JAKKS Pacific  Inc    NASDAQ JAKK   do not conform to the overall rosy industry background  Here s why  Toy companies like Hasbro have been grappling with declining demand for traditional toys for quite some time now The recent Toys  R  Us bankruptcy aggravated matters  The company saw a decline in quarterly revenues and operating profits in the third quarter  Hasbro had been selling roughly 9  of its total inventory at the chain  The bankruptcy filing could have left the company with  60 million worth of unsecured payments  In fact  it has disrupted Hasbro s growth plans for the holiday and has even paused shipments for a short period   Resultantly  the company expects fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 4  to 7  year over year  lower than its earlier projections We note that  with a market capitalization of  11 94 billion  Hasbro is on investors  radar owing to its size and liquidity  The company s earnings estimate revisions clearly reflect the disappointment among investors regarding the stock s prospects  Over the past 60 days  current quarter and year earnings estimates have gone down 8 9  and 1 2   respectively Further  shares of the company have underperformed the year to date  The stock has gained 23 2  as compared with the industry s growth of 44 6  However  in order to navigate the macro challenges  Hasbro focuses on innovation in products and major theatrical releases  Increased focus on gaming and strategic partnerships continues to be this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s key growth drivers Mattel  the largest toy retailer in the United States  foresees a weak holiday season as revealed in a recent regulatory filing  Despite owning prominent brands like Barbie  Fisher Price and Fijit Friends  Mattel expects at least mid to high single digit decline in 2017 sales compared to 2016 The company is anxious about its key retail partners opting for tighter inventory management  Moreover  Toy Box related challenges and certain underperforming brands are likely to dent the top line in the to be reported quarter Moreover  Mattel has been particularly affected by the Toys  R  Us bankruptcy as it resulted in a year over year decline in third quarter 2017 revenues and profits  In fact  since the company s gross margins included the associated cost of goods sold  the net sales reversal in Toys  R  Us accounted for approximately one fifth of the year over year decline in gross margin  The effect of the bankruptcy is expected to linger in the upcoming quarters as well The company reported a 620 basis points  bps  year over year decline in gross margins in the first nine months of 2017  This decline  owing to unfavorable product mix  higher freight and logistics expenses and lower fixed cost absorption  is expected to reflect in fourth quarter 2017 results as well  A persistent decline in the top line is likely to result in gross margin deterioration due to higher inventory write downs and discounts offered to clear inventory Meanwhile  over last 60 days  earnings estimates for the current quarter have gone down 30 8   The consensus estimate for the bottom line has declined from earnings to loss for the current year in the same time period  Also  year to date  shares of the company have lost 41 4  as against the industry s gain Hence  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company  which generally rakes in about 40  of its annual sales during Christmas  is likely to face a decline in sales and margins owing to the above mentioned dampeners JAKKS Pacific has also been bearing the brunt of declining demand for traditional toys  The bankruptcy also compelled the company to slash its 2017 guidance  JAKKS Pacific expects to incur a net loss and record negative earnings per share in the full year  Also  though the company continues to expect positive EBITDA for the year  the figure is anticipated to decline year over year  Though the company expects Toys  R  Us to be a healthier retailer 2018 onward  the near term effects of the bankruptcy and consequent pause in shipments might hamper JAKKS Pacific s performance We note that over the last 60 days  the consensus estimate for the bottom line has declined from earnings to loss for current quarter and year Also  year to date  shares of the company have lost 50 5   widely underperforming the industry JAKKS Pacific carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Even though the above mentioned stocks are likely to dampen investor sentiments  a look at Nintendo Co  T 7974    Ltd    OTC NTDOY   can be comforting  The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and its current year earnings are expected to increase 112 8  year over year  You can see Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at

115137,336652,HAS,S P 500 Futures  Third Longest Bull Market In History ,opinion,"Yields and Dollar climb as budget plan passes Senate
Banks rally on budget hopes
Global stocks continue to rise
Nikkei on longest win streak in nearly 57 years  Up 15 sessions in a row
Its all seems too unbelievable  The global markets keep going up  Forget the crash idea  the markets don t even pull back  Wednesday night  the S P 500 futures traded down to 2542 50 on Globex  and rallied up to 2561 50 on Thursday  On Thursday night the Senate passed a budget proposal  and the ES traded all the way up to another  new all time  contract high at 2571 75  Mitch McConnell  R   Ky    Senate Majority Leader  said  Passing this budget is critical to getting tax reform done  so we can strengthen our economy after years of stagnation under the previous administration   The dollar rallied and European shares advanced 
Just before Friday s 8 30 am CT futures open  total Globex volume in the ES was 270 000  On the bell  the ES traded 2569 00  rallied 1 handle up to 2570 00  and then dropped down to 2566 00  After the low  the ES rallied up to 2569 50  retested the 2566 00 level  and then rallied all the way up to 2573 25  With the exception of the two early drops  and a couple of 2 handle pullbacks  the ES went straight up  The problem was  if you didn t buy the early pullbacks  you were pretty much locked out 
Late in the day  the MiM was showing over  450 million to buy  and the ES dipped down to 2569 75 before flying back up to trade and close at another new all time high at 2574 50  News had hit that front runner Jerome Powell is likely to become the next head of the fed

Feel   Flow
As most of you know I love writing about that markets  but it s been getting harder due to the non stop upswing  As the title above says  the current rally is the third largest in history  Last weeks overnight selloff was just another short term blip on the screen that caught the short sellers with their pants down 
While I understand that my newsletter is not the most technical  it really isn t meant to be  Like  during Saturday s FX webinar  when Ryan Littlestone said he follows flow to help him make his trading decisions  While I am sure that is not all he follows its very much like what i do  I follow volume and news  My charts are imbalance charts  they show the the exact number of contracts that trade on the  bid and offer   and net it out  When I see the ES or NQ drop  and it shows big net buys  I look to be a buyer  I also look for retests  If the ES bounces off a low and comes back down  and I see buyers filtering in  that is my signal to get long 
I understand it s not the most technical advice  and I also understand that there are a lot more indicators traders can use  like moving averages  put   call levels  pivots  overbought and oversold conditions  old highs and lows  but at the end of the day  the S P has been going up since it made its low since March of 2009  and it really does not show any major signs of retreating  So for me  and I do make mistakes   I still believe that being a trend follower is the golden rule  Until there is a major structural change  or a war  I think it s going to continue to be  business as usual   an under invested public waiting to buy the dip that seemingly never comes 
Automation on Wall Street Is Coming Sooner Than You Think
An article on Bloomberg last week said it all  After the credit crisis hundreds of thousand of people lost jobs on Wall Street and in the financial sector  brokerage companies and banks  When the public questions why volume is so low  there is a good reason for that  All the new regulation shut down most  or all  of the bank prop trading desks  and hedge funds don t make money  Just think how many ES contracts JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   Goldman and UBS used to trade for their own account  Think of all the desks that used to make prices  and all the options and futures they used to use to lay off the risk of the position they took the other side of when a customer called up and wanted a price on 100 000 shares of IBM 
It s all gone  and no matter what President Trump says about lowering some of the regulations  it s not coming back  I still talk to  traders  at some of the banks  most of the guys that are left do not go to work to take on risk  they go to turn on the computers before the open and turn them off after the close  The computers make all of the trading decisions  I have always wondered how long the traders that were left would remain in those positions  but the Bloomberg story below answers that question 
More Wall Street Jobs Vulnerable to Being Wiped Out

200 Companies In The S P Report Earnings This Week
Our View  It s going to be a big week  According to FactSet  200 companies in the S P 500 are scheduled to report third quarter results  Of the S P 500 companies that have reported  three quarters have topped estimates  There is also a pickup in economic reports this week  and some fed speak

Our view  the S P  Dow and Nasdaq are all overdue for a pullback  but was that pullback last week  I don t think so  We are sticking to what we have been saying for weeks  you can sell the gap up open or the first rally above the gap  or just wait for a pullback and be a buyer  This party is not over

115138,336653,HAS,Profit From Retailers  Defaults With These ETFs,opinion,"The retail sector has seen a slew of bankruptcies this year and the scenario may continue next year too  As per Fitch Ratings   the sector is expected to again produce the most defaults at up to  7 billion  resulting in a 10  default rate   
With Toys  R  Us filing for bankruptcy  the trailing 12 month retail default rate was 7 3  in September  up from just above 5  in July and August  If we go by the article published on MarketWatch  the retail sector makes up about 30  of the defaults so far this year   with six issuers defaulting on debt totaling  5 billion  
The Toys R Us bankruptcy also spelt trouble for toy maker Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   which was down 8 6  on Oct 23  This is because Hasbro  from Toys R Us  It has also triggered uncertainty over when and how many toys would be shipped to the retailer in the fourth quarter or the holiday season 
Why Such Disaster in the Retail Space 
Consumers  tendency to shift to online shopping or  Amazonization  led many companies to invest in technology despite lackluster sales  According to Fitch   the overall  is expected to end 2018 at 2 5   equal to about  27 billion of debt  
Higher debt defaults   for the buyout effort   As per a source  the fourth generation of Nordstrom s founding family required around  7 billion to go private  Lenders called for a high interest rate  After four months of discussion with potential buyers  the asking price was settled at about 13   almost twice the average borrowing cost for a retailer  as per  
Moody s Investors Service rated most several businesses as  stressed   Although we noticed lesser defaults overall in the third quarter  38  belonged to the retail sector  compared with 17  in the second quarter and none in the first 
Players in the Likely Default Queue
Several companies are on watch by Fitch ratings this time  These include Neiman Marcus Group Inc   J Crew Group Inc   Talbots Inc   Lands  End Inc  and Cole Haan  PetSmart Inc   Belk Inc   Ann Taylor parent Ascena Retail Group Inc    NASDAQ ASNA    Tailored Brands Inc    NYSE TLRD   and J Jill Group Inc 
Against this scenario  many are skeptical of investing in retail ETFs like SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF   VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   and PowerShares Dynamic Retail ETF  PMR  
We thus highlight a few ETFs that could save one from any sudden downslide

Recap from September s Picks

Our Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio underperformed the S P 500 last month  The Model Portfolio rose 1 2  on a price return basis and 1 4  on a total return basis  The S P 500 rose 2 0  on a price and total return basis  The portfolio s best performing stock was Lennox International  LII   which was up 12   Overall  13 out of the 30 Dividend Growth Stocks outperformed the S P last month and 17 had positive returns

The methodology for this model portfolio mimics an All Cap Blend style with a focus on dividend growth  Selected stocks earn an Attractive or Very Attractive rating  generate positive free cash flow  FCF  and economic earnings  offer a current dividend yield  1   and have a 5  year track record of consecutive dividend growth  This model portfolio is designed for investors who are more focused on long term capital appreciation than current income  but still appreciate the power of dividends  especially growing dividends 

Featured Stock from October  Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS   97 share 

Hasbro Inc   HAS   global toy and game manufacturer  is the featured stock from October s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio  HAS was also featured as a Long Idea in June 2017  The stock is down 11  since then  S P  6   and the lowered valuation creates an even better buying opportunity 

Over the past decade  HAS  revenue has grown by 5  compounded annually while after tax profits  NOPAT  have grown by 9  compounded annually  per Figure 1  HAS s NOPAT margin has improved from 8  in 2006 to 12  over the last twelve months  Long term  HAS has grown NOPAT by 7  compounded annually since 1998 

HAS  return on invested capital  ROIC   17  TTM  ranks in the top quintile of our coverage universe and has improved from 11  in 2006

Steady Dividend Growth Supported by FCF

HAS has increased its regular dividend seven consecutive years and 13 times in the past 14 years  The current annualized dividend has grown from  1 44 share in 2012 to  2 28 share  or 10  compounded annually  Growing FCF has fueled dividend growth in the past  and we expect the same for the future  Over the past five years  HAS has generated cumulative FCF of  2 6 billion  20  of market cap  and paid out cumulative dividends of  1 1 billion 

Companies with FCF well in excess of dividend payments provide higher quality dividend growth opportunities because we know the firm generates the cash to support the current dividend as well as a higher dividend  On the flip side  the dividend growth trajectory of a company where FCF falls short of the dividend payment over time cannot be trusted to grow or sustain its dividend because of inadequate free cash flow

HAS Remains Undervalued 

Over the past three months  HAS is down 9  while the S P is up 4   This price decline gives HAS a more attractive risk reward trade off  At its current of  97 share  HAS has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 1  This ratio means the market expects HAS  NOPAT to grow by no more than 10  over its remaining corporate life  This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 7  compounded annually since 1998 and 9  compounded annually over the past decade 

If HAS can maintain current NOPAT margins  12  TTM  and grow NOPAT by 5  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  128 share today   a 32  upside  Add in Hasbro s 2 3  dividend yield and history of dividend growth  and it s clear why this stock is in October s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio

Bottom Line
A stock s market price is certainly not the most important factor to consider when considering whether or not to add it to your portfolio  and sales and earnings growth projections can prove to be tough to live up to 
Nevertheless  we can always use Zacks  proven methods of finding quality stocks  and these five companies just happen to be showing strength while also trading for under  10 per share

115167,336682,HAS,Ponies and princesses  Hasbro launches charm offensive for girls,news,"By Subrat Patnaik
 Reuters    Having captivated boys with its Star Wars figures   Hasbro Inc   O HAS  is turning to Disney Princesses and the launch of its first animated movie to arrest a five quarter slump in sales of its toys for girls 
The second biggest U S  toymaker has begun selling dolls from the popular Disney movies  Frozen  and  Cinderella  after wresting the lucrative license from its larger rival   Mattel Inc   O MAT  
Hasbro will also launch  My Little Pony  toys throughout this year  Chief Executive Brian Goldner told Reuters  as it aims to create a buzz ahead of the 2017 release of a movie voiced by Emily Blunt and Emmy award winning Kristin Chenoweth 
It s a strategy that worked well for Hasbro in the run up to the December 2015 release of  Star Wars  The Force Awakens  
 Getting it on the shelves early allows Hasbro to maximize the window in which it can sell   said Neil Saunders  chief executive of research firm Conlumino 
Of Hasbro s four distinct product categories  toys for girls have long been a weak spot  In a fourth quarter that delivered the company s biggest revenue growth in nearly five years  sales of toys for girls fell 17 percent 
Toys for boys accounted for 40 percent of Hasbro s revenue last year  The contribution from toys for girls   its third largest category  behind games   fell to just 18 percent in 2015 from 24 percent a year earlier 
A merger with Mattel  bringing Barbie into its world  might be one way to solve Hasbro s girl problems  Bloomberg reported this month that the two companies had held inconclusive talks about a potential merger 
Goldner  in an interview with Reuters  declined to comment on the report  Instead  he focused on Hasbro s plans to twin merchandise with movies 
Goldner  CEO since 2008  is no stranger to the screen  having brokered deals with several major studios for movies based on Hasbro s best known brands  He worked as an executive producer on the blockbuster  Transformers  series 
 My Little Pony  The Movie  is the debut animation production of Hasbro s in house film unit  Allspark Pictures  and will follow the adventures of Twilight Sparkle  Pinkie Pie and the other brightly colored ponies of Equestria 
Among the new toys slated for release are a purple dragon  Spike  and a winged foal  Baby Flurry Heart 
Speaking to Reuters  Jim Silver  editor in chief of toys and sporting goods review website TTPM  described the new dolls as having  a really modern  slick  cool look  
While analysts expect the ponies to sell well  a more immediate impact should be felt from the Walt Disney Co license  which includes dolls based on the hit movie  Frozen  
Leaving Barbie behind in fourth place  dolls based on  Frozen  princesses Elsa and Anna were second only to Star Wars on the  Top Ranked Properties of 2015  list compiled by NPD Group  a retail research firm 
 These products are already on shelves in the U S  and rolling out internationally   said Goldner   Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer indications are positive  
Stephanie Wissink  analyst with Piper Jaffray   Co  said she expected the license to earn Hasbro about  250 million this year and a further  375 million in 2017 
With most analysts expecting sales of Star Wars toys to be flat this year  toys for girls should contribute a larger share of Hasbro s revenue  A forecast from KeyBanc Capital Markets  for example  has the proportion rebounding above 20 percent in 2016 
The average forecast of 12 analysts covering Hasbro is for 2016 revenue of  4 7 billion  which would represent a 5 6 percent increase   the biggest  year on year  since 2011  Hasbro has not provided its own forecast

115171,336686,HAS,JAKKS Pacific Rides On Alliances   New Products  Fx Woes Stay,opinion,Multi brand toy and consumer products company  JAKKS Pacific  Inc    NASDAQ JAKK    is likely to continue growing on the back of its long term strategic goals  The objectives include expansion of its solid base of evergreen brands  entering into new categories  creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses  and developing owned IP and content However  the company faces challenges in the form of a difficult retail environment  rising costs  competition from alternative modes of entertainment and adverse forex translations Meanwhile  JAKKS Pacific continues to expect higher net income  earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales for 2017 compared with the previous year  Also  the company anticipates enhanced profitability in the second half of the current year owing to its efficient marketing undertakings and cost cutting policies Key Growth DriversGoing forward  we are particularly optimistic on the company s innovative partnerships and joint ventures that should help JAKKS Pacific gain market share in a competitive industry  Additionally  the company  strategic acquisitions is likely to aid in entering new categories Markedly  JAKKS Pacific s collaborations with Disney  Skechers  Nickelodeon  Cabbage Patch Kids to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands is also likely to drive growth  Furthermore  the company s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises are expected to boost sales as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity In fact  since the beginning of the year  it has entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines that are all set to hit stores in the near term and add to the top line  Also  despite lower sales in the first half 2017  the company expects sales decline in the second half to be more modest as it heads into peak selling season JAKKS Pacific also remains committed to diversifying its footprint outside the United States in various key markets and currently operates in 65 countries  worldwide  Notably  the expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence as well as customer base and thereby aid in growing sales  profit margins and the company s access to attract licenses Furthermore  in order to cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming  the company has introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games along with the physical toys  which would help the company  JAKKS Pacific s investment in digital innovation is also expected to help in brand building  besides helping the company to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative technology based gaming market Interestingly  JAKKS Pacific has realized the importance of online retailing and has shifted a great amount of focus to aggressively growing online sales  In fact  it continues to modify the company s sales and logistics capabilities in order to capitalize on this shift  Markedly  sales to online customers and the e commerce division of traditional retailers rose over 50  year over year in the second quarter ConcernsIt is to be noted that a challenging retail environment for toys due to lower consumer confidence remains a major concern for JAKKS Pacific as well as other leading toy makers like Hasbro  Inc    NASDAQ HAS   and Mattel  Inc    NASDAQ MAT    Currently  customers are reducing non essential purchases  which in turn is hurting toy makers  revenue Continuous competition from technology based gaming companies like Electronic Arts  Inc    NASDAQ EA   and Activision Blizzard  Inc    NASDAQ ATVI   has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like JAKKS Pacific Meanwhile  as the U S  dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies  the negative currency impact is likely to hurt revenues  given the company s considerable international presence  Moreover  the British Pound s plunge in value since the Brexit vote is impacting JAKKS Pacific s revenues  In fact  foreign exchange movements can be cited as one of the primary reasons behind the company s expectations of lower revenues in 2017 than the last year Additionally  the company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion  development of new IP and acquisitions  These initiatives are adding greatly to expenses without the offsetting benefit of having any material impact on revenue growth  Unless the trend reverses  the company s margins will remain under pressure  despite several cost containment efforts Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already

Total third quarter earnings for the S P 500 members are anticipated to increase 3  year over year  on 4 9  growth in revenues A Look at Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors  out of which eight sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter including the  space  Currently  the sector is placed at the bottom 38   10 out of 16  of the Zacks classified sectors  Nevertheless  the sector has gained 10 7  year to date  which is lesser than the S P 500 s growth of 14 3    According to the report  about 8 1  of the S

leading manufacturer of home appliances in the world that is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  We believe that volatility in commodity prices  particularly steel  might have adversely

115176,336691,HAS,Hasbro Q4 Guidance Drags Down Toy Industry  Toys R Us To Blame,opinion,"Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   reported third quarter earnings and revenues that beat Wall Street estimates on Monday morning  but the toy maker s updated guidance for the coming quarter helped send its shares tumbling  taking Mattel   NASDAQ MAT   along with it 
Hasbro s revenues popped 7  to hit  1 79 billion  while its earnings jumped 3   Yet  the year over year gains were ignored because of the company s new  lowered fourth quarter guidance  which cited negative industry trends as a major reason for its downward forecast  also read    
 As a result of the Toys R Us bankruptcy filing in the U S  and Canada  there was a negative impact on our quarterly revenues and operating profit   Hasbro s CEO Brian Goldner said in a statement 
Hasbro noted that the recent collapse of one of the largest big box toy retailers is expected to negatively impact its vitally important holiday quarter  after already suppressing potentially larger third quarter gains 
The company had been selling roughly 9  of its total inventory at the chain  The Toys R Us bankruptcy filing could also leave Hasbro on the hook for nearly  in unsecured payments 
Despite Hasbro s lowered expectations  the company still expects for its fourth quarter revenues to increase by 4  to 7   But investors are worried because previous Wall Street estimates for Hasbro s holiday quarter projected a gain of as much as 11 68  
 We are well positioned for the holiday  including good quality inventory at Hasbro and at retail  backed by strong consumer momentum   CFO Deborah Thomas said in a statement   We continue to work closely with Toys R Us as we head into the holiday period  
Hasbro s stock had gained over 26  since the start of the year  which almost doubled the S P 500  However  in the last 12 weeks  the company s stock price has fallen almost 8   which likely priced in fears of the now official Toys R Us based fourth quarter forecast 
Shares of Hasbro sunk over 8 50  Monday morning to hit their lowest point since February 
Hasbro s new suppressed holiday quarter guidance  based in large part on negative overall industry trends  caused shares of fellow toy making power Mattel to fall 
Shares of Mattel dipped over 3 50  and now rest close to their 52 week low  Mattel is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is set to report its quarterly earnings on Oct  26

115193,336708,HAS,Toy business attracts private equity as kids go green and retro,news,"By Jilian Mincer NEW YORK  Reuters    Striding confidently through Matty s Toy Stop in Manhasset  New York  Catie Tepedino  7  is the sort of consumer who may hold the fate of the U S  toy business in her own little fists  Finding that her top toy choice  Shopkins   tiny grocery store characters made by Australia s privately held Moose Enterprise   was sold out  Catie went directly to the Barbie row and picked out one of  Mattel Inc   NASDAQ MAT   s iconic dolls  Next stop  the arts and crafts section  where she selected an Alex Brands jewelry making set    I know the aisles here   the petite brunette confided as she navigated the store along with her mother  Victoria  And knows what she wants as well  the Tepedinos spent perhaps five minutes shopping  not counting the time spent answering a reporter s questions  Catie s preferences are a good indication of the state of the toy business  Though Mattel  Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  and Lego control about 40 percent of the U S  toy market  there s a growing niche for smaller companies such as Alex Brands that sell educational or environmentally friendly toys to delay the seemingly inevitable demand for electronic devices  That  in turn  has attracted investments from private equity companies including Propel Equity Partners of Greenwich  Connecticut  which since 2012 has been building a toy empire off of retro and  green  brands  buying at least 10 companies to date and bringing them together under the name Alex Brands  Other PE firms active in the sector include Winona Capital  the Friend Group and Topspin Partners  Propel s Alex Brands portfolio includes well known older toy names  including Slinky and Shrinky Dinks  as well as newcomers such as Citiblocs  which makes wooden construction toys  Both categories represent a trend among parents nostalgic for their own toys and keen on environmentally conscious products  and have helped weaken the grip of mainstream manufacturers such as Mattel and Hasbro   More toy company deals are expected in 2015  according to Reuters interviews with private equity firms  Targets may include Dallas based KidKraft  which makes wooden toys and furniture  industry experts said   There are times kids do other things  besides play with electronic devices  Alex Brands CEO Neil Friedman  67  told Reuters   We have things for them to do that make them creative and active   Friedman joined Alex in October as CEO after holding senior roles at Toys R Us and Mattel  Alex Brands  which reached a licensing deal in February with kids cable channel Nickelodeon  wouldn t discuss its sales numbers or future plans  But it s opened a new headquarters in Fairfield  New Jersey  and a new distribution center in Woodbridge  The goal for many of these smaller toy companies is to get large enough   around  200 million in sales   to be bought by the bigger brands or create their own publicly traded corporation      Propel partners Michael C  Cornell and John M  Belniak appear to be employing the same playbook they used as executives at Jarden Corp  which has acquired many well known consumer brands with growth potential including Coleman  Yankee Candle and Mr  Coffee  Jarden shares have risen almost 260 percent in the last five years       Both partners declined to be interviewed  NOT ALL CHILDS PLAY Toy brands large and small must still contend with a volatile selling season that relies heavily on gift buying around Christmas  Consumers are fickle  imitation is easy and electronic devices are taking center stage in children s free time  While worldwide toy sales are growing with the rise of middle class consumers in China and elsewhere  U S  sales are expected to increase only slightly to  23 9 billion in 2018 from  22 6 billion in 2014  according to Forrester Research      To meet demand for educational toys  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  recently launched a separate online sales department for STEM Toys   Games  which encourage math and science skills and include many smaller private brands including Milton Industries  founded in 1946  and Melissa   Doug    We know customers are interested in these types of toys  so we re making it easy for them to find them   said Amazon spokeswoman Lori Richter  Melissa   Doug  which specializes in wooden play sets and children s arts supplies  sold a majority share to private investment group Berkshire Partners in 2010  It s a popular brand at the Dolphin Bookshop in Port Washington  New York  which has a large selection of Lego and some of the smaller  private toymakers    We have a lot of people who ask for toys that are not made in China   said Debbie Klein  a bookseller at the store

Gold plunged by as much as 5 3  in a matter of minutes during early Asian morning hours as a bout of technical selling kicked in after prices broke below a key support level close to the  1 120 level  triggering fresh sell orders amid bearish chart signals 
Comex gold prices have been under heavy selling pressure in recent weeks amid speculation the Federal Reserve is moving closer to raising interest rates for the first time in eight years 
Prices of the precious metal slumped  27 20  or 2 24   last week  the fourth straight weekly loss  amid rising bets that a rate hike is coming in September 
Gold  which yields nothing and costs money to hold  is seen as a less attractive investment during times of rising interest rates

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  lost 67 points  0 3   to 21 513  the S P 500 Index was 3 points  0 1   lower at 2 470  and the NASDAQ Composite advanced 23 points  0 4   to 6 411  In moderate volume  821 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 7 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil gained  0 57 to  46 34 per barrel and wholesale gasoline was unchanged at  1 53 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  0 38 to  1 255 36 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 1  higher at 93 96 
Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS  105  reported Q2 earnings per share  EPS  of  0 53  or  0 52 ex items  versus the  0 45 FactSet estimate  as revenues grew 11 0  year over year  y y  to  973 million  compared to the expected  974 million  Gross margin came in a bit shy of forecasts  The company noted solid revenue growth in the U S  and Canada but some softness in economic conditions in Brazil and the U K  Shares saw heavy pressure 
VF Corp  NYSE VFC  59  posted Q2 EPS of  0 29  one penny above forecasts  as revenues rose 2 0  y y to  2 4 billion  topping the estimated  2 3 billion  VFC raised its full year guidance  Separately  VFC announced that its Chairman Eric Wiseman announced his retirement  Shares overcame early losses and finished higher

Existing home sales dip slightly more than expected  business activity continues to grow Existing home sales in June decreased 1 8  month over month  m m  to a 5 52 million annual rate compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a decline to a 5 57 million pace  and versus May s unrevised 5 62 million rate  Sales of single family homes declined 2 0  m m and purchases of multi family structures were little changed  and both were up y y  The median existing home price was up 6 5  y y at  263 800  a new all time high  Unsold inventory came in at a 4 3 month pace at the current sales rate  down from the 4 6 months rate a year ago  Inventory of homes for sale was down 0 5  m m  and down 7 1  y y and has fallen for 25 consecutive months  Sales declined in all regions except for the Midwest  Existing home sales are based on contract closings instead of signings and account for the majority of the housing sales market 
National Association of Realtors  NAR  Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said the previous three month lull in contract activity translated to a pullback in existing sales in June  Yun added that demand for buying a home is as strong as it has been since before the Great Recession  though interested buyers are being tripped up by supply that remains stuck at a meager level and price growth that s straining their budget 
The preliminary Markit U S   Manufacturing PMI Index rose more than expected to 53 2 in July  from June s 52 0 level and compared to the expected increase to 52 3  The preliminary Markit U S  Services PMI  Index showed growth for the key U S  sector this month held steady at June s 54 2 level  matching forecasts  Readings above 50 for both reports denotes expansion in activity 
Today s data kicked off a   which shares the stage with ratcheted up earnings season and Wednesday s Fed monetary policy decision  With no updated economic projections and press conference  coupled with the recently perceived change in tone  the Central Bank is not expected to make any policy tweaks 
Economic uncertainty has confounded the Fed  which may raise the risk of a policy mistake and or bouts of market volatility  while putting the potential for another rate hike this year into greater doubt  We re sticking with our forecast for one more hike this year along with the start of a gradual reduction in their balance sheet  believing the latter could come before the former  The long running bull market continues to show remarkable resiliency and we expect that to continue  However  risks have risen and a pullback is likely but solid earnings growth should continue to support stocks 
Treasuries dipped with the yields on the 2 Year and 10 Year notes rising 2 basis points  bps  to 1 36  and 2 26   respectively  while the yield on the 30 Year bond ticked 3 bps higher to 2 84  
Bond yields and the U S  dollar rebounded modestly from pressure as of late on heightened political uncertainty and mixed economic data  while the markets grapple with global monetary policy uncertainty 
Tomorrow s economic calendar will begin with the S P Case Schiller Home Price Index  forecasted to show the 20 city composite rose 5 8  year over year and 0 3  on a seasonally adjusted basis month over month in May  as well as the Consumer Confidence Index  with economists expecting a slight downtick to a level of 116 5 for July from the 118 9 posted in June  and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index will round out the day 
Europe and Asia mixed 
European equities finished mixed  with the euro retreating somewhat from a recent rally that came in the wake of last week s unchanged monetary policy decision by the European Central Bank  ECB  with President Mario Draghi noting that talks of tapering its stimulus measures will begin in the fall  The British pound gained ground to weigh on the U K  markets  along with the IMF s downwardly revised 2017 growth forecast for the nation  while Brexit negotiations continue to roll on and U S  political uncertainty festers  Bond yields in the region diverged 
In economic news  Markit s Eurozone Composite PMI Index  a gauge of business activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors  declined to 55 8 in July  from 56 3 in June and compared to the projected dip to 56 2  However  a reading above 50 denotes expansion  Automakers led to the downside on reports that the European Commission is investigating potential collusion between German automakers on technology amid the lingering diesel emissions scandal 
Stocks in Asia also finished mixed as traders await the ramped up earnings season this week  which will also bring a monetary policy decision in the U S  Political uncertainty in the U S  continued to hamper conviction  Japanese equities declined  but came off the worst levels of the day as the yen gave back some early gains  Shares trading in both mainland China and Hong Kong advanced on the heels of recent upbeat economic data  which helped overshadow lingering concerns about regulatory crackdowns  Weakness in oil and gas and financials weighed on Australian stocks  while equities in India and South Korea ticked higher  with securities in both countries remaining at or near record highs 
A relatively light international economic docket for tomorrow will include consumer confidence from Australia  the Import Price Index and Ifo business climate survey from Germany and business confidence and PPI from France ",2017-07-25,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-close-monday-mixed-200203099,200203099

 NEW YORK  April 14  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Thursday

inflation and the choppiness in the jobs market   said Sandy

strategist at the Milwaukee based M I Investment Management 
  It s a bit premature to think we re at a tipping point for
a contraction  but something like inflation has the potential
to become a much bigger issue as the year progresses  
 March Chinese inflation accelerated to a rate as fast as
5 4 percent from a year earlier  Hong Kong media said  Such a

4 GARP Stocks to Buy for Maximum Returns

	If you re looking to rake in the maximum returns from a portfolio of stocks that offers the best of value and growth investing  try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive prospects 

	Unlike a blend strategy  a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics
	The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth Metrics
	Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy 
	Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value Metrics
	GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered 
	Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening Parameters
	Along with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to make the strategy foolproof Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20    Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average   Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than M industry average   P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued  
	These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only seven 
	Here are four stocks that made it through the screen 
	Pasadena  CA based East West Bancorp Inc   NASDAQ        is the holding company for East West Bank  East West Capital Trust I  East West Capital Trust II and Risk Services Inc  The company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9 35  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see   Littelfuse Inc   NASDAQ       is a leading manufacturer and seller of fuses and other circuit protection devices  It has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 2 14  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 
	Pawtucket  RI based Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ        is engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of games and toys  The company has a Zacks Rank  2 and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 16 54  
	Covington  LA based Pool Corporation  NASDAQ        is the world s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies  equipment and related products  The stock has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 7 57  and carries a Zacks Rank  2

115282,336797,HAS,5 Stocks With Impressive Sales Growth Worth Investing In,opinion,A number of factors influence investment decisions  particularly when it comes to choosing stocks  While investors with a high risk appetite looking for higher returns seek sophisticated and complex strategies  those with a low risk appetite prefer conventional investment strategies based on solid fundamentals Conventional strategies can be banked upon in bearish markets as well  We have picked one such strategy that is focused on the sales growth of a company Sales Growth   A Key Financial IndicatorIn the current market scenario  characterized by changing customer preferences and habits  evolving needs  demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment  continued sales growth is crucial for the survival of any business  Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to boost sales Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that in cases where companies incur a loss  albeit temporarily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation  It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings  Thus  the P S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price to Earnings ratio  Sales growth alone  however  cannot ensure success  Consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more reliable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of

	Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that in cases where companies incur a loss  albeit temporarily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
	Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation  It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings  Thus  the P S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price to Earnings ratio 
	Sales growth alone  however  cannot ensure success  Consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more reliable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Choosing the Winning Stocks
	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening Hasbro  Inc   NASDAQ       operates as a play and entertainment company  This Pawtucket  RI based company currently has long term expected EPS growth rate of 11 7  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 American Airlines Group Inc   NASDAQ        based in Fort Worth  TX  operates as a network air carrier  It has long term expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 2 8   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

115284,336799,HAS,Why Robo Analysts  Not Robo Advisors  Will Transform Investing,opinion,"Robo advisors and Robo Analysts are both important to enabling wealth management firms to cut costs without sacrificing quality of advice  but the importance of a Robo Analyst to enhance the quality of investment advice shouldn t be underestimated 
Today  many of the tasks performed by robo advisors are low value added services such as determining and communicating asset allocation strategies  e g   60  equities  30  fixed income and 10  cash  
In fact  these services are so low value added that advisors cannot make money doing them unless they are bundled with higher value added services  The value proposition of a Robo Analyst is very different  That s because Robo Analyst technology empowers wealth managers to provide the kind of long term  value oriented advice that not only meets the fiduciary duty of care  but also provides peace of mind for both advisor and client  Specifically  by shining an analytical light in the dark corners of financial filings  Robo Analyst technology can identify many critical data points overlooked by most research analysts today  No longer must investors rely on the headlines or management manipulated earnings 
With new technologies  investors can receive a much fuller  more comprehensive analysis of financial filings  company profits and valuation so as to make better informed decisions than ever before  As a result  Robo Analyst tech raises the analytical bar universally  enabling investors to transcend the short sighted and high turnover trading mentality that  in the long run  does more damage to investors than good 
Robo Analyst Technology Brings Analytical Rigor Back to the Advice Business
It s no surprise that the market has become more focused on headlines and management manipulated earnings than economic earnings over the past 20 years  Management manipulated  a k a  accounting  earnings are widely available for free  They maintain a large presence in the media and are the focus of the always attention grabbing quarterly releases 
On the other hand  economic earnings  the truly comprehensive view of corporate profits  are hard to find and rarely free  because they have historically required considerable human effort to calculate  To be derived with integrity  economic earnings require rigorous analysis of every annual and quarterly financial filing  cover to cover  that a company has published for several years  For those not familiar with these documents  they average over 200 pages  can be as long as 1 900 pages and are filled with complex accounting and legalese 
Who has the desire to do this much work on one stock and or an entire portfolio of stocks  ETFs and mutual funds  How does one have time  with all the fast moving trades and constant news 
You get the idea  In fact  Wharton University s Brian Bushee published a survey of institutional investors in the  showing that only eight percent of investors performed this kind of rigorous work in 2004  That percentage is almost certainly much lower today 
Natural Language Processing Techniques
Given the disconnect between the importance of analyzing the filings and the number of people doing that diligence  it was only a matter of time before someone figured out how to get machines to do much of this work for us  There is still plenty of room to improve the natural language processing  NLP  technology utilized  and I m not sure it will ever be perfect  but we have come a long way  The technology is not fancy artificial intelligence software 
To the contrary  it can be built by pairing forensic accountants with programmers who can create software to track the parsing decisions of analysts as they analyze 10Ks and 10Qs  In our case  these decisions form the foundation of a library of human validated parsing instructions that NLP techniques leverage to teach machines how to parse automatically  The automated parsing tools are further enhanced by our ontology for translating raw accounting data into value added investment advice  In other words  we model the raw data and derive investment ratings to give further context and meaning when analyzing filings   a powerful intelligence feedback loop 
Humans continue to guide the parsing and model building process  as they have for the last 130 000 filings we ve analyzed  But their role is altered dramatically  as they can now spend more time scouring footnotes and the MD As for usual items and far less time on mind numbing repetitive tasks like parsing financial statements  In case you re wondering whether this extra high value time pays off  we can illustrate that it does 
Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  is a great example  The stock has more than doubled since our initial call in   During that time  HAS has grown economic earnings by 9  compounded annually over the past decade  while accounting earnings have grown at an annual rate of just 6   As such  and unlike most of the S P 500  Hasbro s underlying drivers of valuation are better than its top line metrics  This disconnect is driven in part by items such as a  the company took last year that artificially decreased its reported earnings 
The same analytical rigor applies to funds  too  For example  Rydex Energy Services Fund  RYESX  is down 28  vs  its benchmark  XLE  NYSE XLE   which is down just 14  since   The reasons for our warning emanated from two key issues our technology discovered 
The fund s annual turnover was an astounding 1241   which translates into an annual cost of 4 73   No matter the investment strategy  such high trading costs can erode any potential returns for investors 
Financial filings analyzed and models built by our Robo Analyst revealed that the fund s managers had allocated more capital to stocks that were simultaneously less profitable and more expensive than their benchmark  XLE  
Heightened awareness of fiduciary duties by both investors and advisors is ushering in a return to the more diligent habits that underpin value investing  e g   focusing on economic earnings  and are more important than ever before  Moreover  now that interest rates are no longer falling  investing is getting harder  To fulfill fiduciary duties  it s imperative for investors to roll up their sleeves and do the extra work necessary to understand true  economic earnings and not rely on unscrubbed accounting results  Technologies like ours support this trend  because they make it much more feasible for investors to apply the value investing principles that play a critical role in providing high quality investment advice

115286,336801,HAS,2 Stocks To Watch  Will Alphabet And Hasbro Perform ,opinion,"Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL 
Estimize is predicting GOOGL EPS to be  8 19 a share and The Street is coming in at  7 91  a 3  difference between the two  On the contrary  revenues for both are roughly in line  with Estimize calling for  20 902B and Wall Street at  20 831B  According to the Estimize community  EPS is projected to decrease 3  YoY  However  revenue is projected to grow roughly 19  YoY  Historically  Alphabet has beaten Estimize EPS 52  of time and Wall Street EPS 70  

Alphabet has many interesting projects going on  not just in tech but also in medicine and environmental projects  Verily  a subsidiary of GOOGL  has just been approved to conduct their new study  Debug Fresno  They plan to release 1 million male  sterilized mosquitoes into the Fresno population in an effort to decrease the overall mosquito population in the area and the transmission of Zika virus  Since females are the only ones that bite  when they try to mate with sterilized male mosquitoes  the population will inevitably decrease  Likewise  Alphabet has decided to potentially relaunch Google Glass  but this time in a new environment  factory floors  The company has announced they feel the product can maximize efficiency of the workers working on complex manual projects by displaying step by step instructions  photographs or aiding them in choosing the right tools 
Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS 
Many analysts are predicting a strong quarter for Hasbro  The Estimize community is estimating the EPS this quarter to come in at  0 48  while Wall Street is estimating  0 46  For revenue  Estimize is predicting  980 53M and Wall Street is at  972 96M  EPS is projected to have YoY growth of 17  and revenue is projected to grow 12  YoY  pretty appealing numbers  Hasbro has beaten Estimize EPS 68  of the time historically and Wall Street EPS 67  of the time and revenues 57  of the time 

  showed off a 16 2  earnings surprise last quarter  and has surpassed the Wall Street consensus in the last four quarters  As previously mentioned  many analysts are expecting HAS to have a strong quarter once again and it is easy to see why  Due to the popularity of action movies such as  SpiderMan  and  Transformers   the toy markets and their sales will see a direct  positive correlation  Some analysts are expecting that franchised brand toy sales will make up approximately 47  of their total sales  Likewise  an increase in investments in digital initiatives and programs such as Hasbro Gaming Crate  a delivery system that delivers new board games right to people s houses every 3 months  are all expected to increase the company s results this quarter

115312,336827,HAS,New Research Reports For Salesforce  FedEx   Occidental Petroleum ,opinion,"Thursday June 1  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s publication features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Salesforce  CRM   FedEx  FDX  and Occidental Petroleum  OXY   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see 
Before we discuss today s featured analyst reports  a brief comment about this morning s ISM and labor market surveys is in order  These broadly positive readings come ahead of tomorrow s all important government jobs report that will have direct Fed implications 
The closely watched manufacturing ISM index came in better than expected at 54 9  just a shade above April s 54 8 reading  indicating a steadily improving backdrop for the factory sector   This key gauge of the manufacturing sector s health struggled the last two years  occasionally falling under the  50  level   the dividing line between expansion and contraction  but appears to have broken out to the upside this year  While the domestic economic backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way  notwithstanding expectations of growth friendly policy initiatives from the Trump administration  the international growth outlook has starting improving lately and that appears to be helping this export oriented part of the U S  economy  Stable prices for oil and other commodities lately have also been helpful 
In other economic data today  the ADP jobs report for May came in very strong  with the  headline  number coming in at 253K vs  consensus expectations of a 170K read  The main use of this report is to serve as a preview for the monthly jobs reading from the government s Bureau of Labor Statistics  which comes out tomorrow morning  Friday  and is expected to show  headline  gains of 185K  Given the proximity of the BLS report s release  we may not see much change in consensus expectations data  But it s reasonable to assume that  whisper expectations  will be north of 200K for tomorrow s report  That said  the ADP report hasn t always closely tracked the BLS reading in the past  though both reports do move in the same direction

Today s Featured Research Reports 
Salesforce shares have handily beat the broader Tech sector this year  with the stock up almost double the Zacks Technology sector s  16 2  gain in the year to date period  Driving this momentum is the company s dominant position in  front office  applications and strong cloud offerings that provide it one of the best growth profiles in the large cap tech space  All of these positive attributes were on display in the company s recent quarterly report when it beat on both the top  and bottom lines  Substantial increase in revenues was backed by growth across all its business segments and the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform   While stepped up investments on international expansion and data centers could impact near term results  but the company s long term growth outlook remains very compelling   You can 
FedEx have lagged the broader market this year  FDX is up  6 6  vs   8 1  gain for the S P 500 index YTD   but it has done better than both UPS as well as the Zacks Transportation sector  The company s dominant market share in the package delivery space has made it a proxy for the secular growth in e commerce  But concerns about the seemingly never ending cycle of capital spending that weigh on its ability to generate free cash flows and potential competitive challenges  particularly from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   remain key headwinds  Uncertainty about integration of the TNT operations remains an another issue  On the positive side  management s bullish comments about the current period at the time of the last earnings release is encouraging  The company reports quarterly results on June 20th and is expected to come out with  3 84 in EPS on  15 5 billion in revenues  up  16 3  and  19 6  from the year earlier period  respectively  The stock has a history of responding strongly to quarterly results  it was up following the last quarterly release on the aforementioned positive outlook even though it missed EPS estimates   You can  
Occidental Petroleum shares have suffered this year  as have shares of all oil producers  to reflect the commodity s price slide and uneven outlook  That said  it has done better than its E P peers  the stock is down  14 7  in the year to date period vs   23  decline for the Zacks E P industry   reflecting Occidental s strong position in the Permian basin and solid balance sheet  The Zacks analyst likes Occidental s plans to sell its low margin assets and focus on higher quality assets  The company s focus on Permian Resources and its initiative to produce more oil will boost its performance in the long term  The highly competitive oil and gas space  operational interruptions and stringent environmental regulations are headwinds   You can

Bet on These 4 GARP Stocks for Impressive Returns

	Growth at a reasonable price  or GARP  provides an excellent opportunity for investors who are interested in consistent and assured returns  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued but have impressive prospects 
	Unlike a blend strategy  a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics
	The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth Metrics
	Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy 
	Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value Metrics
	GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered 
	Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening Parameters
	Along with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to make the strategy foolproof Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20    Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average   Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than M industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued  
	These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only nine

115315,336830,HAS,Will Mattel s  MAT  Strategic Growth Plan Aid A Turnaround ,opinion,Leading toy maker Mattel  Inc    NASDAQ MAT   outlined its strategic plan    a guideline for achieving growth   as well as the company s financial framework for the medium term at its Investor Day event in New York City on Jun 14 As the global toy market continues to grow  with changing consumer and market trends that are transforming the future  the company s Chief Executive Officer  CEO   Margo Georgiadis  believes that Mattel is well positioned to capitalize on the impending opportunities given its differentiated and market leading assets Inside the HeadlinesMoving ahead  Mattel aims to focus on a five pillar strategy to reinvent itself and provide improved and sustainable growth over the long term Firstly  the company is focused on building its Power Brands  American Girl  Barbie  Fisher Price  Hot Wheels and Thomas   Friends  into 360 degree connected systems of play and experiences  In fact  the company has formed a brand development framework to unlock the scale and profitability of its brands and modernize them for the digital world The framework expands these brands into systems of play  both physical and digital  Moreover  the company aspires to drive further growth by vital adjoining opportunities that widen the scope of Mattel s Power Brands and complete the 360 degree experience  including Consumer Products  Gaming  Content and Live Experiences In fact  Mattel is already moving promptly on this path as it is building a growing pipeline of tech enabled products that capitalize on new play patterns and allows it to extend beyond traditional toy age ranges  Notably  Mattel plans to bring these new scaled  digitally connected toy offerings to market beginning in fall 2018 Secondly  given the fact that emerging markets are expected to be the leading driver of future industry growth  Mattel aims to accelerate its presence therein  The company already sells products in most of European  Latin American and Asian countries  Given the enormous untapped potential  it thus plans to increase its momentum in emerging markets with tailored product lines and strategic partnerships Particularly  to succeed in China  Mattel has adopted a solutions based and digital first method to localize products  which has aided the company to scale swiftly in the past five years  In fact  it is doubling the efforts to capture a bigger share of China s fragmented yet lucrative toy market and has struck ground breaking deals  Moving ahead  the company also aims to expand more quickly and efficiently across other top Asian markets  such as India and Indonesia Thirdly  the company is making the shift to a company wide approach in order to oversee its innovation portfolio and doing away with siloes across brands  categories and partners  With this  Mattel intends to better focus on and fortify its product innovation pipeline  Consequently  the company anticipates to accelerate its innovation cycle time from 18 months today to a target of six to nine month cycles to develop new products Fourthly  Mattel aims to reshape its operations to transform itself into a faster  leaner and smarter organization  To accomplish this goal  the company anticipates freeing up  150  200 million to plow in rearchitecting the company  It will thus be focusing on three key areas   commercial side of the business  manufacturing and supply chain  and IT transformation   to bring about the desired change Finally  the company is taking steps to reignite its culture and team  To this end  Mattel has initiated a new purpose  promise and values as well as begun hiring and will continue to hire strategic talent to bring in change across the organization and speedup its development Investment BlueprintWe note that Mattel plans to make incremental investments in order to drive growth and margin improvement  It projects the collective incremental investment to execute this strategy in both capital and operating expenditures to amount to roughly  250 to  350 million Additionally  Mattel is apparently cutting its quarterly dividend by more than half  to unlock resources for reinvestment as well as reinforce its balance sheet and offer additional financial and strategic flexibility Medium Term Financial ViewMattel is of the view that its future state business model can attain mid to high single digit revenue growth and operating profits at  or over  15   in the medium term What s Up at Mattel Mattel s shares have compared unfavorably with the Zacks categorized  industry in the past six months  The company s shares have lost 25 3  against the broader industry s gain of 35 6   during the same time period  Apart from various macro concerns  hitches at the company level have also been hampering the stock s performance Age compression is tapering the demand for traditional toys and hitting the toy makers  revenue severely  and Mattel is no exception  Continuous competition from technology based gaming companies like Electronic Arts  Inc    NASDAQ EA   and Activision Blizzard  Inc    NASDAQ ATVI   has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like Mattel A challenging retail environment for toys along with forex headwinds is further hampering the company s performance  Weak performance in key international markets is also a major hindrance to the company s top line growth Meanwhile  lack of innovative schemes for brand awareness and brand innovation has been hurting Mattel s revenues and point of sale momentum  Furthermore  sluggish performance of certain segments and brands along with the loss of Disney deal to Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS   has added to its woes  Also  costs related to sales boosting initiatives may continue to keep profits under pressure in the near term Nevertheless  given the strong product lineup  which includes core brands  licensed brands and lucrative product associations Mattel remains well positioned for growth  In fact  the company s focus on improving point of sale through introduction of more products  brand innovation and strategic initiatives like entering into new categories and strengthening the Girls portfolio bodes well  Going forward  Mattel s renewed contracts for toy franchisees of Cars 3 and Toy Story 4 are likely to boost its top line  Meanwhile  efforts to achieve cumulative cost savings and enhanced margins remain added positives for the company Bottom LineManagement is confident that this aggressive strategic repositioning will augment the company s long term growth and profitability Thus  going forward  it remains to be seen that how profitable the company s strategic growth plan turns out to be in the long run and whether it can aid in stimulating the brand and uplift this currently Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  rated company You can see  3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue ExplosionAt Zacks  we re mostly focused on short term profit cycles  but the hottest of all technology mega trends is starting to take hold   By last year  it was already generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast

the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive prospects Unlike a blend strategy  a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rallied 216 points  1 1   to 20 764  the S P 500 Index increased 25 points  1 1   to 2 374  and the NASDAQ Composite jumped 73 points  1 2   to 5 984  In moderately heavy volume  906 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 8 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil ticked  0 39 lower to  49 23 per barrel and wholesale gasoline  lost  0 02 to  1 63 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price fell  8 65 to  1 275 79 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 9  lower at 99 08

Regional manufacturing report dips to kick off economic calendar The Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity Index unexpectedly dipped but remained solidly at a level depicting expansion  a reading above zero   The index declined to 16 8 in April  from 16 9 in March  and compared to the expected improvement to 17 0 
Treasuries finished lower in the wake of the reaction to the French Presidential election  as the yield on the 2 Year note rose 5 basis points  bps  to 1 23   the yield on the 10 Year note gained 2 bps to 2 27   and the 30 Year bond rate increased 1 bp to 2 91  
Bond yields rebounded and the U S  dollar dropped as the first round of the key French Presidential election came in as expected  appearing to alleviate some political concerns  Also  the markets remain optimistic regarding progress made on President Trump s tax reform plans  details of which are expected to be delivered this week 
Along with ramped up earnings season  this week s economic calendar will deliver key reads on the economy  beginning with tomorrow s new home sales report  with economists forecasting a 1 4  m m decline during March to an annual rate of 584 000 units  as well as the S P Case Shiller CoreLogic Home Price Index  expected to show year over year increase of 5 8  during February  and a 0 7  m m rise on a seasonally adjusted basis

Investors appear to be shying away from risk  resulting in the recent pullback in stocks  We view this as temporary  although patience will be required and sharper downturns could occur within the ongoing bull market as political and geopolitical uncertainty abounds  while the Fed has begun to address the slow draining of its balance sheet  Global earnings have aided stock market gains  but the expectations bar is getting higher to hurdle  The next several weeks should show whether gains will persist or if expectations may have gone too far 
Europe rallies  Asia mostly higher following French election results 
European equities jumped  with financials leading a broad based rally as the markets appeared to breathe a sigh of relief after the first round of the key French Presidential election came in as the polls had predicted  The election did not offer any surprising results and post election polls are suggesting pro Europe  mainstream candidate Emmanuel Macron is poised to defeat anti EU Marine Le Pen in the final vote on May 7th 
The euro jumped and the British pound declined versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields were mixed  In economic news  German business sentiment improved to the highest level in almost six years for April 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly to the upside as the markets appear to be relieved by the results from the French Presidential election over the weekend that went according to what the polls had suggested to ease some political uncertainty  Japanese equities gained solid ground following a drop in the yen  while markets in Australia  South Korea and India all gained ground  Stocks in Hong Kong also traded higher  but those traded in mainland China fell sharply on festering concerns about regulatory crackdowns

The stock markets are back in record territory  while the U S  dollar and Treasury yields ticked higher  bolstered by U S  President Donald Trump saying yesterday that  something phenomenal  will likely be announced regarding his tax plan in 2 3 weeks  This is overshadowing the recent flare up in concerns about global trade relations and immigration on the heels of Trump s actions and comments  Also  last week s relatively dovish takeaway of the Fed s unchanged monetary policy decision and continued upbeat economic data have aided the markets  Crude oil prices are extending a rally to lend further support  in the wake of a report that suggested OPEC had achieved initial compliance of 90  with their recent production cut agreement

Stocks ride late week rally back to record highs 
Conviction remained contained to begin the week amid exacerbated global market uneasiness toward the political risks in the U S  and Europe  with the former exacerbating trade and immigration concerns and the latter facing key elections  However  the major U S  equity markets staged a late week rally into positive territory and back to record highs as reflation optimism resurfaced as President Trump pledged that a  phenomenal  tax plan was in the offing  The U S  dollar index posted the first weekly gain of 2017 and Treasury yields pared early losses  Crude oil prices battled back to near the flatline as reports of OPEC production cut compliance countered oversupply concerns in the wake of a couple bearish oil inventory reports  Gold extended its recent jump in choppy trading

115364,336879,HAS,Hasbro Toys  Making Money And Providing Fun ,opinion,"Most people are familiar with Hasbro Toys  NASDAQ HAS   If you ever played the Monopoly board game  with a G I  Joe action figure  or a Mr  Potato Head  you have played with a Hasbro toy  And while toy fads come and go  there will always be kids looking to have some fun with toys  This is where Hasbro comes into play 
So what does the current and future environment look like for Hasbro Toys  Should you consider investing in this company or are there better options for your money out there 
Hasbro Toys Background
The Hasbro company as we know it started back in 1923 by the Hassenfeld brothers  The original company was a textile business  but expanded into pencil cases and school supplies  In the 1940 s the company expanded into making doctor and nursing kits for kids  but hit gold when in 1952 it bought Mr  Potato Head from its creator  Two years later  Hasbro signed a licensing deal with Disney to sell Disney characters as toys 
Fast forward to the 1980s and its toy line really took off  With G I  Joes  Transformers and My Little Pony  among others  Hasbro was riding high  Since then  business has been primarily good for Hasbro 
Hasbro currently markets toys under its name as well as a handful of subsidiary companies  These include Funskool  Playskool  Tonka  Milton Bradley  Parker Brothers  and Tiger Electronics 
Some the top performing toys for Hasbro include G I  Joe  Start Wars  Transformers  Nerf  Monopoly  and The Game of Life 
The Economics of Hasbro
Last year Hasbro reported earnings of  4 46 a share  The year before that  earnings were  3 51 a share  While the stock is pricey  trading at 22 times earnings  there is a lot of room for continued growth 
The main reason for the bullish outlook on Hasbro is from the company themselves and their plans for 2017  Hasbro still owns the rights to Disney Princess  which was a huge success for them in 2016  They also are the creator of Pie Face Showdown  which has been a top selling toy on Amazon for 3 months now 
And new toys are on the horizon  With new Star Wars  Marvel and Transformers movies coming out in the next couple of years  Hasbro will be debuting many new toys for these lines  This will help to further solidify the boy s toy segment for the company 
For girl s toys  look no further than Disney  With Hasbro continuing to license Disney products  sales from Disney Princess and Frozen will continue to add to Hasbro s bottom line as will new films from Disney in the coming years 
Is Hasbro A Buy 
The answer to the question of whether or not Hasbro Toys is a buy lies in the person asking the question  There are two outlooks for Hasbro 
The first  is a cyclical toy company  It has its hit toys one year and they fall off to a new hot toy the following year  Most times  it is not the same toy manufacturer who makes hit after hit  so you have unpredictability when it comes to the toy industry 
The second is a marking company  Since Hasbro has   it is solely a company that markets and sells toys  This allows for greater stability over the long term  It focuses its efforts and investments into figuring out what kids want and is better able to market and sell to them  thus improving the bottom line 
In addition to this  Hasbro has taken a different approach to toys  It sees itself as a storyteller now  It focuses on brands that last a long time  For example  girls will always be interested in princesses and boys will always be interested in robots  As a result  you have toys that span years of popularity and not just one holiday season 
Many investors like what they hear in regards to the second point  By re inventing themselves  Hasbro has turned its highly volatile business into a more stable company and can better anticipate results  This doesn t mean it won t have bad years  but most believe that the bad years won t be as bad or come at such a surprise any longer 
Because of this  many analysts are expecting the company to grow in the high single digits per year for the next couple of years  While some may argue that some of this growth is already priced into the stock  which is currently trading at  98 a share  many believe there is still a lot of room for the company s stock to push higher 
Estimates for 2017 earnings are at  4 66 a share and for 2018   4 91 a share  If Hasbro Toys can hit these numbers  you can expect the stock to be more than  100 a share 
The time to buy the stock is now  It is up to you as to whether or not you wait for a dip or market pullback before getting in  The only downside to this strategy is getting outpriced if the pullback never comes

115365,336880,HAS,Hasbro s Bringing Play Doh Production To The U S   Not Tied To Trump ,opinion,"Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS   is bringing the production of their children s toy and moldable putty  Play Doh  back to the United States  Play Doh was last produced in the United States in 2004 and has been outsourced since  Now  Hasbro looks to add a production facility in East Long Meadow  Massachusetts in addition to current factories in China and Turkey 
Executives of Hasbro say the decision does not relate to President Trump s plans to bring back manufacturing to the United States  Rather  the new United States manufacturing plant  expected to be in production as early as the latter half of 2018  is being built to accommodate increased Play Doh demand in the past five years 
The Wall Street Journal says more than 3 billion cans of Play Doh have been sold in its history and Hasbro produces 500 million cans a year  The company employs 5 400 globally and about 2 600 of their employees are located in the United States 
First used to clean wall paper  Joe McViker of Rainbow Crafts Company re created Play Doh as a children s toy  When Hasbro acquired his company in 1991  it became one of their core brands

115396,336911,HAS,Gold  Silver And Mining Shares During 2016,opinion,"I wasn t going to write anything until next week  but reporting on the annual performance for gold and silver in the first week of the year is appropriate and timely 
Publishing the following table has been an annual event in my work for the past few years  Using the last published value of the year for gold and silver  not their bull   bear market  high   low prices  I calculate the annual performance as well as how far metal prices has gone in their bull or bear markets on an end of year basis  Metal prices for the 1980 to 2000 bear market bottomed in 2000  with 2001  Green Row  being year one of the current bull market  And yes the PM mining shares and the old monetary metals are still in a bull market 
Looking at the price of gold from 2000 to 2012  gold saw twelve yearly gains  This is remarkable for two reasons  I know of no other market series that saw twelve consecutive annual gains  The Dow Jones has never seen twelve consecutive years of advances yet somehow during this entire twelve year period  the financial media was successful in maintaining a wide spread public revulsion toward the gold and silver markets  Darn right they did  and they continue doing so today  Silver during this period  2000 2012  saw only two down years  and frequently saw double digit gains that far outperformed those holders of gold enjoyed 

At the close of 2016  gold saw its first annual advance since 2012  An 8 51  advance may not seem like much  but neither was the 2 46  gain seen in 2001  Keep in mind that although the gold bulls at the end of 2016 are disheartened  the price of gold has still advanced 323  from itsclose of December 2000 
That s something the Dow Jones  S P 500  NASDAQ Composite indices and most of the groups in the Dow Jones Total Market Groupcan t say  And that s with the metals near the bottom of a three year correction as most major stock indexes now find themselves at  or just a whisker from their all time highs 

Silver was up 14 98  from a year ago  not that it feels like it  Historically  silver outperforms gold  something that the table above  first table  shows is something silver has failed to do since 2000  I expect silver will once again outperform gold  maybe starting this year 
A note on the bull market data for 1977 to 1979  the percentage gains are based on the closing prices of 02 January 1969 
Gold   43 50
Silver     1 85
Can you imagine buying an ounce of gold for  43 50  silver at  1 85  Or that when gold broke above  100 in May 1973 the world held its breadth Probably not  But then in 1969  who could have imagined gold trading at  1 151  or that seeing the price of gold over  1 000 would inspire pessimismin the gold market  These are emotional reactions to the changes in the price of gold  and responding to emotions is no way to make money in the market 
I admit it s been hard being optimistic on precious metals assets for the past few years  but I just keep my eye on the blue plot in the chart below  In reckless disregard to the inflationary consequences  Washington continues to issue ever more paper dollars  Since the high tech bubble began deflating in January 2000  the volume of paper dollars in circulation  CinC  has increased 168 8  
Since the Chinese invented paper money in the 10th century  printing ever more money has never lead any society to the Promised Land  as noted by William Durant below 
 Such were the sources of that flood of paper money which  ever since  has alternatively accelerated and threatened the economic life of the world    William Durant  Our Oriental Heritage   1935  pg 780
And the  policy makers  now want to eliminate paper money all together 
Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   maker of the Monopoly real estate game now has a version of their famous parlor game that uses electronic money instead of paper monopoly money  Whose idea was that 

Note how the Dow Jones  Red Plot chart below  has failed to keep up with the expansion of CinC since January 2000  After adjusting for inflation  not inflation as measured by the Labor Department s CPI   I doubt most investorshave bettered their financial situation risking their money in the stock market since January 2000 

The fact is that gold and silver bullion have far outperformed the broad stock market and the expansion in CinC for the past sixteen years  table below   and the PM mining stocks  after correcting by 30  since last summer aren t all that far behind the Dow Jones which is now at an all time high 

Returning to my first table above  just a few weeks after the close of 1979  gold had risen to 825 on 21 January 1980 and silver at  48 70 on 17 January 1980 as the precious metals market experienced a historic bout of panic buying  After January 1980  the old monetary metals began a twenty year bear market  something that isn t going to happen after the close of 2016  Why do I believe that  Because we haven t seen a panic out of financial assets into precious metal assets yet  after all that was what caused people to buy gold and silver at any price in early January 1980 the bond market was crashing as consumer price inflation soared to double digits So far in the 21st century  we ve yet to see this  yet it s coming 
In the chart below we see that bond yields were rising since the end of World War Two in response to rising consumer prices  Forgotten today  the post war period was plagued by rising consumer prices as we see in this quote from 1957 
 The real problem with retiring is money  Most people save their whole lives to retire in the same style they enjoyed when they were working  only to realize that they can t live like they used to even while they re still working  You see these ads for retirement and they always have fishing boats in the background  That s because for  120 a month  fishing is the only way retired people can feed themselves 
  George Burns  Burns and Allen Television Show   Season 8 Episode 9  1957
I went shopping for groceries this week and spent  120 on three bags of food  Don t tell me about low inflation in today s economy  The government s CPI data series is the longest running fake news story around 
By 1958 consumer prices and bond yields increased to the point where the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI  began a bull market  though gold itself was fixed by fiat at  35 until 1968  It s very evident  and logical that the 1958 to 1980 bull markets in the PM mining shares and the monetary metals took place in a rising interest rate environment 
Look at what the tech wreck and sub prime mortgage bear markets did to Barron s Intermediate Grade Bond Yields  Since March 2009  with the implementation of three quantitative easing  and zero interest rate programs by the Fed in the past eight years  corporate America has taken on massive amounts of debt for no good reason  In the next financial crisis I wouldn t be shocked if both Best and Intermediate Grade Bond Yields take off 

That s something that our current bull market in the mining shares and precious metals haven t seen since the 2001 2016 bull market began  where bizarrelyrising precious metals assets occurred as bond yields continued in their multi decade decline This is an anomaly resulting from our financial markets being  regulated  by the Federal government 
This won t go on forever  The bull market in the precious metals mining shares and the metals they mine will see their most significant gains when bond yields once again trend upwards to double digits and above  exactly as they did from 1958 to 1980 
Next is a table giving the one year performance for the Dow Jones Total Market Groups  DJTMG  and other key market indices  The precious metals miners are  3 4 5 in the list  even after seeing their highs of last summer corrected by 30   Silver and gold bullion are at  39 and  63 
CPI is  85  at 1 73   that has to be a lie  But if the government says it s so  the MSM is more than willing to pass the fake statistics on to a trusting public without challenge 
Home Construction  93 and REITS  95 find themselves down for the year  Bond yields have been rising since last July  and that isn t good for real estate 

The banks since the summer of 2016 have done very well in the BEV chart below  But we re still in the aftermath of the sub prime mortgage debacle  Since 2007  nothing has been done to clean up the tens of trillions of illiquid assets and derivative liabilities on these banks  balance sheets  Their accounting is at best specious  so they re still damaged goods as far as I m concerned If people in 2017 are now paying top dollar for shares that in March 2009 were down some 86  from their highs of 2007 doesn t change that An 86  crash  That s a Great Depression event  These banks in 2017 are ticking time bombs  Still they may go on to new highs  However they will do so without me owning any 
One thing this BEV plot of the banking stocks illustrates very well is how breaking the Bretton Wood s  35 gold peg in 1971 created instability in the banking system  Sure  after the dollar was freed from the last vestige of the gold standard the insiders in these banks were making money like they never had before  With their spare change Wall Street has purchasedmembers of congress and market regulators  But time will prove that their gain was at everyone else s expense 

One last graphic  showing how our current bull market in gold has performed compared to the Dow Jones from 1982 to 2000  Again using the last published price for the year  this time for the Dow Jones and gold  Year zero equals 
1981 for the Dow Jones
2000 for gold
Looking at history  the Dow Jones saw three down years during its first twelve years of the 1982 2000 bull market  while as mentioned before  gold s first twelve years of its current bull market only saw annual advances 

Another notable fact made evident in this table is that gold during the first twelve years of its bull market outperformed the Dow Jones during the first twelve years of its 1982 2000 bull market by just under 200   One might believe that the main stream financial media would have covered the gold market from 2000 to 2012 with as much enthusiasm as it had the Dow Jones from 1981 to 1993  but that wasn t so  In fact it was quite the opposite

Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ HAS  94  reported 4Q earnings per share  EPS  ex items of  1 64  above the  1 27 FactSet estimate  as revenues rose 11 2  year over year  y y  to  1 6 billion  topping the projected  1 5 billion  Separately  the toy maker increased its quarterly dividend by 12 0  to  0 57 per share  Shares rallied over 14

Treasury yields seeing pressure as economic calendar quiet 
Treasuries were higher amid an economic calendar void of any major reports today  as the yield on the 2 year note fell 6 basis points  bps  to 1 15   the yield on the 10 year note decreased 5 bps to 2 42   while the30 year bond rate declined 4 bps to 3 05  
Treasury yields  the U S  dollar and the stock markets have been mixed after recent record highs for the latter  while focus continues on the plethora of policy moves from President Donald Trump and last week s unchanged monetary policy decision 
The recent sideways movement of U S  stocks was a healthy pause in the sharp post election rally  Continued solid economic data and a decent earnings reporting season bolster our confidence in the continuation of the bull market in stocks  However  rising inflation  possibly forcing the Fed to be more aggressive  could lead to bouts of volatility and more pullbacks  Issuing executive orders to roll back previous executive orders is relatively easy in a lot of cases  but getting tax reform and new health care legislation written and passed will prove to be more difficult for President Trump 
Investor and corporate confidence may have gotten a bit ahead of the pace at which many of the administration s policy priorities can get enacted  and the balance between those which are growth friendly and those which could retard growth and confidence 
Tomorrow s economic calendar will hold the December trade balance  with economists expecting the deficit to have narrowed slightly to  45 0 billion from the  45 2 billion posted in November  as well as the Labor Department s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  JOLTS   a measure of unmet demand for labor  forecasted to show 5 58 million jobs were available to be filled in December  mostly matching that seen the month prior  In the final hour of trading  Consumer Credit will be reported  with consumer borrowing expected to have shrunk to  20 0 billion in December from the  24 5 billion registered in November 
European equities decline on mixed data  Asia mostly higher to begin week 
European equities traded to the downside  amid lingering political uncertainty on continued concerns toward U S  President Donald Trump s recent flood of policy moves and comments  while some key elections loom on this side of the pond  An unexpected jump in German factory orders for December did little to boost stocks  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi highlighted in a parliamentary speech growing confidence in eurozone economic prospects  but added that there is a lack of a clear sign of sustained convergence of inflation rates toward the desired level  The euro and British pound were lower versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region came in mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher on the heels of Friday s mixed U S  labor report  while U S  political uncertainty remains  Japanese equities advanced  with the yen pulling back from recent strength and financials moving higher 
Mainland Chinese stocks and those traded in Hong Kong increased on the heels of a report that showed growth in the nation s services sector output decelerated but remained in expansion territory  while insurance stocks rallied amid speculation the country s pension funds are set to enter the stock markets  per Bloomberg 
Markets in South Korea and India rose  with emerging markets continuing to rally  However  weakness in oil and gas and technology issues pressured stocks in Australia  along with an unexpected decline in the nation s retail sales for December

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 75 on  1 58 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Hasbro could see tepid results without the release of any movie themed toys this quarter
The premiere of new Frozen and Star Wars movies could push Hasbro to raise guidance for the fourth quarter
Toy maker  Hasbro  is scheduled to announce third quarter results this Monday  before the market opens  Hasbro is coming off a string of strong reports thanks to the booming success of its movie themed toys  Star Wars  Captain America and Frozen themed toys have been the strongest contributors to revenue over this time  This quarter expectations are tepid given the lack of blockbuster movies this quarter and the loss of the Jurassic Park license 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of  1 75  roughly 5  higher than the same period last year  That estimate is currently 1 cent higher than Wall Street  which historically underestimates its EPS estimate on Hasbro  Revenue for the period is anticipated 7  higher to  1 58 billion  marking a significant decline from the previous three quarters  Historically shares jump 2  immediately following a report but given how results have been trending it s more likely that shares drop Monday morning  Shares are down 11  in the past 3 months but up about 14  year to date  
Hasbro s recent string of success can be credited to movie themed toys specifically those based on Star Wars and Captain America  Those movies have come and gone and now Hasbro is waiting for the next blockbuster success  In all likelihood that will be the next Frozen or Star Wars movies expected to debut at the end of the year 
Frozen toys will help propel the girl s segment which has recently seen a marked turnaround  In the past  the boy s segment and movie related toys were expected to offset the losses posted in the girl s segment  It was only until this year that the girl s segment has begun to hold it own  That doesn t mean all of its girl brands are performing well  Furby and My Little Pony are consistently posting weak growth and should put a dent in the upcoming quarter s results

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research  

Look Beyond Bargain Hunting  Buy 5 Stocks with Rising P E

	Investors are always hunting for stocks with low P E which indicates undervaluation  The ratio  which is obtained by dividing a stock s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings  measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings 

	The lower the P E of a stock  the better for a value investor  This is because value investors believe that a company s earnings growth potential is not priced in at the current level and thus the stock has higher chances of outperformance  going forward 

	Naturally  there are very few investors who pay attention to stocks with an increasing P E  But this often overlooked trend can prove worthwhile in finding great stocks  Let s dig a little deeper 

Rising P E  An Useful Tool

	Investors should note that stock prices move in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance in turn boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 

	So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  All these make the case for a rising P E a lucrative investing criterion 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth

Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to the previous year

	 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  

Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks

Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks

	 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  

Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 

Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500 

	 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  

Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100  

	 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 

Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000    High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 14 

	Here are five out of the 14 stocks 

Hasbro Inc     NASDAQ        This is a games and toys company within the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 7   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 

Asbury Automotive Group Inc     NYSE        One of the largest automotive retailers in the U S   company falls within the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 13   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  You can see     

The Home Depot Inc     NYSE        This Zacks Rank  2 company is a home improvement retailer  The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  

Innoviva Inc     NASDAQ        The Zacks Rank  2 company is into the biopharmaceuticals industry  The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  

ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc     NASDAQ        This is a biopharmaceutical company dealing with in licensed cancer drugs  The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  and the stock has a Zacks Rank  2

115480,336995,HAS,3 Game Stocks Will Reach A New Level This Earnings Season,opinion,"The video game industry has drastically changed since its early beginnings with Atari in the 1970s  Modern day consoles have become powerhouses that replicate some of the most powerful computers  They are no longer a pastime activity but an investment 
Sony s PS4 or Microsoft s Xbox One can run you upwards of  300 which doesn t include additional controllers or the games themselves  Still  the video game industry continues to expand  accumulating more revenue than the movie and music industry 
As the highest gross form of entertainment it s no surprise that video games studios are also a great financial investment  Many of the industry s biggest publishers have seen their stocks skyrocket on new content  strategic acquisitions and a transition towards digital offerings 
With earnings season on the way  investors should keep an eye on Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  and Take Two Interactive Software Inc  NASDAQ TTWO  

Electronic Arts    Information Technology   Software
Electronic arts has made major leaps the past year  largely from the success of its sports titles like Madden and Fifa  as well as Star Wars  Battlefront  The latter had a huge impact on both Electronic Arts and Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS   which debuted Star Wars related products prior to the premiere of The Force Awakens 
Meanwhile  Madden and Fifa habitually grace the top 10 selling video game lists year after year  Simply updating rosters and improving graphics ever so slightly have gamers drooling 
As a result  EA saw increases across many of its key metrics in fiscal 2016  Of the  4 4 billion in revenue  55  of it came from digital offerings  Downloadable content is slowly replacing the trek to GameStop  NYSE GME  and are often publishers fastest growing source of income 
EA has also emerged in the rapidly expanding mobile space  Madden Mobile is one of the most popular mobile games  donning the Apple store s top 10 grossing apps  The Estimize community is doubtful that EA can keep it up 
Estimates have been in a whirlwind lately  dropping by double digits in the past 3 months  The consensus data is currently calling for flat year over year earnings on  660 42 million in revenue  reflecting a 91  decline on the bottom line and 3  on the top 
Activision Blizzard    Information Technology   Software
Activision is perhaps the most attractive of the three big gaming publishers  The company is firing on all cylinders and should have no problem topping expectations this quarter  Earnings will be largely driven by the success of its new flagship game  Overwatch 
In its short shelf life  the game is estimated to have sold 8 million units  double than what was previously expected  Overwatch has been a huge success  slowly replacing League of Legends in a large number of competitive gaming circles 
Fortunately the game is still in its early days and Activision should be reaping these benefits for a long time  Like its peers  Activision is also gaining traction in its digital offerings and mobile gaming  The company only recently acquired Candy Crush maker  King Digital  which has helped position them as a top mobile game maker 
The Estimize community is optimistic heading into Activision s Q2 earnings report  The consensus data is calling for earnings per share of 42 cents on  1 47 billion in revenue  a 203  increase on the bottom line and 81  on the top  Shares have generally reacted well during earnings season  rising before and after a report 
Take Two Interactive    Information Technology   Software
Video game publishers have greatly benefited from a transition away from physical games towards digital downloads  Electronic Arts  Activision Blizzard and Take Two Interactive have seen shares increase over 15  thanks to increasing revenue from the digital space 
For Take Two  the ongoing success of its Grand Theft Auto and 2k Sports series has produced huge financial prosperity  The GTA and NBA 2K franchises both headlined a list of the top 10 best selling games of 2015 
Fiscal 2017 is poised to be another strong year for Take Two with new and innovative titles prepared to hit shelves in the coming months  However  without a new Grand Theft Auto game until 2018  it might be hard to replicate the runaway success from past years 
The Estimize community is still high on this name to post better than expected earnings  The stock has typically tracked earnings  increasing 2  through a report and 3  in the month following  Shares are up 43  in the past 12 months with the a strong possibility of breaking out on another strong report ",2016-07-08,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-3-companies-will-reach-a-new-level-this-earnings-season-200140655,200140655

115491,337006,HAS,Marriott Vacations  VAC  Q2 Earnings  Surprise In Store ,opinion,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation   NYSE VAC   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 21  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  this Florida based vacation ownership company posted a negative earnings surprise of 11 22   In fact  the company has surpassed earnings estimates in two out of the past four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 0 41  
Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement 
Factors at Play
Marriott Vacations  one of the major players in the timeshare industry  is poised to benefit from positive timeshare industry trends  The company has been recording higher contract sales and rental revenues  The trend is expected to continue in the second quarter of 2016 
The company has been able to maintain a steady flow of clients by offering tours to diverse locations and programs with greater outreach 
Volume per guest   sales volume for a given period divided by the number of groups toured   for Marriott Vacations has been consistently increasing since the beginning of 2014  We expect the positive trend to continue in the to be reported quarter as well backed by strong marketing initiatives 
However  the timeshare industry is extensively marketing oriented and relies heavily on sales initiatives to attract customers  Therefore  the company s increased marketing expenses would likely put pressure on second quarter margins 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marriott Vacations is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Marriott Vacations is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 03 MARRIOT VAC WW Price and EPS Surprise
   Zacks Rank  Marriott Vacations has a Zacks Rank  3  which  when combined with 0 00  ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks in the consumer discretionary sector that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Intrawest Resorts Holdings  Inc    NYSE SNOW   with an Earnings ESP of  1 44  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS   with an Earnings ESP of  5 13  and a Zacks Rank  3

Hasbro s diversified toy and game product line has brought earnings momentum to the company and helped the stock become one of the best performers of 2016  up over 25   The company recently became a Zack Rank  1  Strong Buy  making it the Bull of the Day 
Fundamentals
Hasbro has a market cap of  10 5 Billion with a Forward PE of 20  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of  A  in Growth and has of VGM score of  B   The company has an expected 3 5 year growth rate just above 13  and it pays a dividend yield of 2 42  while you wait for that growth 
Relative Strength
Over the last two years Hasbro has outperformed  returning almost 70  verse just under 10  for the S P 500  The combination of growth and a strong of earnings beats have lead to the stock surge  but the driver has been the company s ability to capitalize on hot toy markets 

Toy Fads and Opportunities
Whether it is Avengers  Star Wars or Angry Birds  Hasbro excels at marketing and profiting off the toys of popular moves  It s a pretty simple concept that starts when a kid see the movie  then see the commercial for the toy  and then bugs their parents till they give in and buy the toy 
Last quarter CEO Brian Goldner had some comments on this success during the earnings conference call   Demand for STAR WARS  THE FORCE AWAKENS products continued to be high and we benefited from the addition of DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN fashion and small dolls  We are very encouraged with global demand and our outlook for 2016  
This past week  a woman that bought a Hasbro Chewbacca mask at Kohl s  KSS  put an entertaining video on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  that went viral  This led to sell outs of the mask at both Kohl s and Hasbro stores  The company s ability to capitalize on trends and events like this continue to drive sales quarter over quarter 
Earnings and Estimates
Hasbro reported Q1 earnings on April 18th  EPS came in at  0 38 verse the  0 24 expected  while EBITDA came in at  117 Million verse  93 year over year  Domestic growth was strong  with the US Canada segment coming in at 28  year over year  while international was seen at 13  
Looking at future earnings  estimates are headed higher for fiscal year 2016 and 2017  For the current year estimates have jumped 3 5  over the last 60 days  from  3 95 to  4 09  For next year during the same time period  estimates have gone 3 4  higher  from  4 38 to  4 53 
While future growth may seem to be priced into the stock  as long as the EPS momentum continues  any pullback should be bought    
EPS Surprises
Hasbro will go for its seventh straight beat on July 18th  Since the streak began the stock is up over 50   heading form the  55 area to  87  If the beats can continue the stock s price momentum should continue higher 

 
In Summary
Hasbro s diversified product line  nice dividend and exposure to popular movies and trends makes it an interesting play  While a lot of the good news looks to be priced into the stock at the moment  there is still room for growth and higher prices  An investor s best approach  rather than chasing the stock  should be to wait for pullbacks and enter during market corrections

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

4 Stocks to Buy on Stronger Q1 GDP

It seems that the decline in first quarter GDP was not as much as was estimated earlier  Fresh figures on Friday reflected a substantial upward revision which indicates that the economy has grown stronger with the arrival of spring  This is in keeping with other reports released recently which suggest that a strong revival is underway 

Apart from an increase in corporate profits  which was the highlight of the Q1 GDP release  consumer expenditure and a rebound in housing continued to boost GDP  This is why it may be a smart option to pick stocks from these sectors at this time 

Q1 GDP Revised Upward

The  second  estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that the first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 0 8   lower than the 1 4  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015  However  first quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0 5  rise 

The most notable feature of the report was evidence that corporate earnings were stabilizing  For a long time  this metric has been weighed down by a strong dollar and a downturn in the energy sector  Pretax corporate profits increased by 0 3   the first sign of growth seen since early 2015 

Personal Consumption  Housing Powering Growth

Viewed as the engine of U S  GDP  consumer spending was one area which continued to shine  Even though the estimate remained unchanged  personal consumption came in at a healthy 1 9  for the first quarter  Meanwhile  expenditure on new home construction jumped to 17 1  for the first quarter compared with the earlier estimate of 14 8   This is the largest such increase in around four years 

Other economic indicators have also been providing similar signals  U S  retail sales rose 1 3  last month  reaching its highest level since Mar 2015  Meanwhile  the final reading of consumer sentiment index released by University of Michigan came in at 94 7 in May to touch an 11 month high 

Our Choices

The U S  economy has not grown as sluggishly as was earlier apprehended  Consumers continue to power economic growth and the housing sector continues to reflect improvement 

This is why it makes good sense to add stocks to your portfolio which are set to gain from such trends  However  selecting winning stocks may be a difficult proposition 

This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 

We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score 

Hasbro Inc       is engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of games and toys 

Hasbro has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of B  The company has expected earnings growth of 16 6  for the current year  The forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the current financial year  F1  is 21 33  lower than the industry average of 23 34  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 0 1  over the last 30 days

5 Stocks to Buy on Strong Retail Sales

Retail sales increased for the second consecutive month in May  experiencing gains across most product categories  Expenditure at gas stations and higher online spending led the key metric higher  This is even more significant since it comes after a month of record gains 

This report lends further weight to evidence that the U S  economy is growing steadily despite tepid job data released earlier this month  Other reports released on Tuesday indicated a steady increase in import inflation and a higher level of confidence among small businesses  Selecting stocks gaining from higher consumer demand would make for a prudent option at this point 

Second Consecutive Increase 

Retail sales increased 0 5  in May to  455 6 billion  Additionally  the metric experienced a 2 5  year on year increase  The monthly gain  which was preceded by a record 1 3  increase in April  came in higher than the consensus estimate of a 0 3  rise  April s gain was the largest since Mar 2015  read      Excluding auto sales  retail sales increased 0 4  last month after gaining 0 8  a month ago 

Gas stations and non store sales  which include online sales  experienced the highest increases of 2 1  and 1 3   respectively  Sporting goods  hobby  book and music stores sales moved up 1 3   Expenditure at food services and drinking places increased 0 8   Sales increased by 0 3  and 0 8  at electronics and appliance stores  and at clothing and clothing accessories stores  respectively 

Economic Environment Improving

Meanwhile  U S  import prices increased 1 4  in May  registering its highest gain since Mar 2012  It was also higher than the consensus estimate of 0 8   Moreover  export prices rose 1 1  last month  higher than April s increase of 0 5  

Separately  the National Federation of Independent Business s  NFIB  small business optimism index increased from April s reading of 93 6 to 93 8 last month  This was the index s second consecutive monthly increase 

Additionally  data released at the end of last month had indicated that April stood out as the best month since Aug 2009 with respect to consumer spending  read      Taken together  the latest set of reports indicates that the U S  economic environment has become increasingly favorable  particularly for consumer spending 

Our Choices 

Retail sales started the year on a strong footing before declining during the months of February and March  read      Fresh data indicates that the situation has improved considerably over the last two months 

This makes it imperative to add stocks set to gain from this trend to your portfolio  Even then  picking winning stocks may be a difficult task 

This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 

We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score 

Hasbro Inc      is engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of games and toys 

Hasbro has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a VGM Score of B  The company has expected earnings growth of 16 6  for the current year  The forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the current financial year  F1  is 20 88  lower than the industry average of 22 81  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 0 1  over the last 30 days

115547,337062,HAS,Top 7 Stocks To Charm You With Sales Growth,opinion,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth 
Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base 
Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors 
Without impressive top line growth  the bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires robust sales growth 
However  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits 
Therefore  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters 
However  sales growth and cash strength are not absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy 
Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  A lower ratio is considered better for picking stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales 
  Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  An upside estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price 
Return on equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that the sales growth is getting translated into profits and the company is not sitting idle on hoards of cash  High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
Here are seven of the sixteen stocks that qualified the screening 
Affiliated Managers Group Inc     NYSE AMG   
Newell Brands Inc     NYSE NWL   
Hasbro Inc     NASDAQ HAS   
Lear Corp     NYSE LEA   
FedEx Corporation    NYSE FDX

115555,337070,HAS,Looking To Gain From Earnings Surprise  Buy These 4 Stocks,opinion,"An earnings season is probably a most watched period by equity investors  After all  investors decide on which stocks to pick and which one to kick out from their portfolios  depending on companies  earnings performances  
Now while evaluating earnings performance  there are various factors investors take into consideration  These are earnings growth  earnings acceleration and definitely earnings surprise 
As a matter of fact  an earnings beat or a positive earnings surprise seems to be a greater driver of stock movement these days than earnings growth  no matter how big it is  or earnings momentum  We ll tell you why 
Earnings Surprise  A Key to Win
An earnings surprise is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations 
After all  a 10  earnings rise  though it apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company  This growth may be decelerating over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into the play sometimes  If any company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
Similarly  earnings momentum over the quarters or years is definitely a sign of corporate well being  Then again  this does not quantify the extent of the company s operational efficiency 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and also consider a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  scoring higher on that key number is almost equivalent to beating one s own expectation as well as the market estimate  Of course  this gives you a clear picture of the company s bottom line  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
Now since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check at the earnings surprise history  An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to pull off an earnings beat in its next release    
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank equal to 1 Only companies with a Strong Buy rating can get through 
greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10  Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrows down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around 7 
Here are four of the seven stocks that passed the screen 
Cablevision Systems Corporation    NYSE CVC   
Hasbro Inc     NASDAQ HAS   
Dave   Buster s Entertainment Inc     NASDAQ PLAY   
Wabash National Corp     NYSE WNC

115556,337071,HAS,Why Hasbro  HAS  Stock Might Be A Great Pick,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS    This is because this security in the Toys Games Hobby Products space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Toys Games Hobby Products space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 39 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Hasbro is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from 38 cents per share to 39 cents per share  while current year estimates have risen from  3 96 per share to  4 09 per share  This has helped HAS to earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   further underscoring the company s solid position So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Hasbro  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment ,2016-05-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-hasbro-(has)-stock-might-be-a-great-pick-200130757,200130757
115557,337072,HAS,Hasbro  Advanced Auto Parts  BASF  Valeo SA And Enbridge Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 24  2016    highlightsHasbro  NASDAQ HAS     as the Bull of the Day and  Advanced Auto Parts    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BASF SE  DE BASFN     Valeo  PA VLOF  SA ADR    and  Enbridge    

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

Hasbro     provides children s and family leisure time products and services worldwide  The company operates through U S  and Canada  International  Entertainment and Licensing  and Global Operations segments  Its brands include Playskool  Tonka  Super Soaker  Milton Bradley  Parker Brothers  Tiger  and Hasbro Interactive  Some of its popular games and products include Monopoly  Twister  Connect 4  Scrabble  Jenga  The Game of Life  Operation  Play Doh  and Nerf 

Hasbro s diversified toy and game product line has brought earnings momentum to the company and helped the stock become one of the best performers of 2016  up over 25   The company recently became a Zack Rank  1  Strong Buy  making it the Bull of the Day 

Fundamentals

Hasbro has a market cap of  10 5 Billion with a Forward PE of 20  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of  A  in Growth and has of VGM score of  B   The company has an expected 3 5 year growth rate just above 13  and it pays a dividend yield of 2 42  while you wait for that growth 

Relative Strength

Over the last two years Hasbro has outperformed  returning almost 70  verse just under 10  for the S P 500  The combination of growth and a strong of earnings beats have led to the stock surge  but the driver has been the company s ability to capitalize on hot toy markets 

  

Advanced Auto Parts     engages in the automotive replacement parts  accessories  batteries  and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars  vans  sport utility vehicles  and light and heavy duty trucks  The Virginia based company is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  after a recent EPS miss 

The company has a market cap of  10 7 Billion and has a Forward PE of 16  The stock sports a Zacks Style Scores of  C  in Growth  Value and Momentum  The company has 3 5 year growth rate of 11 55  and dividend yield of 0 16  

Earnings

Q1 earnings came in at  2 51 verse the  2 61 expected  The company cut fiscal year same store sales to  5  versus a  3  expected  Advanced Auto also announced it will no longer target adjusting operating income of 12  for 2016  In addition  the company s CFO will be leaving the company 

The stock reacted negatively to the news selling off almost 10  to February lows  However  investors and perhaps short sellers bought the stock back up to unchanged level  After making a 2016 high at  165 in early April  the stock now sits in a vulnerable spot under the  150 level  The earnings momentum is bringing sellers into the stock and another break of the  130 level could lead to long term investors dumping the stock 

Estimates

Over the last 60 days  the company has seen estimates fall for both fiscal year 2016 and 2017  For the current year we have seen a 5 7  revision lower from  10 01 to  9 43  For next year  estimates have fallen 5 2   from  8 93 to  8 46 

These numbers are also reflected in the next couple quarters as well  If the company misses when it next reports in June the stock will be in danger of new 2016 lows

Japan s 20 Year Cycle Takes the Global Stage for G7

This Global Week Ahead ends with a 2 day meeting of G7 leaders in Ise Shima Japan  According to the Government of Japan s website  G7 leaders will discuss 


Global Economy   Trade  global growth 



Foreign Policy  Middle East  Ukraine  and North Korea 



Climate Change   Energy



Development  Japan hosts the 6th annual Tokyo International Conference on African Development in August 



Quality Infrastructure Investment



Health  public health emergencies like Ebola 



Women


Aides to President Obama also set up  at least half a year ago  a visit to nearby Hiroshima  Japan  That visit happens this Friday   in advance of the official G7 visit to Shima  The President s visit will make him the first sitting U S  head of state to set foot in the city devastated by an atomic bomb  in August 1945  

The U S  State Department hopes Obama s Friday  May 27th Hiroshima visit will become part of his diplomatic legacy  It will symbolize his pursuit of a nuclear free world and the maturation of Japan U S  relations 

As a backdrop to these important G7 prime minister meetings  be aware  The Shima Peninsula        Shima Hant   is home to Japan s most sacred Shinto religious shrines  the Ise Shrines 

The peninsula has been designated as Ise Shima National Park given its natural beauty and cultural importance  Shima has evolved into a resort area popular with Japan s nearby urban populations in the cities of Nagoya and Osaka 

Trees and stones have long been objects of deep devotion in Japan  Originally there were no shrine buildings at sacred locales like Shima  Instead a tree  forest  a large boulder  or a mountain   festooned with ropes   would be the focus of worship 

Nature worship was then ported to a set of buildings  The Ise Grand Shinto nature shrine is one of the grandest  It consists of two groups of wood buildings   Naiku and Geku  

Here s an amazing fact 

Every twenty years   Japanese Shinto priests totally rebuild the two 1300 year old shrines to nature on an adjoining site  The idea  To directly experience once in a generation renewal 

Let s hope a tone of renewal plays out for Japan s economy and the world s economy across the rest of 2016 and into 2017  Global indicators out this week look helpful in that regard 

The best looking Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  global stocks over the weekend included 

BASF SE      the German diversified chemicals giant with a  69 billion market capitalization  The Zacks VGM score is B  Buy  Rating 

Valeo SA ADR     the Paris  France based auto truck component maker with an  11 7 billion market capitalization  It has 4 Business Groups  Powertrain Systems  Thermal Systems  Comfort and Driving Assistance Systems  and Visibility Systems  The Zacks VGM score is a B  Buy  rating 

Enbridge     the Canadian oil products pipeline company with a  37 billion market capitalization  It operates the world s longest crude oil and liquids pipeline  The Zacks VGM score is also a B  Buy  rating 

In the global week ahead  both Germany and France should see improvement in their respective manufacturing PMIs  Better macro data will be fully consistent with the fresh high Zacks  1 ranks tied to Germany s BASF and France s Valeo  

Oil prices should keep climbing towards  50 a barrel  in part on stronger seasonal gasoline demand this summer  This helps Canada s Enbridge ship more oil down its pipelines

The boys sector is a bright spot for the toy manufacturer  Blockbuster movies over the past year have propelled boys toy sales to outperform Hasbro s other divisions  With future installments of Star Wars and Captain America yet to hit the big screen  this sector should continue its robust growth 

While boys and movie related toys continue to outperform  the girls segment has hit a wall  Classic brands such as My Little Pony and Furby are fighting an uphill battle with changing consumer spending habits  Besides the popular Disney Princess line  every other female focused toy group has fared poorly  Sales in this category were a weak spot in previous quarters and should continue to be in this onel

115613,337128,HAS,Is A Cashless World In Our Future ,opinion,"Nearly everyone can recall playing Monopoly as a child  and for many  the game served as their first exposure to handling different denominations of cash  It was exhilarating to have someone land on your Park Place property  complete with hotel  and in turn receive a fistful of  50s and  100s 
A new generation of players might never get the chance to experience this  however  as Hasbro Gaming just released an  Ultimate Banking  version of the popular board game that nixes the funny money in favor of play credit cards and an electronic scanner 
You could argue it s just a game  but Monopoly has always had a reputation for being a reflection of capitalism as it operates in the  real  world  which is why it was banned in communist states such as the Soviet Union   The cashless version of the game is no exception  as it comes at a time when calls to limit or in some cases eliminate the use of cash are intensifying  And to be clear   cash  here means cash in your pocket  not cash in the bank 
Just last week  former treasury secretary Larry Summers published an op end in the Washington Post arguing it s time to  kill the  100 bill   the reason being that it s preferred by those involved in money laundering  corruption and other illegal activity   One million dollars denominated in  100 bills weighs 2 2 pounds  he points out  whereas the same amount in  20 bills weighs a much more cumbersome 50 pounds   The European Union  he argues  should also consider getting rid of the 500 euro note  a position that s echoed by European anti fraud officials 
Having had  when I visited Harvard recently  I respect his opinion and believe his intentions are good  But ultimately the argument to eliminate the  100 bill is based on the presupposition that anyone using such a note is a drug trafficker or money launderer  This seems to go against one of the main tents of common law  namely  that we re innocent until proven guilty 
The risks far outweigh the benefits when you consider where this anti cash sentiment is leading us a cashless society  As I  regarding Sweden s own trend toward a cashless economy  every transaction could be monitored  not to mention taxed and charged a fee  Accounts could be frozen  which  in a cashless world  would leave you with nothing 
I ve experienced the inconvenience that sometimes comes with electronic transactions  as I m sure many of you have 
Occasionally my credit card couldn t be read for one reason or another  and if you re not carrying cash  what do you do  When I m traveling  domestically or abroad  I always carry cash with me  and  100 bills are much more convenient than a pound of  20s 
Capital controls are nothing new  but they would be much easier to impose  In Colombia  a tax is levied on every transaction  whether it is a direct deposit from your employer  transfer of funds between accounts or a purchase  Since 2003  Venezuela s government has significantly regulated the amount of money citizens can take with them on trips abroad  in effect blocking access to foreign travel 
Currently the limit is  2 000  but for travelers headed to the U S   it drops to  700  This  along with a labyrinthine exchange rate  there are three   has only created a black market currency exchange 
And since credit cards in Venezuela are issued by state run banks  there s no stopping the government from restricting payment on any goods or services  or from any vendor  it wishes 
Colombia and Venezuela are extreme cases  and there s no reason to expect the same would ever happen in the U S  At the same time  scrapping the  100 bill would further debase Americans  economic liberty 
Gold Shines on Stellar Consumer Price Index  CPI  Reading These concerns might be part of the reason why gold and silver coin sales are doing so well right now  The U S  Mint began selling out of its popular American Eagle coins late last year  and demand is exceeding the mint s weekly allocation of 1 million ounces  In Australia where four out of five respondents to  said the country would be cash free by 2022 gold coin sales surged 106 percent in January 2016 from a year earlier  silver coin sales  151 percent 
Buying gold in times of uncertainty and instability is not just tradition it s rational behavior  The yellow metal has a long history of acting as an effective store of value 
This is especially the case with nominal interest rates turning negative around the globe  More than a fifth of the world s GDP is now produced in countries with subzero rates  and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently stated that the Fed will not take such rates off the table for consideration 
Negative rates are essentially a tax on your bank deposits  intended to discourage saving  And if hard cash were no longer available to squirrel away in your mattress  gold might be the only other option 
But nominal rates aren t the only driver  Numerous times I ve written and spoken about  which is what you get when you subtract headline inflation from the government bond yield  When inflation rises  real rates are pushed lower  and when they turn negative  gold becomes more attractive  Last week the Labor Department reported that core inflation in January increased 0 3 percent  its largest monthly gain since August 2011  when gold reached its all time high of  1 900 per ounce  For the 12 month period  the consumer price index  CPI  hit an impressive 2 2 percent  its strongest showing since June 2012  Both of these readings beat analysts  estimates and should be constructive for gold 
Also helping the metal s appeal last week was the uncertainty surrounding whether the United Kingdom would exit the European Union  Momentum had been growing behind the  Brexit  campaign to end economic control from Brussels  with a majority of respondents to a British poll saying they were in favor of leaving the 28 member bloc  On Friday  however  Prime Minister David Cameron managed to secure a deal giving the UK  vital protections  to its economy  including never having to bail out any other EU member if it chooses not to  Gold ended the trading day up 2 3 percent to settle at  1 228 60 per ounce 
Oil Prices Aligned with Seasonality Trade Oil was up last week with prices rising above their 50 day moving average  mostly on a production cap agreement between the world s two largest producers  Russia and Saudi Arabia 
Historically  oil bottoms every February  and today it s right on cue  We are now due for a rally until Easter at least  possibly until the beginning of summer 
Another factor to consider is money supply  Based on our own regression analysis  there s a high correlation between money supply growth in the seven most populous countries and commodity prices  If you look back to 2011  when oil averaged  100 per barrel and gold peaked at  1 900  money supply was strong  Since then it s been falling  particularly in China  as you can see below  But with money supply on the upswing  we might have a good chance for a rally here 
Besides continued oversupply  oil s most significant headwind remains the U S  dollar  As it has gained in strength  emerging market currencies have declined 
As always  it s important to follow the smart money  Just as influential  Shark Tank  investor Mark Cuban went long on gold recently  we ve seen big name investors place their bets that oil prices will climb  It was widely reported last week that billionaires Warren Buffett  George Soros and hedge fund manager David Tepper all disclosed buying shares of Kinder Morgan  N KMI   the Houston based oil and gas pipeline company  Buffett s stake alone amounts to 26 5 million shares  currently valued at around  450 million 
In the meantime  low oil prices continue to give a lift to transportation stocks such as airlines  many of which reported record net profits for the fourth quarter

115642,337157,HAS,Stocks Squeeze Another Round of Gains  Dollar Strength Causes Oil Drop ,opinion,"U S  stocks ended slightly higher  after remaining in the red for most of Monday s trading session as the energy sector weighed down on the markets  A fresh decline in oil prices has hit energy related shares  including Exxon Mobil  N XOM  and Chevron  N CVX   who have been the worst performers under the Dow Jones index  Other commodities suffered as well as the dollar regained some of its strength  The downward pressure was increased with the release of worse than expected earnings reports from Morgan Stanley  N MS   Hasbro  O HAS  and more  However  Monday s sluggish trading may offer an indication to investors  wanting to see more third quarter earnings reports  according to some analysts  Regardless  the upcoming week includes a slew of earnings reports  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 14 57 points  or 0 1   to trade at 17 230 54  The Standard and Poor s 500 index rose 0 55 points  or 0 03   to trade at 2 033 66  The Nasdaq Composite gained 18 78 points  or 0 4   to close Monday s session at 4 905 47  Despite remaining relatively flat  Monday marked the third consecutive session of gains  Five of the S P s 10 sectors rose on Monday  led by a 0 5  gain in the consumer discretionary sector  For the year  this sector is around 9  up  The energy sector was hit the hardest after oil prices fell  Exxon Mobil fell nearly 2  to trade at  80 99 and Chevron tumbled 1 4  to trade at  90 03  According to analysts  while the ongoing supply glut has a hand in the latest round of declines  the strength of the dollar is likely the driving force behind the recent drop in energy prices  However  oil prices have since recovered during the early Asian trading session after falling 3  on the previous session  Gains were slightly capped by oversupply concerns and the outlook for global economic growth  which provides an indication for future demand  Brent crude added 11 cents to trade at  48 72 a barrel after falling 3 7  in the previous day  Crude oil gained 13 cents to trade at  46 02 a barrel after falling 3  in the previous day

115658,337173,HAS,Trades In Toyland   Hasbro,opinion,"Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  stock    had been moving in a channel into their last earnings report April 20th  A few days ahead of time it teased traders with a break out to the upside  But stalled there for a week  Finally  when no one was looking  it reported on a Monday morning  and the stock gapped higher  Since then it has done nothing  Back in consolidation mode  That means it is time to prepare for a trade again  Wait a minute  what 

Yes that is right  with the stock moving sideways and no clear catalyst for a couple of months it is time to get ready for a trade  The chart above gives the clues as to why  The Bollinger Bands  have gone from being over  15 wide to only  3 wide  This type of Bollinger Band squeeze is often a precursor to a move in the stock  In fact you can see this happened in March before the last move higher 
Now the question becomes  which way will it move  The momentum indicators put in a vote to the upside  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD has stopped falling and is level  heading towards a cross  The volume pattern looks that way too  A high volume move up followed by declining volume  looking like a bull flag  This would suggest a target to 80 on a break to the upside 
Clearly the price can go either way  And by buying a June 70 72 5 Strangle for  2 20 can cover both ways  But if you can get an edge on direction then the cost can often drop by nearly half  And buying the June 72 50 Calls for  1 30 can get you there

The US dollar steadied against most currencies on Monday as the market prepares for an interest rate hike  Further supporting this position  St  Louis Fed President James Bullard was quoted in saying that there is a higher than 50 percent chance that interest rates would hike in September  Analysts expect that a rate hike would occur this year even if at a later date  The dollar index  comparing a number of currencies to the U S  dollar  has remained flat despite marked gains during the day and is currently at 98 051  The euro edged up on the dollar and it trading at  1 0826 after falling overnight to its lowest level since mid April  The U S  dollar strengthened against the yen  adding around 0 1  to trade 124 36 yen after touching a four week high of 124 390 on Monday 
Gold  which has suffered significant declines in recent trading  has gained about 0 6  to trade at  1 103 28 per ounce  The sharp decline has created some concern  although the reopening of the Greek banking system as Greece begins to pay off its debts has helped the market stabilize  At the current state of a strong dollar  investors have less incentive to hold on to gold  As the market nears a U S  interest rate hike for the first time in nearly a decade  gold is expected to continue to trade near lows 
Crude oil continued to decline on Monday  dipping below  50 per barrel as the dollar strengthened and concerns over a supply glut caused by the nuclear deal with Iran create concerns for ample demand  Crude oil is currently trading at  50 29 per barrel

115665,337180,HAS,Michael Kors Share Price Collapse May Continue,opinion,"Michael Kors  NYSE KORS  will report it s FQ1  16 results tomorrow morning and from examining the recent stocks price action  expectations are low for Michael Kors  Michael Kors has continued to disappoint investors this year  year to date  YTD  the stock has collapsed over  47  compared to the broader S P 500 which has risen 2 49  
The Estimize community is predicting better EPS and revenue figures than Wall Street for Michael Kors  According to Estimize  Michael Kors will produce  0 78 in EPS and  952 79M in revenues  whereas Wall Street analysts are predicting  0 75 in EPS and  942 99M in revenues 

Many consumer discretionary stocks including Macy s  NYSE M  and Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  have been reaping the rewards recently as households in United States gain more discretionary income as a result of lower fuel prices and slowly rising wages  Michael Kors  however  is certainly not benefiting  The once exclusive high end fashion label famous for its prestigious handbags has lost its way over the past two years  The explosion of sales growth experienced by Michael Kors a number of years ago is beginning to have painful effects on company s brand name and sales  Michael Kors is now faced with a challenging environment in which their brand name has been tarnished and its exclusivity lost  This has led to Michael Kors having to slash prices in an attempt to sell slow moving lines of stock 
Michael Kors  share price collapse is a result of numerous additional factors  all of which should be a serious concern for investors leading into the company s upcoming result  Michael Kors  watch business continues to experience weakness  foreign exchange headwinds and a slowdown in North American traffic have all been detrimental to Michael Kors  underlying business and are likely to continue to have negative effects on the companies finance in the coming quarters 
Investors will want to hear from management with respect to their store opening strategy  The company s store count experienced an explosion of growth from 2013  where its products were available in circa 2 913 globally compared to today s figure of over 4 133 locations  Although more stores typically results in increased revenues  it can harm the brand and cause long term problems as growth slows  which is what is currently being experienced  Investors will likely react negatively if management continue to open stores at a rapid rate 
With the stock almost halving over the past 8 months  the question now is whether or not Michael Kors can fall even further  With expectations so low  it is hard to picture ongoing losses for Michael Kors shareholders  However  if the report tomorrow morning disappoints once again and no clear strategy is outlaid  investors may in for another tough 3 months ",2015-08-06,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/michael-kors-share-price-collapse-may-continue.-260725,260725
115669,337184,HAS,Does Cheaper Valuation Make Mattel Attractive ,opinion,"Mattel  Inc   NASDAQ MAT  has been struggling and even losing revenue despite the industry witnessing an uptrend in the past  That can be seen from the way its privately held rival  Lego  has been performing  If the stock is witnessing sluggishness  it is because of the none too impressive performance from the company  For instance  the publicly held firm s sales witnessed a drop in sales in the first two quarters of the current year  However  its rival  Lego  reported a 30  jump in sales  Its poor performance also reflected in the top twenty holiday toys  While it was able to see only three toys making their way to the list  Hasbro  Inc   NASDAQ NASDAQ HAS  witnessed five toys making its way to the top twenty holiday toys  However  the underperformance  be it stock or sales  could be a thing of the past if their new alliance or events started producing results 
Industry Performance
Mattel is a laggard in the toy industry that has been growing as the licensed toys are continuing to make healthy progress with the possibility of extending in the upcoming years too  The makers of toys are launching several licensed toys of familiar film franchises to get a bigger share of the market  Obviously  this factor has heightened the competitive environment in the toy industry  NPD  a research firm s findings said that the toy industry s retail sales witnessed 4  growth in the United States  to reach  18 billion  Of that  the licensed toys were the biggest gainers by recording 7  sales uptick 
In the current year  toy sales have already recorded 7 3  growth  fueled by strong sales of Paw Patrol  Shopkins  and Minecraft  apart from Disney Frozen  NPD Group s SVP of the toys division  Juli Lennett  said that the kind of sales performance suggest that the current year will be one of the best years for the industry in a decade  However  the year cannot be a good one for Mattel  In the first half of the current year  the company suffered a 5  drop in sales  The toy maker also suffered a net loss of  69 5 million in the first six month period of the current year  One of the reasons for the drop was the 16  drop in Barbie sales that hurt girls  as well as boys brands sales driving down 10   That apart  there was a 14  fall in other brands of girls toys 
Will The Second Half Be Better 
Now  the question is whether the second half of the current year will be better than the first one  The indications suggest positively for the company  though nothing dramatic can be expected in its performance  The optimism is due to the robust demand of some of the toys that included Avengers  Age of Ultron  Jurassic World  and other licensed toys  That apart  the most recently launched Minions will likely increase sales during the holiday season in the current year  Last year  Mattel suffered a 5 6  fall in sales during the holiday season  The company will try to erase the bad memory by focusing on improving its sales from Star Wars Hot Wheels  The industry will also likely close the year on an upbeat note 
New Partners Joining
A few months ago  DC Entertainment teamed up with Mattel and Warner Bros to unveil  DC Super Hero Girls   For its part  Mattel would launch its new action dolls line for release next spring season  That would be the first six inch dolls developed specifically for girls in the age group of 6   12  The alliance  as well as the license  should help all the involved companies  particularly Mattel  to enhance girls division sales to a larger extent  The alliance would also enable the company to compete better with its rivals  Incidentally  Walt Disney Co   NYSE DIS  was leaving Mattel  Therefore  the alliance should compensate more than the loss of Disney leaving 
Women Prefers Mattel Brand
Recently  Piper Jaffray disclosed a finding of its survey of women  That indicated that Mattel still commanded confidence among women as they believe that the brand shows early signs of stabilization  The survey came on the back of a 25  drop in stock price to reach its lowest level after 2011  The brokerage s analyst  Stephanie Wissink  said that the upcoming holiday season would be a critical performance point for regaining reach among baby  as well as preschool  The survey was conducted involving over 1 000 women that included moms 
The brokerage said that the survey indicated improving sentiment among moms in respect of Mattel brands  That included Barbie  Disney Princesses  and Fisher Price  That should be a big boost to arrest the sliding stock price in the last one year  Significantly  Fisher Price topped the preferred toy brand among the retailer  That is a first time in three surveys that the company s toy reached the top level 
Secondly  there appears to be improved favorability of the Barbie brand  with 55  of moms viewing it positively  That meant a 7  growth from the spring season  Despite these positives  the analyst is not ready to boost the rating from Neutral  as well as the price target of  22 on the shares of the company 
Conclusion
It seems that the share price of Mattel has bottomed out as some of the data suggests  However  those data should reflect on the financial numbers to have more confidence in the stock  which is already providing a yield of 6 5   There is no doubt that the upcoming holiday season would be a litmus test to prove its strength  That should allow the company to erase the past memory of its losing streak  Though there is an element of risk because of the past  the current price looks to be attractive due to recent events  as well as data

Our Most Attractive Stocks   1 5   underperformed the S P 500   2 0   last month  Most Attractive Small Cap stock EZchip Semiconductor  NASDAQ EZCH  gained 11  and Most Attractive Large Cap stock Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  was up 13  
Overall  17 out of the 40 Most Attractive stocks outperformed the S P 500 last month 
March Picks
Our Most Attractive stocks for March were made available on March 5  Our Most Attractive stocks have high and rising returns on invested capital  ROIC  and low price to economic book value ratios 
Most Attractive Stock Featured for March  Teva Pharmaceuticals
One of the new additions to our Most Attractive stocks list for March is Teva Pharmaceuticals  ARCA TEVA   an Israeli pharmaceutical company and the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world  The stock is up 9  this year  While Teva has a challenging 2015 ahead of it  we re confident in this company s ability to weather the storm and to continue to deliver value for its shareholders as it has done for years 
A Relatively Unknown Winner in Pharmaceuticals
Since 2002  Teva has grown net operating profit after tax  NOPAT  by an impressive 22  compounded annually  The driving forces behind this growth have been 1  Teva s dominance in the generic drugs market and 2  sales of Copaxone  Teva s groundbreaking treatment for Multiple Sclerosis  In 2014  Teva produced 14  of all generic prescriptions in the United States 
Figure 1 provides a look at how Teva has grown NOPAT since its public listing in 2002 
Figure 1  Teva s Long Term Success

Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Teva currently earns an ROIC of 10   up from 9  in 2012  NOPAT margins are near historic highs at 21  while revenue was mostly flat in 2014  2014 also saw Teva hit new highs in terms of free cash flow  over  4 7 billion  while its margins and ROIC were strong in the face of flat sales 
Like many pharmaceutical companies  Teva has taken on a large amount of debt    12 billion  or over 23  of Teva s market cap   to fund its research and acquisition efforts  However  Teva s abundant free cash flow discussed earlier should ease concerns about servicing its debt 
How Much Does This Roadblock Matter 
Teva has done a great job increasing its profitability in the face of flat sales  But what about when sales fall 
The drug that made Teva what it is today is Copaxone  a patented treatment for multiple sclerosis  As is the case with all patents  this drug s patents must expire   this one in September 2015  The problem with this is that half of Teva s Specialty Medicines  non generic medicines  profits and revenues come from this single drug  Specialty Medicines makes up 42  of Teva s revenues and 69  of its reported operating income 
Teva is currently embroiled in a legal battle over whether or not its patent that protected Copaxone until September is invalid  If the company can secure this patent  it has time to switch patients in the U S  and especially Europe to its new  thrice weekly version of Copaxone  patented until 2030  In 2014  60  of Copaxone prescriptions in the U S  were for this new version 
The expiration of the Copaxone patent will dramatically affect Teva even if it has more time to transition consumers to the new  patented version  In January  the U S  Supreme Court overturned the federal appeals court decision that invalidated the patent  and sent it back to the court for further review  so Teva has a few more months to continue transitioning patients to its new  patented version of Copaxone 
Cheaper generics  that necessitate higher injection rates than this new version  will undoubtedly take some of the market when this patent expires  This looks to have already been priced in though  and a recent study found that higher injection rates for Copaxone would increase the amount of complications for patients 
Aside from preparing for this  patent cliff   Teva has several other strategies it is pursuing  On top of aggressive cost cutting measures that are expected to increase operating margins by 600 basis points in 2015  the company is pursuing niche markets in manufacturing increasingly complex generic drugs that other manufacturers tend to shy away from  The lack of competition in these niche spaces should also help soften the margin impact from the Copaxone expiration 
Current Valuation Allows for Patent Risk and Huge Upside
At its current price of   61 share  TEVA has a price to economic book value ratio of just over 0 8  This ratio implies that the market expects the company s profits to permanently decline by 20   This seems unlikely given the increasing demand for pharmaceuticals worldwide  and considering Teva s history of profit growth in Figure 1 
Moreover   that Teva could be shopping around for a potential acquisition target  as it has thus far sat out of the recent pharmaceutical M A boom  This provides the possibility of a large upward catalyst for TEVA  as it has done for other  less attractively valued pharmaceutical companies this year 
If Teva can grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next 10 years    a 52  upside from current levels  We think that Teva has the potential to do much better than even this scenario indicates  which is why it makes our Most Attractive stocks list this month

115688,337203,HAS,Should You Buy The Dip ,opinion,"There s a popular saying amongst most schools of investing   buy the dip   This maxim can hold especially true for value investors  who look for companies that are trading cheaply relative to their book values  This is where we fall  We like to quantify the expectations embedded in companies  stock prices to see if these expectations are rational  If the expectations are too pessimistic based on the company s financials  we buy in 
Now that the first quarter of 2015 is behind us  it s prudent to examine any new investment opportunities that have arisen over the past three months  That s why we re looking at the stocks that saw the biggest decline in 1Q15 to see if they warrant buying at their new  lower prices 
Data Storage Out of Room    SanDisk Corp  NASDAQ SNDK 
SanDisk  maker of data storage products and services   leads  this pack after dropping 35  in the first quarter of 2015  SanDisk makes and markets removable memory cards used in various portable consumer devices  solid state hard drives used in laptops and computers  and data storage products for use in enterprise markets  After revising guidance for its 1Q15 revenue  the stock plummeted more than 18   This guidance revision comes on the heels of a similar move in the previous quarter s earnings report  The company cited issues such as product delays  lower sales in enterprise markets  and lower pricing as the main reasons for the lowered revenue estimates  Obviously a company that keeps lowering revenue going forward is going to warrant a sharp decline in share price 
However  the decline in SanDisk may be largely overblown  as the concerns are not as serious when viewed long term  SanDisk is still one of the largest flash memory providers in the world  and the entire industry is expected to see significant growth moving forward  Despite increasing competition  SanDisk still boasts an impressive gross margin upwards of 50   which is admittedly expected to see pressure going forward  Even if this huge margin contracts due to increased competition  it still leaves SanDisk ample room to operate and continue growing profits long term 
On top of its high margins  SanDisk has consistently grown its revenue over the last 10 years while weathering rapid advancements in technology  As emerging countries continue to get access to new technology and older storage technologies are replaced in developed markets  the usage of SanDisk s products will continue to grow with the industry  These short term worries have created an excellent opportunity in SanDisk shares 
Fundamentally  SanDisk is situated well to weather a decline in revenue while still delivering shareholder value  SanDisk had over  4 2 billion in current assets on its balance sheet and over  200 million in free cash flow at the end of 2014  Total debt sits at  2 2 billion  or 15  of the company s market cap  SanDisk s strong balance sheet should allow it to continue meeting its dividend payments  move forward with its share repurchase program  and also continue looking into avenues to grow the business even further 
SanDisk has grown net operating profit after tax  NOPAT  by 22  compounded annually over the past five years  While this may slow down going forward  SNDK s current price is highly undervalued even when accounting for a lower NOPAT growth rate  The company s return on invested capital  ROIC  was 23  in 2014  which places SanDisk in the top quintile of all companies we cover  SanDisk is more than efficient at deploying the capital invested into its business  and with a history of high ROIC  we expect more of the same moving forward  The company s fundamental strengths lead SNDK to receive our Attractive rating 
At its new price of   67 share  SNDK has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 0  This ratio implies that the market expects SanDisk s NOPAT to never meaningfully increase from current levels  The expectation that SanDisk would cease to grow profits in the high growth flash memory industry ignores all realities of the market 
If we give SanDisk credit for only 6  NOPAT growth  compounded annually over the next 10 years  the stock is worth  85 share today   a 25  upside from current prices  The large decline in share price has created an opportunity not normally afforded in today s market  This stock is certainly one to  buy on the dip  
Going Out of Fashion    Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL 
Ralph Lauren and his prancing horse logo are icons in the annals of American fashion  However  due to a number of factors  the Ralph Lauren Co  s stock had an extremely rough start to 2015  and dropped 29  between January and March 
The luxury goods sector overall dropped in the first quarter due to concerns about consumer response to luxury pricing  especially in China  which saw luxury growth decline   1   for the first time ever in 4Q14  The strong dollar only added to investors  concerns  Later on in the quarter  Ralph Lauren reported that it missed on both earnings and revenue in the last quarter of 2014  while revenue growth was up just modestly year over year  at 0 5  growth  Add the West Coast port shutdown into the mix  and it s not surprising that RL declined in 1Q15 
However  RL s 29  decline in the first quarter is almost certainly overdrawn  as the company s financials are as good as they ve ever been  Ralph Lauren s revenue was up 5  on a TTM basis  but due to the impact of the strong dollar  NOPAT was  804 million and was flat for the period  While the dollar affected Ralph Lauren s bottom line  it did not affect cash flow  and the company earned an all time high of  833 million in free cash flow on a TTM basis 
All of these shifting financials have dragged down Ralph Lauren s ROIC to 14  from its high of 16  in 2013  However  a 14  ROIC is nothing to sneeze at  and is in the top quintile of all Consumer Discretionary companies we cover  In fact  Ralph Lauren has a long history of generating returns on capital  and has had just one year of sub 10  returns on invested capital and just one year of revenue decline since 1998  This track record  along with the company s  1 1 billion in excess cash and solid free cash flow  makes us confident that Ralph Lauren can weather the turbulence in the dollar s value and the Chinese luxury goods market 
At its current valuation of  139 share  RL has a price to economic book value of almost 1 4  which implies that the market expects Ralph Lauren s profits to grow by 40  for the rest of the life of the company  While this certainly isn t cheap  it s not particularly expensive either  If Ralph Lauren can grow profits by 7  compounded annually for the next 10 years  the stock is worth  173 share  a 24  upside  Note that Ralph Lauren has grown profits by 12  compounded annually since 1998  so this forward growth assumption is a conservative one  RL looks like an attractive pick for  buy the dip  
A Beaten Down Stock in a Beaten Down Sector   ENSCO plc  NYSE ESV 
Over the last six months  energy prices have continued to decline  and investor sentiment has grown increasingly pessimistic regarding the energy sector in the United States  Adding to this uncertainty are international policy concerns with oil producing nations such as Iran and Saudi Arabia  Although these concerns are warranted  Ensco s stock has seen a disproportionate decline 
Just how badly is the market undervaluing Ensco  the world s second largest offshore drilling company  First  the stock s economic book value is  92 per share  This is the company s value if it doesn t grow profits from their current levels from the rest of its lifetime  When share price is taken into account  the ESV s PEBV ratio is 0 4  The market is therefore expecting a 60  decline in NOPAT 
While in the short term this kind of decline may occur  over the long term this kind of expectation is unreasonable  Over the last 10 years  Ensco has grown NOPAT by 6  compounded annually  At the moment  Ensco receives our Very Attractive rating due to its 9  ROIC and a high 16   free cash flow yield  Despite this consistent performance the stock has declined from  53 in 2010 to its current price of  23  This pessimism has also been driven by analysts who have forecasted consensus revenue declines of 4  for Ensco for each of the next two years 
However  even if Ensco fails to grow at all going forward  the stock I still worth a substantial amount more than  23 share  If we expect that the company can earn the same NOPAT in five years that it earned in 2014  the stock is worth  93 share today   a 300  upside from current levels  Given Ensco s healthy balance sheet and  1 2 billion in free cash flow in 2014  it seems pessimistic to forecast the company s profits permanently declining by 60   as the stock s current valuation implies  At a valuation this cheap and with a track record this strong  it s hard not to justify taking a serious look at ESV 
A Bet on the Energy Sector With Carl Icahn   Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK 
Much like its sector peer above  Chesapeake has had a rough several months in the Energy sector  During the first quarter of 2015  shares of Chesapeake Energy declined by a startling 27   During this same period  the iShares U S  Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Index  has actually increased by 3  
As the second largest natural gas producer in the United States  Chesapeake Energy is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas prices to drive profitability  With WTI crude oil prices hovering around  50  and natural gas prices at around  2 80  investors are concerned with near term company performance in a declining market  To provide perspective  in February 2014 WTI crude was priced at over  100 per barrel and natural gas was at  5 56 
To deal with this  Chesapeake is monitoring financial aspects within its direct control such as capital planning and overall activity levels  Although Chesapeake cannot directly control oil prices  it can control expenses and capital expenditures  Two weeks ago on March 23  Chesapeake announced that it would be spending  500 million less on capital expenditures due to weak commodity pricing  This represents nearly 25  of the company s 2014 capital expenditures 
The company has made steady progress in managing its balance sheet by reducing drilling and completion expenditures by nearly  1 billion since 2013  The company also continues to divest assets that are not critical to core operations  For example  according to the company s Feb  25  2015 conference call  Chesapeake divested two shale assets worth roughly  5 billion  This transaction represented only 7  of production but nearly 40  of the company s market capitalization at the time  This is important as the company now has more financial flexibility to better manage the cyclical downturn in oil prices  Currently the company has a  4 billion cash balance  over triple its 2013 cash balance of  837 million  Chesapeake obtained another  4 billion capital cushion in the form of a new  unsecured credit facility  Chesapeake s liquidity position is therefore very favorable  The company is not only positioned well in the current price environment  but also can take advantage of favorable investment opportunities within the industry 
Finally  insider trading from company executives has been very favorable recently  Insiders can sell their holdings for any number of reasons  However  insiders buy for only one reason  they want to make money  Insider purchases have been very positive for the company  Archie W  Dunham  chairman of Chesapeake s board  purchased 1 million shares of common stock according to a March 31  2015 filing  worth nearly  14 million 
Notable investor Carl Icahn has also increased his stake in the company to 73 million shares  High insider transactions  a large purchase from the Chairman  and a significant investment from an investor recognized for his ability to properly ascertain value are all positives for the stock 
In addition to the improved liquidity position and favorable insider purchases  the company has a very compelling valuation  Chesapeake has managed to generate strong NOPAT growth over the last decade at 14  compounded annually  This strong growth has occurred during varying oil and gas prices and macroeconomic cycles 
Due to the cyclical energy decline currently underway  analysts project revenue declines of 22  next year and revenue increases of 4 3  the following year  Given the uncertainty with future oil and gas prices this seems like a reasonable estimate  Assuming a revenue decline of 22  next year  and NOPAT growth of just 0 3  compounded annually for the next 9 years  the stock is worth  26 share  a 73  upside from current valuations  CHK is extremely cheap at the moment and definitely a long term hold 
No One Wants Our Toys Anymore    Mattel Inc   NASDAQ MAT 
Mattel  MAT   the longtime kids toy producer  makes our list after dropping 27  in the first quarter of 2015  Mattel makes well known children s toys under the Barbie  Hot Wheels  Fisher Price  and American Girl brands  Unfortunately for Mattel  4Q14 earnings were largely disappointing  and the continued confusion within the company has created a further decline in share price  Yearly revenues declined 7  in 2014 with fourth quarter results dragging even further  Particular weakness was seen in the Barbie segment  which saw revenue decline 12  year over year  and the Fisher Price segment  which saw revenue decline 11   Gross margin and operating margin also declined  with operating nearly halving to 12  in 4Q14 
Unfortunately for Mattel  the company s issues run deeper than just one bad quarter  The Barbie sales decline marks the third consecutive year in which the brand s sales declined year over year  For the entire year  Barbie sales were down 16  over 2013  even worse than the 12  decline for 4Q14  As other toy makers like Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  have taken market share from Mattel  there have been no clear signs of how Mattel plans to reverse course  In fact  management shakeups have become a normal event at Mattel  Mattel s interim CEO was made permanent in early April  however this announcement comes on the heels of Mattel hiring the company s prior CEO as a consultant and paying him more now than as CEO  Also  Mattel s CCO and COO have also been shuffled in the past month  Executive shakeups can be a positive for a company in decline  but the lack of clarity in positions and strategy makes Mattel s moves easy to question 
Adding to investors  worries  Mattel recently lost the rights to produce Disney Princess products to rival Hasbro  a lucrative contract that saw enormous upside potential after the release of the blockbuster Disney movie Frozen  While Mattel still holds the rights to produce Disney Princess dolls through 2015  moving beyond that  it remains unclear how Mattel aims to make up for the lost revenue  For a few years now  Mattel has not done much innovating  Meanwhile its competitors have slowly taken their market share  and it will be up to Mattel to determine the correct response to return to its former glory 
Fundamentally  Mattel is neither good nor bad  NOPAT declined 42  year over year in 2014  but this was after five consecutive years of near double digit growth  The company s ROIC fell to a 14 year low of 7  in 2014  Falling profits and ROIC do not bode well for investors unless Mattel has a solid plan to reverse course  Mattel does have over  2 5 billion in total debt  which is 31  of its market cap  but also  3 1 billion in current assets and over  140 million in free cash flow for 2014 
After the large decline in price  MAT s valuation does look more attractive  However  issues highlighted above such as its low ROIC  low free cash flow yield  and negative NOPAT growth earn this stock our Neutral rating  Given the management issues detailed above  as well as the lack of a clear plan to return to growth  Mattel does not appear to be stock to  buy on the dip  
At its current price of   24 share  Mattel has a PEBV ratio of 1 2  which implies that the market expects the company to grow NOPAT by 20  over the life of the company  While this expectation may seem low  unfortunately Mattel has given no reason for investors to believe that is currently possible without drastic changes in the business

graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings   Hasbro Inc  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 2003 Performance Table Hasbro IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 11 9  capital appreciation  long term shareholders of Hasbro Inc  assuming an initial investment of  100 000  would have received an additional  46 493 46 in dividends that increased their total return from 11 9  to 13 6  per annum versus 6 3  invested in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2003 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Hasbro Inc is 1 03 which is historically normal   Looking to the Future  Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants   1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings 2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance   The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to

long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Hasbro Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Hasbro Inc s
