10866,232381,NCR,Stocks To Watch  ENPH  LSCC  NCR  SEDG  UIS,opinion,"Enphase Energy  Inc   ENPH ENPH  is running up  Ever since we first noticed this stock on a breakout in January when it was trading at 5 1 2 3 4  we watched it rocket to the 28 range  Wednesday is an exceptional day with it up 6 50  or 30   to 28 15  on 22 million shares  the biggest volume I ve ever seen on this stock  The long term chart and channel top comes in at about 32  so it might get an extension if it gets momentum  But be careful  Any reversal put a stop under Wednesday s low at 26 26 1 4 
Lattice S emiconductor Corporation  LSCC LSCC continues to run and on Wednesday it was up 2 93  or 18   to 19 34  on 12 million shares  That s the second biggest volume I ve seen on this stock  It had a breakaway gap in January  but we put a swing on it before it was a breakaway gap when it was trading in the 7 1 2 range  It has made it to Wednesday s high at 20 1 4  My extension target is 25 at the top of the channel 
NCR Corporation  NCR NCR had an inverse head and shoulders type pattern  it popped  and then consolidated for 2 1 2 months  and then had the recent run up for 8 days in a row  and on Wednesday it closed up 1 36  or 4   to 33 81  on 2 million shares  with a high of 35 08  It got almost to the top of the channel  so I m not surprised it pulled back  There is some support at 33  and if it gets through that the target is 38

10867,232382,NCR,Is NCR Corporation  NCR  A Solid Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NCR Corporation   NYSE NCR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NCR Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 64  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 52  If we focus on the long term PE trend  NCR Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 10 74 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer and Technology Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that NCR Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 73  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for NCR Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  NCR Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 78 This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 26 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NCR Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NCR Corporation a solid choice for value investors For example  the P CF ratio for NCR Corporation  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 64  which is better than the industry average of 8 28  Clearly  NCR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though NCR Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of B  This gives NCR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at the best  The current quarter has seen no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to five downward revisions  while the current year estimate has seen three upward revisions compared to no downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate declined 9 46  in the past two months  whereas the current year estimate increased 0 72   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NCR Corporation Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNCR Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 21  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying

10870,232385,NCR,Attractive Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Buying ,opinion,Investors often overlook sales growth while selecting stocks  as a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum  Nonetheless  earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and inflated  That s why sales should always be considered Sales growth is an important indicator of a company s health and ability to sustain its business  It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  The main advantage is that sales figures are generally not manipulated and are less volatile than earnings Without some top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires steady sales growth Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening     Keurig Dr Pepper   NYSE KDP   is a Burlington  MA based beverage company  Its expected sales growth rate for 2019 is 10 9   and it carries a Zacks Rank  2 Based in Bloomfield  CT  Cigna   NYSE CI   provides insurance and related products and services  Expected sales growth rate for 2019 is 182 5

10914,232429,NCR,Outlook 2018  Equity  Crypto Rallies Will Slow   But Continue ,opinion,"Risk rose in 2017 via North Korea s ongoing saber rattling in the form of ballistic missile tests  the re emergence of global populism which this past year included Donald Trump s first year as president of the US  the UK s continuing  muddled Brexit negotiations  the ascent of Catalan separatism and recent Euroskeptic election victories such as Sebastian Kurz s People s Party in Austria  not to mention the weak outlook for a variety of nationalist leaning parties in South and Central America but global markets remained exuberant  with US markets at the forefront  though shares in South Korea  up 20 4  YTD   Brazil   24 8  YTD  and Hong Kong   34 4   outpaced US gains  19 8  for the S P   The best performing index this year however was Vietnam s Hanoi 30  up a whopping 50 5  on the year so far 
At the beginning of 2017 many wondered if the Dow Jones Industrial Average  which started the year at 19872 86  would hit 20K  As of the Friday before Christmas it closed at 24 754 06 25 2  higher on the year and 23 7  above that 20K  fantasy   Oh  and during the course of 2017 so far it s hit over 70 new record highs  the most record closes for a year ever  surpassing the previous record of 69  made in 1995 
The S P 500 wasn t exactly a laggard either  it began 2017 at 2251 57 and closed before the holiday weekend at 2683 34  up 19 8   The NASDAQ Composite also outperformed expectations  gaining 29 2  over the course of the year so far  propelled higher by tech sector shares which are currently up 33  on the year  using iShares US Technology  NYSE IYW  as our benchmark  
Oil appears to finally have recovered from its swoon after the 2016 slump  but the dollar continues to look unsteady  Volatility remains practically non existent  but cryptocurrencies have been on an eye popping tear  barreling past other assets this year in terms of percentage gains  Bitcoin hurtled higher by 1200  for 2017  having started the year at  999  Ethereum rocketed from  8 17 to  624 3  up 7541   and Ripple rallied from  0 00652 to  0 90  or 13 700  
On a quieter note  the Fed delivered on their three rate hike promise this year  with another three forecast for 2018  Though the European Central Bank  ECB  has confirmed that it is cutting monthly asset purchases they remain cautious about raising rates  As for the Bank of England  BoE   along with general monetary policy decisions  they also must contend with what remains a great unknown how will Brexit negotiations play out for the UK 
Many claim they re happy to see 2017 in the rearview mirror  but from a markets perspective it was indeed a very good year  Will 2018 be as good  or perhaps better  for investors  We asked 12 of our most popular contributors  as well as some Investing com analysts  how they see markets performing as 2018 begins 
This installment covers this year s outperformers  Stocks and Cryptocurrencies  Read Part 2  for where our contributors believe Gold  Silver  Oil  the Euro and Dollar as well as major Central Bank Policy are headed in 2018 

Declan Fallon  Generational Rally to Continue  Small Caps Best Positioned to Gain
The market bottom of March 2009 came a year earlier than I thought but hasn t disappointed in terms of its significance  As indices head into 2018 in a buoyant mood marking the ninth year for the secular bull market it s hard to look beyond this continuing  However  Large Caps and Tech Indices  the latter in particular  are due a round of sustained selling which last afflicted the broader market in January February 2016 
The only market to feel the full pinch of seller s pain in 2016 was the Russell 2000  This is based on the top 5  of historic weak prices dating back to the inception of the index  measured as a relative percentage loss to the index s 200 day MA  Comparable extremes for the NASDAQ occurred during October 2008  and for the S P during November 201  the latter based on data going back to 1950  
For the Russell 2000  the 2016 January February selloff should have flushed out all the weak hands  thus resetting the cyclical bull market count which is now just a couple of years old and could last another two to three years 
While a sustained selloff will no doubt attract talks of a crash  in real terms any selloff will only give back a fraction of the nine year gains  for example  a 25  loss  aka  bear market   in the S P would bring the index to around 1 985 well above the 2016 swing low of 1 810  Again  context is everything  A 40  style crash would bring the S P to 1 600s  last seen in the latter part of 2013 and four years after the low generated by the credit crisis 
Consequently  don t be afraid to start accumulating shares  i e  component stocks of the relative indices  once the S P drops into the 15  of historic weak action which kicks in on a 4 8  drop below its 200 day MA  becoming an historic extreme  5   when the S P is 10 5  below its 200 day MA  Likewise  accumulate NASDAQ shares when the index loses 7 5  against its 200 day MA with historic extremes at a 19 1  loss 
For the Russell 2000  which covered the spectrum of losses in early 2016  accumulate when the index is 4 8  off its 200 day MA and hits an extreme at a 14 8  loss  This is based from an end of day close  not an intraday low  The precision on these figures  and when to start taking profits  can be found in the tables available as a footnote   

Joseph L  Shaefer  This Bull Still Has Legs
No bull market dies of natural causes  This one is no exception  Despite the anguished cries of short sellers and red flags thrown carelessly about by those left behind and now desperately seeking an  I told you so   this bull still has legs 
Interest rates are low  An extra 1 4 percent rise is not going to cause any concern  The economy hovers between inflation  mostly government caused in both education and health care  and deflation  especially in energy thanks to supply demand factors  and food thanks to greater competition and excellent crop yields   No real changes there 
Valuations  In recent articles I have discussed over a dozen different Fallen Angels and identified scores more  These companies can be bought now at prices available only a year ago  or in some cases many years back  Yes  many shares are overvalued  So don t buy those  In trailing sectors and beaten down companies there is still a great deal of money to be made in the early going in 2018 
Why should this change as the year goes on  Lots of reasons  Fewer and fewer such tax selling bargains and  I don t want to miss the party  buying  Greater leverage  The entry of johnny come lately nervous holders  The likelihood of further rate increases  A likely rebound in commodities including energy good for owners of the right energy shares  bad for Industrials  Materials  and so many other sectors  Year on year earnings comparisons  what looked great  in comparison to  last year s earnings is less likely to be very impressive compared to this year 
And finally  at long last  valuation  By mid year  instead of defending forward median share prices of 25 times earnings  Wall Street will be touting 28 times earnings as reasonable  with 30 times earnings OK for the fastest growers  This will be the point at which a small boy will cry out to his mum   But the emperor has no clothes   The latter half of 2018 will be a great time to make money in long short funds and other non market sensitive positions 
As for specific stocks  Valero  NYSE VLO   Range Resources  NYSE RRC  and Encana  NYSE ECA  are my favorite energy stocks for the coming months  I own them all  Of the Fallen Angels I mentioned above   I personally own Teva  NYSE TEVA   Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   NCR  NYSE NCR   Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY    BT Group  NYSE BT   Kroger  NYSE KR  and Mednax Inc  NYSE MD  

Candy Matheson  More Volatility  Additional Political Uncertainty
The full article from which this was excerpted was originally published on December 4  2017 
Taking into consideration the uncertainty that next year s mid term elections will bring  coupled with likely interest rate hikes  I d project that we ll likely to see volatility rise in 2018 and the SPX  and the other 8 Major Indices  gain only about half of what they gained this year  This would mean an approximate increase of 10  for the SPX  I expect Technology to remain fairly strong  Small Caps may struggle more than Big Caps  Nonetheless  I anticipate that the U S  markets will continue to outperform other World Markets 
With respect to the S P 500  NASDAQ 100  and Russell 2000 Indices  I d watch to see whether the following major support levels can be held on the following Index Volatility ratios   a breach of those important levels could produce a selloff  
SPX VIX Ratio    200
NDX VXN Ratio    350
RUT RVX Ratio    80

Clement Thibault  Investing com Analyst  15 20  Correction Ahead  But No Apocalypse
I believe we re in borderline  never before seen territory when it comes to the US stock market  The only two red months for the S P in 2017 were March and August  when the index lost 18 and 6 points  respectively  That s  0 7  and  0 2  for the worst months of the year  The Dow is up 25 4  in 2017  while the S P is up  only  20 1  
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  are all up over 50  this year  That type of double digit growth is unusual for mega cap  mature companies  which each of these is of course 
Clearly  they re past their start up phases  So expectations for this sort of robust growth more commonly seen with promising  early stage growth prospects cannot account for the tremendous increase in each of their share prices  To each company its own reasons  naturally  but they all indeed continued to grow over the year  Of course  the Technology sector in general enjoyed positive momentum and sentiment throughout the year  which helped propel market leaders higher 
Overall  however  the market seems stretched  The last uninterrupted bull run took place from 2012 to 2014 and was the result of a recovery following a crash  This isn t where we are now  I believe we will witness a 15 20  correction in the first half of 2018  Corrections are  after all  a natural part of every market cycle  regardless of any reforms enacted by the Trump administration 
However  I do not see an apocalyptic scenario on the horizon  The US economy does seem to be strengthening  albeit slowly  As well  the closest thing we ve had to a correction this year was the 3 25  drop in March  So it s inevitable that this impressive no real correction streak will come to an end  Afterward  the reasonably expensive tech stocks  such as Facebook  NASDAQ FB  or Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   will be one of the most attractive investments for the second half of the year 
 Investing com CryptoCurrency Team  Mania Moderates and Connoisseurship Takes Hold
Without doubt  2017 was the year of crypto mania  Bitcoin  which grabbed headlines early and often this past year  saw heart stopping gains  but other digital currencies  such as Ripple and Litecoin  had even better returns from a percentage point of view 
Merely owning an asset labeled cryptocurrency could have yielded thousands of percent of added value for an investor  regardless of the digital currency s technological protocol  During the final days of 2017 however  a massive wave of cryptocurrency selling took hold  which appears to still be in progress 
We believe this signals that sentiment toward Bitcoin and all sister alt currencies is moderating  And that moderation will most likely characterize trading in 2018 
As well  we re seeing significant  conventional economy  entities getting in on the crypto action  just this month both CME and CBOE have started issuing Bitcoin futures contracts  there s talk of retailers  financial organizations and even central banks adopting various technologies and officially supporting  or even issuing  a variety of major cryptocurrencies  As mainstream adaption becomes a reality we can expect to see a calming of the crypto storm 
In that way  we expect the crypto investor mindset to shift from  all you can eat  to something more akin to technology connoisseur  wherein serious digital currency investors will seek out the most promising and groundbreaking of digital technologies  In the wake of this shift  smaller investors will likely also attempt to gain relevant and appropriate understanding of the differences between the various alt currency technologies 
In our opinion  one outstanding  currently available asset that we believe will garner more attention in 2018 is IOTA  the name is derived from Internet of Things   which we wrote about here  Its founders have taken it quite a way in terms of technological achievement and significantly  have done so outside the blockchain protocol  using something called  Tangle  instead  Indeed  it s the first cryptocurrency to develop a non blockchain technology but also remain decentralized 
Because the Tangle doesn t rely on miners to verify transactions  it also doesn t necessitate transaction fees  allowing even micro transactions  And unlike most blockchain based currencies  the IOTA network requires a minimal amount of GPU CPU  computing power  so can be managed on any home device 
We believe that sets IOTA on a path to become  the next Bitcoin   but with more stability and less volatility  During 2017 IOTA  only  gained 450  in value but managed to sustain a relatively solid pace of growth with restrained highs and measured lows  Currently the sixth most popular alt currency based on its  10 25B market cap  we think IOTA could climb into the top 5 by the end of 2018

10928,232443,NCR,Should Value Investors Consider NCR Corporation  NCR  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NCR Corporation   NYSE NCR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NCR Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  NCR Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that NCR Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  NCR Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NCR Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NCR Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though NCR Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F  This gives NCR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 14 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NCR Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNCR Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  among the top 30    the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past year  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-05-21,Zacks Investment

10937,232452,NCR,Technology Stocks To Gain As Retailers Emulate Amazon,opinion,Technology plays a crucial role in the evolution of various sectors  retail being prominent among them  The retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with its focus shifting gradually from brick and mortar to online shopping Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   has been in the spotlight for the last few years  as changing customer patterns have made the retail industry fall back more on e Commerce  The company s technological prowess has provided it an upper hand over other retailers who are still at their nascent stage in the e Commerce field Story Behind Amazon s SuccessTechnology is giving shape to Amazon s innovative business ideas  Apart from providing customers a seamless retail experience   user friendly website and mobile app as well as payment and delivery system   technology has been helping the company in saving costs and increasing transaction efficiency Amazon has been also testing waters with innovations  These include a drive in grocery delivery service AmazonFresh Pickup wherein one can order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby  and  cashier less  stores  Amazon Go   the company s first brick and mortar grocery store   It has also added online and offline features to its bookstores Not only this  Amazon always tries to bring in different user friendly technological gadgets that even big tech companies haven t thought of  The best example of this is Dash Button and Echo devices  These devices are highly coveted for their multi utility feature Amazon s cloud computing arm  Amazon Web Services  AWS  is providing the entire technological infrastructure  The company is continuously investing in enhancing its cloud infrastructure and Artificial Intelligence capabilities that are helping it to execute plans  better understand customer needs and simplify the overall retail process Why NVIDIA   Other Tech Stocks Are in FocusWith Amazon s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   the situation has worsened for retailers now  The acquisition has provided Amazon the scope to fortify its position in the brick and mortar space  and will enhance its distribution and fulfilment capabilities Amazon s move has raised question about the survival of other grocery store operators  particularly in the United States  Grocery stores already operate under razor thin margins and will thus face extreme difficulty in coping with Amazon s pricing strategy and the technique of bringing in customers  for which it is well known Computer and Technology Sector 5YR   ReturnLooking at the successful run of Amazon  retailers have understood by now that in a changing landscape  market understanding and data information hold the key to gaining an edge over rivals  Therefore  to counter the growing threat from Amazon  various retail bellwethers are teaming up with tech companies The latest tech company to benefit from this trend is NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    Recently  Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   announced that it will build its own cloud based data centers by using NVIDIA chips  Wal Mart currently uses Amazon s AWS for its cloud needs  The move will help it to shift from the rival s infrastructure  Also  Wal Mart partnered with Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google last month to give shoppers the ability to order thousands of products through Google Express using voice activated shopping Wal Mart is not the only company making efforts to counter Amazon  Earlier this year  Target Corporation   NYSE TGT

10940,232455,NCR,Why Now Is The Time To Consider These 4  Fallen Angel  Stocks,opinion,"There are two reasons why we often see great buys in November and December  at least for the short to intermediate term 
First  individual investors owning what they believe  or believed   to be quality companies have looked on hungrily as they see other companies  share prices move forward rapidly  They look at their own holdings and  if they don t see the same  action  often sell their shares to take what is often greater risk at a higher valuation  buying the momentum darlings that are moving up instead of stagnating or moving down 
Second  in a great year like 2017 has been  lots of investors have taken significant capital gains already or are planning to  When they talk to their accountant or plug this into their tax software  they suddenly realize they just pushed themselves into a higher bracket  Unless they are convinced that their now sunk holdings are their best bet to reap further gains  it makes eminent sense for them to take whatever capital losses they must in order to return to a lower bracket 
Finally  the big mutual fund companies  managers of your pension fund  money managers  etc  do not want to look like idiots even though they may be  If you as a holder in some mutual fund  for instance  look at the year end  Portfolio Holdings  page and see nothing but stocks that have under performed  these managers recognize you might pull your funds and place them elsewhere  So they  window dress  
They sell stocks not in the public eye that may represent the best long term value and instead buy stocks that are in the news  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  is a lot sexier to own than Ford  NYSE F  and has performed reliably better in 2017 as well 
However  even if these neglected stocks that have declined were all dogs   and they are not     every dog shall have its day   Market history shows that many fickle money managers  at or near the beginning of the next year  are salivating to find the Fallen Angels that will afford the best rebound probability   This trend has moved forward in many years as more mutual funds and other institutions have moved their reporting forward for year end  
Here are some of my best ideas for which Fallen Angels might do best in the coming weeks and months 
Health Care 
Can Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  make any more dumb mistakes than they already have  At first  the declines in this mega cap generic and ethical pharmaceutical company were the result of a whole series of self induced wounds by self aggrandizing executives looking to secure their legacy  but now  Now it has less to do with fundamentals and more to do with the three factors stated above  having lost two thirds of its value  now it s just investors piling on  Could it get worse before it gets better  Any stock could  But there are patents here  and market share  that are enticing enough to make it worth your due diligence 

Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  has a much clearer runway to good growth than TEVA but it  too  disappointed investors  not with its Q3 numbers its top line grew 10  year on year  less than the analyst community expected  but actually beat on earnings  Come end of year  anything less than an earnings surprise on the upside  financially engineered or not  will do for this pack  They had the temerity to suggest their full year revenues would be just  13 billion  not the  13 2 million they were previously expecting  I don t expect fireworks here but I imagine a fall in stock price from  140 to  105 might be just a tad overdone  I see CELG as a growth company for years to come 

Technology 
There are those who might quibble with my choice here  noting that the old National Cash Register Company  now just NCR Corp  NYSE NCR  is hardly a tech company  Why  they just make cash registers or ATM machines or something equally boring  right  Well  maybe so   to us in the USA  But what many don t know is that NCR is a true multinational  deriving most of its earnings overseas  Or that they also make point of sale terminals and self service check out systems for grocery and other retail stores  and self check in kiosks for airlines and hotels  Or that they are the biggest factor in ATMs globally  especially in India  NCR is somewhat of an indirect play on India where retail banking is being established in the countryside  the company has installed some 25 000 ATMs in India over the last couple of years  Then there is the servicing of all this and the software that keeps NCR a jump ahead in point of sales and all that  No they aren t Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   On the other hand  if NCR just recovers half of what they lost this year and goes to 40  that would be a 25  move  Not bad for any year 

Retail 
Speaking of Amazon  it seems to be an article of faith among some that in the future we ll never need to go anywhere since Amazon will deliver our food  clothing  games  programming and soma direct to our doorstep  Somehow I just don t see it  I think people will still want the occasional bit of fresh air  socializing with others and actually touching some of the things they buy  Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  might just benefit from meandering shoppers in their retail stores   Or AMZN will buy them in order to have a central place shoppers can touch the product and still have it delivered in bulk   We need to remember that BBY isn t just one store  they also own Cost Plus World Market  Christmas Tree Shops  buy buy Baby  Linen Holdings  Chef Central and a whole bunch of online specialty stores themselves  The stock is down 55  this year based on the fact that they are brick and mortar  Sorry  Charlie  brick and mortar doesn t mean peel and fade  It just means you have to have great products  low debt  a strong balance sheet and an innovative approach to marketing  Oh  by the way  BBBY has a current Price  Earnings Ratio of 5 3 

Will all of these companies rise  Phoenix like  from the ash heap onto which they have been thrown  Of course not  But I ll wager most have seen or within the next week or two will see their bottoming area and are unlikely to plunge further  And if only one or  dare to dream  two recover anywhere near their high of this year

solutions  along with steady demand for the software offerings drove the top line performance  Revenues came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  156 million 3D Systems  Healthcare revenues were up 29  to  43 million year over year  primarily attributable to high demand for printers and materials from medical and dental customers  Also  Materials revenue rose 11  to  43 million  thanks to strong production orders and robust contribution from the previously acquired Vertex Global  Software revenues totaled  20 million  flat on a year over year basis  The company s Printer revenues were down 4  to  31 million In the quarter  gross margin expanded 50 basis points on a year over year basis to 51 8   mainly driven by cost savings accrued from supply chain betterment initiatives and

offerings During second quarter 2016  NCR modified its reportable segments to reflect changes in the reporting structure of the organization  The new reportable segments are Software  Services and Hardware segments The company s Software revenues on a reported basis were up 8  to  452 million  The year over year increase in software revenues was primarily due to 29   6  and 6  increase in Software license  Cloud and Professional Services revenues  respectively Services revenues increased 3  to  557 million Hardware revenues however decreased 3  on a year over year basis and came in at  469 million  In the Hardware segment  revenues from ATM and IPS declined 8  and 94   respectively  while that from SCO and POS surged 124  and 17   respectively  The increase in SCO and POS revenues was primarily due to store transformation growth during the quarter Non GAAP gross profit for the quarter increased 9 1  and came in at  432 million  primarily due to higher revenues  Also  non GAAP gross margin was 29 2   up 180 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter Income from operations on a non GAAP basis was  160 million  up from  139 million a year ago  Also  operating margin

earnings increased on a year over year basis  primarily due to strong growth in its software business  Although  the company slightly disappointed on its second quarter guidance  its strong full year 2017 outlook makes us optimistic about its future performance Also  NCR s growing exposure in the ATM and self service kiosk space is encouraging  given the tremendous growth prospects in the respective markets  Continuous product launches  growing popularity of its self service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are the catalysts  Continuous deal wins also drive growth However  softness in the ATM business in mature markets  competition from Diebold Inc    NYSE DBD   and HP Inc    NYSE HPQ    and a high debt burden remain concerns Currently  NCR carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

11002,232517,NCR,Ericsson  ERIC  Q1 Deep In The Red  Posts Loss  Sales Shrink,opinion,In the first quarter 2017 results  Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   reported a huge non IFRS loss of SEK 2 42  27 cents  per share  excluding amortizations  write downs of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges   Declining sales and shrinking adjusted gross margins put immense pressure on the bottom line  The figure also compared unfavourably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 3 cents  marking the fifth consecutive earnings miss for the Swedish communication technology and services giant The bottom line performance was even worse on a year over year basis  The loss was comparable to earnings of SEK 0 87 recorded in the prior year quarter Previously announced provisions  write downs and restructuring costs pushed the company s earnings deep into the red  as the Swedish firm reported a massive net loss of SEK 10 9 billion   1 2 billion   in stark contrast to net income of SEK 2 1 billion a year ago Ericsson Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The dismal bottom line performance can be attributed to sluggish industry trends significantly reducing product demand  Moreover  a steep decline in revenues over the past few quarters made things worse for Ericsson Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter fell 11  year over year to SEK 46 4 billion   5 2 billion   The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 3 billion  Weak mobile broadband market and lower investments in parts of Europe  Latin America and Africa dragged down revenues The decline in sales was all pervasive  with all three operating segments of the company charting decline in revenues  Lower IPR licensing revenues  in particular  were a major drag on first quarter sales Segmental PerformanceAs part of its recently announced restructuring plans  Ericsson reorganized its operations to focus on three core areas   Networks  Digital Services and the Internet of Things  The three segments which will now comprise the company s reporting structure are  Networks  IT   Cloud and Media On a segmental basis  Networks revenues were down 13  year over year to SEK 34 9 billion   3 9 billion   Persistent low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower IPR licensing revenues resulted in the poor performance of this segment IT   Cloud revenues fell 3  year over year to SEK 9 5 billion   1 1 billion   Lower product sales hampered the segmental performance  although strong services performance somewhat restrained the fall Media revenues were the worst hit  The revenues from this segment plunged 20  year over year to SEK 2 billion   200 million   primarily due to lower IPR licensing revenues and lower sales of legacy products Ericsson s gross margin  excluding restructuring charges  in the quarter declined 340 basis points year over year to 30 5   A bigger share of lower margin business  particularly in IT   Cloud and Media   along with poor IPR licensing revenues  resulted in the margin contraction The decline in Ericsson s operating margin  excluding restructuring charges  was even more pronounced   down 1300 basis points on a year over year basis to 3   The impact of lower gross margin trickled down to operating margins Restructuring PlanLate in March  Ericsson s new CEO   B rje Ekholm   revealed a restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline the company s focus areas  as well as explore options for the media business  Per the restructuring  Ericsson expects to take provisions  write downs and restructuring charges this year  with most of them already booked in the first quarter The company planned to write down assets in first quarter 2017  which are projected to hurt operating income by as much as SEK 4 billion  Further  restructuring charges for 2017 are anticipated to come in the range of SEK 6 billion SEK 8 billion  up from a previous estimate of SEK 3 billion  Of this  Ericsson will book about SEK 2 billion in the first quarter as Ekholm accelerates cost cuts Provisions of an estimated SEK 7 billion SEK 9 billion have also been made in the first quarter  related to negative developments in certain large customer projects LiquidityDuring the quarter  cash flow used in operating activities was SEK 1 5 billion   170 million  compared with SEK 2 4 billion in first quarter 2016 Ericsson s cash and cash equivalents as at Mar 31  2017 came in at SEK 33 billion   3 7 billion  compared with SEK 35 9 billion a year back To ConcludeTelecom equipment makers across the world are distressed as customers invest less in 4G services  and even less in 3G  while waiting for the introduction of 5G networks  The year 2016 was a particularly harrowing year for Ericsson  a year in which the company ousted CEO Hans Vestberg  and stunned investors with a massive profit warning Soft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets significantly dented Ericsson s performance  Challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging nations acted as a deterrent for major investments by telecom equipment behemoths  These factors manifested in the company s poor sales  In fact  the company expects the industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well The company s CEO   Ekholm   is confident of making  significant improvements  in the business next year  under stable market conditions  Ekholm s restructuring plan will help streamline Ericsson s focus areas  improve profitability and revitalize its technology and market leadership  Ericsson also plans to explore options for the company s media business and review  low performing  contracts in its managed service business Whether these steps will allow Ericsson to jump back on the growth track  remains to be seen  However  as of now  we have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on the stock  as we are apprehensive over the effect of the restructuring on the company s profits and share price in the near term Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderEricsson presently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the broader sector include Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI    PC Tel  Inc

11003,232518,NCR,Logitech  LOGI  Maintains Earnings Streak In Q4  View Intact,opinion,Logitech International SA   NASDAQ LOGI   continued its impressive streak of earnings beats for the sixth consecutive quarter  as its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings  including stock based compensation expense adjustments  of 15 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents by nearly 25 0  Also  on a non GAAP basis  the company s earnings per share came in at 21 cents  up 50 0  on a year over year basis  The bottom line s remarkable year over year growth was driven by strong top line growth For fiscal 2017  the company reported non GAAP earnings per share of  1 32  an impressive increase of 35  compared to the year ago tally Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter rose an impressive 15 2   year over year  to  496 2 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  478 million  The entire growth was attributable to the company s Retail segment  which grew a remarkable 15  year over year  in constant currency  This was the highest quarterly growth achieved by Retail in six years  Also  previously completed Jaybird buyout stoked top line growth significantly For fiscal 2017  the company s sales grew 9 4  to  2 207 million  Growth in Retail was broad based growth for the fiscal year  driven by double digit sales growth of four product categories Video Collaboration  Mobile Speakers  Gaming and Home Control Creativity and Productivity business comprises four sub business lines Keyboards and Combos  Pointing Devices  PC Webcams  and Tablet and Other Accessories  Of these  Keyboards   Combos grew 14  year over year  while Pointing Devices and PC Webcams showed modest growth of 4  and 11   respectively  However  revenues of Tablet   Other Accessories plunged 43  due to sluggishness in overall tablet markets Gaming surged 23  year over year to  69 0 million  driven by strength in PC gaming  Impressive product sales in both the high end segment  including G900 wireless gaming mouse  and the more casual offerings  including our Logitech G Prodigy family of gaming gear  fuelled revenues  On the other hand  Video Collaboration grew 70  to  37 1 million on the back of double digit growth from all three regions The Music business  which comprises Mobile Speakers units and Audio PC   Wearables  witnessed impressive growth driven by solid performance of both the sub businesses  While Mobile Speaker sales grew 61  due to strong sales in the Americas  Audio PC   Wearables category sales rose 27  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  driven by the Jaybird buyout In addition  sales under the Home Control category increased 45  to  15 2 million  driven by continued demand for smart home products  Integration of voice assistants  such as Alexa and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Assistant  into Harmony Hub proved conducive to the sales performance of this segment During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  Logitech generated record non GAAP gross margin growth  up 430 basis points to 37 4  year over year  Non GAAP operating margin for the company expanded a remarkable 210 bps  year over year  to 7 3   as non GAAP operating income jumped 61 7  year over year to  36 1 million on top line strength  Growth in operating profits reflects focused cost control initiatives and disciplined operational spending as well Logitech International S A  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    LiquidityAs on Mar 31  2017  Logitech s cash and cash equivalents were  547 5 million compared with  519 2 million as of Mar 31  2016 Guidance IntactConcurrent with the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results  Logitech reiterated its full year 2018 guidance  The company continues to expect high single digit growth in constant currency for retail sales for the fiscal year  It forecasted non GAAP operating income to lie in the range of  250  260 million  Logitech also announced a new share buyback program worth  250 million  as part of its three year capital allocation framework To ConcludeLogitech started 2017 on an exceptional note with impressive top and bottom line beats  Exceptional growth in retail sales for the fourth consecutive year and record gross margin growth highlights the company s underlying strength  Going forward  Logitech remains confident that overall positive industry trends  strategic investments in core business areas and timely product launches will boost its profitability and sales As a tech company  Logitech stands out in the crowd for managing to thwart industry headwinds like restrained corporate spending  We believe that the company s robust business model that focuses on maximizing profit in PC peripherals and expanding into new business categories will continue to drive growth for the rest of the fiscal year Other Stocks to ConsiderThe company currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Other top ranked stocks in the broader sector include Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI

11006,232521,NCR,Technology Stock Earnings On Oct 25  AAPL  AKAM  LOGI  NCR,opinion,Earnings releases are gaining momentum with results from 116 S P 500 members or 23 2  of the index s total market capitalization already out  as of Oct 21  As per the latest  report  total earnings of these 116 index members are up 3 3  year over year on the back of 1 8  higher revenues   Beat ratios are impressive with 80 2  beating EPS estimates and 62 9  coming in ahead of top line expectations More than 800 companies are set to report results this week  including 171 S P 500 members  Notably  after consecutive five quarters of decline  earnings are now anticipated to show positive growth Overall third quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are now expected to inch up 0 1   as compared with earlier estimate of  1   from the year ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 1 5  The growth is expected to be driven by impressive results from the Finance sector  which is anticipated to mitigate sluggish growth from the Energy  Autos and Transportation sectors Technology Earnings Growth   Apple is KeyHowever  growth from Technology  another large sector in the list   is expected to remain muted due to lower earnings anticipation from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   We now have third quarter results from 33 3  of the sector s total market capitalization in the S P 500 index  So far  total earnings are up 5  year over year on 0 2  lower revenues  with 88 2  beating EPS estimates and 70 6  beating revenue expectations Earnings for the Technology sector are now anticipated to be up 1 1  based on 1  lower revenues  Apple s earnings are expected to decline 19 8  on 9 1  lower revenues  which will deal a major blow to earnings  Excluding Apple  earnings are estimated to grow 6 4  Here is a sneak peek into four technology companies lined up to report earnings on Oct 25 Despite all the concerns related to Apple s lowered guidance  we believe the iPhone maker is well poised to beat earnings this quarter due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an  of 1 21   You can see This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  to beat earnings  Simultaneously  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions APPLE INC Price and EPS Surprise    We also note that Apple s results compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last

11052,232567,NCR,Trade Ideas For The Week Of June 8th  2015,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Cigna  NYSE CI 
Cigna has been in a strong trend higher since mid 2012  What makes it interesting now in that trend is that it is giving a possible entry point against good support for a strong reward to risk trade  Currently  it is pulling back in a bull flag  The RSI is bullish  The MACD is pulling back  but already turning flat  Friday  the price moved higher in the flag  showing a support level and testing the falling trend resistance  A break of this triggers a long trade 
Canadian National Railway  NYSE CNI 
Canadian National Railway has sold off since falling out of a broad consolidation in April  Now it is showing support and some strength Friday  The MACD is confirming this as it moves to cross up  while the RSI is still running along the oversold level  Notice how extended the price is from the moving averages 
Hanesbrands  NYSE HBI 
Hanesbrands has been moving higher  but found resistance in mid March  After consolidating  it fell to the 50 day SMA and bounced  Now  a rounding consolidation suggests it may be ready for another leg higher  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising  while the MACD is also rising  both supporting more upward price action 
Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY 
Eli Lilly has trended high for a long time  The recent strong move up in May has now turned into a pull back in a bull flag  This is resetting the overbought RSI and moving the price back into the Bollinger Bands   Look for a break of the flag  as in the Cigna trade above  as your entry against the flag low as a stop 
NCR  NYSE NCR 
NCR fell sharply from September into the October low in 2014  Since then  it has recovered  but found resistance between 30 and 31  What makes it interesting for a trade is that the past 3 months has built an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern  and it is back testing the neckline  The RSI is bullish and the MACD is rising  both supporting continued upward price action 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week  sees the equity markets continuing to look a bit vulnerable on the daily timeframe but strong on the weekly timeframe 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue lower while crude oil consolidates with a slight downward bias  The US dollar index also is in broad consolidation with an upward bias  while US Treasuries look to continue lower  The Shanghai Composite is back off to the races higher with a chance of consolidation  while Emerging Markets look to continue to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts suggest that the IWM is strong and taking over leadership  while the QQQ looks strongest on the longer timeframe  The SPY may need more sideways consolidation before resuming higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
