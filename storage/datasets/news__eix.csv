130417,351932,EIX,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   February 04  2020,opinion,"Strange but true  seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
In the past  investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady  reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6 50   whereas at the time of this article  the current rate is under 2  and looks to stay low thanks to an accommodative Fed 
While this yield reduction may not seem drastic  it adds up  for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries  the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
So what s a retiree to do  You could cut your expenses to the bone  and take the risk that your Social Security checks don t shrink  Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady  higher rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds  and other bond options   we believe dividend paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable  predictable income investors in retirement seek 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
Going beyond those familiar names  you can find excellent dividend paying stocks by following a few guidelines  Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3   with positive annual dividend growth  The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Edison International  NYSE EIX  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 64 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 28   This compares to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 69  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 82   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 55 is up 4 08  from last year 
Foot Locker  NYSE FL  is paying out a dividend of 0 38 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 84  compared to the Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 52 is up 10 14  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 18 per share  Independent Bank  IBCP  has a dividend yield of 3 35   This is compared to the Banks   Midwest industry s yield of 2 52  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 72 is up 20  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio  they can help lessen the effects of inflation  since many dividend paying companies  especially blue chip stocks  generally increase their dividends over time 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement

130441,351956,EIX,Unprecedented California Blackout Plunges Millions Into Darkness,news," Bloomberg     The unprecedented power shutdown by California s Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG  has spread deeper into densely populated cities near San Francisco  ensnaring millions of people and raising the prospect that much of a major metropolitan area could go without electricity for days 
The bankrupt utility said late Wednesday that it had begun a second round of power cuts that will plunge another 234 000 customers in cities including Berkeley and Oakland into darkness  It s part of the biggest blackout ever orchestrated to prevent strong winds from knocking down electrical lines and igniting fires  Half a million homes and businesses in Northern California were already in the dark  cut off by PG E overnight 
Meanwhile in Southern  NYSE SO  California  Edison International  NYSE EIX  was cutting power to dozens of customers and has warned of more  while San Diego s main utility is also considering shutoffs  Altogether  more than 3 million people may eventually be affected  or almost 8  of the state s population  based on city estimates and the average household size  The economic impact may reach  2 6 billion 
After being forced into bankruptcy from wildfires its equipment caused over the past two years  PG E is using the massive power cuts in an attempt to prevent another deadly disaster  While San Francisco and Silicon Valley will be spared  the extensive reach of the outages threatens to roil the area s economy by disrupting workers  shutting stores and forcing companies and agencies to shell out for costly back up generators to keep operations limping along 
Restoring Power
Determining just how deep the impact will be is difficult  PG E had already restored power to some 50 000 customers in the Sierra Nevada foothills as of late Wednesday and were looking to return service to 80 000 by Thursday morning  the company said in its statement  released around 11 p m  local time Wednesday  But outages could persist into next week as the utility sends crews to inspect all of its lines  Santa Clara County warned a shutoff could last seven days 
Parts of Northern California s East and South Bays were set to lose power later in the evening under the second phase  After that  PG E will weigh a third round of cuts for portions of Kern County  which may affect about 4 000 customers  The utility earlier predicted impact to 43 000 
A prolonged blackout will strain the region s economy  said Michael Wara  director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University  Blackouts lasting hours or a single day close offices and schools  and prompt runs on grocery stores  At five days  cupboards start running bare  diesel for backup generators start selling out and gasoline runs short as stations won t have power 
 If you lose power for five hours  you may have to throw out some milk   Wara said   If you lose power for five days  you need to throw anything that s perishable away  and you are likely eating out of a can  
Wara estimated PG E s blackout could cost  2 6 billion if it lasts two days  using a planning tool developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  Two of the researchers who developed that tool  however  cautioned that it s designed to calculate the impact of much shorter blackouts    less than 24 hours 
Running on Generators
In areas where electricity was already out early Wednesday  many stores and businesses sat closed  while others worked off back up power   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  shuttered some branches  A few dozen Safeway supermarkets were affected as of midday  and the company was providing backup generators and refrigerated trailers upon availability 
Cities also turned to generators to power some facilities on Wednesday and simply closed others  Santa Rosa used generators to keep tap water flowing to residents and the lights on in fire stations  It shut down City Hall  according to its website  Public buses were running but not collecting fares    its own expense 
For wineries  the blackout hit at a crucial time  harvest  Michael Haney  executive director of Sonoma County Vintners  said many wineries have either bought or rented backup generators  Some smaller growers have struck agreements to have their grapes stored at other facilities where there s power 
 Wineries have had to pay out money for backup power   he said   The sad thing is some of our smaller wineries can t afford it  
Elsewhere in Sonoma County  the Russian River Brewing Company rented a 2 megawatt generator to power its brewery  The company    famed for its Pliny the Younger cult beer    wanted something smaller  but wineries had already snapped up most  said co owner Natalie Cilurzo  It s instead paying about  27 000 to rent its backup unit for a month  and fueling it with diesel probably costs between  8 000 and  10 000 every day it runs  Cilurzo said

130442,351957,EIX,PG E Cuts Power to 2 8 Million Californians as Fires Burn,news," Bloomberg     Mass power shutoffs by PG E Corp  left more than 2 8 million Californians in the dark Sunday  the state s largest deliberate blackout ever  as the bankrupt utility tries to keep its equipment from igniting wildfires during the strongest wind storm in years 
As of 1 45 p m  local time  PG E had shut off the lights to 941 000 homes and businesses in Northern California  including parts of Oakland and Berkeley  and almost all of affluent Marin County north of San Francisco  The city of San Francisco itself was spared  High winds are expected to lash the region through Monday morning  with another set of gusts forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday    raising the prospect that some areas will be blacked out for several days 
The scope of the current outage was unprecedented  with 38 of California s 58 counties expected to be affected  The largest number of shutoffs were in Sonoma County  where the Kincade fire triggered a massive exodus Saturday and Sunday  With that blaze and others burning  Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency 
 What we find ourselves experiencing is a historic wind event   Andy Vesey  head of the Pacific Gas   Electric utility unit  said at a press conference Saturday night  The shutoff is a  last resort to make sure that in these conditions our operations will not create a major public safety issue  That s why we do it  
PG E has said it expected to begin restoring power Monday  when the winds are forecast to subside  after it inspects every line of its equipment for damage  But the company warned Sunday that a separate set of gales expected to descend on the state could lead to another round of shutdowns in 32 counties on Tuesday and Wednesday  Some customers who are currently out of power may remain so throughout that time 
In the suburbs of Marin County  street lights were out  gas stations were closed and stores were shuttered  People who charged their phones and computers before the outage hit woke to slow internet connections as they searched for updates on the blaze and blackouts  In Oakland  long stretches of banks  pharmacies  restaurants  shops and markets were dark  Police patrol cars parked at intersections to help navigate vehicles through darkened traffic lights 
It s the third time this month that PG E has resorted to mass blackouts to avoid wildfires  The San Francisco based company has been taking more extreme measures since its equipment sparked blazes in 2017 and 2018  saddling it with an estimated  30 billion in liabilities and forcing it into bankruptcy  The shutoffs have triggered a debate over how far California is willing to go to prevent fires in an increasingly warm and dry climate  Despite the power cuts  blazes continue to burn

The outages are extending to Southern  NYSE SO  California  where Edison International  NYSE EIX  has cut power to 364 customers and said 302 900 more face shutdowns  Sempra Energy s San Diego Gas   Electric said it has no emergency shutoff plans at present 
Wildfires have already broken out at both ends of California  The Tick blaze near Los Angeles forced tens of thousands of evacuations  And north of San Francisco  the Kincade fire is still raging  It had burned more than 30 000 acres  destroyed at least 79 structures and was threatening another 31 175 buildings as of Sunday morning  Almost 200 000 people were forced to evacuate 
 I ve heard some people express concerns that we re evacuating too many people   Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said Sunday   I think those concerns are not valid at this point  
The Kincade fire was reported minutes after a PG E transmission line in the area malfunctioned late Wednesday  Firefighters have not determined the cause of the blaze  PG E s shares plummeted 31  Friday to  5  a record low  Shares of Edison fell 8 5  as fires burned in its Southern California service territory 
All told  there s about  12 billion worth of property within a mile of the active fires  said Chuck Watson  a disaster modeler with Evenki Research 
The prospect of more liabilities from wildfires is especially vexing for PG E  Since filing for Chapter 11 in January  the judge overseeing the case has warned that another big blaze would upend the utility s bankruptcy and potentially wipe out shareholders  Any claims from new fires sparked by PG E would have to be paid out first    and in full    before those from previous blazes get a dime 
The winds are arriving at a precarious moment  California receives almost no rain during its summer  and a five year drought earlier this decade killed millions of trees that can now easily ignite  Recent winds have dried out grasses and shrubs even further

As the bankrupt utility began inspecting power lines for damage from wind storms sweeping through the northern part of the state  it warned that another round of gusts could spur more shutdowns Tuesday  Much of the region remained in the dark as of Sunday evening  including in the San Francisco Bay Area  and some customers who lost electricity may not see their power restored from the initial outage until later the week

The coming wind storm appears to be the last in the immediate forecast  according to PG E meteorologists  Three have already struck this month

And then legislators started whispering  Someone handed assembly member Eloise Gomez Reyes a piece of paper  She was the one to publicly break the news to Johnson  who had started his job two weeks ago  State investigators had just found the company s power lines at fault for the Camp Fire that killed 85 people and destroyed an entire town in November 
Johnson looked at her and nodded   I made the assumption  when I got here  that PG E equipment caused the fire    that s the best place to start   he said later in the hearing   It s a disappointment that this happened  Let s not do it again  
The tense meeting underscored just how much work Johnson has ahead of him in guiding PG E out of the biggest utility bankruptcy in U S  history and repairing its relationship with state lawmakers and customers  Shares cratered 70  in the three months leading up to the company s Chapter 11 filing in January  Its credit ratings were downgraded to junk  and dozens of lawsuits have been filed  Now that the utility is restructuring  some of the biggest names in distressed debt  including Elliott Management Corp   are piling into its case  California Governor Gavin Newsom is pressing for a quick exit 
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Being blamed for the Camp Fire  sets the stage for two key goals for the bankrupt company  Paying off existing liabilities and restructuring California s regulatory structure that puts utilities on the hook for natural disaster liabilities

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection found probable violations of state laws and forwarded its investigation to the district attorney of Butte County  where the Camp Fire occurred  Cal Fire deputy director Michael Mohler said Thursday  PG E shares fell as much as 1 4  
Exactly how Johnson will rescue PG E from the damages incurred by wildfires that tore through Northern California in 2017 and 2018 remains to be seen  The company has already warned that its liabilities may exceed  30 billion  and the report by Cal Fire could open the door to more 
Wearing a blue suit with a matching blue paisley tie on Wednesday  Johnson assured lawmakers in a southern drawl that he would turn the company around   I d like to fix it   he said   If you actually talk to people in the industry  they would say   Oh yeah  he s the fix it guy   This is a big fix  
Cal Fire said power lines owned by PG E ignited the Camp Fire  the deadliest in California history  while dry brush and strong winds helped it spread quickly  The finding  certainly was telegraphed    it s hard to believe that anyone is surprised   Bloomberg Intelligence utilities analyst Kit Konolige said in an interview   But it is certainly a negative  
Under a legal doctrine known as inverse condemnation  California utilities including PG E and Edison International  NYSE EIX  may be held responsible for damages from wildfires their equipment causes    even if they aren t found negligent  The power companies have been fighting to kill this doctrine since a series of wildfires devastated parts of wine country in 2017 
At Fault
Paul Patterson  a utilities analyst with Glenrock Associates  said Cal Fire s brief statement on Wednesday failed to answer the most important question  Did PG E act negligently in maintaining the power line that sparked the fire 
 What s really key is whether or not the company s operation or maintenance of the system was in fact at fault   he said 
The news came just as activist shareholder Appaloosa Management disclosed it had more than doubled its stake in PG E in the first quarter  The fund now holds about 4 4  of the company s outstanding shares  Baupost Group boosted its holdings by 58  to 24 5 million shares valued at  436 1 million  regulatory filings show 
PG E had meanwhile already disclosed that a criminal grand jury in Butte County is investigating the Camp Fire and has requested documents related to its operations and maintenance  The company said it s cooperating with prosecutors in collecting physical evidence at the fire site

Sitting before lawmakers on Wednesday    with only a prepared statement  a notepad and a pen accompanying him    Johnson said his goal as CEO is to leave PG E in better shape than when he arrived  Before joining the company this month  he led the federally owned utility Tennessee Valley Authority for more than six years 
 I believe in redemption   he said   I want some redemption for PG E in the hearts and minds of the customers  and the people in this building and elsewhere  Earned redemption

130490,352005,EIX,Edison International  EIX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Edison International  NYSE EIX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electric power provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  34 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 15 billion  up 12  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 73  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edison International 
For Edison International  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edison International will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Edison International would post earnings of  0 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering a surprise of  28 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Edison International doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edison-international-eix-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200441372,200441372

What s Next for Edison International 
While Edison International has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Wall Street went into rally mode Friday after Trump said he was hopeful the U S  and China will reach a consensus on trade deal  The White House  however  peddled a more sombre narrative on trade in the wake of Trump s comments  telling CNBC that a deal was not coming soon

Facebook  NASDAQ FB  fell 3  amid the fallout from a New York Times article detailing how the company conspired to cover up warnings that Russia had used the social media platform to disrupt the U S  election in 2016 
Weakness in tech was exacerbated by a slump in semiconductor stocks as Nvidia s  NASDAQ NVDA  soft earnings and light guidance  owing to excess inventories  an industry wide problem for many chipmakers   triggered fire selling across the industry 
Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  fell 4   while Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  was rewarded for its quarterly results  which came in line with consensus  Its share rose 1  
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1  
Energy added steel to the rally on Friday as oil prices settled flat  but slumped 6  for the week on concerns about a  global glut in supplies 
Retailers kept the broader market in check  however  following a rout in both Nordstrom and Williams Sonoma 
Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  fell 14  after its earnings  including a one time item  fell short of estimates  The retailer grew comps 2 3  in the third quarter  below estimates for a 2 4  increase 
Williams Sonoma  NYSE WSM  was punished for delivering mixed third quarter results as earnings beat  but revenue missed consensus estimates  sending its shares tumbling 11

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electric power provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10  
Revenues are expected to be  2 73 billion  up 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 28  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edison International 
For Edison International  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edison International will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Edison International would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  6  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Edison International doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edison-international-eix-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200409512,200409512
130520,352035,EIX,An Overview Of The Utilities Sector ,opinion,"This is part 19 and the final part of my series covering all the various sectors reported by FactSet  However  the popular idea of saving the best for last does not apply in this instance  As I indicated throughout each installment  there were some sectors that I felt offered better investment opportunities than others  Furthermore  I attempted to indicate that growth coupled with purchasing that growth at a reasonable valuation was a major key to long term investment success  Stated very simplistically  a faster growing company will generate significantly more future cash flows  and dividends if they apply  than a slower growing company will  It s not only common sense  it s mathematical reality 
With that said  the Utilities Sector  NYSE XLU  is largely recognized as being comprised of some of the slowest growing companies in all the market  However  the Utilities Sector is also recognized as providing higher levels of dividend income than the average dividend paying company  Consequently  there are many investors that have historically and are currently utilizing utility stocks as bond alternatives  However  please don t be confused by that statement  This is not the same as saying that utility stocks are as safe as bonds  Instead  this simply implies that utility stocks offer higher yields than the average stock and thereby provide some of the benefit that bonds traditionally have offered 
Furthermore  people are looking to utility stocks because even though they tend to be low growth entities  the good ones do have a legacy of increasing dividends each year  Therefore  although bonds provide the theoretical safety of having your original investment returned at the end  they do not necessarily provide the security of protecting your purchasing power  Inflation eats at both the income you receive from a fixed investment and the future purchasing power as well  Consequently  an alternative option such as utility stocks can provide an inflation fighting rising dividend income stream  as well as modest capital appreciation 
Low Growth Utility Stocks and The Importance of Valuation
Regular readers of my work know that I am literally obsessive compulsive about only investing when valuation makes sense  However  valuation is even more critical when investing in slow growing investments such as utility stocks  One of the primary advantages of only being willing to invest at fair valuation is that it positions you to earn returns that are consistent with the operating results that the company produces 
Investing when overvaluation is manifest reduces your returns while investing when undervaluation is manifest can increase them  Therefore  when growth potential is low there is little to no margin of error or safety  If you even slightly overpay for a slow growth stock such as a utility  you are very likely to earn unsatisfactory long term returns  Moreover  you will earn these lower returns at elevated levels of risk  Higher risk and lower returns are the exact opposite of what prudent investors seek 
The key to understanding this is to understand the realities of compounding  Any investment is ultimately worth the amount of cash flows or earnings that it can generate for its stakeholders  In simple terms  a slow growing entity such as a utility stock does not produce a large enough stream of future cash flows to provide a margin of safety  Therefore  even the slightest miscalculation can devastate future returns  In contrast  a faster growing entity produces a much larger future stream of income thereby providing a greater margin of safety  Of course  that assumes that the faster growth does manifest  I will be expanding on this in the analyze out loud video later in the article 
A Sector By Sector Review
This is part 19   the final installment in my series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc 
Please see here for my report on all other sectors 
In this part 19 I will be covering the Utilities Sector 
In each article in this series I provided a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering in this article is marked in green 

Sector 19  Utilities
Electric Utilities

Water Utilities
Alternative Power Generation
A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I have presented a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I ve applied a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I was able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances within this series

Summary and Conclusions
This is the 19th and final installment in my series looking for valuation over all the sectors covered by FactSet  From my point of view  the Utility Sector is one of the  if not the most unique of all sectors  Although there are a lot of differences between one utility stock to the next  there are also a lot of similarities  Regarding valuation  the five companies I covered in this article were all electric utilities  This was only because I could not find much value in any of the other utility subsectors  However  that is not too different than what I experienced with the other 18 sectors  The general market is highly valued  therefore  finding fair value in any sector has been a challenge 
With that said  there are some excellent utility stocks that I like and have invested in  Next Era Energy  NEE  and Wisconsin energy  WEC  are two of my favorites  However  their valuations have become extremely high in my analysis and conclusions  Consequently  they were not mentioned in this article although they should have been had their valuations made any sense at all  I bring this up to be clear that I am not recommending any of the stocks covered in this article  Instead  I am simply suggesting that these might be some of the best valued utility stocks  even though they might not be great long term investment choices 
Series Summary and Conclusions
I hope the reader enjoyed this series of articles covering various sectors  and even more I hope that this series provided some additional insights in the degree of diversity among various common stocks  As I ve stated throughout  I do believe it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  Nevertheless  I think it s also important to recognize that attractive valuations are difficult to find after such a long running bull market  More importantly  finding value in best of breed companies is even more difficult  Consequently  prudent investors might need to make some compromises in the quality characteristics of the companies they need to invest in 
Generally speaking  I believe in investing in the highest quality companies your mind can conceive and or identify  However  and at the same time  I also believe that even the best of companies can become dramatically overvalued  Unfortunately  I believe that is the general state of the equity markets today  On the other hand  that doesn t mean that good value and excellent long term investments can t be found  Because  as I ve attempted to illustrate over this series  there are many good investments out there  Simply stated  it is simply harder to find good value in a bull market than it is in a bear market  Nevertheless  it doesn t make any sense to overpay for even the best of companies  Additionally  it doesn t make any sense to invest in bad companies either regardless of valuation  Nevertheless  if you find a good company  maybe not a great company  at an attractive valuation it can be more prudent to invest in it than to invest in a higher quality company at a much higher valuation  The simple point is that valuation matters  and it matters a lot 
Finally  allow me to conclude this series with a lament that is rooted in why I have written this series  After almost 50 years as an investment advisor  the number 1 question I have been asked is  what do I think the market s going to do  Since I believe it is a market of stocks  the reader might see why I abhor this question  Succinctly stated  I believe the only reason to worry about what the market might do is if you are invested in a market index fund  If you are  then the overall value of the market is important 
On the other hand  if you are invested in a select portfolio of individual stocks  then to me  the better question is  what do I think the stocks I am currently invested in are going to do  Personally  I have a clear  thoroughly researched  but sometimes erroneous  opinion of what my individual holdings are worth and how much they might grow going forward  More precisely  I understand their valuations and the specific and precise opportunities they present me 
Consequently  instead of worrying about what the overall market might do  I believe in minding my own businesses  In the long run  my results are going to be directly and functionally related to how well the businesses I m invested in performed as operating companies  Of course  this is only true as long as I am prudent with valuation especially at time of purchase  You make your money on the buy side

130521,352036,EIX,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Edison International,opinion,"Edison International   NYSE EIX   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for EIX broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 8 6  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for EIX stock 
If that wasn t enough  EIX isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  4 estimates have been reduced  while 1 has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for EIX  You can see

130532,352047,EIX,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Edison International  EIX ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Edison International  NYSE EIX   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry 
This electric power provider has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 76  
For the most recent quarter  Edison International was expected to post earnings of  1 31 per share  but it reported  1 56 per share instead  representing a surprise of 19 08   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 82 per share  while it actually produced  0 84 per share  a surprise of 2 44  
With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Edison International  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Edison International has an Earnings ESP of  3 28  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 28  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss

130542,352057,EIX,Why Edison International  EIX  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Edison International  NYSE EIX  in Focus
Based in Rosemead  Edison International  EIX  is in the Utilities sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 11 89   Currently paying a dividend of  0 61 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 86   In comparison  the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield is 2 91   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 45 is up 0 9  from last year  In the past five year period  Edison International has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 13 29   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Edison International s payout ratio is 59   which means it paid out 59  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for EIX for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 53 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 16  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  EIX is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-edison-international-eix-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200399011,200399011

130563,352078,EIX,EIX Vs  BKH  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Utility   Electric Power stocks have likely encountered both Edison International  NYSE EIX  and Black Hills  BKH   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Edison International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Black Hills has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that EIX has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
EIX currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 77  while BKH has a forward P E of 18 92  We also note that EIX has a PEG ratio of 1 98  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  BKH currently has a PEG ratio of 4 17 
Another notable valuation metric for EIX is its P B ratio of 1 22  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BKH has a P B of 1 81 
Based on these metrics and many more  EIX holds a Value grade of A  while BKH has a Value grade of C 
EIX sticks out from BKH in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that EIX is the better option right now ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eix-vs-bkh-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200377068,200377068
130564,352079,EIX,Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks With Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is the most commonly used tool for evaluating a firm s value due to its simplicity  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase for stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Alternative Although P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers a firm s equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents EBITDA  the other component of the multiple  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another shortcoming of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can club it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank

130571,352086,EIX,5 Utility Stocks To Gain From Fed s No Rate Hike Decision,opinion,"Investors heaved a sigh of relief as most of the central bank officials favored to end the runoff of the Fed s balance sheet this year  The Fed also expressed uncertainty over raising rates further in 2019  going by the  of its January meeting 
The Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  Jan 29 30 meeting showed that almost all participants thought it would be ideal to stop reducing the Federal Reserve s asset holdings later in 2019  The Fed s dovish position on further rate hikes  by the way  makes it sensible to invest in dividend yielding stocks such as utilities  which could thrive in a no rate hike scenario 
Interest Rates at Bay 
A gauge of encouraging economic factors such as strengthening labor market conditions  a low unemployment rate  strong gross domestic product growth and inflation near the 2  target were taken into consideration by Fed officials as they expected sustained growth  the minutes revealed 
In addition  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had stated on Jan 30 that the Fed would be patient when it came to altering its monetary policy  The Fed took into account economic headwinds that could be potential risks for the U S  economy such as slowing growth in Europe and China  U S  China trade negotiations  the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union and the five week long federal government shutdown  The Fed concluded that stagnating further rate hikes posed fewer risks to a strong economy 
The encouraging domestic economy and an uncertain global economic outlook are the major reasons behind the Fed s decision to hold its gradual rate hikes 
Utilities Could Gain From Fed s Dovish Stance
Utility companies could reap significant gains from the Federal Reserve s decision to leave rates unchanged this year  This is because the borrowing costs of these companies will remain constant in the near future  thus helping them to avoid incurring additional costs on their expensive business models 
Second  utility companies offer products and services such as electricity  water  gas and HVAC  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  that are always in constant demand irrespective of stock market volatility or economic downturns  The consistent revenues of these companies stem from their stable business models and near absolute authority in the regions where they operate 
Thus  the operational nature of these businesses allows them to maintain a decent level of dividends for their shareholders along with offering moderate risk levels  In addition  the Utilities Select Sector  XLU  has gained 13 8  on a year over year basis  making it the second sector that gained the most after real estate  14 2    Therefore  betting on utility stocks could be ideal at present

130572,352087,EIX,Are Investors Undervaluing Edison International  EIX  Right Now ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One company value investors might notice is Edison International  NYSE EIX   EIX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 13 20 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 14 17  EIX s Forward P E has been as high as 16 03 and as low as 10 49  with a median of 14 75  all within the past year 
EIX is also sporting a PEG ratio of 2 22  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  EIX s industry has an average PEG of 2 29 right now  Over the last 12 months  EIX s PEG has been as high as 2 82 and as low as 1 77  with a median of 2 57 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is EIX s P B ratio of 1 38  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 1 55  Within the past 52 weeks  EIX s P B has been as high as 1 63 and as low as 1 08  with a median of 1 48 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  EIX has a P S ratio of 1 59  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 98 
Finally  our model also underscores that EIX has a P CF ratio of 7 20  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 8 19  EIX s P CF has been as high as 8 52 and as low as 5 62  with a median of 7 78  all within the past year 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Edison International s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that EIX is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-edison-international-eix-right-now-200390794,200390794
130575,352090,EIX,How these energy geeks are re imagining an old school utility,news,"By Nichola Groom Orange County  Ca  Reuters    Welcome to the utility industry s future   or at least that s what Southern California Edison is hoping   Here in a non descript  53 500 square foot building  the  12 billion utility s research team is testing everything from charging electronic vehicles via cell phone to devices that smooth out the power created by rooftop solar panels  Those are some of the roughly 60 projects in the works at Edison s Advanced Technology division  It has a small  19 million annual budget  but its influence far exceeds that   The engineers from California s largest utility are hatching plans to insure its survival   and maybe even the survival of the nation s other big utilities  which are watching the project closely  The lab was formed by Southern California Edison in 2009 after California passed a landmark law to lower its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels   and source one third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020   The result has been more electric vehicles here in the Golden State  And more solar and wind power  which has got the state s utilities  and those nationwide  scrambling to adapt  Unlike traditional electricity  power from solar and wind sources fluctuates depending on the weather  making it tricky to manage on the grid   Also the cost of solar power has come down so much that more homeowners are producing their own power and paying less to their utility   Simply put  long term  utilities will need new sources of revenue   In 2013  California s three largest utilities sourced nearly 23 percent of their power from renewable sources  and Gov  Jerry Brown has called for a target of 50 percent by 2030  Twenty nine states have laws requiring more renewables  according to North Carolina State University s Database of State Incentives for Renewables   Efficiency    With so much  distributed  energy on the grid now  mainly from solar panels  says Accenture  the utility industry could see revenues fall by between  18 billion and  48 billion a year by 2025  That s why some call it the utility  death spiral         INDUSTRY MODEL There s a reason why the lab s work is getting a lot of attention  It is producing results and they share the work with utility officials and researchers from as far away as China  For instance  Edison s work designing cyber security systems and developing uses for advanced energy meters have received high marks from other utilities  said Mark McGranaghan  a vice president at the Electric Power Research Institute   Edison s lab has emerged as a model for others  too  In 2013 The National Renewable Energy Laboratory opened its  135 million Energy Systems Integration Facility  which complements Edison s research  The New York Power Authority is also working to establish a similar lab    The concept is really built off of learnings from Southern California Edison   McGranaghan said   They have taken so many people through their labs  it s amazing        THE WILD WEST Edison is focused on energy storage  automation and digital communications that will improve the efficiency and reliability of the grid  That  the utility hopes  will result in new revenue as power demand flattens  more energy efficient homes  and rooftop solar ramps up    There is only one provider of the wires  which is us   said Ted Craver  CEO of Edison International  the utility s parent company   These new technologies are going to become much more prevalent and we  maybe immodestly  feel we are on the cutting edge   Many of those technologies have yet to be commercialized  but the market is booming  Smart grid spending will grow to  70 2 billion in 2023 from  44 1 billion in 2014  according to Navigant Research  That s why Edison built nine labs here   In one room Edison researchers replicate a complete power grid  That was used to troubleshoot when Edison was working on a new transmission line to connect its grid with California s other behemoth utility  Pacific Gas   Electric  In another lab   smart  inverters are being tested that are capable of smoothing out the voltage sent to the grid by solar panels  These devices are common in Europe  but have yet to be rolled out widely in the United States   It s a bit of the Wild West right now   Doug Kim  director of the utility s advanced technology group  said of the proliferation of new energy technologies   Every year The Advanced Technology group solicits project proposals from the rest of the utility  Among them  a project that studied how large amounts of wind and solar power affect power restoration during blackouts  another tested different kinds of batteries to see how they perform when storing energy along the grid           ELECTRIC GUINEA PIGS Many of the new technologies are taken for a test drive at University of California  Irvine  faculty housing   The Irvine Smart Grid Demonstration   a  79 million project launched in 2010 and funded in part by the U S  Department of Energy  will wrap up later this year   SCE s take  If you can figure out ways to generate electricity at home  and use it more efficiently  you can cut costs related to new generation and transmission equipment    We threw everything in there that we could think of  thinking that maybe someday it was going to be real   SCE s Kim said   Sure enough just about everything we are testing here is now real   Crista Lopes  a computer science professor  said the project cut her electric bill to zero in the summer  The utility outfitted her house with solar panels  about 50 LED light bulbs and new appliances like a  smart  refrigerator whose power usage she can track  THE ENDGAME The stakes for the Irvine project are high  At the conclusion  Edison will make recommendations on smart grid technologies to the industry  The utility will then take the testing to a larger area   perhaps thousands of homes  Of course  the industry will hear about the mishaps too  For example  Crista Lopes has a device that controls energy consumption when demand is high  That was great until she was without air conditioning for three hours during a heat wave  Edison planned the outage for just 15 minutes  but a system that worked in the lab failed to send the correct command   
But those stumbles are why the project is valuable  said Bob Yinger  the chief engineer   We learn about what the issues are   he said   and manufacturers learn about how their products behave in the real world  ",2015-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/how-these-energy-geeks-are-re-imagining-an-old-school-utility-325347,325347

130577,352092,EIX,Edison International wins dismissal of U S  lawsuit over 401 k  plan,news,By Daniel Wiessner  Reuters    A U S  appeals court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by Edison International  NYSE EIX  employees in California who accused the utility of favoring higher cost mutual funds over lower cost ones in its retirement plan  despite a U S  Supreme Court ruling backing the workers   The 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said that while the Supreme Court in May 2015 ruled that federal law imposes an ongoing duty to monitor investments on fiduciaries like Edison  the workers failed to raise that argument in lower courts  The Supreme Court decision  which revived the Edison case and sent it back to the 9th Circuit  will likely make it easier for 401 k  plan participants to sue their employers for choosing investments that impose excessive fees  especially when those decisions were made years before lawsuits are filed  But the 9th Circuit on Wednesday said that before reaching the Supreme Court  Edison employees argued merely that changes to their plan triggered a duty to monitor  and not that the obligation was ongoing  so they could not make that claim now  The case concerned exactly when the role of a retirement plan administrator in monitoring a plan s performance can trigger liability under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act  known as ERISA  The plaintiffs and Edison agreed there was a duty to monitor  but disagreed over what that entailed  Employees filed suit against Edison subsidiary Southern California Edison Company  which said in a statement that Wednesday s ruling reflected the company s efforts to act in the best interests of 401 k  plan participants  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment  The employees argued the company breached its fiduciary duty by  among other things  offering higher cost mutual funds to plan participants despite the fact that identical lower cost funds were available  The main legal issue was whether some of the lawsuit s claims were barred by a six year statute of limitations under ERISA  The Supreme Court said liability is triggered by the fiduciary s ongoing role monitoring the plan s performance  so the six year clock routinely resets   In 2010  a federal judge in California said the claims against Edison were barred  The 9th Circuit agreed in a 2013 decision that the high court last year overturned  The case is Tibble v  Edison International  9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  No  10 56406 ,2016-04-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/edison-international-wins-dismissal-of-u.s.-lawsuit-over-401(k)-plan-395271,395271
130578,352093,EIX,Earnings Preview  Edison International  EIX  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Edison International  NYSE EIX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This electric power provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 90 billion  down 9 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edison International 
For Edison International  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edison International will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Edison International would post earnings of  1 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 56  delivering a surprise of  19 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Edison International doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-edison-international-eix-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200390954,200390954

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog

from Thursday s Analyst Blog 5 Utility Stocks to Gain from the Fed s No Rate Hike DecisionInvestors heaved a sigh of relief as most of the central bank officials favored to end the runoff of the Fed s balance sheet this year  The Fed also expressed uncertainty over raising rates further in 2019  going by the  of its January meeting The Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  Jan 29 30 meeting showed that almost all participants thought it would be ideal to stop reducing the Federal Reserve s asset holdings later in 2019  The Fed s dovish position on further rate hikes  by the way  makes it sensible to invest in dividend yielding stocks such as utilities  which could thrive in a no rate hike scenario Interest Rates at Bay A gauge of encouraging economic factors such as strengthening labor market conditions  a low unemployment rate  strong gross domestic product growth and inflation near the 2  target were taken into consideration by Fed officials as they expected sustained growth  the minutes revealed In addition  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had stated on Jan 30 that the Fed would be patient when it came to altering its monetary policy  The Fed took into account economic headwinds that could be potential risks for the U S  economy such as slowing growth in Europe and China  U S  China trade negotiations  the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union and the five week long federal government shutdown  The Fed concluded that stagnating further rate hikes posed fewer risks to a strong economy The encouraging domestic economy and an uncertain global economic outlook are the major reasons behind the Fed s decision to hold its gradual rate hikes Utilities Could Gain From Fed s Dovish StanceUtility companies could reap significant gains from the Federal Reserve s decision to leave rates unchanged this year  This is because the borrowing costs of these companies will remain constant in the near future  thus helping them to avoid incurring additional costs on their expensive business models Second  utility companies offer products and services such as electricity  water  gas and HVAC  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  that are always in constant demand irrespective of stock market volatility or economic downturns  The consistent revenues of these companies stem from their stable business models and near absolute authority in the regions where they operate Thus  the operational nature of these businesses allows them to maintain a decent level of dividends for their shareholders along with offering moderate risk levels  In addition  the Utilities Select Sector  XLU  has gained 13 8  on a year over year basis  making it the second sector that gained the most after real estate  14 2    Therefore  betting on utility

130605,352120,EIX,Sector ETFs   Stocks To Win Or Lose On Higher Rates,opinion,Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs  This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes  pushing yields higher  According to CME  there is 51  chance of four interest rates hike this year The 10 year Treasury yields  which are a key driver of global borrowing costs  jumped to a 7 year high of 3 12   The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price  which is back to  80 per barrel level  and upbeat April retail sales  Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields  read    Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial  technology  industrials and consumer discretionary  Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  If interest rates rise  banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits  This would expand net margins and bolster banks  profits  Also  insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer duration bonds Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy  which in turn leads to greater consumer power  An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields  The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace  leading to increased IT spending  read    Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country  boosting the U S  dollar against the basket of other currencies  it would have a huge impact on commodity linked investments  implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments  In particular  high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit  given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates  Additionally  securities in capital intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates Further  higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses  This will in turn dent profitability across various segments  Further  businesses will also face higher loan rates over time Given this  we have highlighted ETFs   stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates

You can see 
Nike s shares have outperformed the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry year to date   19 5  vs   16 3    driven by strength in international business and the global NIKE Direct business which has been aiding its quarterly performance  Notably  the company delivered top  and bottom line beat in third quarter fiscal 2018 which also marked the 23rd straight earnings beat  
Quarterly results reflected significant progress on the Consumer Direct Offense  positioning it for strong profitable growth in the future  Further  it closed the third quarter with expectations of a trend reversal in its North America business in the fourth quarter  backed by the introduction of new innovation platforms and differentiated customer experiences in the marketplace  
Consequently  it provided robust guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2018 and initial view for fiscal 2019  However  its higher SG A expenses are likely to continue hurting results in the fourth quarter  Estimates have been stable ahead of fourth quarter earnings

Shares of Morgan Stanley have underperformed the Zacks Investment Banking industry over the last six months   5 3  vs   0 7    Yet  the company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  
The Zacks analyst likes the company s efforts to lower balance sheet risk and strengthen wealth management operations  These initiatives  along with cost saving initiatives will continue to support growth  
Also  continued market volatility is expected to aid trading revenues  However  muted investment banking performance is expected to hurt the company s top line growth  Further  higher interest expenses mainly owing to rise in interest rates are expected to hurt its net interest income to some extent

FedEx s shares have outperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry and rival United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  in the last year  The company has gained  18 8  while the industry it belongs to and UPS have rallied  13 5  and  4 2   respectively  in the same period  
Ushering in further good news  the company reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  Both metrics also improved year over year  Results were aided by e commerce growth and a buoyant U S  economy  Additionally  higher shipping rates and volume growth are huge positives for FedEx  
Meanwhile  lower tax rates are boosting the company s bottom line performance  The Zacks analyst is also impressed by FedEx s decision to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks  
However  high costs are hurting the bottom line  Significant investments at the company s Ground unit are pushing up costs as well  Capital expenses are estimated to be  5 6 billion for fiscal 2019  Trade war related fears are also weighing on FedEx

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Edison International and Allete are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This means that EIX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
EIX currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 48  while ALE has a forward P E of 21 93  We also note that EIX has a PEG ratio of 2 77  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ALE currently has a PEG ratio of 3 66 
Another notable valuation metric for EIX is its P B ratio of 1 55  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ALE has a P B of 1 81 
These metrics  and several others  help EIX earn a Value grade of B  while ALE has been given a Value grade of C

Another notable valuation metric for EIX is its P B ratio of 1 33  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 1 75  Over the past year  EIX s P B has been as high as 1 63 and as low as 1 08  with a median of 1 49 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  EIX has a P S ratio of 1 49  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 85 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Edison International s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that EIX is an impressive value stock right now ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-edison-international-eix-stock-undervalued-right-now-200367068,200367068

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Edison International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that EIX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
EIX currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 22  while NEE has a forward P E of 23 47  We also note that EIX has a PEG ratio of 2 39  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 80 
Another notable valuation metric for EIX is its P B ratio of 1 34  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  NEE has a P B of 2 34 
Based on these metrics and many more  EIX holds a Value grade of A  while NEE has a Value grade of D 
EIX has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NEE  so it seems like value investors will conclude that EIX is the superior option right now ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eix-vs-nee-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200367046,200367046

130632,352147,EIX,Southern Company  SO  To Post Q4 Earnings  Hit Or Miss ,opinion,"Electric utility firm Southern Company   NYSE SO   is set to release its fourth quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday  Feb 21  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 46 cents on revenues of  5 410 million 
In the preceding three month period  the Atlanta  GA based service provider reported stronger than expected earnings due to robust performance of its wholesale unit and lower costs 
As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the utility is on a solid footing  having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Southern Company  The  Price and EPS Surprise

   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Southern Company surpasses earnings estimate this time too  Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
A leading utility holding entity in the U S   Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast  With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation  we expect the firm to generate steady earnings 
Also  with operations in a stable and growing industry  Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow  The utility s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself 
We further believe that the AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings 
However  with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time  sales might be affected  This together with a large base  might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates  Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern 
The utility is also bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns over two of its large construction projects   Vogtle and Kemper   which are again expected to weigh on Southern Company s fortunes 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  for this company stands at  0 36   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  However  Southern Company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
As it is  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company  here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
CenterPoint Energy  Inc    NYSE CNP   has an Earnings ESP of  2 65  and a Zacks Rank  2  The firm is expected to release earnings on Feb 22  You can see  
Public Service Enterprise Group Inc    NYSE PEG   has an Earnings ESP of  0 72  and a Zacks Rank  2  The utility is anticipated to release earnings on Feb 23 
Edison International   NYSE EIX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 44  and a Zacks Rank  3  The utility is likely to release earnings on Feb 22

130671,352186,EIX,Week Ahead  Will Bitcoin s Plunge Continue  Can Gold Go Higher ,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
The Week That Was
This past week  all four major US indexes achieved new record closes  all posted on Monday at the start of weekly trading 
From a fundamental perspective  investors looked to be milking the last full week of trade before year end  buoyed by the promise of the biggest tax overhaul in decades and more than 13 months of market chatter pushing the narrative that tax reform would be extremely bullish for stocks  We use the term  milking  deliberately  Investors have been bombarded recently by endless predictions that markets in 2018 won t be able to repeat the extraordinary gains of 2017  which in itself was the best year since 2013 
Technically  all four major US indices the S P 500  Dow Jones  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 opened the trading week with rising gaps  an area indicating no price action  forming a visual gap on the chart  This occurs when buyers find no available supply at current prices and raise the stakes till they find willing sellers  While on the face of it the over eagerness of buyers appears bullish  it also holds the potential for an  exhaustion gap   as the previous demand is dried out  which could precede a selloff 

The S P 500 Index advanced 0 29 percent  paring a 0 89 percent gain  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0 44 percent  down from its 0 89 percent high  The rising gap of these indexes has a higher potential of turning out to be an exhaustion gap  as their preceding moves were sharp 
The NASDAQ Composite gained 0 33 percent after giving back the difference to a 0 98 percent advance  Its rising gap has a lower potential of turning into an exhaustion gap  since its earlier prices were more congested  allowing profit taking for those who brought prices this far and for fresh blood to take it up for another rally 

The Russell 2000  which we ve repeatedly said stands to gain the most from tax cuts  outperformed  advancing 1 02 percent  easing from a 1 6 percent high  Its exhaustion gap is meaningless  as well as harmless  as it s an  area gap   meaning preceding prices were already higher because traders were already willing to take prices higher from the current levels  In other words  there remains potential demand 
The bottom of a rising gap generally provides support to the price  as investors remember the literal leap and are likely to step back into the fray for yet another try  While it is a myth that gaps must be filled when prices correct  hitting all the prior missed prices  and indeed there is a trading strategy that calls for shorting after a rising gap  alternatively  buying after a falling gap   most do fill  or come close  Three of the four gaps filled  while the Dow maintained a light  0 6 percent gap 
The Dow formed a weekly shooting star  which occurs when bears push back a bullish advance  suggesting that at the end of the day  or in this case  the week  they are in charge 
The S P 500 formed a High Wave candle  something that occurs when prices rise and fall but close with no discernible change  This behavior takes place when there s no market leadership  because traders have no clue how to proceed  This candle often forms before reversals 
On Monday  the price action formed a Shooting Star  in which the bears had the last word  Sure enough  the resistance held throughout the week  receiving confirmation by the high wave candle 
The Russell 2000 also formed a weekly high wave candle  after completing a powerful daily Bearish Engulfing pattern on Tuesday  in which the bears stopped a major advance and sent the bulls back deep into the prior day s advance 
Market Internals  Growth Stocks Advance  Defensive Shares Fall  But It s Not What You Think 

Energy  a growth sector  outperformed with a 4 73 percent jump  as the sector is seen to be the biggest beneficiary of the tax overhaul  according to MarketWatch s corporate   reported last Monday by   The calculation shows that the energy sector s median tax rate for the past 11 years was 36 8  far above the 30 percent company average for firms on the S P 500  More importantly  it s significantly higher than the 27 5 effective tax rate for financial firms  which till now were considered to be the firms with the highest effective tax rate 
However  a more direct trigger for the energy sector performance was the recent price of oil  The Forbes article was published on Monday  but the energy sector didn t see major gains until Thursday  when it rose 2 16 percent  the biggest one day jump of its 4 69 percent weekly advance 

This occurred one day after WTI crude oil jumped by 0 75 percent on Wednesday  its biggest one day jump of its weekly 1 98 percent advance  It reflects the effect of growth outside the US and the demand for oil imports  The price of oil finished the week at  58 41 a barrel  the highest closing for the commodity since November 20  and just 0 56 percent below  A higher close will be the highest since June 30  2015 

Utilities  a defensive sector  was the biggest laggard with a 4 67 percent retreat  the mirror image of the Energy sector  That s despite the fact that the new tax plan would have a positive affect on the sector  In addition to slashing the tax rate from 35 to 21 percent  it would also allow these companies to deduct 100 percent of the cost of capital projects from their taxes in the first year the plan goes into effect  rather than smaller deductions over time 
The primary reason for the sector selloff were massive losses by California s two major utilities  Pacific Gas   Electric  NYSE PCG   whose shares plunged 12 percent on Thursday  a day after the company announced that it was suspending its dividend due to  uncertainty related to causes and potential liabilities associated with the extraordinary October 2017 Northern California wildfires   It s the biggest decline for the stock since August 2002  This selloff is its second largest historically  the first was on concerns about the company s potential liability for the wildfire  underscored Wednesday when PG E admitted that it had not yet discovered the cause for the October wildfire 
The other perpetrator was Edison International  NYSE EIX   which dropped 6 7 percent on Thursday  propelled by the PG E announcement  bringing its total loss to 22 percent for the month  This after the company recently conceded during an investigation into another lethal wildfire in the southern region of the state that it is acknowledging  the possible role of its facilities  
So while US indices indeed broke new ground early in the week  they have also met with major selling resistance as the week headed toward its close  While a growth sector led the rally and a defensive sector retreated  it is the result of specific fundamentals  not a reflection of overall market sentiment 
Bitcoin s  Black Friday 

Perhaps cryptocurrency investors had the roughest week of all  Bitcoin diehards in particular saw gains evaporate with a heart stopping 44 percent overall plunge on a 27 percent decline  While the most famous cryptocurrency rebounded 6 9 percent on Saturday  the selloff then extended  wiping out Saturday s gains as it continued to fall lower than Saturday s low 
It s not clear why this is happening now  but some believe the selloff may have been sparked by China s biggest Bitcoin exchange BTCC no longer accepting deposits in Chinese yuan  as of January 1  Others suggest that investors are cashing out after seeing stellar gains  in order to profit before the holidays 
On Friday  Bitcoin was strongly in the red  after a panicked selloff saw it reach a  10 891 32 low  a loss of more than a third from the previous day s close  according to Coindesk data  One of Bitcoin s biggest bulls  Mike Novogratz  said on Friday that he s pausing a planned launch of a crypto fund  after earlier in the month forecasting the digital currency would reach  50 000 next year  He told Bloomberg   We didn t like market conditions and we wanted to re evaluate what we re doing   He now expects a correction in the digital currency to go as low as  8 000 over the coming three to four months before it hits  20 000 again 
Morgan Stanley just published a report stating that the real value of Bitcoin might be  0  The report does not assign a price target for the alt currency and elaborates why it s impossible to determine its value since it s neither like a currency  with no interest rate  nor like gold  which can be valued via weight  electronic usage or jewelry 
Gold
Gold had a great week  advancing 1 75 percent for the second week in a row  showing that even if a growth sector such as energy rises  while a defensive sector such as utilities falls  investor sentiment isn t necessarily risk on 

Still  the price of the precious metal stopped short of a confluence of its broken uptrend line since December 2016 and its downtrend line since September 
US Dollar

The greenback fell 0 6 percent this past week  on profit taking by dollar bulls after tax reform   the Fed rate hike   New Fed Chief Powell s bias toward easing regulations  as the slower holiday season looming  Another factor spurring selling  the end of 2017  which is expected to have been better for the reserve currency than circumstances forecast for 2018

130722,352237,EIX,Utilities To Post Q1 Earnings On May 1  CMS  EIX  UGI  OTTR,opinion,The Q1 earnings season has reached almost halfway  with more than 40  of the S P 500 members having released their quarterly numbers  Encouragingly  significant improvement has been witnessed in these companies when compared to the same group in the recent past  with a bigger proportion beating EPS and revenue estimates  As of Apr  26  181 S P 500 members reported their earnings results  Among them 75 7  beat EPS estimates while 64 1  beat revenue estimates For Q1 as a whole  with almost 800 stocks slated to reveal their results this week  total earnings are estimated to improve 9 7  on 5 9  higher revenues  This surely reflects notable improvement when compared to prior quarter s 7 4  earnings growth on 4 8  higher revenues  The picture should become clearer by the end of this week  as 191 index members are scheduled to report earnings For the sector which comprises 3  of the total market capitalization  the overall picture is not very impressive  with the stocks expecting to witness 0 5  earnings decline this season  However  revenues from the utilities are expected to improve 5 7  Being capital intensive in nature  the utility sector requires huge investments to set up generation facilities as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure  Funds are also needed to upgrade the existing systems to meet emission control standards  So far  lower interest environment in the States benefitted the utility stocks  However  raised interest rates for two consecutive quarters  Dec 2016 and Mar 2017  by Federal Reserve and at least two more expected hikes this year  has definitely marred the investment prospects in this sector As per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   total U S  electricity generation from utility scale plants is expected to decline 0 7  per day in 2017 from 2016 on account of lower demand  The drop in electricity generation will outweigh the expected rise in electricity prices in 2017  thereby hampering the growth expectations for these utilities Further  warmer than normal winter in most parts of the U S  did have an adverse impact on the demand and earnings of these companies  Such factors might have led to negative growth expectation for the utilities  earnings this season At present  four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season  Read more details in our weekly  report Let s take a look at four Utility providers CMS Energy Corporation

130723,352238,EIX,Is Edison International A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Edison International   NYSE EIX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Edison International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Edison International s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE does not compare favorably with the Zacks classified Utility   Electric Power sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 0  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Edison International has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Edison International stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Edison International has a P S ratio of about 2 2  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well in line with the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  EIX is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Edison International currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Edison International a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Edison International is just 2 9  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 3 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 1  which is slightly better than the industry average of 7 2  Clearly  EIX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Edison International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives EIX a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen none of the estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and no down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 1 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Edison International Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEdison International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 34  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Top Research Reports for Friday  CNI  ITUB  EXPE

	The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Canadian National  NYSE           Itau Unibanco  NYSE          and Expedia  NASDAQ           These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 

	You can see    

Canadian National  s shares have done well since the election  up  28   and have also posted strong gains over the last year  up  38 8    but failed to outperform the Zacks Transportation Rail industry which gained  39 5  over the same period  However  the stock has outperformed fellow railroad operator  Canadian Pacific  which has gained  24 8  over the last year  The Zacks analyst likes the company s initiatives to reward investors 

	Furthermore  the company s 2017 capital investment plan is a positive  This plan complements its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  Due to these tailwinds we expect the stock to perform well in the second quarter  Detailed results should be out on Jul 25  Estimates have moved up 3 2  to  0 97 per share over the last month  The company s high debt levels  however  raise concerns 

	 You can   

	Shares of Itau Unibanco underperformed the Zacks categorized Foreign Banks industry year to date losing  6 5  vs a gain of  16 8   Rising operational risk  with management s expectation of non interest expenses to grow in the range of 1 5 4 5  in 2017  remains a concern  But the Zacks analyst likes the company focus on building strategies to expand inorganically  In Dec 2016  it completed the acquisition of 40  equity stake in Itau BMG Consignado  Further  it has been diversifying its loan composition with focus on origination of products with lower risks and more guarantees 

	 You can   

Expedia  s shares have underperformed the Zacks characterized Electronic Commerce industry year to date gaining  32 6  vs  40 4   However  it has outperformed its peers Priceline  up  26 8   and TripAdvisor  down  19 4   over the same period  The company s agency business looks good  which is no doubt benefiting from the ETP initiative 

	However  the Zacks analyst thinks increased investments in the business  increasing competition across geographies  discounts offered by larger chain hotels and lack of ADR growth in emerging markets can make margin expansion difficult  Detailed results are expected on Jul 27  Estimates have increased by 0 7  to  4 18 per share over the last 60 days 

	 You can   

	Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Edison International  NYSE         and Delphi Automotive  NYSE

130778,352293,EIX,Utility Industry Stock Outlook   June 2016,opinion,"Stocks of utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business that give their revenues a high level of certainty  They also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been a headwind for many other industries lately  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  is up 16 4  year to date  til Jun 3  2016  compared with the S P 500 return of 2 7  over the same time frame 
Though demand for utility services like electricity  gas and water varies with the swings of the economy  the fortunes of these companies don t fluctuate to the same extent over the economic cycle  After all  these companies providing basic services can never go out of business    this is their most basic fundamental strength  Their ability to boost shareholders  value through consistent dividends makes them all the more attractive 
To provide an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities  utilities need to upgrade and strengthen their infrastructure and modernize the generation fleet  The water utilities in particular are positioned for massive growth as billions of dollars in regulated investment are required to upgrade the soiled and old water infrastructure  These modifications enable utilities to meet increasing demand and abide by stringent environmental regulations laid out by state and federal agencies 
The capital intensive utility industry was enjoying the benefit of near zero interest rates and was using the funds to strengthen existing infrastructure and add to their generating assets  However  the increase in the interest rate by the Federal Reserve in Dec 2015 has to some extent raised the cost of capital for the utilities  In addition  investors might show more interest toward bonds than utilities as an alternative source of investment 
The Environmental Challenge
Electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  Curbing pollution is now an ongoing process and the regulators have fixed standards of emission that need to be achieved within a stipulated timeframe  Utilities are installing smart meters  attaching scrubbers to lower emissions and launching energy efficiency programs to reduce customers  energy consumption 
Governments across the world are enforcing ever stricter rules and mandates to bring down the industry s carbon footprint  In Aug 2015  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency released the final version of the Clean Power Plan  The plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels 
There was however strong opposition to the enforcement of this Clean Power Plan  as a large group felt it was too harsh and will have an adverse impact on other industries like coal apart from utilities  The Supreme Court ruling in Feb 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of this Clean Power Plan and blocked the efforts of the U S  administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal fired power plants 
Per a U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report  thanks to the already undertaken pollution control initiatives  emissions of carbon dioxide were reduced by 2 7  in 2015 and are expected to further decline 1 5  in 2016 
Something to Cheer About
Per the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  the unemployment rate in May 2016 was down by nearly 70 basis point year over year to 4 7   As per U S  Census Bureau  new single family home sales in Apr 2016 increased 23 8  year over year to 619 000 
Recent projections from the EIA  however  indicate that despite the increase in housing permits  retail sales of electricity to the residential sector are expected to fall by 1 3  year over year during 2016 
However  the EIA forecasts that retail electricity sales to the commercial sector will rise by 0 5  and 1 3  in 2016 and 2017  respectively  In addition  U S  industrial sector sales are expected to remain flat in 2016 but increase by 1 5  in 2017

Our present outlook on the utility sector is Neutral with two major industries in this space currently holding a neutral rank while Gas Distribution slipping since the last update
