20207,241722,BANF,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  BancFirst  First Bancorp  First Financial  Morgan Stanley And Green Bancorp,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 12  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include BancFirst Corporation   NASDAQ BANF    First Bancorp   NASDAQ FBNC    First Financial Bancorp   NASDAQ FFBC    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   and Green Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ GNBC   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Bank Stocks to Buy as Q4 Earnings Bells ChimeA steadily growing economy  more confident consumers and record low jobless rate are sure to give banks a lift this Q4 earnings season  These favorable factors will encourage more people to take loans  and with rising interest rates  net interest margins will improve  Reduction in corporate taxes will also boost earnings as banks will be able to retain more of their revenues But  the Trump administration s overhaul of the tax law means that banks will have to re measure the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and consider one time charges for repatriating overseas earnings  Most of the banking behemoths have already announced such one time charges associated with the accounting changes that will now have to be made Nevertheless  let us focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season  Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results  which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price Loans to Grow              The consumer confidence index is at a historically high level  courtesy of a bullish job market  While the unemployment rate remained at a record low of 4 1   workers  pay has increased 2 5  in the December 2016 to December 2017 period  up from 2 4  in the prior month The National Employment Law Project  in fact  showed that the minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States  This will reach employee wages closer to  15 an hour  which is known as  living wage  All these factors will lend consumers the flexibility to take more debt and also reduce loan default risks  which bode well for banks Rising Rates for Borrowers  Not SaversAs widely expected  the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month  The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1 25  to 1 5   In fact  Fed officials expect to hike rates at a steady pace  The median expectation for rate hikes this year is pegged at three   at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020 A move toward higher rates is a welcome news for banks  Needless to say  ultra low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade  Then again  higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities With the Fed hiking rates by a quarter point  the biggest banks by assets also said that they will do the same to its main lending rate  Millions of credit card holders and small business borrowers will have to pay more in terms of interest  But  does that mean there will be higher rates in deposits  Certainly not  Rates for savers will remain unchanged  confirmed JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Thus  the ability to earn more on assets and limit the cost of liabilities to depositors should keep shareholders of U S  banks cheerful How Will Banks Deal With Tax Reform House Republicans passed a monumental bill to enact  1 5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals  The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21   making it the biggest one time drop in big business tax rates ever Banks face a high tax burden  which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down  As per KBW estimates  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Bank of America  NYSE BAC  will enjoy a 20  or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to around 20  But  such tax cuts will result in revaluation in deferred tax assets  This in turn will result in one off hits to banks  profits  However  even though it may hamper Q4 earnings  shareholders will be much better off over the long term 5 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q4Barring one time accounting charges  improving consumer sentiment and rise in interest rates will help banks stay afloat this Q4 earnings season  This calls for investing in five banks  which are

20252,241767,BANF,5 Bank Stocks To Buy As Interest Rate Hike Hopes Rekindle,opinion,After the Federal Reserve signaled a likely rate hike by the end of this year  hopes were renewed among investors targeting bank stocks  The Fed announced that it would raise the interest rates four more times by the end of next year  This came as a sweet surprise for investors  as they were not expecting any update on rate hike this time around The news led to an increase in SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF   CO KRE   by 1 6  in the past two days as against a 0 2  decline recorded by the S P 500 index As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed s target level  chances of an interest rate hike were low this time around among market participants  However  investors were waiting for another important decision that is likely to significantly benefit banks Putting all speculation to rest  the Fed finally announced that it will begin reducing its balance sheet starting next month  The Fed s balance sheet stands currently at a staggering  4 5 trillion  thanks to its efforts to increase liquidity by large scale purchases of assets during the last financial crisis  The decision to unwind was the result of months of vigilant research and hard work put in by the central bank to tighten the monetary policy Fed Chair  Janet Yellen  said in the meeting that the economy was strong enough to survive further rate increases and the reduction in the balance sheet Why Are Banks Likely to Profit Anticipation of Rate Hike  Banks typically benefit from rising interest rates  The benefit primarily comes from a steep yield curve  i e  when the spread between long term and short term rates is wide  Deposits usually carry short term rates while loans are often tied to long term rates Accordingly  a rise in rates enables banks to charge more for loans  leading to an increase in their spread income  Also  rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy that boosts banking business Downsizing of Balance Sheet  Balance sheet reduction is also going to profit banks  That s because if the Fed decides to buy back some or all short term duration securities  the yield curve will be steeper  This means that the yield on long term bonds will increase  This will also lead to improved margin spreads for banks Choosing the Winning StocksWhile the Fed s moves will likely benefit the entire banking sector  stocks that been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a favorable Zacks Rank should generate solid returns   BancFirst Corporation   NASDAQ BANF   carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 1 1  for the current year  in the last 60 days  Shares of this bank have witnessed growth of approximately 3  in the past two days  You can see  State Street Corporation   NYSE STT   has witnessed a 3 6  upward revision in earnings estimates for the current year  in the last 60 days  It currently sports a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   The company s share price increased marginally in the past two days Wintrust Financial Corporation   NASDAQ WTFC   also carries a Zacks Rank of  2  The company s Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised 1  upward for the current year  in the last 60 days  The stock has gained 1 4  in the past two days SunTrust Banks  Inc    NYSE STI   has witnessed upward earnings estimate revision of 0 8  for the current year  in the last 60 days  Its share price increased 1 7  in the past two days and it currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE PNC   has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 0 5  for the current year  in the last 60 days  It currently sports a Zacks Rank of  2  The company s share price increased 1 6  in the past two days 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-09-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-bank-stocks-to-buy-as-interest-rate-hike-hopes-rekindle-200214952,200214952

beat Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsTrading Revenues to Descend  Trading business is expected to be down in the third quarter as indicated by Citigroup s chief financial officer  John Gerspach  with his projection of about a 15  year over year decline in trading revenues  The bank projects weak trading revenues to continue on subdued volatility in markets Consumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth  In consumer  in North America  revenue growth in the third quarter is expected in retail banking  excluding mortgage as well as modest organic growth in cards as full rate balances rise  In International consumer  continuous revenue growth is anticipated Expense to Trend Lower  Citigroup continues to execute on its investment plans in Mexico  modernizing branches and ATMs  enhancing digital capabilities  and upgrading core operating platforms  These infrastructure investments will likely improve operating efficiency and returns over time  Therefore  management anticipates maintaining positive operating leverage each year throughout the investment period  including current year Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to higher interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending   particularly  in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer   might perk up interest income Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate  Global investment banking fees have been on an upswing  with more than half the contribution from North America  The U S  banks topped the league tables  Improving U S  economy data  along with gaining market share  helped record higher investment banking fees  Moreover  as the interest rate hike is expected to continue  many U S  companies have been raising fresh debt capital over recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later  As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees  this has been leading to strong gains  Thus  Citigroup is also likely to report an impressive quarter In Institutional business  consistent year over year revenue growth is projected in accrual businesses  including PPS  security services  and the private bank  Market revenues are likely to reflect a normal modest seasonal decline sequentially and investment banking revenues are expected to be a level closer to the first quarter  perhaps a little lower  assuming a seasonal slowdown in the third quarter underwriting activity Credit Costs to Rise  Cost of credit is likely to be higher  quarter on quarter  driven by the normalization of credit cost in Corp Other as well as continued volume

20260,241775,BANF,5 Top Bank Stocks To Buy As Q4 Earnings Bells Chime,opinion,A steadily growing economy  more confident consumers and record low jobless rate are sure to give banks a lift this Q4 earnings season  These favorable factors will encourage more people to take loans  and with rising interest rates  net interest margins will improve  Reduction in corporate taxes will also boost earnings as banks will be able to retain more of their revenues But  the Trump administration s overhaul of the tax law means that banks will have to re measure the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and consider one time charges for repatriating overseas earnings  Most of the banking behemoths have already announced such one time charges associated with the accounting changes that will now have to be made Nevertheless  let us focus on banks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season  Such banks are positioned to report upbeat earnings results  which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price Loans to GrowThe consumer confidence index is at a historically high level  courtesy of a bullish job market  While the unemployment rate remained at a record low of 4 1   workers  pay has increased 2 5  in the December 2016 to December 2017 period  up from 2 4  in the prior month The National Employment Law Project  in fact  showed that the minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States  This will reach employee wages closer to  15 an hour  which is known as  living wage  All these factors will lend consumers the flexibility to take more debt and also reduce loan default risks  which bode well for banks Rising Rates for Borrowers  Not SaversAs widely expected  the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month  The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1 25  to 1 5   In fact  Fed officials expect to hike rates at a steady pace  The median expectation for rate hikes this year is pegged at three   at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020 A move toward higher rates is a welcome news for banks  Needless to say  ultra low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade  Then again  higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities With the Fed hiking rates by a quarter point  the biggest banks by assets also said that they will do the same to its main lending rate  Millions of credit card holders and small business borrowers will have to pay more in terms of interest  But  does that mean there will be higher rates in deposits  Certainly not  Rates for savers will remain unchanged  confirmed JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM    Thus  the ability to earn more on assets and limit the cost of liabilities to depositors should keep shareholders of U S  banks cheerful How Will Banks Deal With Tax Reform House Republicans passed a monumental bill to enact  1 5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals  The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21   making it the biggest one time drop in big business tax rates ever Banks face a high tax burden  which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down  As per KBW estimates  JPMorgan Chase  Wells Fargo   Co   NYSE WFC   and Bank of America Corp   NYSE BAC   will enjoy a 20  or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to around 20  But  such tax cuts will result in revaluation in deferred tax assets  This in turn will result in one off hits to banks  profits  However  even though it may hamper Q4 earnings  shareholders will be much better off over the long term 5 Bank Stocks to Buy Heading Into Q4Barring one

    The low interest rate environment  however  continues to exert pressure on Texas Capital s net interest margin  NIM   We believe the pressure on NIM will not ease much in the near term  given the slow pace of increase in rates Further  exposure to the stressed energy sector remains a major headwind for Texas Capital  The continuing low oil prices may lead to deterioration of the credit quality of loans offered to the energy companies  This may lead to higher provisions in 2016  which may ultimately impact the company s profitability Stricter regulatory landscape and rising expenses remain other concerns Notably  over the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at  3 00 per share and  3 57 per share for 2016 and 2017  respectively
