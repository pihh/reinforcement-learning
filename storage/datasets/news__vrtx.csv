119845,341360,VRTX,Better Buy  Vertex Pharmaceuticals vs  Galapagos,news,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  turned in a very good performance in 2019  with its shares jumping 32     slightly outpacing the S P 500 index s 30 4  return  But Galapagos NV  NASDAQ GLPG  had a great year  The stock skyrocketed by nearly 126  
However  for investors trying to decide which of them to buy now  those returns of the past don t matter much  What does matter are the respective strengths of Vertex s and Galapagos  products and pipelines  Here s how the two biotechs stack up against each other 

The case for Vertex
Juggernaut  That s probably the best word to use for Vertex in the cystic fibrosis  CF  arena  The biotech s drugs remain unchallenged in addressing the underlying genetic cause of CF  Further  thanks to new reimbursement deals in several important international markets over the last few months  sales in the CF franchise should pick up momentum 
Even better  Vertex won FDA approval several months earlier than anticipated for its newest CF treatment  Trikafta  The triple drug combo should expand the number of patients who can be treated by Vertex s therapies by more than 50  if it wins regulatory approval in Europe    which seems quite likely 
Meanwhile  Vertex is looking to expand beyond the cystic fibrosis niche  It s partnering with CRISPR Therapeutics to use gene editing in treating the rare genetic blood disorders beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease  Vertex and CRISPR are also working together to develop a gene editing approach for treating the 10  of patients with CF whom its other drugs won t help 
Vertex management thinks that an approach similar to the one that has brought it success in the CF arena will work with other rare diseases  The company s pipeline includes programs targeting genetic disorders such as alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  AATD  and APOL1 mediated kidney diseases 
Rare diseases aren t the only area of interest for Vertex  though  Its most advanced pipeline program is VX 150  a pain drug  Vertex s 2019 acquisition of Semma Therapeutics also put the company front and center in an especially ambitious area    attempting to develop a cure for type 1 diabetes 
In the meantime  Vertex s CF drugs continue to generate boatloads of revenue  Vertex should report 2019 sales of close to  3 7 billion  It ended the third quarter with a cash stockpile of  4 billion  
The case for Galapagos
Galapagos doesn t have any approved products yet  The important word in that sentence  though  is the last one  In December  Galapagos and partner Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  filed for FDA approval of filgotinib as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis  RA  and used a priority voucher  which will speed up the process 
Assuming filgotinib earns FDA approval  the drug should be a commercial success  Some analysts project peak annual sales in the ballpark of  3 billion for the RA indication  Filgotinib is also being evaluated in several other indications  including atopic dermatitis  Crohn s disease  and psoriatic arthritis  Regulatory approvals in these other areas could boost its potential peak sales to around  6 billion 
Galapagos won t reap all of the rewards from filgotinib  however  The company licensed rights to the drug to Gilead in 2015  and will receive royalties starting at 20  of sales in the U S  and in many key markets  However  Galapagos will split sales 50 50 with Gilead in several major European markets 
The relationship with Gilead is one of the biggest feathers in Galapagos  cap  Last year  the two companies expanded their collaboration agreement with a 10 year deal valued at more than  5 billion  Gilead owns a little over 25  of Galapagos  but can t boost its stake above 29 9  during the period covered by the agreement 
At one point  it looked like Galapagos might be on the road to compete against Vertex in the CF market  However  in 2018 AbbVie acquired Galapagos  entire CF program  Galapagos is eligible to receive royalties if those CF drugs make it to market 
Although Galapagos isn t profitable at this point  it doesn t have to worry about raising capital to fund its operations  Thanks to its deal with Gilead  Galapagos ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of more than  6 billion 
Better buy
Both of these biotech stocks have promising growth prospects  I think that Galapagos might be the bigger winner again in 2020 if filgotinib wins FDA approval  However  my view is that Vertex is the better long term pick 
I expect Vertex to keep racking up higher sales with its CF drugs  I m also cautiously optimistic about the company s chances of success in expanding into at least one new indication  The stock price already reflects a lot of the company s earnings growth potential  but I think shares could move significantly higher over the next few years ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmri9,2067734
119846,341361,VRTX,Singapore Helps Global Cryptocurrency Firms to Expand Their Local Operations,news," Bloomberg     Singapore is introducing new payments legislation that offers global cryptocurrency firms a chance to expand their operations in the country by applying for operating licenses for the first time 
The Payment Services Act  which comes into force Tuesday  is the first comprehensive regulation for companies handling activities ranging from digital payments to trading of tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether  As well bringing crypto firms into the regulatory fold  the law will hand the Monetary Authority of Singapore formal supervisory powers for cyber security risks and controls on money laundering and terrorism financing 
The measure narrows the gap with Japan  currently a major Asian center for cryptocurrency trading after 22 exchanges received licenses there since 2017  Increased investor interest in digital tokens has encouraged several regulators around the world to bring the venues under their scrutiny  especially for money laundering and other illicit activities 
The key advantage of Singapore s new legislation is providing regulatory clarity on new types of payments activities such as e wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges  according to Nizam Ismail  the founder and chief executive officer of Ethikom Consultancy  which helps potential applicants with licensing and compliance issues 
Read how Singapore is seeking a level playing field in digital services
Tokyo based crypto exchange operator Liquid Group Inc  and London based Luno  which already operate in Singapore  are among the firms planning to apply for the licenses   We welcome the Act with open arms   said Liquid s CEO Mike Kayamori  The firm will apply via its local Quoine Pte subsidiary 
The legislation  provides regulatory certainty to industry players but  more importantly  it provides consumers with a clear sense of the players they can trust   said Luno s Singapore general manager Sherry Goh  Luno obtained an operating license in Malaysia last year 
Twenty of the top 50 crypto exchanges are based in the Asia Pacific region and accounted for about 40  of Bitcoin transactions in the first half of last year  according to Chainalysis data

Prepared Remarks 
Michael Partridge    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsGood evening  Welcome to the Vertex Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call  This is Michael Partridge  Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Vertex  Making prepared remarks on the call tonight  we have Dr  Jeff Leiden  Chairman and CEO  Dr  Reshma Kewalramani  Chief Medical Officer  Stuart Arbuckle  Chief Commercial Officer  and Charlie Wagner  Chief Financial Officer  We recommend that you access the webcast slides on our website as you listen to this call  This conference call is being recorded  and a replay will be available on our website We will make forward looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today s press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  These statements  including without limitation those regarding Vertex s marketed CF medicines  our pipeline and Vertex s future financial performance  are based on management s current assumptions  Actual outcomes and events could differ materially I will now turn the call over to Dr  Jeff Leiden Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Michael  Good evening  everyone  We saw many investors and analysts at the JP Morgan conference two weeks ago  So I ll spend just a few moments highlighting our 2019 achievements and what we believe sets Vertex apart for the future  2019 was a truly remarkable year for Vertex  All parts of our business met or exceeded the goals we set at the start of the year  And as a result  we are very well positioned to bring our CF medicines to many more people and to advance our broad pipeline in additional diseases in 2020 In cystic fibrosis  the US approval of TRIKAFTA for patients 12 and older in October  five months ahead of our PDUFA date  was the most significant milestone to date in our efforts to bring new CF medicines to all people with this disease  TRIKAFTA is a remarkable medicine that holds the potential to treat up to 90  of all people with CF  As you ll hear from Stuart  the US launch of TRIKAFTA in patients ages 12 and older is off to a very strong start  This clear interest in TRIKAFTA across all groups of eligible patients and the early feedback from both patients and doctors is highly positive  Outside the US in 2019  we reached a number of key reimbursement agreements for our CF medicines that will allow many thousands of new patients to begin treatment with our CFTR modulators in countries  including England  France  Spain  Australia and many others throughout 2020 We are also making excellent progress advancing and broadening our pipeline beyond CF  As we enter 2020  we are now in the clinic with multiple new medicines in five diseases outside of CF  We continue to implement our strategy of advancing a portfolio of medicines into clinical development for each of the disease areas  Key programs include alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  our AAT program where we have multiple small molecule correctors in the clinic aimed at addressing the underlying cause of disease in both the liver and the lung  These include VX 814  which has recently entered Phase 2 clinical development Beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease where we announced clinical data for two patients treated with CTX001  a one time CRISPR Cas9 ex vivo gene editing therapy  which suggests that we may be able to functionally cure these diseases  FSGS where our first small molecule aimed at halting the progression of the disease will move into Phase 2 development in 2020  And type 1 diabetes  where we are developing an autologous islet transplantation therapy with cells alone  and a second  with a combination of cells and a device to correct islet cell function and potentially transform the treatment of this disease  Importantly  these pipeline programs now span multiple modalities  including small molecules where Vertex has excelled in the past  but also new approaches such as cell and genetic therapies  For these new modalities  we ve acquired or partnered with leading companies who have the best teams and unique expertise to manufacture and deliver transformational therapies for diseases that fit our strategy In the business development  we completed more transactions in 2019 than in the four prior years  including our acquisitions of Semma with a leading cell therapy approach for type 1 diabetes and Exonics  the leader in gene editing for DMD and DM1 In summary  the 2019 was the combination of almost a decade of focused execution against our strategy of discovering and developing transformative medicines for serious diseases in specialty areas by focusing on validated targets and predictive biomarkers that will improve the probability of clinical success  Our strategy is playing out exactly as we had planned and will position us for continued short term and long term growth  The Company has never been stronger or better positioned for future success in CF and beyond Let me now turn the call over to Reshma who will talk in more detail about the year ahead Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerThanks  Jeff  Our 2019 progress has positioned us for continued growth in 2020 and for many years to come  We are focused on bringing our CF medicines to more people  advancing our pipeline and building financial strength to support continued investment in internal and external innovation  In 2020  we expect to gain approval for the triple combination in Europe in patients 12 years and older and to submit TRIKAFTA for approval in the US for children ages six to 11  Beyond CF  we are advancing multiple molecules in our pipeline through late preclinical and early clinical development and are now entering a period of multiple proof of concept data readouts and clinical advances with potentially transformative medicines With our AAT program  we recently initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept study of the small molecule corrector  VX 814 in patients with two copies of the Z mutation and expect data from the study in 2020  In APOL1 mediated FSGS  we completed a Phase 1 study of VX 147 in late 2019 and expect to initiate an open label Phase 2 proof of concept study in 2020 to evaluate the reduction in protein levels in the urine with VX 147 In pain  having established proof of concept data from NaV 1 8 inhibition with VX 150 in multiple Phase 2 studies  our focus is now to find the optimal molecule or molecules to advance into mid and late stage studies  We are continuing to advance a portfolio of medicines into clinical development and will be advancing an additional molecule into Phase 1 development in the first half of 2020  We have discontinued Phase 1 development of VX 961 because it did not display optimal PK and tolerability profile Beyond our small molecule programs  we ve made significant progress in building and progressing a portfolio of cell and genetic therapies  in line with our research strategy primarily through our business development activities  We are highly encouraged by our recent clinical data for our CRISPR Cas9 ex vivo gene editing treatment CTX001 for beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease  Both studies continue to enroll  and we expect to provide additional data for this program in 2020 I d also like to highlight our cell therapy approach for type 1 diabetes  This program comes to us from our acquisition of Semma Therapeutics in October of 2019  The team of scientists at Semma have cracked the biology on both the production and scale up of fully mature islet cells and has developed a novel implantable device to protect these cells from the immune system  while preserving cell health and function  We have set an ambitious goal to progress this program into clinical development in late 2020 or early 2021 In summary  we ve made outstanding progress in CF and multiple other diseases in 2019  And I look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming months and years I ll now turn the call over to Stuart Stuart A  Arbuckle    Executive Vice President   Chief Commercial OfficerThanks  Reshma  I m pleased to review with you this evening our strong commercial performance for 2019  Our full year 2019 CF revenues were  4 billion  up from  3 billion in 2018  which represents year over year growth of 32   This growth in total revenues was driven primarily by the full year impact of the SYMDEKO launch in the US and Germany  label expansions for our CF medicines globally and the early approval and launch of TRIKAFTA in the US  The launch of TRIKAFTA is off to a very strong start Our fourth quarter total CF product revenues were approximately  1 25 billion  including TRIKAFTA revenues of  420 million  making TRIKAFTA already our top selling medicine  I would note that our fourth quarter revenues include  as expected  launch related stocking of approximately  100 million  Approximately 18 000 patients are eligible for TRIKAFTA in the US  which represents the largest patient population eligible for one of our CF medicines at the time of approval and launch  For 6 000 of these people  this is the first time they have had a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their CF  We are seeing strong interest from all groups of eligible patients  including new initiations  as well as patients transitioning from our other CFTR modulators Our commercial supply  market access  patient support  marketing and field teams were ready for an early approval  And since October  these teams have been doing a phenomenal job with CF centers and commercial and government payers  The centers and their multi disciplinary teams have done a remarkable job responding to the high patient demand  And while still early in the launch  we are on track to obtain broad reimbursement for TRIKAFTA in the US  similar to what we have seen for our other CF medicines  Together  these factors have combined to produce the strong start to the launch Outside the US  we reached multiple reimbursement agreements in 2019 in key countries  which will enable many thousands of patients to initiate treatment with certain Vertex medicines for the first time  While TRIKAFTA will be the main driver of Vertex s revenue growth in 2020  we also expect an increase in international revenues based on more patients initiating treatment with our medicines outside the US In summary  I m pleased that we are bringing our medicines to many more patients around the globe And with that  I will now turn the call over to Charlie Charles F  Wagner    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Stuart  I will provide additional remarks this evening regarding our 2019 financial results  and I will also discuss our 2020 financial guidance  All of the results and guidance  I will discuss  are non GAAP  As Stuart mentioned  we had fourth quarter total CF product revenues of approximately  1 25 billion  a 45  increase compared to 2018  Our fourth quarter 2019 combined R D and SG A expenses were  496 million  including the operating expenses of Exonics and Semma  compared to  400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  The significant growth in revenues and disciplined spending in the fourth quarter resulted in operating income of  593 million  a 70  increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was  444 million  compared to  337 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 Our full year financial results reflect a similar story of strong revenue growth and disciplined spending  resulting in exceptional operating income growth  Our total CF revenues for 2019 were  4 billion  a 32  increase over full year 2018  Our 2019 combined R D and SG A expenses were  1 69 billion  compared to  1 53 billion for 2018  Our full year operating income was  1 79 billion for 2019  compared to  1 11 billion for 2018  a year over year increase of more than 60  As our profitability and cash flow increase as a result of treating more CF patients globally  we have deliberately reinvested in both internal and external innovation to create future medicines  In 2019  we invested approximately  1 6 billion in external innovation through new acquisitions and collaborations  Even with the significant BD activity  we ended the year with approximately  3 8 billion in cash and marketable securities  compared to  3 2 billion at the end of 2018  As we look ahead to 2020 and beyond  we expect continued increases in cash flow to provide more flexibility for additional investments to fuel our long term growth Now on to 2020 guidance  Today  we re providing 2020 financial guidance for total CF product revenues as well as for combined non GAAP R D and SG A expenses and our anticipated effective tax rate  The strong uptake of TRIKAFTA and the recent completion of reimbursement agreements outside the US have positioned Vertex for continued strong revenue growth in 2020  Our 2020 guidance for total CF product revenues is  5 1 billion to  5 3 billion  which at the midpoint  reflects approximately 30  growth over 2019  I would note a few dynamics that are reflected in our 2020 guidance  As part of the strong launch of TRIKAFTA that Stuart mentioned  we saw an expected launch related inventory build of approximately  100 million in the fourth quarter that we do not expect to repeat in 2020  Also as we move through 2020 as with all of our CFTR modulators  persistence and compliance dynamics will affect TRIKAFTA revenues and therefore  our experience with our other CF medicines is factored into our guidance  Lastly  we expect gross to net adjustments of 13  to 14  for 2020 Focusing in on Q1 2020  we expect our revenues to be modestly higher than Q4 2019 revenues  This reflects the impact of the fourth quarter inventory build  as well as gross to net adjustments in the first quarter of each year that are generally higher relative to the previous quarter  We expect 2020 combined R D and SG A expenses of  1 95 billion to  2 00 billion  The increase compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the launch of TRIKAFTA globally and the expansion of our R D pipeline into additional diseases  Our R D expense growth includes increased investment to advance our programs and cell and genetic therapies  including type 1 diabetes and DMD Now to tax guidance where we expect our full year non GAAP tax rate to be 21  to 22   The tax rate may fluctuate quarter to quarter with the highest rate occurring in the fourth quarter  The vast majority of our tax provision will be non cash expense until we fully use our net operating losses  As Jeff noted  Vertex has a unique long term growth potential that is based on continued revenue growth in CF and an expanding pipeline  And with continued spending discipline  we expect operating margins  earnings and cash flow to continue to increase Now back to Jeff for a few concluding comments Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Charlie  As this is my last quarterly call as CEO  I hope you indulge me for a couple of minutes for some final comments  First  it has been a tremendous pleasure and honor to lead Vertex for the past eight years  I always say the drug discovery and development is the ultimate team sport  None of our successes would have happened without several incredible teams  First  I want to thank the entire Vertex team  including our senior leadership team  most of whom have been with me for the entire journey  I ve never seen a stronger team in my 35 years in the industry  and I m so proud and grateful for all of their work The commitment of our outstanding senior leaders and employees to execute the Vertex strategy of serial innovation to deliver transformational medicines to patients and to grow the business is the driving force for our recent achievements  and it s also what will differentiate us and position us for long term success for the future Second  I want to thank our Board of Directors and our investors for their constant support encouragement and advice  Even when I first became CEO and we were still losing several hundred million dollars a year  we re trying to develop the first transformative CF medicines And finally  and most importantly  I want to thank the entire CF community  patients  families and caregivers for their courage  their persistent encouragement and their enthusiastic participation in this amazing journey toward a cure for all patients with this devastating disease  I look forward to continuing to work with all of you as Executive Chairman to bring more transformative medicines to patients with serious diseases who are waiting I will now open the line to questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen   Co  Your line is now open Phil Nadeau    Cowen   Co     AnalystGood evening  Thanks for taking my question  Jeff  let me be the first to congratulate you and all that    you and the Vertex team have achieved in your eight years of the CEO tenure  It s really been quite something to watch  Then  my question is just in terms of the numbers  First  Stuart  you mentioned really three buckets of TRIKAFTA patients  those transitioning from ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO  new patients being added to therapy  who had no option prior and the new initiations maybe among the holdouts to dropouts in other populations  Could you give us some sense of the dynamics in those three markets in    of the  300 million in end user demand  Where do they come from And then second  just on the inventory  it seems like  100 million of inventory is really just two to three weeks of inventory given the current run rate  So to be clear on your comments  it s not that you expected inventory to come out of the channel during Q1  It s just that there is no subsequent inventory build given that you re already had a kind of average run rate for inventory in the channel  Thanks Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Great  Phil  I ll take the question on the TRIKAFTA uptake  And then  Charlie can talk to the inventory  So  as you know  we had a very strong launch  There are a number of eligible patient populations  As you might tell from the strong launch  we have had a high level of interest from all patient groups  and we ve seen uptake in all of those patient groups and we expect that to continue into 2020  And so to handle the inventory question  I ll throw that over to Charlie Charles F  Wagner    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Phil  to your question  the    first of all  the inventory build in the fourth quarter was expected  and I d say the magnitude of the build is probably even a little bit less than what you mentioned  But    therefore  I think it s fair to say that  that is a    we commented that  that s a build that won t repeat nor do we expect it to get drawn down significantly  Inventory bounces around a couple of day    a day or two on any given quarter  But that s about the right level Phil Nadeau    Cowen   Co     AnalystThat s very helpful  Thanks for my questions and congrats on the performance OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies  Your line is now open Michael Yee    Jefferies    AnalystHi  thanks for the question  And again  congrats on a great result  And obviously Jeff  you are moving and leaving them with a great position  I guess  I just wanted to ask  Stu  you made some comments just now on where the buckets for  but maybe you could just characterize how you think about the swapping dynamic and was there parts of that number of swapping and how do you think  what percent of swapping could happen throughout 2020  just so we can think about that And then maybe a question for Reshma  I mean I know that there ll be a lot of focus on AAT next  I know you ve given a broad guidance on 2020  Can you just talk about the speed of that study  It s a short study  What you re doing there and how fast we can get that data  It just seems like a very broad timeline for 2020 data  Thank you so much Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Mike  on the uptake of TRIKAFTA  As I said  we ve seen interest across all of the patient groups and that includes those who are currently being treated with one of our existing CFTR modulators  Over time  where we have overlapping labels given the superiority of the TRIKAFTA profile  we expect the vast majority of patients who are eligible for TRIKAFTA are going to switch to TRIKAFTA  Exactly how long that process will take  it is hard to tell obviously  we re early in the launch  but in terms of the destination  the vast majority of those patients are going to transition to TRIKAFTA Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerHi  Mike  With regard to the alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency program  I think the one you re referring to is VX 814  That s the one that s furthest ahead  It s the one we started Phase 2 proof of concept dose ranging toward the very tail end of 2019  So actually  it s really very early days  We re just getting going with that study  I m expecting that we will have results from the program in 2020  but it s just way too early to give you more color around that Michael Yee    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Salveen Richter    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks for taking my question  And Jeff  congrats on all that you ve achieved at Vertex  So firstly  could you just comment on how the 2019 TRIKAFTA launch hold form the cadence of uptake during 2020  And then secondly  as we looked at the pipeline  any new thoughts around the requirements for the regulatory pathway for alpha 1 antitrypsin here regarding the need for liver biopsy or not  And then secondly with Type 1 diabetes  what does a proof of concept study look like here Stuart A  Arbuckle    Executive Vice President   Chief Commercial OfficerYes  Salveen  it s Stuart  I ll take the question on the 2019 and impact on 2020  So obviously  given the results we ve announced today  off to a very  very strong start  Having said that  there are many patients  We continue to need to get onto TRIKAFTA  So we are expecting continued growth through 2020 in terms of adding patients and that s built into our guidance of  5 1 billion to  5 3 billion  As Charlie said  one other factor to take into account as you think about the cadence or the shape of those revenues is the impact of persistence and compliance and how that will impact revenues  It does have an impact although as we ve seen with our other CFTR modulators  Our expectation is that the levels of persistence and compliance will be high with TRIKAFTA  particularly given the strong clinical profile  And then I think on the AAT and type 1  I think Reshma will take those Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerSure  So  let me tackle the diabetes question first  And I ll take AAT second  So with regard to the diabetes program  that s the cell therapy program that we acquired through the Semma acquisition  So  I mean the proof of concept I imagine to be something you can think about more akin to sickle cell and our beta thal program versus a small molecule program  And what I mean by that is we are going to be able to go into the clinic right into patients  It s not going to have a healthy volunteer step  And whether we go with the cell program alone or the cell with the device  I think the kind of endpoints you could expect are fairly straightforward ones  glucose levels  hemoglobin A1c  Clearly  hypoglycemic episodes on the safety side will be something that we re watching  But I think that kind of gives you a good sense for what we re going to be watching for The other thing to mention is  I think that you can again    similar to beta thal and sickle cell  I anticipate that the proof of concept studies are going to be a reasonable size and a very reasonable duration  With regard to the AAT program  we have not had further regulatory interactions  And so  as I ve commented on before  I was impressed with the October 2019 FDA conference  what the agency indicated was that they would work with each sponsor depending on their approach for what the regulatory enabling endpoint would be  and I anticipate that the key points that we would be looking for from this program that s ongoing is functional serum AAT levels  And as we think forward beyond that  we just need to get through the regulatory interactions  I will remind you that the augmentation companies receive their approval based on AAT levels  That s just the data point to look at  And the last thing I ll say is our approach is obviously very different than those out there and that the small molecule corrector approach holds the opportunity to treat both the liver and lung manifestations  And so  obviously  we re going to be talking through what those liver manifestations and what those endpoints would look like as well Salveen Richter    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel  Your line is now open Paul Matteis    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystGreat  thank you so much for taking the questions  Just one quick question on guidance  Even with considering inventories when we just take your comments on 1Q  it looks like you re already pretty close to annualizing at the full year number you outlined  And so  we just wanted to get a better understanding of the dynamics that go into your guidance  Are you just being conservative or is there a reason that uptake is slow And then  just second quickly on the cell therapy program in diabetes  I was just curious how do you think about a realistic clinical goal for that program  and do you feel like the bar for true commercial success is insulin independence or are there other ways we should think about a potential benefit  Thanks so much Charles F  Wagner    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerHey  Paul  this is Charlie  I ll take the first question on guidance  And I would not characterize the guidance is conservative  I think it s appropriate given what we know about the TRIKAFTA launch so far  as well as the reimbursement agreements that we signed in the fourth quarter  Again  just to touch back on the inventory topic  it s tempting to look at the Q4 run rate and want to extrapolate from that  but if you take the  1 25 billion back out of  100 million for the inventory build  you re at  1 15 billion into the guidance  obviously implies significant growth over that  And then again as we touched on    in the remarks  the impact of persistence and compliance is meaningful and will come into the revenues over the course of 2020  So once you factor those things in  we think that the guidance is absolutely appropriate And candidly  when you think about the  5 2 billion number at the midpoint  so  1 2 billion increase year over year  a 30  growth rate  it sets us up for another very strong year Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerPaul  I ll take the question on the cell therapies program and type 1 diabetes  So if you think about the current approach to type 1 diabetes and whether you think about insulin just injection or you think about closed loop systems or you think about really anything that s available there  what you realize in these over 1 million people who have this disease  neither is the glucose control particularly good  whether you look at glucose or hemoglobin A1c  nor is it particularly safe on the other side  that s to speak to the hypoglycemic episodes Then if you look at cadaveric transplants  that actually shows that people who cadaveric transplants  islet cell transplants  They do very well in terms of glucose control and don t have the deficiencies with hypoglycemia  Now  the problem there of course is that just aren t enough islets    there are not enough cadavers for transplant and then there is the issue of immunosuppression  So the real beauty in this approach and why we re so very excited about this is Doug Melton and the Semma Group have come up with a way to not only produce  but to scale these islet cells and that holds the potential for really excellent glucose control like the cadaveric transplant without the hypoglycemic episodes  So that s what the real goal here is Paul Matteis    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystGreat  thanks for the color  Appreciate it OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald  Your line is now open Alethia Young    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking my question  Congrats on the quarter  And Jeff  certainly you will be missed in the CEO seat  incredible run  I think we call that CEO might drop  So my two questions are  I guess  when you re thinking about in the field  what have been kind of the biggest surprises  I know you guys talked about bottlenecks and maybe potentially just so much demand  have you seen that to be the case or has been a little better  And then my second question is  it might be a little early  but do you think of compliance and persistence are trending more like a KALYDECO or kind of what are the puts and takes that you think about that as a dynamic in 2020  Thanks Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Alethia  thanks very much for the question  You re right  Prior to the launch  there was a couple of potential bottlenecks as you ve described them that we were concerned about  One was concerns that CF centers  it raised with us about the capacity constraints  They felt they might have given 18 000 patients were going to be eligible for full TRIKAFTA  I have to say they have done a spectacular job in responding to the high level of patient demand  And while they have certainly been some bottlenecks at some centers  in general the multi disciplinary teams have jumped  just an amazing job working to get patients initiated on the medicine  The other potential bottleneck as always with a new product launch is whether we are going to get support from payers  And again  our teams have done a great job working with both government and commercial payers  And clearly  we wouldn t have been able to deliver the results we have in the fourth quarter without very significant access  So both of those bottlenecks have actually    we ve been pleasantly surprised with how well those have turned out in Q4  and I expect that to continue in 2020 In terms of compliance and persistence  really  it s just too early to say in the real world exactly what that is going to look like  We do expect it to be high  We do expect it to be in the range of our other CFTR modulators  which is very high for both of those aspects and certainly given the profile  we d expect it to be similar with TRIKAFTA it has been for all of the medicines  but really too early to tell exactly what it s going to be like for this medicine in the real world Alethia Young    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystGreat  thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Whitney Ijem with Guggenheim  Your line is now open Whitney Ijem    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks very much for the question  I wanted to follow up on type 1 diabetes  so it sounded like it wasn t clear whether or not you d be moving forward into the clinic with the naked cells or the encapsulation  and I m wondering if you can give us any more color on what the exact encapsulation technology or devices at this point Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerSure  Thanks so much for the question  It s really one of my favorite late preclinical development progress to talk about for a few reasons  But with regard to your specific question  you re right  we have two shots on goal here  so to speak  One  development pathway involved the cells alone  And for example  that is attractive in a couple of different potential areas  One of them would be patients who are renal transplant recipients as an example  who are on immunosuppressive therapy anyway and they have their renal transplant because of type 1 diabetes  the naked cell approach or the cell alone approach there could be a nice pathway The encapsulation is a device  The Semma Group has not only done amazing work with regard to the development and the maturation of cells and the industrial scale up  but they ve done a really nice job with the device  The device has to be particular  And others have tried this in the past and it s a tough problem to solve  The device is different and I think is really has the opportunity to succeed here for a few different reasons  It has to do with the geometry  It has to do with the material  It needs to allow glucose and insulin to free flow  but to keep the cells in their state  And it also has to do with ensuring that the device in the cells get sufficient oxygenation and that there is in fibrosis  And the data that we have seen to date including in large animals tells us that that s so Whitney Ijem    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystGot it  And just a quick follow up  So we will be moving the encapsulation program forward into the clinic first and you sort of abandoned the naked cell approach or is it still the nearest  which will go first  Thanks Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerYeah  You can think of it in terms of having two shots on goal  And it s just a matter of which one goes first  But you can think of it as two programs OperatorThank you Michael Partridge    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsOperator  next question please OperatorOur next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  Your line is now open Robyn Karnauskas    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystHi  thank you for taking my question and thanks Jeff for all the hard work you put in  It s been great  So two questions  one for Charlie  First  you have cash that s accumulating  It looks like the studies that you re about to do may not be as expensive  they re very tight and they re maybe small  at least for the next few years  So how are you thinking about thus maximizing cash without running the risk of having loyalty balance sheet  And then Reshma  for pain  you just continued one program  What are you looking for versus the original VX 150  Thanks Charles F  Wagner    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  Robyn  Thanks for the question  As you point out  the business model is running very well right now and we are generating cash  which gives us flexibility  We continue to feel that the best use of our cash is to reinvest in the business  both in terms of internal innovation and also external innovation  Again  you saw us have a very active year in 2019 with  1 6 billion on a number of deals that got us access to some great enabling technology and some programs that are a perfect fit with our research strategy  So going forward  we will continue to be active in business development to the extent that we have additional cash flow in 2020  That s where the priority will be  I m not going to say that we re committing to a certain number of deals or a certain volume of cash flow  Everything needs to be governed by the research strategy  and the corporate strategy will stay disciplined  but you continue    you will continue to see us be active in 2020 Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerRobyn  this is Reshma  I ll take the question about pain  So Robyn  I would think about pain just like CF and frankly all of our program  The approach here in Vertex speak is first crack the biology  then pour on the chemistry  And where we are with the pain program is we ve cracked the biology  And I feel confident saying that because of the VX 150 results that we saw in three Phase 2 studies  right in acute pain and neuropathic pain and in osteoporosis  So what we re really doing now is part 2  which is pour on the chemistry  And this is about finding  let me call is the ideal molecule  particularly in this disease state  Safety and efficacy of course  table stakes  But what we re really looking for is a molecule with the perfect PK  something that can be dosed once or twice a day  given that we re talking about pain condition in this instance  We need to ensure that this medicine can be taken with food or without food  If you re talking about acute pain  immediately post surgery being able to take it with our food is going to be really important  We re also thinking about DDIs and COGS  And so  really I guess  I would describe it to you as we re at the stage of pouring on the chemistry and this is our search for the ideal molecule for this pain condition  or I should actually describe as conditions  we think about it as three distinct groups in there Robyn Karnauskas    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan  Your line is now open Cory W  Kasimov    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  good afternoon guys  Thanks for taking the question  Congrats on a great quarter  Only you pre announced this a couple of weeks ago  you could have made that Investor Conference a little more exciting this year  I guess  first question I have for you is regarding AAT  As clinical work ramps  are you seeing any broader based efforts to help with the diagnosis rate and what kind of education can you do there to facilitate the process while in development Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerYeah  Cory  let s take this in two parts  If you would mind  this is Reshma  I ll make a few comments and then I m going to turn it over to Stuart to tell us a little bit more about the market opportunity and such  Cory  as we start our clinical trials and really start to engage with the community  which we ve already started to do  what you realize and what you re alluding to is absolutely true  Unlike CF  this is a disease where there isn t newborn screening and there isn t 100  diagnosis  And while there is a 510 cleared CE marked assay for antigenic level  the diagnosis is not done that frequently  We are working with the community  We are engaged with the Alpha 1 Foundation  And I do see that group providing a real good amount of education  and I see an opportunity to do even more  Let me ask Stuart to comment from his vantage point Stuart A  Arbuckle    Executive Vice President   Chief Commercial OfficerYeah  Cory  So in terms of what we know about the market today  this estimated to be about 100 000 people with the ZZ genotype in the US and the EU  Almost definitely  that s an underestimate  but let s just take that as a starting point  only a fraction of those patients are currently diagnosed to your point  and only a fraction of those that are diagnosed are actually actively treated with the current standard of care  which is the IV augmentation therapy  So if we are able to bring to the market a product  which treats the underlying cause of the disease  which has impact on both the lung and the liver and is an oral small molecule  we think there is multiple opportunities here  One is clearly potentially to replace some of the IV augmentation therapies  Another opportunity would be to increase the treatment rate in those patients who are already diagnosed  But we also do think there is a significant opportunity to increase the diagnosis rate The diagnosis is not difficult to do  It s a simple blood test  It s currently included within treatment guidelines that  that should be done for patients diagnosed with COPD  But I think as so often the case where you don t have a solution  people don t go looking for the problem  And so  we do anticipate that could be an increase in those diagnosis rates  if we are able to bring a better solution to the market Cory W  Kasimov    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  thanks guys  Appreciate taking the questions OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Kostas Biliouris    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHello  this is Kostas on for Matthew  Congratulations on the quarter  Two questions from me  The first one is  can you give us some sense for how to think about the dynamics of European revenues in 2020 please Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYes  I ll take that  We were able to finalize reimbursement agreements in a number of major European countries toward the back end of 2019  And as we anticipated  we did not see much of a contribution of those reimbursement agreements in 2019 because even having secured those agreements  you have to work through the administrative process before patients can be initiated  We are expecting our European revenues to grow in 2020 as more patients are able to access our CFTR modulators and that s incorporated in the  5 1 billion to  5 3 billion guidance that Charlie talked to earlier on the call Kostas Biliouris    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  And my second question is on APOL1 mediated kidney disease program  You have mentioned that you are planning to use the protein urea as a clinical market  I was wondering whether you need more key efficacy endpoints or these would suffice Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerSure  Thanks  Kostas  This is Reshma  I ll take that one  So  for those who may not be as familiar with this one  this is the VX 147 program and this is going into patients    into the clinic in Phase 2 now actually  This is for APOL1 mediated FSGS  So  Kostas  as you may know  the renal community along with regulatory agencies have for the past many years thought and discussed what the appropriate regulatory enabling endpoint might be for a homogeneous pro generic kidney disease  that s a mouthful  but basically what I m saying is that there is a lot of support and what the idea here would be is to measure protein in the urine  That s a fairly simple thing to do  And when you have a disease that s a homogeneous protein leaking disease that most people believe and this has been discussed extensively in the community that protein in the urine is the right measure for one to evaluate  So that s what we re going to be evaluating in this Phase 2 study  and that s the study that is now getting under way Kostas Biliouris    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you very much  and congratulations again OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities  Your line is now open Liisa Bayko    JMP Securities    AnalystHi  Wanted to also wish congratulations to the team and during the transition  Wanted to ask about the European roll out  Can you just get into a little more specifics on sort of timing of the different countries  And what you think on ramping could look like given that this is serve a new therapy that s available on some countries  meaning they haven t had access to CFTR modulators in the past  Thanks Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think there s really two aspects to that question  Liisa  One is the timing in different countries of the uptake of our current medicines  which are approved in Europe  And clearly  we expect that as I had mentioned earlier to begin now that we have reimbursement agreements in some of the major countries  UK  Spain  France  etc  for existing CFTR modulators  In terms of how that might play out for the triple combination  clearly  we have that submission in with the regulatory authorities  Our expectation is for an approval in Q4 of this year and as you know  the regulatory approval is really the trigger to the beginning of reimbursement discussions  And so within our guidance for 2020  there is minimal triple combination regimen revenues included within that guidance OperatorOkay Michael Partridge    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsOperator  we have time for one more question OperatorThank you  Our final question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Brian Abrahams    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi there  thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter and congratulations  Jeff  to on all your accomplishments  What s been your feedback on real world experience with TRIKAFTA efficacy and safety  To what degree  that s been aligning with the clinical trial experiences  anything unexpected or different there  And then secondarily  can you remind us of your plan to collect longer term outcomes data with TRIKAFTA things like exacerbations  the timeline for updating that and how important you think that will be for full market penetration in the US as well as European access  Thanks Jeffrey Leiden    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerSo in terms of the real world experience  I say    I would say  has been very similar to what we saw in the Phase 3 program  Brian  The feedback we ve had from physicians and patients has been almost universally positive  And when I say positive  their experience of the level of efficacy and the impact it s having on their lives is really inspiring  Obviously  safety is something  which needs to play out over time  But certainly  we haven t seen anything in the real world that has surprised us that has been different from what we saw in the Phase 3 programs  And as you know  those studies demonstrated a very  very strong benefit risk profile  In terms of outcomes data and what data we re going to be collecting  I ll hand that over to Reshma Reshma Kewalramani    Executive Vice President  Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs    Chief Medical OfficerSure  So  Brian  you know that we    in the Phase 3 program for the FMS patients  that was the program with about 400 patients that went out to 24 weeks  We already reported on pulmonary exacerbations and it was a really large reduction of 63   We are continuing to collect data  So patients in both the FS study and the FMS study rolled over into an open label extension  that goes out through 96 weeks  And in addition to that  we have additional studies that we re doing  collecting data from various registries  not only here in the US  but as we ve done with our other CFTR modulators around the globe as well  So we have more data to look forward to not only from the clinical trials program  the open label extension  but also registry data that we re collecting and will be collecting around the globe Brian Abrahams    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks very much Michael Partridge    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsOkay  On behalf of everyone here  thanks everybody for listening to tonight s call  Thanks also for all the kind words  We know that there are other earnings call tonight  So we ll let you get to them  And at the same time  the IR team is in

Prior to today s trading  shares of the drugmaker had gained 2 12  over the past month  This has outpaced the Medical sector s gain of 1 32  and lagged the S P 500 s gain of 3 31  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from VRTX as it approaches its next earnings report date  On that day  VRTX is projected to report earnings of  1 20 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 7 69   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  996 44 million  up 14 52  from the prior year quarter 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for VRTX  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant  VRTX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Digging into valuation  VRTX currently has a Forward P E ratio of 33 53  This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 25 55 
We can also see that VRTX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 14  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  Medical   Biomedical and Genetics stocks are  on average  holding a PEG ratio of 1 67 based on yesterday s closing prices 
The Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 49  putting it in the top 20  of all 250  industries

119851,341366,VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals  VRTX  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 7  
Revenues are expected to be  996 44 million  up 14 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex 
For Vertex  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  14 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Vertex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vertex would post earnings of  1 14 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 23  delivering a surprise of  7 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Vertex appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vertex-pharmaceuticals-vrtx-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200501097,200501097
119852,341367,VRTX,Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Stock Still a Strong Buy ,news,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   a top shelf rare disease drugmaker  posted stellar fourth quarter results after the closing bell Thursday  The company absolutely crushed Wall Street s consensus bottom  and top line estimates for the three month period  thanks to the outstanding performance of its new cystic fibrosis  CF  medication Trikafta  along with other key CF drugs like Symdeko Symkevi  
Is Vertex s stock a strong buy on the heels of this outstanding Q4 report  That s a tricky question to answer  At present  Vertex sports one of the richest valuations in the entire healthcare sector  which would seem to indicate that this quarterly beat was already baked into the biotech s share price  A deeper look under the hood  however  reveals that this highly prized rare disease company is still a great buy for long term investors  Here s why 

Vertex s deep value
Vertex has earned its premium valuation  As things stand now  Vertex is the undisputed king of the CF drug landscape  What s more  there are no serious competitive threats to Vertex s dominance in CF  The company  in fact  won t even face a major generic threat in CF until the latter half of the next decade  And by then  there s a good chance that Vertex will have changed the game yet again  with the advent of an entirely new class of CF treatments 
The big deal is that CF is forecast to grow into a  10 billion per year drug market by 2026  So while Vertex s ginormous price to sales ratio of 16 36 may seem unreasonable at first glance  the truth is that the biotech s stock is probably only trading at something like six or seven times 2026 revenue    and that may be a gross overestimate  The biotech  after all  is currently pursuing a diverse range of additional high value indications  
What else does Vertex offer  Right now  the biotech has promising clinical and pre clinical assets in development for alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  APOL1 mediated kidney diseases  diabetes  Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD   pain  and severe hemoglobinopathies  Vertex almost certainly won t come to dominate all of these high value indications  but it should at least end up deriving a significant portion of its future revenue from sources outside the realm of CF 
The company s gene editing collaboration with Crispr Therapeutics  for instance  could easily produce a few billion in annual revenue through the development of functional cures for the rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia  Its cutting edge work on deadly muscle wasting disorders like DMD could turn out to be a game changer from a value creation standpoint as well     
Another key area to keep an eye on is Vertex s rapidly growing war chest  At the end of the fourth quarter  the company reported having cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  3 8 billion  With its free cash flows set to take a huge jump this year with Trikafta s commercial launch under way  the biotech may end the year with close to  5 billion in the bank  That s a healthy amount of cash for potential business development activities  Simply put  Vertex might emerge as a major force on the merger and acquisition scene in the not so distant future   
Time to buy 
On the surface level  Vertex comes off as just another overpriced biotech stock due for a major correction  But that perfunctory assessment doesn t account for the biotech s rock solid competitive moat in CF  first class clinical pipeline  and proven track record of bringing innovative new treatments to market in a timely manner  Moreover  this biotech stock is arguably dirt cheap once you factor in its long term commercial opportunity in CF    and that s not even considering its massive potential in other disease areas such as diabetes  pain  etc  In short  Vertex s stock is worth the price of admission ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppgqg,2073011
119853,341368,VRTX,Can CF Drugs Drive Growth For Vertex  VRTX  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   to beat on earnings when it reports fourth quarter 2019 and full year results on Jan 30  2020  after the market closes Vertex boasts an excellent earnings surprise history  surpassing expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  the average being 17 59   In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive surprise of 7 89  Shares of Vertex have rallied 22  in the past year versus the  5 1  decrease Let s see  how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported Factors at PlayVertex s cystic fibrosis  CF  drug portfolio has been performing well  Sales growth in the last reported quarter was driven by a rapid uptake of the company s newest CF medicine Symdeko  a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter  The drug  a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor  has seen solid demand since its launch in 2018 as more patients are resorting to treatment with the same In June 2019  the FDA approved Symdeko to treat children  aged from six to 11 years  affected by CF with certain mutations in the CFTR gene  This label expansion reflected on incremental sales in the last reported quarter  a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter as well Meanwhile  Vertex s other two CF medicines Kalydeco  ivacaftor  and Orkambi are expected to have contributed to the company s top line in the to be reported quarter In the quarter to be reported  Vertex gained a reimbursement approval in England for Orkambi and Symkevi and in France for Orkambi  The reimbursement nods are expected to have driven Vertex s revenues from ex U S  markets in the soon to be reported quarter Key DevelopmentsIn October 2019  the FDA approved Vertex s triple combination regimen Trikafta  elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor and ivacaftor  for the treatment of CF in patients aged 12 years and older  who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene  The approval of Trikafta  which can treat about 90  of total CF patients  came five months before the scheduled PDUFA date in March 2020 A regulatory application in the EU seeking approval of elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor combination regimen was validated by the European Medicines Agency  EMA  on Oct 31  2019 We expect management to provide a thorough update on this recent nod and discuss the launch activities for Trikafta during the upcoming investors  call Meanwhile  in November 2019  Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics   NASDAQ CRSP   announced positive preliminary safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase I II studies evaluating their CRISPR Cas9 gene editing therapy  CTX001  for two severe blood disorders  namely sickle cell disease  SCD  and adult transfusion dependent b thalassemia  TDT  Vertex believes that the interim data from the above mentioned study demonstrated meaningful benefits from CTX001 for patients following a one time intervention  Investors will be keen to get the latest details on the same during fourth quarter earnings call Last month  the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Kalydeco for its expanded use in infants aged from six to less than 12 months with at least one of specified nine mutations in the CFTR gene  Though this label expansion nod is unlikely to have driven Kalydeco sales in the fourth quarter  we expect the same to have contributed to the company s top line in future quarters Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an

119855,341370,VRTX,Where Will Vertex Pharmaceuticals Be in 10 Years ,news,"It s easy to grasp how Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  got to where it is today  A decade ago  the biotech s market cap hovered around  8 billion  Vertex s lead pipeline candidate was hepatitis C virus  HCV  drug telaprevir  which went on to win FDA approval in 2011  The drug was marketed under the brand name Incivek    but only briefly  Vertex quit selling the HCV drug in 2014 because Gilead Sciences  HCV franchise was dominating the market 
However  Vertex had another program in development targeting cystic fibrosis  CF   Its first CF drug  Kalydeco  won FDA approval in 2012  The rest is history  Vertex went on to gain FDA approvals for three other CF drugs  It s now highly profitable with annual revenue approaching  4 billion  And its stock has skyrocketed more than 500  over the last 10 years 
Trying to predict where Vertex will be 10 years from now isn t as easy  But there are some clues from the present that point to the prospects for another highly successful decade for the biotech 

A reigning juggernaut
The safest prediction of all for Vertex is that it will remain a juggernaut in CF in 2030  Vertex won FDA approval for its most powerful CF drug yet    Trikafta    in October 2019  European approval for the drug is likely on the way this year 
Vertex expects that Trikafta will expand the addressable patient population for its CF therapies by more than 50   The company also has three other CF drugs in its pipeline  including two programs that  like Trikafta  are triple drug combos 
Currently  there are no other approved drugs that treat the underlying cause of CF  AbbVie is evaluating a triple drug CF combo that it picked up from Galapagos in a phase 1 clinical study  but it s way behind Vertex  Even if AbbVie s drug proves to be successful  it would at best be several years before the drug could win approval  By that time  Vertex will already have further entrenched itself in the CF market 
Although the patents for Kalydeco  Orkambi  and Symdeko will expire near the end of the decade  Vertex s patents for Trikafta won t expire until 2037  The company could face generic rivals for its older CF drugs  but there s no reason to expect that Vertex s CF franchise won t still be racking up huge sales 
Most likely additions
Vertex doesn t plan on being a one indication company 10 years from now  though  The biotech has been busy expanding its pipeline and advancing the most promising programs 
The most likely addition to Vertex s lineup in 2030 will be a pain medication  Vertex has already completed phase 2 clinical studies for experimental pain drug VX 150  Chief Medical Officer and soon to be CEO Reshma Kewalramani said in Vertex s Q3 conference call in October that the company is  advancing multiple selective NaV1 8 inhibitors through late stage research and early clinical development  
I think that Vertex and its partner CRISPR Therapeutics also have a good chance of launching a few years from now a gene editing therapy that effectively cures rare blood disorders beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease  The two companies are currently evaluating gene editing therapy CTX001 in phase 1 2 studies targeting both indications and have reported encouraging preliminary results 
Another indication that could be a big winner for Vertex by the end of this decade is alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  AATD   Like CF  AATD is a rare genetic disease caused by misfolding proteins  Vertex has two experimental AATD drugs in early stage testing  My hunch is that the company s CF expertise combined with the similarity between AATD and CF could boost the odds of success for this program  
Vertex also has an early stage program targeting APOL 1 mediated kidney diseases  The biotech hopes to advance a drug to phase 2 testing this year  If all goes well  this could be yet another new arena for Vertex to dominate by the end of the decade  
A potential game changer
Then there s the huge potential game changer  Vertex acquired privately held Semma Therapeutics for  950 million last year  Semma is developing a drug that could cure type 1 diabetes 
Semma s approach is to turn pluripotent stem cells into islets that produce insulin in the needed amounts to keep blood sugar levels in check  This program is in its very early innings right now  So far  Semma has conducted promising lab tests but hasn t initiated any clinical studies in humans 
Curing type 1 diabetes presents an enormous opportunity for Vertex  Over 1 5 million people have type 1 diabetes in the U S  alone  Vertex has had its eye on several companies in recent years that have made progress in addressing issues related to islet transplantation to treat type 1 diabetes  The big biotech thinks that Semma has a solution and is confident enough about its prospects to write a really big check to acquire the small drugmaker 
The future looks bright
Will Vertex really have successful drugs on the market that target five or more rare genetic diseases in addition to more common indications like pain and type 1 diabetes 10 years from now  There s no way to know for sure  Many promising early stage programs fail along the way 
However  there are some things we can be certain about with Vertex  It claims a commanding lead in CF  It has the expertise needed to develop therapies targeting other rare genetic diseases  It has plenty of money to continue investing in research and development and acquisitions  And it has multiple shots on goal  Not all of them have to pan out for Vertex to win 
My view is that Vertex is the best biotech stock on the market right now  I think that it s future looks really bright ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp-lz,2073854

119858,341373,VRTX,Vertex  VRTX  Q4 Earnings Beat On Solid CF Product Sales,opinion,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX   reported fourth quarter 2019 earnings per share of  1 70  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 21  Moreover  the bottom line surged 31  year over year  Strong cystic fibrosis  CF  product revenues led to higher earnings in the reported quarter 
Vertex s revenues were  1 4 billion in the fourth quarter  also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 billion  Total revenues included  155 8 million of sales from Orkambi distributed through the early access program in France during the fourth quarter  Excluding this impact  the company s sales surged 45  year over year to  1 26 billion  driven by the early launch of Trikafta triple combination regimen in the United States and the global uptake of Symdeko Symkevi 
Full Year Results
For 2019  Vertex generated revenues of  4 2 billion  reflecting 37  growth year over year 
For the same period  the company reported earnings of  5 33 per share  up 31  year over year 
Quarter in Detail
Vertex s fourth quarter sales comprised only CF product revenues of  1 4 billion  The company markets four CF medicines  namely Kalydeco  ivacaftor   Orkambi  lumacaftor ivacaftor   Symdeko  a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor  and Trikafta  elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor and ivacaftor   The company did not record any collaborative and royalty revenues during the reported quarter 
Newly launched Trikafta generated sales of  420 million in the period under review 
A regulatory application in the EU seeking approval of elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor combination regimen was validated by the European Medicines Agency  EMA  on Oct 31  2019  The company expects to gain approval of this triple combination in Europe this year 
Symdeko  Symkevi registered sales of  322 million in the fourth quarter  reflecting a rise of 12 9  year over year 
Meanwhile  Kalydeco  Vertex s first CF medicine  recorded sales of  236 million in the quarter under consideration  reflecting an 8 8  decrease year over year 
Vertex s second CF medicine Orkambi generated sales of  270 million in the reported quarter  accounting for a 14 3  decline year over year 
Notably  a strong adoption of Trikafta might have resulted in sales erosion of the existing combinations  On fourth quarter earnings call  management stated that it expects Trikafta to be the main revenue driver for Vertex in 2020 
Adjusted research and development  R D  expenses rose 22 5  to  337 million in the fourth quarter 
Adjusted selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 27 2  to  159 million in the reported quarter 
2020 Revenue Guidance
Vertex s current year outlook for sales from CF products was better than management expectations 
The company expects total revenues for CF products in the range of  5 1  5 3 billion  significantly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 86 billion 
Shares of Vertex were up 5 9   in after hours trading following a favorable outlook for 2020  In fact  the stock has rallied 20 2  in the past year against the  decrease of 5 9  

 
During fourth quarter conference call  management stated that a strong uptake of Trikafta and the recent reimbursement approvals in key countries like England and France for Vertex s CF drugs led to the bullish view for 2020 
Moreover  combined adjusted research and development  R D  plus selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses for 2020 are anticipated in the band of  1 95  2 billion 
Other Pipeline Updates

ServiceNow last summer expanded its partnership with Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    The updated relationship with Microsoft will help ServiceNow sell to highly regulated industries and see it house its full SaaS offerings on MSFT s Azure cloud  which competes directly against Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   
More recently  the cloud centered digital workflows firm was added to the S P 500 index in November  And new CEO Bill McDermott  who took over in mid November   worth of NOW shares  This appeared to be a solid vote of confidence in ServiceNow and a possible sign that the CEO might have thought NOW stock was undervalued

119893,341408,VRTX,Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Stock a Buy ,news,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  hit paydirt when the company s first medicine to treat the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis  CF     a rare condition that affects several internal organs like the lungs    was approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration in 2012  Since then  the company has strengthened its monopoly on the CF market by developing several new drugs  and its shares are up by more than 500  as a result 
However  it seems Vertex s assumed continued dominance in the CF market is already being factored into its stock price  The company currently trades at 33 times future earnings  Will Vertex continue to deliver market beating returns  Or are the company s best days in the rearview mirror 

CF will continue to be a major growth driver
Because there are 127 known mutations of the gene that causes CF  only 39 000 patients with this rare genetic condition are eligible to be treated with Vertex s first trio of drugs    Kalydeco  Orkambi  and Symdeko    out of 75 000 patients with CF in the U S   Europe  and Australia  However  the company recently received FDA approval for Trikafta  a triple combination therapy with the potential to treat the vast majority  about 90   of patients with CF since it targets the most common CF mutation  In other words  the company s addressable market increased thanks to this approval  and it could continue to get larger as Trikafta racks up more regulatory approvals in Europe  Sales of Trikafta could reach as much as  4 3 billion by 2024  according to projections by research firm EvaluatePharma  
Note that during the third quarter  Vertex s revenue was  950 million  a 21  year over year increase  The company s revenue should continue growing at a nice clip thanks to Trikafta  
Beyond CF
Sales of Vertex s drugs that treat the underlying causes of CF will eventually lose steam since the addressable market for the drugs is limited  With that in mind  the company is looking for ways to diversify its product offerings  Vertex s pipeline includes potential drugs for such illnesses as sickle cell disease  a rare and potentially life threatening genetic condition that affects red blood cells  The company is developing a candidate treatment for sickle cell disease called CTX001 in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics  NASDAQ CRSP   In early 2019  CTX001  which is still in phase 1 2 testing  received a fast track designation from the FDA  which is  designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need   
The company s pipeline also includes VX 150  a potential drug for acute pain caused by small fiber neuropathy  a neurological disorder that often arises as a result of some other underlying medical condition  such as diabetes  and causes severe pain most often to the hands and feet of the patient  VX 150 is currently in phase 2 testing  
Further  in September 2019  Vertex announced its acquisition of the privately held biotechnology company Semma Therapeutics for  950 million in cash  Vertex is after Semma s potential cure for type 1 diabetes  and if the company manages to reach that lofty goal  it will reap the benefits for many years to come  
Should you buy 
There is no guarantee that Vertex s goal to find a cure for type 1 diabetes via its acquisition of Semma Therapeutics will bear fruit  Also  the products the company is currently developing could run into regulatory setbacks  However  Vertex s monopoly on the CF market    not to mention its latest approved trio of drugs    means the company s top line is poised to continue growing rapidly  For that reason  and despite the company s high P E ratio  Vertex is  in my view  a growth stock worth buying ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdix-,2052391
119915,341430,VRTX,Three Stocks From The Zacks  1 Rank Uptrends Screen ,opinion,Don t let this shaky start to December distract you from the fact that stocks are up BIG in 2019  In fact  we just came off of several new highs for each of the major indices So Zacks  1 Rank Uptrends is still a good tool to watch before the Santa Claus Rally begins later this month  The screen looks for Zacks Rank  1s  Strong Buys  with upward price momentum and market beating relative price strength that are trading in the top third of their 52 week range Below are three names that had passed this screen lately  See the current list by Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AMAT What do werewolves  washer machines and the chip industry all have in common They all run in cycles  of course Applied Materials  AMAT  isn t much interested in the full moon or when to add the fabric softener But this global leader in semiconductor equipment sales can t get enough of the comeback for chips this year  which has brought the Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication space into the Top 1  of the Zacks Industry Rank  3rd spot out of more than 250  Sales and earnings for AMAT have trended lower over the past several quarters  but its infamously cyclical space seems to be coming back around  Hopefully  its fiscal fourth quarter from last month is a sign of positive things to come in 2020 Earnings per share of 80 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 5 3   Net sales of  3 75 billion also topped our expectations by 1 9  Whether in a good part of the chip cycle or a bad one  AMAT usually finds a way to surpass quarterly earnings expectations by a few percentage points  It has surprised for 17 straight quarters now AMAT attributed its success to  a healthy uptick in demand for semiconductor equipment  combined with strong execution across the company  For all of fiscal 2019  revenue reached  14 6 billion for AMAT while adjusted earnings per share were  3 04  As with the quarterly results  these numbers are down from the previous year However  analysts expect earnings of  3 77 for this year  which ends in October 2020  Analysts have raised the consensus by 14 6  in the past 30 days Earnings are then expected to jump by that same percentage to  4 32 in the fiscal year ending October 2021  That consensus has advanced by 10 5  in the past month Shares of AMAT are up more than 77  in 2019 as the cycle of chips ramp up  The best part is that the company sees significant opportunities in several emerging trends  including AI  big data  cloud infrastructure and the Internet of Things  among others DICK S Sporting Goods  DKS The holidays are a perfect time to get a new set of golf clubs or maybe even a state of the art kayak The only problem is wrapping these things for under the tree   Hint  you ain t Santa Claus or Martha Stewart  so just get a big bow and put it in the corner  With 733 stores in 47 states  there s a good chance that many consumers will be buying such items at DICK S Sporting Goods  DKS  The company is feeling so good about the holidays amid this strong consumer that it raised fiscal 2019 non GAAP earnings to between  3 50 and  3 60  Earlier  it was expecting  3 30 to  3 45 In that fiscal third quarter report from last month  DKS reported earnings per share of 52 cents that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 37   It also improved 33 3  from last year The positive surprise was the company s third straight  though it hasn t actually missed since 2017  In fact  the stock has managed a double digit average surprise of 11 5  over the past four quarters even though one of those periods was only a match Sales of  1 96 billion also beat our expectations at around  1 91 billion and improved 5 6  from last year Same store sales rose 6  thanks to higher average ticket and transactions along with growth at hardlines  apparel and footwear  which are its three major categories It s brick and mortar locations saw positive comps in their own right  but DKS is an omni channel retailer  E commerce sales increased 13   It also accounted for 13  of total net sales  which was 1  more than last year Analysts liked what they saw in the quarter and raised estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year  ending January 2020  is now  3 59  which has gained 6 2  in the past 30 days Likewise  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year  ending January 2021  is up to  3 77  marking a gain of 8 3  in 30 days  It also suggests year over year improvement of 5  By the way  shares of DKS are up nearly 50  this year  which trounces the performance of the retail   misc  industry at a little more than 10    Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   VRTX If you or someone you care about is one of the approximately 30 000

such a strong 2019  as TRIKAFTA could provide treatment for up 90  of all people with CF Shares of VRTX are up approximately 34  in 2019  which trounces the performance of the Medical   Biomedical   Genetics space at only about 7   This area is in the top 23  of the Zacks Industry Rank In its third quarter report from late October  VRTX reported earnings per share of  1 23  which improved 13  from last year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 8  The stock has topped expectations for 12 straight quarters and amassed an average surprise of more than 17  over the past four   Revenue climbed 21  from last year to  949 2 million While CF makes up most of the business right now  VRTX is also looking at other areas  It is working on medicines to treat pain  alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency  sickle cell disease  beta thalassemia and APOL1 medicated kidney diseases VRTX reiterated its outlook for total revenues of CF products between  3 7 billion and  3 75 billion  which it raised to that level in October after the approval of TRIKAFTA  The drug is expected to be a big help to 2020 as well Over the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has jumped 5  to  4 81 per share The same period saw expectations for 2020 surging 10 6  to  6 67  which suggests year over year growth of nearly 39  Experts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks

119918,341433,VRTX,5 Defensive Stocks To Buy As Volatility Index Soars ,opinion,Lately  the stock market has been highly volatile due to trade war jitters  Uncertainties regarding the completion of a U S  China phase one trade deal and the fate of the 15  tariff imposition on Chinese products scheduled on Dec 15 has left investors rushing to hedge  In fact  the fear gauge has climbed steeply  implying that investors are turning bearish  Given such conditions it is advisable to invest in defensive stocks VIX Jumps 16   Encouraging Investors to Hedge The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  is a measure of the level of implied volatility based on the S P 500 option prices  In short  VIX represents the market s expectation of the 30 day forward looking volatility and a low VIX reading indicates investors  bullishness Generally  the S P 500 and VIX move in opposite directions 80  of the time  But both may proceed in the same direction in certain market conditions  In May  both indexes rose simultaneously for the first time for two straight weeks  This event was followed by a 7  slump in the S P 500 the very next month On Nov 26  as the stock market rallied to hit record highs and the fear gauge CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  dropped to a new low  declining 2 8  to close at 11 55  The fear gauge closed at the lowest since Oct 3  2018  But  with rising uncertainties over the protracted U S  China trade war owing to a fresh 15  higher tariff on Chinese products scheduled to be imposed on Dec 15  VIX jumped 16  on Dec 9 The market has been highly volatile with fears of  no deal  before Dec 15 creeping in and investors bearish  Despite this  that major benchmarks are merely 1  lower than their all time highs and VIX remains well below its long term average of 19  The steep jump of 16  highlights clouded investors  sentiment Given the uncertainties looming from the U S  China trade deal  investors are looking for options to hedge  Defensive stocks look like safe options in such uncertain times Why Play Defensive Defensive stocks like utilities  consumer staples and healthcare have stable earnings regardless of market conditions  Amid any market gyration  demand for these products or services is constant  as these cater to basic necessities  However  these stocks do not give high returns when the economy is expanding  compared to technology and other sectors But with the prevailing trade war weighing heavily on manufacturing and in turn on the economy  defensive stocks are generating better than expected results  In fact  defective stocks that include utilities  consumer staples and real estate sectors have been quite beneficial in this turbulent market  In fact  the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLRE   the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU  and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLV  have grown 27 3   21 1  and 17   respectively  on a year to date basis 5 Stocks to Buy NowHence  as fear creeps in from uncertainties

119920,341435,VRTX,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Vertex  VRTX  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drugmaker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Vertex is 250 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 12 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Vertex is 204   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 19 5  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 37 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Vertex have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Vertex a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Vertex is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-vertex-vrtx-is-a-solid-choice-200491947,200491947
119921,341436,VRTX,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Spark Energy  Vertex  ResMed  Prologis And Boston Beer,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  December 11  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Spark Energy  Inc    NASDAQ SPKE    Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX    ResMed Inc    NYSE RMD    Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD   and The Boston Beer Company  Inc    NYSE SAM   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Defensive Stocks to Buy as Volatility Index SoarsLately  the stock market has been highly volatile due to trade war jitters  Uncertainties regarding the completion of a U S  China phase one trade deal and the fate of the 15  tariff imposition on Chinese products scheduled on Dec 15 has left investors rushing to hedge  In fact  the fear gauge has climbed steeply  implying that investors are turning bearish  Given such conditions it is advisable to invest in defensive stocks VIX Jumps 16   Encouraging Investors to Hedge The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  is a measure of the level of implied volatility based on the S P 500 option prices  In short  VIX represents the market s expectation of the 30 day forward looking volatility and a low VIX reading indicates investors  bullishness Generally  the S P 500 and VIX move in opposite directions 80  of the time  But both may proceed in the same direction in certain market conditions  In May  both indexes rose simultaneously for the first time for two straight weeks  This event was followed by a 7  slump in the S P 500 the very next month On Nov 26  as the stock market rallied to hit record highs and the fear gauge CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  dropped to a new low  declining 2 8  to close at 11 55  The fear gauge closed at the lowest since Oct 3  2018  But  with rising uncertainties over the protracted U S  China trade war owing to a fresh 15  higher tariff on Chinese products scheduled to be imposed on Dec 15  VIX jumped 16  on Dec 9 The market has been highly volatile with fears of  no deal  before Dec 15 creeping in and investors bearish  Despite this  that major benchmarks are merely 1  lower than their all time highs and VIX remains well below its long term average of 19  The steep jump of 16  highlights clouded investors  sentiment Given the uncertainties looming from the U S  China trade deal  investors are looking for options to hedge  Defensive stocks look like safe options in such uncertain times Why Play Defensive Defensive stocks like utilities  consumer staples and healthcare have stable earnings regardless of market conditions  Amid any market gyration  demand for these products or services is constant  as these cater to basic necessities  However  these stocks do not give high returns when the economy is expanding  compared to technology and other sectors But with the prevailing trade war weighing heavily on manufacturing and in turn on the economy  defensive stocks are generating better than expected results  In fact  defective stocks that include utilities  consumer staples and real estate sectors have been quite beneficial in this turbulent market  In fact  the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLRE   the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU  and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLV  have grown 27 3   21 1  and 17   respectively  on a year to date basis 5 Stocks to Buy NowHence  as fear creeps in from uncertainties related to the trade deal completion and imposition of higher tariffs in mid December  it is prudent to invest in defensive stocks  We have shortlisted five defensive

share Audentes Therapeutics  an early startup in the gene therapy area  which develops single shot carrying the correct copy of a gene to cure patients of genetic diseases  This deal will enable Audentes to operate as an independent subsidiary and access Astellas  scientific and development resources Apart from massive mergers and acquisition that benefit this space  its broad and intriguing project pipeline attracts investors  as successful execution will lead to higher revenues  For example  Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation in September announced positive results from its leading pipeline program  X linked retinitis pigmentosa  XLRP  Almost 8 000 Americans suffer from this rare ophthalmologic disorder and a breakthrough will benefit the company financially as treatment would cost  500 000 per patient  This also provides the company an edge over competitors like Biogen and MeiraGTX Additionally  collaborative activities have been driving the gene therapy  On Dec 3  Seattle Genetics  Inc  and Astellas Pharma announced a deal to collaborate  with Merck   Co   Inc to commence a phase III study  that would allow combination of their antibody drug conjugate Enfortumab Vedotin and PD 1 L1 inhibitor Keytruda  pembrolizumab  to address patients with previously untreated metastatic urothelial cancer Earlier in September  Seattle Genetics and Astellas had released encouraging results for the phase I EV 103 study on Enfortumab Vedotin  Such developments indicate growth in the gene therapy space In fact  major biotech ETFs and indexes have exhibited a

119956,341471,VRTX,U S  benefits manager baulks after Novartis values gene therapy at  4 5 million,news,"By John Miller ZURICH  Reuters    Just weeks after Novartis floated the idea that  4 5 million was fair value for its new gene therapy against a deadly neuromuscular disease  a major benefits manager is pushing back  The Swiss drugmaker s assessment of AVXS 101 s value for treating spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  has put the company front and center in the debate over what  super drugs   for rare diseases afflicting relatively few patients  are really worth  Among the first to react was pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   which helps U S  employers manage workers  prescription costs  Its chief medical officer  Steve Miller  told Reuters he  loves the science  behind Novartis s therapy  a potential cure for newborns who are diagnosed early  But  4 million or more per patient   You just can t keep pushing these price points up   Miller said   I just don t think we can allow it  It is not sustainable over time   Novartis  which bought U S  based AveXis for  8 7 billion in April to add the SMA therapy to its portfolio  is still mulling its asking price as it awaits U S  Food and Drug Administration approval  likely in early 2019  But the company has begun its campaign to convince insurance groups and governments to cover AVXS 101  contending the one and done infusion will save society money over the long haul  even with a cost near the highest ever for a one time therapy  There s now only one approved drug for SMA  Biogen s two year old Spinraza  and it is listed at  750 000 for the first year and  350 000 thereafter  Spinraza is not a cure and must be taken indefinitely   When we look at 10 year costs  you see somewhere between  2 5 million to  5 million being spent by societies to care for these types of patients   Dave Lennon  AveXis s president  said   Four million dollars is a significant amount of money  but we believe this is a cost effective point   Though newborns may stand to benefit the most from AVXS 101  depending on the durability of its effect  the therapy is also being tested in older SMA patients with more advanced disease in hopes it will improve their symptoms  too  A CHILD S LIFE A diagnosis of SMA  which affects one in 10 000 live births  is devastating  Forty percent of victims have the severest form and historically die within months  Children with less severe SMA can live to adulthood  although with profound physical disabilities  Though cognitively normal  many cannot feed themselves and require 24 hour care  wheelchairs and machines to help them breathe and cough  Janice Kress  a Pennsylvania woman  lost her grandson to the disease at 5 months  Today she volunteers for SMA charity events and knows families who have fought their U S  insurers for access to Biogen s Spinraza  as payers seek to rein in costs using eligibility criteria like age or when symptoms began   A child s life    how can you say no   Kress said  PRICE WATCHDOG As Novartis prepares to launch AVXS 101  it also hopes for tacit endorsement of its pricing strategy from the non profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review  ICER   which is currently reviewing the cost effectiveness of SMA therapies   The Boston based non profit  established in 2006  carries out cost benefit analyses on drugs that it calls independent of  Big Pharma   insurers and government  Unlike European price regulators  ICER cannot dictate costs  But it has steadily gained influence in the U S  pricing debate  as companies like Express Scripts and CVS Caremark and governments rely on its analyses  ICER has reviewed 11 treatments in 2018   Seven times  it concluded drugs  prices aligned with their benefits  like when it said Roche s  482 000 hemophilia medicine Hemlibra could save the U S  system up to  1 9 million for the hardest to treat patients  Four times  however  ICER concluded drugmakers were asking too much  giving payers ammunition to bargain them down   For instance  the New York Department of Health told Reuters that ICER s finding that a  270 000 per year cystic fibrosis drug from Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  represented  low long term value  helped underpin the state s demand for a steep discount  JUST ONE FINGER Novartis and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   as well as Switzerland s Roche  which also has an SMA drug in development  are all lobbying ICER to broaden what it considers a meaningful benefit  potentially helping their therapies fare well in the group s review  The ability to move one finger might not seem like much  but Biogen told ICER such a measure should be considered  since it might allow somebody with SMA to steer an electric wheelchair and maintain a level of independence   We recently spoke with a young man who is   now losing ability and power in his fingers   said Sangeeta Jethwa  Roche s head of patient partnerships  told Reuters   He wants to be able to go out with his friends and open his own bottle of drink  That for him is fantastically meaningful   For its SMA review  ICER aims to quantify factors like quality of life  direct medical costs and how patient and caregiver productivity losses may burden society  A head to head comparison of Spinraza s and AVXS 101 s financial impacts over time is also planned before ICER issues its final report in March  ICER spokesman David Whitrap said ICER s review takes eight months so it can  rigorously evaluate all of the available evidence    The stakes are high for Biogen  after Britain s healthcare cost agency  the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  has concluded Spinraza was too expensive to be cost effective  Though Spinraza  whose nine month 2018 sales hit  1 25 billion  is available in the United States and elsewhere in Europe  Biogen wants to avoid a negative ICER assessment that gives payers more leverage to demand rebates   We are confident in the evidence supporting the value it provides   a Biogen spokeswoman said  SIGNS OF PROGRESS Treatments for rare diseases like SMA are increasingly popular among drugmakers  because they command high prices while insurers are hard pressed to reject claims  especially for sick children  Sales of rare disease therapies will rise 11 percent annually  nearly twice the overall market rate  through 2024  when they ll hit  262 billion  consultancy Evaluate Pharma has forecast  Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan  with ambitions of treating hundreds of SMA patients annually  highlights 90 kids in AVXS 101 trials over four years  including some who would otherwise have been incapacitated and fed through tubes   With AVXS 101    patients are alive and thriving   Narasimhan said  There were no SMA therapies  however  when Victoria Gusset  an eight year old Swiss girl with a shy smile and love for horses  was diagnosed as a toddler after failing to stand independently  Today  Victoria is in a trial testing how Spinraza may improve muscle control or halt its decline in older children  Every four months  Victoria and her mother  Nicole Gusset  load her electric wheelchair into their van and drive two hours from their home near Bern to a German hospital for a spinal infusion  Victoria looks forward to each trip  though she sometimes suffers from nausea and headaches following treatment   I get to go shopping with mum   she said  After her daughter s diagnosis  Nicole Gusset founded an SMA patient organization and has been lobbying the Swiss government to expand access to Spinraza  Children under 20 have coverage  but most insurers refuse to pay for adults  Gusset said Novartis s  4 million announcement sent shockwaves through Switzerland s SMA community  heightening fears that escalating costs will keep new treatments out of reach for some who might benefit   The best therapies are useless if patients cannot get them   she said

120062,341577,VRTX,Vertex Energy  VTNR  To Report Q3 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Vertex  NASDAQ VRTX  Energy  VTNR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This environmental services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  107 7  
Revenues are expected to be  48 50 million  down 4 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 66 67  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex Energy 
For Vertex Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vertex Energy would post a loss of  0 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 04  delivering a surprise of  233 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Vertex Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vertex-energy-vtnr-to-report-q3-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200479603,200479603

Vertex  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  posted revenues of  949 83 million for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 25   This compares to year ago revenues of  784 54 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Vertex shares have added about 19 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for Vertex 
While Vertex has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Vertex was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Southern Company  NYSE SO   SO   Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AMAT  and Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   VRTX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Southern s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry year to date  38 2  vs  18 3    The Zacks analyst believes that leveraging the demographics of its operating territories  as in healthy population and job growth  the firm has gradually increased its customer base 
With good rate base growth and constructive regulation  Southern Company is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years  However  elevated leverage of the firm  along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over its Vogtle project  are the major overhangs 
While the electric utility holding company s debt to capital ratio of 56  restricts financial flexibility  its  25 billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded budget and is years behind schedule  As such  Southern Company warrants a cautious stance from its investors 
 You can  
Shares of Applied Materials have gained 20 6  in the past six months compared with the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication industry s rise of 27 6   The Zacks analyst thinks that Applied Materials is benefiting from rising need for specialty nodes in IoT  communications  automotive  power and image sensor applications  This is leading to increased customer spending in foundry and logic 
Further  the company is witnessing solid momentum across the United States and Taiwan which is a major positive  Additionally  strengthening momentum in conductor etch is aiding Applied Materials in gaining traction in DRAM and NAND  The company remains optimistic about the price elasticity of NAND  which is expected to bolster NAND customer spending in the near term 
However  market uncertainties remain headwinds  Softness in semiconductor and display markets on account of a slowdown in memory and display customers  spending is a major concern 
 You can  
Vertex s shares have lost 0 6  over the past three months compared with the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry s decline of 4 7   The Zacks analyst believes that Vertex s third cystic fibrosis  CF  medicine  Symdeko  in a very short time  has become the main driver of its CF revenues 
Vertex rapidly advanced its triple combination CF regimen through late stage development and regulatory filings  The regimen is crucial for long term growth as it has the potential to treat up to 90  of CF patients  Meanwhile  Vertex s non CF pipeline  though early stage  looks interesting with several pipeline readouts expected in 2020 21 
However  competitive pressure is rising in the CF market with many other companies developing triple combo CF drugs  Also  Vertex s dependence on just the CF franchise for growth is a concern  Shares have outperformed the industry this year so far  Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q3 earnings  Vertex has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters

120138,341653,VRTX,Will New Alliances Aid Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Quest Diagnostics Incorporated   NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 earnings on Oct 22  before the opening bell 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings of  1 72 implies a 2 38  rise from the year ago reported figure In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 37   the average trailing four quarter positive surprise being 1 33  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors Likely to Influence Third Quarter ResultsQuest Diagnostics seems well aligned with its two pronged agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence  Per the company  its frequently growing partnerships with other health care leaders and prudent buyouts are creating promising opportunities for the top and the bottom line while at the same time  the patient experience is improved and the overall cost of care  reduced As an evidence  the company satisfied all the five elements of its growth acceleration strategy through the last few quarters  Therefore  we strongly expect this momentum to most likely reflect on the upcoming quarterly results Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Going by the first element of its growth strategy  to further strengthen the top line by 2  via strategically accretive acquisitions  so far in 2019  the company completed the purchase of a clinical laboratory services business of Boyce and Bynum  a provider of diagnostic and clinical laboratory services in the Midwest  We expect to see this transaction leave a positive impact on the to be reported results Considering the second element of Quest Diagnostics  key growth plans  which is to expand relationships with hospital health systems  it is executing this strategy quite successfully  The company s top line number is expected to reflect the impact of its recent partnerships with Catholic Health Services  CHS   an integrated health care delivery system  and hc1  a bioinformatics player in precision testing  in the impending quarterly release With respect to the third element of offering its diagnostic innovation a wider access  the company has been witnessing growth in prescription drug monitoring  QuantiFERON  tuberculosis test  T SPOT  Cardio IQ and mutual testing  Per the company  the recently inked consolidation deals are predicted to upgrade its capabilities in advanced diagnostics  especially in the areas of Women s Health and Infectious Disease  These new developments are expected to have contributed to the company s third quarter top line About the fourth element of the company s growth strategy  which is to provide ample choices to consumers  the company s relationship with Walmart  NYSE WMT  has already started adding value to this end with higher patient traffic  Moreover  the company s alliance with Safeway currently has more than 200 patient service centers across its retail store locations  This positive aspect is likely to reflect on the third quarter earnings performance of Quest Diagnostics The fifth element of Quest Diagnostics  growth policies indicates its support to population health within analytics and extended care services  In this regard  the company recently launched Quest Clinical Trial Connect  a patient recruitment service Apart from these five elements  in terms of Quest Diagnostics  efforts to ramp up its operating efficiency  it endeavors to scale up productivity  This  in turn  enabled the company to effectively manage headcount growth We expect these key active catalysts to replicate the company s success story in its impending quarterly results  Also  a better than expected performance is likely to perk up the same primary metrics in the third quarter alike the preceding ones We strongly believe that all these recent developments might have significantly favored the company s top line in the third quarter On the flip side  Quest Diagnostics is suffering a significant PAMA driven reimbursement pressure that remains a major headwind to structural changes in the marketplace  In the first half of 2019  Medicare rates were down by 10  from the prior year  This is expected to affect the company s business through the second half as well  In fact  this should get reflected in third quarter results only The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings of  1 72 implies a 2 38  rise from the year ago reported figure What Our Model SuggestsThe proven Zacks does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Quest Diagnostics this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of beating estimates  But that s not the case here  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  0 51

120166,341681,VRTX,Eaton Vance fund managers see major upside for healthcare stocks  Barron s,news," Reuters    The portfolio managers of the  1 2 billion Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences fund are expecting big gains from a trio of healthcare stocks 
Jason Kritzer and Samantha Pandolfi  co managers of the fund  highlighted Vertex Pharmaceuticals  O VRTX   Zoetis  N ZTS  and  Shire   L SHP  for future outperformance in an article in Barron s 
Kritzer said he expects to see Vertex increase its revenue by at least 20 percent in 2017 and 30 percent in 2018  with per share profit potentially doubling this year and again next year  He sees the stock price rising to  between  152 and  155  
Vertex closed at  130 99 on Friday 
Pandolfi says she sees 15 percent upside for drugmaker Zoetis and 40 percent upside for Dublin based drugmaker Shire She said Shire s stock price has been held back by investor concerns the company is losing ground to other manufacturers of hemophilia drugs  which Shire relies on for a large portion of its annual revenue 
 If the hemophilia fears persist  it could take two to three years to deliver those returns   she said   If the fears abate  it will happen sooner

120170,341685,VRTX,Vertex Pharma shares hit life high as cystic fibrosis data wows,news," Reuters    Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  O VRTX  soared to touch a record high on Wednesday  a day after the drugmaker revealed data on its triple combinations of cystic fibrosis  CF  treatments that wowed both analysts and investors 
Vertex s shares climbed 26 percent to  165 97  adding nearly  8 billion to its market valuation  They had earlier touched a life high of  167 00 
Analysts said the data exceeded expectations  raised the bar for competitors and positioned the treatments to help up to 90 percent of patients with the life shortening lung disease 
Vertex already sells two therapies that can treat up to 40 percent of CF patients  Kalydeco and Orkambi brought in sales of  481 million in the first quarter 
 Not only does this data set up well to reach a large majority of the CF patient population  it greatly increases the competitive hurdle while also enhancing the scarcity value of the company   J P  Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a note 
The data on Tuesday showed three different triple combinations of CF treatments significantly improving patient lung function in clinical trials   nL1N1K91UW 
CF is a rare  life shortening genetic disease affecting about 75 000 people in North America  Europe and Australia that causes progressive lung damage and loss of lung function 
 The triple combo results came in an order of magnitude better than we  or really anyone  expected   Baird analyst Brian Skorney noted 
At least three brokerages raised their ratings on Vertex s stock   Barclays   LON BARC  to  overweight   Janney to  buy  and Raymond James to  outperform  
Analysts are bullish on the stock with 21 out of 25 covering Vertex rating it  buy  or higher and the rest  hold  
Eight brokerages increased their price target on Vertex  The drugmaker s median price target is  180  up from  129 50 in June 
Shares of  Galapagos  NV  AS GLPG   which is developing a rival CF treatment with  AbbVie Inc   N ABBV   slipped about 4 5 percent 
 Galapagos AbbVie s planned path to the triple combo is not impossible  but faces a much higher hurdle as compared with Vertex s triple combo strategy   William Blair analyst Katherine Xu said in a note

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Celgene  CELG   Sinopec  SNP  and HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA   HSBC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Celgene s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past three months  1 2  vs   4 3    The Zacks analyst thinks that Celgene s lead drug  Revlimid  continues to drive revenues on label expansions and market share gains 
Robust performance of psoriasis drug  Otezla  is also boosting Celgene s performance  Investors are focusing on the company s merger with large cap pharma Bristol Myers for a whopping  74 billion 
Per the terms  Celgene shareholders will receive  50 plus one share of Bristol Myers and one tradeable Contingent Value Right  which will entitle the holder to receive a cash payment of  9 00 upon the receipt of FDA approval for three candidates   ozanimod  liso cel and bb2121  The merger was initially opposed but was eventually given a green signal 
 You can  
Shares of Sinopec have lost 26 4  in the past six months  underperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry s fall of 18 3   The Zacks analyst believes that the company has made major progress in identifying attractive and economically viable oil and natural gas reserves 
A huge scale of prospective reserves was discovered in a number of prolific natural gas basins like Sichuan and Ordos  The discoveries will help Sinopec capitalize on mounting clean energy demand as China is transitioning from coal to natural gas for electricity generations  However  China s bleak economic outlook will continue to hurt the firm s refining business 
In fact  soft refining margin primarily led the company to report dismal second quarter 2019 earnings  Moreover  the firm s cash flow declined 54  year over year in the first half of 2019  reflecting weak operations  
 You can  
HSBC s shares have lost 4 8  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Foreign Banks industry s rise of 2 9  over the same period 
The Zacks analyst believes that the company s initiatives to improve market share in the U K  and China are likely to lead to an increase in expenses and hurt bottom line growth  These efforts will support financials over the long term  Also  initiatives to strengthen digital capabilities globally  improve operating efficiency and open 50 new retail banking branches in the United States will go a long way in supporting profits 
Its steady capital deployments are impressive  reflecting a strong balance sheet position  and will enhance shareholder value  Nevertheless  disappointing economic growth in Europe and weak loan demand are likely to hurt revenue growth to some extent  Additionally  uncertainty related to the implication of Brexit on its financials remains a major near term concern

120179,341694,VRTX,3 Big Biotech Stocks Worth Adding To Your Portfolio Now,opinion,It has been a roller coaster ride for the biotech sector so far this year  While 2019 started with a bang announcing the mega merger between Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   that significantly perked up prices of quite a few stocks  these gains were partially offset over the course of time  primarily due to the overall weakness in the global market Nevertheless  the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has seen 7 4  growth year to date Relatively  the biotech sector persisted to be riskier than the more stable  industry or the overall medical sector as investors are mostly banking on the companies  product pipelines with a very few having approved drugs in the portfolios  An unfavorable outcome of a key study on a promising candidate can spell doomsday for the respective biotech player The sector has been in spotlight since the onset of the year as a slowdown in mature products due to increasing competition and rise of biosimilars have forced most pharma biotech behemoths to target lucrative buyouts in this space to bolster their pipelines   Evidently  the focus is back on the mergers   acquisitions activity  The recent spree of consolidations is expected to continue with both big biotech and small biotech stocks  which have a dominant position in the lesser competitive arena of rare diseases and NASH and are well equipped with path breaking technology  respectively  A slew of licensing and buyout deals is struck with most companies eyeing smaller entities with impressive pipelines  Meanwhile  new drug approvals and label expansions of blockbuster drugs boosted investor sentiment and this upside should drive growth As fears of a global recession loom large on the overall economy  the inherent risk of the sector gets intensified  In such a scenario  choosing a biotech stock for investment can be tricky  Particularly  smaller biotechs are more hazardous as their product pipelines are several years away from commercialization  In contrast  investing in biotech biggies provides a cushion against volatility in the sector  Moreover  the  industry is placed within the top 36  of the 256 Zacks ranked industries Here we zero in on the three big biotech companies  which have outperformed the sector so far in 2019 and still hold enough room for an upside  backed by a broad and a strong product portfolio Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   is a biopharmaceutical company  focused on developing and commercializing life transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra rare disorders  Alexion s blockbuster drug Soliris   approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS    continues to perform well  The drug s label expansion for the generalized myasthenia gravis indication boosted sales significantly  The company received a significant boost with the FDA approval of its long acting C5 complement inhibitor Ultomiris for the treatment of adult patients with PNH  The approval has strengthened Alexion s PNH franchise and reduced the company s dependence on Soliris for growth  Alexion is working on the label expansion of Ultomiris and taking steps to further diversify its pipeline  which should reap returns in the long run Shares of the company have gained 8 5  in the year so far against the industry s decline of 1 7  Alexion currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated s   NASDAQ VRTX   key area of focus is cystic fibrosis  CF  and the company has a market leading portfolio for the same  The company s chief marketed products are Symdeko Symkevi  tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor   Orkambi  lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor  and Kalydeco  ivacaftor   Consistent positive regulatory nods increased the eligible patient population for these drugs  The CF market represents a huge commercial potential and Vertex has been striving hard to further cement its pipeline  Notably  the company s CF pipeline is already quite strong and approval of new treatments will further leverage its dominant position in the market  Meanwhile  the company is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease  thalassemia and pain management Vertex presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2  Shares of the company have gained 6 3  in the year so far  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   is one of the top biotechnology companies in the world with a strong presence in the oncology hematology  cardiovascular disease  neuroscience  inflammation  bone health and nephrology markets  While its legacy products reached the end of respective life cycles  growth products  such as Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate plus Kyprolis and Blincyto are performing well  gaining consistent approvals for label expansions  Moreover  Amgen has a solid biosimilars  pipeline  which is expected to drive growth  The company has already launched two biosimilars in the EU  namely Amjevita  biosimilar of AbbVie s Humira  and Kanjinti  biosimilar of Roche s Herceptin  Amgen currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Shares of the company have inched up 0 5  in the year so far Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X

120181,341696,VRTX,Can Vertex  VRTX  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 19 33   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Vertex came out with earnings of  1 26 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 03 per share  representing a surprise of 22 33   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 98 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 14 per share  delivering a surprise of 16 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Vertex  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Vertex has an Earnings ESP of  1 97  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-vertex-vrtx-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200473199,200473199
120182,341697,VRTX,Can Balanced Segmental Growth Aid Abbott  ABT  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   is slated to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 16  before the market opens  In the last reported quarter  the company came up with a positive surprise of 2 5   Abbott delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 1 78  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayOver the last few quarters  Abbott has been riding high on a healthy growth curve within its Diabetes Care business  The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in its flagship  sensor based continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  system   FreeStyle Libre System  This upside is likely to reflect on the upcoming quarterly resultsNotably  in the last reported quarter  Diabetes Care sales surged at a stupendous rate  up 35 3  year over year organically   led by FreeStyle Libre  Libre is once again expected to have performed exceptionally well  registering strong worldwide sales in the to be reported quarter According to Abbott  FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership in CGM systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users  In order to meet higher demand for Libre  Abbott is currently adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity  which is gradually coming online  starting from the third quarter of 2019 onward  This might reflect on the company s third quarter performance throughout Meanwhile  in September  the company announced its newly formed alliance with Sanofi  PA SASY  to integrate glucose sensing and insulin delivery technologies  The two companies are developing tools that combine Abbott s FreeStyle Libre technology with Sanofi s insulin dosing information for future smart pens  insulin titration apps and cloud software  This new development is expected to have contributed to the company s third quarter top line The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  640 million for third quarter Diabetes Care revenues indicates a rise of 25  from the year ago reported figure Alike the prior reported quarter  Abbott in the impending quarterly release is anticipated to gain from a solid performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division  EPD  business  which has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters  Per Abbott  its EPD business is growing at a faster pace than the market rate across the key emerging markets that represent the most attractive long term growth pertaining to its branded generics portfolio  These include India  Brazil  Russia and China among others Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise   Management expects EPD to deliver a mid to high single digit uptick in the to be reported results Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 billion for EPD revenues suggests a 5  decline from the year earlier reported number We are optimistic about the consistently sturdy Diagnostics business  courtesy of robust contributions from all sub segments  namely Core Laboratories Diagnostics  Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Moreover  we are impressed by the accelerated global rollout of the company s Alinity suite of instrument  Currently in Europe  the company is converting its existing customers to Alinity and is progressing strongly with its systems for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing  which is helping drive double digit growth in international Core Laboratory business   In the United states  this business is growing rapidly on achievement of regulatory approvals for broad menu of core laboratory tests  In this regard  in July  the company clinched an FDA approval of Alinity S for blood and plasma screening  This in turn might have also strongly contributed to the company s third quarter top line performance Per Abbott  it is well positioned for sustainable growth in years to come  based on the company s rollout of the full suite of Alinity systems across additional geographies including the United States Within Diagnostics  the company forecasts the legacy diagnostics businesses  comprising Core Laboratory  Molecular and Point of Care  to grow in high single digits and in Rapid Diagnostics  it forecasts low to mid single digit growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 92 billion for Diagnostic revenues implies a 5 3  improvement from the figure registered in the comparable quarter last year We also encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott s most speedily growing business owing to aging population  increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets  Furthermore  Abbott s pediatric nutrition business continues to thrive in the United States  For the third quarter  the company projects mid single digit sales growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 89 billion for Nutritional revenues indicates a 2 9  rise from the number recorded in the prior year quarter What the Model SuggestsThe proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has significant chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter Abbott has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  in the combination makes surprise prediction difficult for the stock this reporting cycle  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter bottom line of 84 cents suggests a 12  climb from the year earlier

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Vertex due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Vertex Q1 Earnings and Revenues Surpass EstimatesVertex s first quarter 2019 earnings per share of  1 14 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents  Moreover  earnings rose 50  year over year as higher product sales were partially offset by higher costs and taxes Revenues were  858 4 million in the first quarter and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  851 0 million  The company s sales surged 34  year over year  driven by the rapid uptake of its newest CF medicine  Symdeko  in the United States CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex s first quarter revenues consisted of sales from its CF products such as Kalydeco  Orkambi and Symdeko and collaborative and royalty revenues of  1 2 million Total CF product revenues were  857 0 million in the quarter  up 34 4  year over year  mainly driven by the rapid uptake of Symdeko in the United States and the recent launch of Symkevi in Germany However  CF product revenues declined sequentially in the first quarter hurt by a channel inventory build that occurred at the end of 2018 and higher gross to net adjustments this quarter Symdeko generated sales of  320 3 million in the reported quarter  reflecting an increase of 8 8  sequentially as new patients initiated treatment  Symdeko revenues included  32 million of Symkevi revenues from ex U S  markets primarily from Germany  On the call  the company said that Symkevi launch is off to a strong start in Germany The company said that Symdeko demand came from all eligible groups of patients including treatment na ve F508del homozygous patients  those who have discontinued Orkambi treatment and also patients switching from Orkambi or Kalydeco to Symdeko In 2019  the company expects additional patients to initiate treatment with Symdeko in the United States and EU  including younger patients in the United States  which should boost revenues from the drug Kalydeco sales declined 2 4  to  244 million year over year due to patient switching to Symdeko Orkambi sales decreased 17 2  year over year to  293 million due to a switch in patient base to Symdeko from Orkambi as patients discontinued Orkambi to start treatment with Symdeko  which partially offset the increase in eligible patient population due to label expansion approvals Costs RiseAdjusted operating income rose 81  to  377 million in the quarter driven by higher revenues and disciplined spending Adjusted research and development  R D  expenses increased 5 1  to  273 2 million in the first quarter due to expansion of Vertex s pipeline in CF and other new disease areas Adjusted selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses escalated 14 8  to  114 3 million in the reported quarter due to investments made in supporting CF patients  treatment  globally 2019 Revenue GuidanceVertex maintained its 2019 outlook for CF product sales and combined operating costs The company expects total full year revenues for CF products to be in the range of  3 45  3 55 billion  indicating year over year growth of approximately 15   The full year impact of Symdeko s launch  ex US reimbursement agreements and label expansions of the CF drugs are expected to drive CF product revenue growth in 2019 Combined adjusted research and development  R D  plus selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses in 2019 are anticipated in the range of  1 65  1 70 billion  Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be between 21  and 22  The increase in operating expense was due to estimated costs related to the development and the potential launch of triple combinations regimen and expansion of early stage non CF pipeline

120303,341818,VRTX,Shares in Vertex Pharma surge after FDA backs its cystic fibrosis drug,news,"Investing com    Shares in Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ VRTX  surged more than 7  in after hours trading after an FDA advisory committee voted 12 to 1 on Tuesday to recommend preliminary approval of its Cystic Fibrosis drug Orkambi 
If approved  Orkambi will be the first and only drug on the market to treat patients above the age of 12  who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene  Cystic fibrosis is caused by missing or defective proteins in a cell that result from mutations in the CFTR gene  Nationwide  there are roughly 8 500 people in the U S  over the age of 12 with two copies of the mutation 
Orkambi combines two other Vertex drugs  Ivacaftor  which is also known as Kalydeco and Lumacaftor  a CFTR corrector  Lumacaftor is designed to correct the defect in the protein  while Ivacaftor can enhance its functioning potential  according to a Vertex statement 
 Today s positive recommendation brings the cystic fibrosis community one step closer to potential approval of the first medicine to treat the underlying cause of this disease for many more people   Dr  Jeffrey Chodakewitz  Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex said in a statement   We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA and other regulatory agencies throughout the world to make Orkambi available to eligible patients as soon as possible  
The FDA is expected to make a final decision on approval of Orkambi by early July

120304,341819,VRTX,How DNA sequencing is transforming the hunt for new drugs,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO  Reuters    Drug manufacturers have begun amassing enormous troves of human DNA in hopes of significantly shortening the time it takes to identify new drug candidates  a move some say is transforming the development of medicines  The efforts will help researchers identify rare genetic mutations by scanning large databases of volunteers who agree to have their DNA sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records   It is made possible by the dramatically lower cost of genetic sequencing   it took government funded scientists  3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003  As of last year  the cost was closer to  1 500 per genome  down from  20 000 five years ago  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  which signed a deal with Pennsylvania s Geisinger Health System in January 2014 to sequence partial genomes of some 250 000 volunteers  is already claiming discoveries based on the new approach  Company executives told Reuters they have used data from the first 35 000 volunteers to confirm the promise of 250 genes on a list of targets for drugs aimed at common medical conditions  including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides  Regeneron says it has also identified  several dozen  new gene targets  including a novel gene that plays a role in obesity   Pfizer Inc  Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc are working on similar projects that use DNA and patient health data to find new drug targets or predict the effects of drugs   Their investments have been inspired by early successes in cancer with drugs such as Pfizer s lung cancer treatment Xalkori  which was approved in 2011 and targets mutations in tumors driving the disease  More recently  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  has changed the treatment of cystic fibrosis with Kalydeco  which targets the disease s underlying genetic cause   All of a sudden  it all opened up   as companies recognize the potential for drugs targeting genetic glitches  Dr  Eric Topol  a genomics expert at the Scripps Translational Science Institute   It s starting to really become a new preferred model for drug development   In the past  discovering such genes was a painstaking process  often involving years of research into isolated populations  In 1991  for example  researchers discovered a rare mutation in a gene called Angptl3 that caused very low levels of artery clogging cholesterol and triglycerides among families in the remote Italian village of Campodimele  It took nearly two more decades and several groups of scientists to fully understand the potential cardiovascular benefits linked to mutations in that gene   Since last autumn  the Regeneron Genetics Center has sequenced the DNA of more than 35 000 Geisinger patients and is on track to sequence 100 000 by year end  Already  the company has identified 100 people carrying similar cholesterol affecting mutations to those first observed in Campodimele and elsewhere   You no longer have to find that one rare family in Italy  because it s just in the database   said Dr  George Yancopoulos  chief scientific officer of Regeneron       PRECISION MEDICINE    Identifying target genes is just a first step  though  and does not guarantee that a drug can be developed on a genetic lead  or that it will ultimately be safe and effective enough to be used  Experts also differ on approach  Regeneron is sequencing exomes  the protein making genes that comprise 1 to 2 percent of the genome  a search that costs roughly  700 per person  Others favor looking at the whole genome  which costs the  1 500 per person  Craig Venter  one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome  believes the whole genome approach will be more meaningful over time   I d rather have a gold mine with a deep vein of gold and modern industrial equipment to mine it rather than sitting there with a pan in a stream looking for gold   he said   Both will find gold  It s a question of how much you find   Even so  the early returns from new  genomic  medicines have attracted attention from the White House  In January  President Barack Obama said he would seek  130 million from Congress to gather genetic data from 1 million volunteers as part of a  precision medicine  initiative  Regeneron is lobbying for the Geisinger database to become a cornerstone of that effort  and proposes creating a consortium of drugmakers to fund it  In return  Yancopoulos said  the company hopes to recoup some of its investment  Dr  Francis Collins  director of the National Institutes of Health  which is in charge of the precision medicine project  identified Regeneron among a short list of potential contributors to the 1 million strong DNA study  Others on the list include Kaiser Permanente  Mayo Clinic  and the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin  A decision is expected by early fall  For drug companies  the lure of a big payoff is strong  Regeneron and its partner Sanofi  PARIS SASY  are expected to soon win regulatory approval for a cholesterol lowering drug that works by blocking the PCSK9 gene  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Pfizer have developed similar treatments  Individuals born with non functioning versions of PCSK9 have very low cholesterol  The new drugs mimic that effect and are considered a poster child for treatments that take advantage of glitches in the genome that prove beneficial to the rare individuals who carry them  Wall Street analysts project Regeneron Sanofi s PCSK9 drug will generate revenues of  4 4 billion by 2019       MINING THE DATA  Amgen bolstered its search for gene targets by buying Decode Genetics in late 2012 for  415 million  giving it a database of complete genetic sequences of 2 636 Icelanders  The community shares a relatively homogenous genetic profile due to its geographic isolation  allowing researchers to identify gene variations more easily  In March  Amgen reported the discovery of a new mutation that increases the risk of Alzheimer s and confirmed the role of two mutations involved in diabetes and atrial fibrillation  This past January  Roche s Genentech unit tapped Venter s Human Longevity Inc for a large sequencing project   Genetic testing company 23andMe announced deals this year with Genentech and Pfizer  Genentech will have access to 3 000 individuals in 23andMe s community of Parkinson s patients  and Pfizer will expand an existing collaboration with the company to study the genetics of lupus  That same month  Biogen formed a  30 million research alliance to support the formation of a sequencing center at Columbia University   All of the companies are feeling like   Oh my gosh  We have to do something substantial in genomics   yesterday    said Dr  David Goldstein  director of Columbia s Institute for Genomic Medicine  At the heart of Regeneron s model is finding rare mutations that disable normal gene function  So far  it has identified people with at least one such  loss of function  gene that correlates with nearly all 250 genes on the company s list of drug targets   That includes essentially every gene previously linked to triglyceride regulation and several novel candidates  Yancopoulos said  They have done the same for cholesterol and coronary artery disease  Regeneron has also partnered with academic centers studying families with extreme genetic disorders  collaborations that already have led to the discovery of a couple of dozen new candidate genes  said Dr  Aris Baras  who runs Regeneron s genetics center  In one case  they are using the Geisinger database to study a rare gene they believe causes severe obesity in young children  The team has found milder mutations in the overall population that may cause an average 10 pound weight gain in adults  That would validate the role that such genes play in regulating body weight and suggests that   if you had a drug it could have a profound effect   Yancopoulos said

120321,341836,VRTX,AbbVie board ditches planned  55 billion Shire acquisition,news,"By Ben Hirschler  LONDON  Reuters    U S  drugmaker AbbVie  N ABBV  has pulled the plug on its plan to buy Dublin based Shire  L SHP   recommending shareholders vote against the proposed  55 billion takeover following new U S  tax rules   Shire stands to be paid a break up fee of about  1 64 billion  assuming AbbVie s shareholders follow the advice and reject the transaction   The reversal    which had been anticipated after Chicago based AbbVie said it was reconsidering the deal    hands a major scalp to the U S  Treasury  which has been fighting to make tax avoiding acquisitions more difficult   That has hit the value of other potential takeover targets in Europe and cast a shadow over transactions that have yet to be completed   But AbbVie s retreat could spark fresh deal making by Shire  which has a strong track record of acquisitions to fuel its fast growing business and may now look around to buy other companies  with its firepower boosted by the break up fee   The U S  government s tax proposals are designed to make it harder for American firms to shift their tax bases out of the country and into lower cost jurisdictions in Europe    The agreed upon valuation is no longer supported as a result of the changes to the tax rules and we did not believe it was in the best interests of our stockholders to proceed   AbbVie s chief executive Richard Gonzalez said in a statement   AbbVie s move for Shire  a leader in drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases  was announced in July amid a spate of deals in the pharmaceutical sector   Gonzalez said at the time that the acquisition  involving the creation of a new U S  listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain  was not just about tax   But the firm said on Thursday that the changes in the U S  tax regime  eliminated certain of the financial benefits of the transaction  most notably the ability to access current and future global cash flows in a tax efficient manner as originally contemplated in the transaction  This fundamentally changed the implied value of Shire to AbbVie in a significant manner    Shire said it was considering the current situation and would make a further announcement in due course   News on Wednesday that AbbVie was cooling to the transaction hammered shares in Shire  sending them down 22 percent to where they were before the deal talks emerged in June  and the shares were down a further 12 percent at 3 525 pence by 1145 GMT   AbbVie s charge of heart has been a bombshell for some of the world s top hedge funds  which have lost out heavily on the Shire stock they were holding   SHAREHOLDER MEETING  AbbVie said the withdrawal of its recommendation alone would not cause a lapse in the offer for Shire and it must convene a shareholder meeting before Dec  14 to vote on the deal   A spate of so called tax inversion merger deals  particularly in healthcare  prompted the U S  move to change tax regulations  including placing a ban on loans that allow U S  firms to access foreign cash without paying U S  tax   AbbVie said the breadth and scope of the changes  introduced an unacceptable level of uncertainty to the transaction    The company also took a swipe at the  unilateral  nature of the U S  government s move and complained about  the unexpected nature of the exercise of administrative authority to impact longstanding tax principles    AbbVie s second thoughts on the deal have surprised Shire investors  coming just weeks after Gonzalez  in the wake of the Treasury proposals  told employees of both companies he was  more energized than ever  about the transaction   Aside from the tax benefits  buying Shire offered AbbVie a way to reduce reliance on arthritis treatment Humira  the world s top selling medicine  whose  13 billion in annual sales accounts for more than 60 percent of company revenue   The episode has fueled doubts about whether Pfizer  N PFE  will ever make another run at AstraZeneca  L AZN   after abandoning a  118 billion bid in May  AstraZeneca shares fell 2 5 percent on Thursday  after losing ground on Wednesday   Shares in Britain s Smith   Nephew  L SN  and Switzerland s Actelion  VX ATLN   also tipped as inversion targets  both fell a further 3 percent   Tax experts say inversions are still possible but the U S  action has cut their appeal  suggesting they will only make sense if there is a compelling strategic fit between two firms   Two other U S  drugmakers  Salix Pharmaceuticals  O SLXP  and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals  O AUXL   have already called off smaller inversion deals this month   SHIRE S OWN DEAL MAKING  Analysts are now looking ahead to Shire s strategy as an independent company once again and its own potential for making acquisitions    or else becoming a target for another company   Before the AbbVie agreement  Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov had made clear he was interested in buying assets and Jefferies analysts said a standalone Shire could now be poised to aggressively target acquisitions   
Shire itself might also be a target for other pharmaceutical companies less driven by tax considerations  Allergan  N AGN   for example  which is fighting a bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  O VRTX   has approached Shire in the past     Additional reporting by Abhiram Nandakumar and Aurindom Mukherjee in Bangalore  Editing by Greg Mahlich  Pravin Char and Clara Ferreira Marques ",2014-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/abbvie-board-turns-against-$55-billion-shire-acquisition-313184,313184

For the last reported quarter  Vertex came out with earnings of  1 30 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 per share  representing a surprise of 23 81   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 09 per share  delivering a surprise of 9  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Vertex  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Vertex has an Earnings ESP of  3 48  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 30  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-vertex-vrtx-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200412494,200412494

120329,341844,VRTX,CELG Vs  VRTX  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector might want to consider either Celgene  CELG  or Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CELG currently has a forward P E ratio of 8 89  while VRTX has a forward P E of 40 90  We also note that CELG has a PEG ratio of 0 40  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  VRTX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 82 
Another notable valuation metric for CELG is its P B ratio of 8 25  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  VRTX has a P B of 9 23 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CELG s Value grade of B and VRTX s Value grade of D 
Both CELG and VRTX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that CELG is the superior value option right now ",2019-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/celg-vs-vrtx-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200418765,200418765

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 66 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this environmental services company would post a loss of  0 02 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 03  delivering a surprise of  50

Vertex Energy  which belongs to the Zacks Pollution Control industry  posted revenues of  39 32 million for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 24   This compares to year ago revenues of  41 37 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Vertex Energy shares have added about 60 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 1  
What s Next for Vertex Energy 
While Vertex Energy has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Vertex Energy was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

120354,341869,VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals  VRTX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 99 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29  
Revenues are expected to be  846 45 million  up 32 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 97  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex 
For Vertex  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 62  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vertex would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 30  delivering a surprise of  23 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Vertex doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vertex-pharmaceuticals-vrtx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200409418,200409418

propel companies to slash prices of key drugs  Incidentally  issues like government scrutiny of high prices  pricing and competitive pressure  sluggish sales of some of the most high profile older

reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy ranked Nike s shares have gained  26 5  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry  which gained  19 9  over the same period  driven by a strong earnings trend stemming from the solid execution of Consumer Direct Offense  Nike has delivered positive earnings surprise for over three years now  with second quarter fiscal 2019 marking 26th straight quarter of earnings beat Moreover  sales topped estimates for the seventh straight quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on direct to customer are the key drivers  Growth at international and Nike Direct businesses alongside momentum in North America also aided fiscal second quarter results Continued strength in Nike Digital is driving the top line  However  higher SG A expenses due to increased demand creation expense and operating overheads are likely to remain a drag  Further  the unfavorable currency environment due to the global trade and geopolitical dynamics is likely to weigh on the company s sales  You can   Shares of 3M have lost  5  in the past three months  underperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has gained  8 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks 3M stands to gain from efforts to innovate products  solid demand and portfolio restructuring moves  Its acquisition of the technology business of M Modal is likely to strengthen the Health Information Systems business in the months ahead In the fourth quarter of 2018  the company s earnings and revenues surpassed estimates  However  on a year over year basis  net sales declined 0 6  due to the impact of divestiture and forex woes For 2019  the company lowered its earnings projection and net sales growth guidance  Foreign currency translation is predicted to adversely influence sales by 1   In addition  inflation in prices of major inputs and rising competitive pressures pose threats to near term profitability  Shares also look comparatively overvalued  You can   Vertex s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past year   19 2  vs   15 9    Vertex beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  The Zacks analyst likes Vertex s dominance in the CF market  A significant increase in the eligible patient population for its CF drugs is driving sales growth Vertex s third CF medicine  Symdeko  in a very short time  became the primary driver of the significant growth in CF revenues in 2018  Vertex s CF pipeline is also accelerating rapidly  Studies on Vertex s triple combination CF regimens are moving fast  The CF triple pill regimes are crucial for long term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90  of CF patients Meanwhile  Vertex s non CF pipeline  though early stage  looks interesting  However  competitive pressure is rising in the CF market with many other companies developing triple combo CF drugs  Also  Vertex s dependence on just the CF franchise for growth is a concern  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are

120389,341904,VRTX,Why Is Vertex  VRTX  Down 0 7  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   Shares have lost about 0 7  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Vertex due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Vertex Q4 Earnings Beat on Solid CF Products SalesVertex reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of  1 30  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05  Moreover  the figure came ahead of the year ago earnings of 61 cents driven by higher revenues Vertex s revenues logged  870 1 million in the fourth quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  822 million  The company s sales surged 33 5  year over year  driven by strong CF product sales CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex s fourth quarter revenues consisted of sales from its CF products such as Kalydeco  Orkambi and Symdeko and collaborative and royalty revenues of  1 9 million Total CF product revenues were  868 2 million in the quarter  up 39 8  year over year  mainly driven by the rapid uptake of Symdeko in the United States Kalydeco sales rose 1 2  to  259 million due to increase in number of eligible patient population driven by continued label expansions Orkambi sales declined 13 7  year over year to  315 million due to a switch in patient base to Symdeko from Orkambi as patients are discontinuing Orkambi to start treatment with Symdeko Symdeko generated sales of  294 in the reported quarter  reflecting an increase of 15 3  sequentially as new patients initiated treatment  The company said that Symdeko demand came from all eligible groups of patients including the treatment na ve F508del homozygous patients  those who have discontinued Orkambi treatment and also patients switching from Orkambi or Kalydeco to Symdeko Costs RiseAdjusted research and development  R D  expenses increased 10 4  to  275 million in the fourth quarter  primarily due to the advancement of the company s portfolio of triple combination regimens for CF Adjusted selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses escalated 17 9  to  125 million in the reported quarter due to investments made in supporting CF patients  treatment  globally 2018 ResultsAdjusted earnings per share rose 109  to  4 08 per share in 2018  Total revenues rose 22 5  to  3 05 billion in 2018 Full year 2018 CF product revenues of  3 04 billion rose 40  2019 Revenue GuidanceVertex provided 2019 outlook for CF products and combined operating costs The company expects total full year revenues for CF products to be in the range of  3 45  3 55 billion  indicating year over year growth of approximately 15   The full year impact of Symdeko s launch  ex US reimbursement agreements and label expansions of the CF drugs are expected to drive CF product revenue growth in 2019 However  a channel inventory build of approximately  10 million that occurred at the end of 2018 is expected to hurt first quarter revenues  First quarter CF product revenues could therefore be sequentially lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 as potential growth from new patients is expected to be offset by channel inventory dynamics Combined adjusted research and development  R D  plus selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses in 2019 are anticipated in the range of  1 65  1 70 billion The increase in operating expense was due to estimated costs related to the development and the potential launch of triple combinations regimen and expansion of early stage non CF pipeline 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
At this time  Vertex has a strong Growth Score of A  a grade with the same score on the momentum front  However  the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side  putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Vertex has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-03-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-vertex-vrtx-down-07-since-last-earnings-report-200395472,200395472
120414,341929,VRTX,Will Gilead  GILD  Q4 Earnings Disappoint On Weak HCV Sales ,opinion,"Biotech major Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and full year results on Feb 4  after the market closes 
Gilead has a decent track record  with the company s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four quarters  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat expectations by 10 8   Overall  the company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 6 99  
Gilead s stock has declined 8 8  in the last six months  against the  s decline of 14 1  

 
Factors in Play
Along with third quarter results  Gilead updated its annual guidance  Gilead expects net product sales of  20 8  21 3 billion in 2018 compared with the earlier estimate of  20  21 billion  Adjusted R D and adjusted SG A expenses are projected to be  3 4  3 6 billion and  3 4  3 6 billion  respectively  Adjusted product gross margin is expected to be 85 87  
While Gilead s third quarter results beat estimates  the year over year decline was disappointing as the magnitude of decline in hepatitis C virus  HCV  sales continues to deepen 
The franchise suffered a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts  HCV revenues are projected to decline further and will constitute a smaller portion of the top line  Gilead s HCV drug  Harvoni has been approved in China 
Nevertheless  the HIV franchise is expected to maintain momentum  Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide   TAF   based products   Genvoya  Descovy and Odefsey  We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter  Genvoya has been listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines  
Truvada  for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting  continued the momentum with an estimated 193 000 patients using the drug by the end of the third quarter  The China National Drug Administration has approved Genvoya for the treatment of HIV 1 infection  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is  1 2 billion 
HIV is one of the primary areas of focus for Gilead and the company is working to bringnew HIV treatments to market to further boost sales of the franchise  The company received a major boost when the FDA approved its once daily single tablet regimen   STR    Biktarvy  bictegravir 50mg emtricitabine 200mg tenofovir alafenamide 25mg  BIC FTC TAF  for HIV 1 infection  
The approval in Europe has boosted sales further  Gilead currently expects Biktarvy to overtake Genvoya as the most successful launch in HIV history  In March  Biktarvy was added as one of the recommended initial regimens to the U S  DHHS guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV 
In December 2018  the board of directors appointed Daniel O Day as the company s chairman and CEO 
Apart from the regular top and bottom line numbers  we expect investors to focus on pipeline updates  Gilead intends to foray into the non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and inflammation market with late stage candidates  selonsertib and filgotinib  respectively  Both the candidates are being evaluated in late stage studies and a tentative approval will diversify Gilead s portfolio  
Earlier this month  Gilead announced that it entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with South Korea based Yuhan Corporation to co develop novel therapeutic candidates for the treatment of patients suffering from advanced fibrosis due to NASH  In December 2018  Gilead entered into a deal with Agenus   NASDAQ AGEN   to develop and commercialize up to five immuno oncology  I O  therapies 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Gilead will beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Gilead is  4 72    The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 74  while the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at  1 65  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which when combined with a negative ESP indicates very low chances of an earnings beat  As it is  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Gilead Sciences  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Stocks to Consider
Here are some health care stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

Vertex shares have added about 13 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8 7  
What s Next for Vertex 
While Vertex has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Vertex was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 on  841 61 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 18 on  3 57 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

120438,341953,VRTX,CELG Or VRTX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Celgene  CELG  and Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Celgene is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CELG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CELG currently has a forward P E ratio of 8 29  while VRTX has a forward P E of 46 42  We also note that CELG has a PEG ratio of 0 41  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  VRTX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 18 
Another notable valuation metric for CELG is its P B ratio of 12 37  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  VRTX has a P B of 16 89 
These metrics  and several others  help CELG earn a Value grade of A  while VRTX has been given a Value grade of D 
CELG stands above VRTX thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that CELG is the superior value option right now ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/celg-or-vrtx-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200378329,200378329
120439,341954,VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals  VRTX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  72 1  
Revenues are expected to be  822 45 million  up 26 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex 
For Vertex  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Vertex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vertex would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  9  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

120450,341965,VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals  VRTX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  72 1  
Revenues are expected to be  818 77 million  up 25 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex 
For Vertex  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Vertex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Vertex would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  9  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

120481,341996,VRTX,Why Vertex  VRTX  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19 78  
For the last reported quarter  Vertex came out with earnings of  1 09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 per share  representing a surprise of 9   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 72 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 94 per share  delivering a surprise of 30 56  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Vertex  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Vertex currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 19   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

120519,342034,VRTX,Vertex  VRTX  Gets Positive CHMP Opinion For Orkambi In Kids,opinion,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX   announced that the European Medicines Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  adopted a positive opinion recommending approval for expanded use of Orkambi  The opinion is given for Orkambi  lumacaftor ivacaftor  to treat children with cystic fibrosis  CF  aged two to five years who have two copies of the F508del mutation 
Approximately 1 500 people in Europe in this age group suffer from this most common form of CF disease  thus making Orkambi eligible to treat expanded patient populations 
Orkambi is already approved in the U S  and Europe for the treatment of CF in patients aged six or older who have two copies of the F508del mutation  It was approved in the United States for the two to five years age group in August 
The CHMP opinion was based on data from a phase III open label safety study in 60 patients that showed treatment with Orkambi to be generally well tolerated for 24 weeks  with a safety profile similar to that in patients aged 6 years or older 
The stock has gained 10 2  so far this year  against the 18  decline registered by the  

 
Sales of Orkambi were down 16 1  year over year in the third quarter of 2018 to  282 million due to a switch in patient base to Vertex s third and newest CF medicine  Symdeko from Orkambi  which targets the same population  Orkambi revenues are expected to be hurt by this switch during the third quarter of 2018 
Other than Orkambi and Symdeko  Vertex also has Kalydeco  ivacaftor  in its CF product portfolio  We remind investors that  Symdeko is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor  which was launched in the United States in February 2018 for treating CF patients  The drug has shown strong uptake so far 
 The company is developing many new combination regimens with CFTR modulators  The CF correctors could bring in multi billion dollar sales for Vertex Vertex is evaluating two next generation CFTR correctors  VX 659 and VX 445  in phase III studies as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor  Vertex is evaluating both the combinations in two separate studies for F508del Min and F508del homozygous patients 
Both AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   and Galapagos NV s   NASDAQ GLPG   were jointly developing CF product candidates  which included a triple regimen combination  However  last month  AbbVie announced that it is taking full commercial and development responsibility of all clinical pre clinical programs in cystic fibrosis products  which were originally discovered and developed in partnership with Galapagos 
AbbVie will now continue the development of the triple combination therapy for CF  Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ CRBP   is developing a CF candidate  lenabasum  in a mid stage study Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  Price

120523,342038,VRTX,5 Drug Biotech Stocks With Promise To Sustain Bull Run In 2019,opinion,The performance of the drug biotech space has been mixed so far this year  The Zacks  industry  comprising some of the world s biggest drugmakers  has gained 8 3  against the S P 500 Composite s decrease of 0 9  However  the riskier Zacks  industry  which includes large as well as small biotech companies  has underperformed the S P 500 Composite  The biotech sector has declined 17 8   wider than the S P 500 Composite s fall of 0 9   probably due to some pipeline setbacks faced by the industry Large Cap Pharma and Biomed Genetics Versus S P 500Notably  the s Medical Biomedical and Genetics industry includes large and small biotech companies  The larger ones  namely Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Vertex   NASDAQ VRTX    Regeneron  Biogen have done relatively well this year  Most of them have handily outperformed the Medical Biomedical and Genetics industry  The chart below shows the scenario  We believe that strong quarterly results along with increases in full year sales and earnings guidance  new product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line extensions  strong clinical study results and frequent FDA approvals have helped these big drug biotech giants consistently do well this year despite broader macro issues and the industry s internal challenges  Moreover  the sector is likely to perform well even if the global economy slows down next year  This is because it is a defensive growth space  almost insulated from broader macroeconomic factors  Importantly  merger and acquisition activity are gaining momentum with the tax reform in place  Notably  the big drug biotech companies face their share of headwinds like government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  generic competition for blockbuster treatments  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and major pipeline setbacks  Meanwhile  the drug pricing issue will remain a headline risk for this sector Nonetheless  we believe  pipeline success  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A and collaboration activity and appropriate utilization of cash should keep these stocksafloat in 2019 Here we have highlighted five stocks that did well in 2018  outperforming the S P 500 Composite indexand are expected to continue with the positive trend next year  All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year  You can see  A chart showing the year to date share price movement of all five stocks compared with the S P 500 Composite is given below Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY  Shares of Lilly have surged 36  this year so far  Lilly s earnings estimates have inched up 1  for 2019 over the past 90 days Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance  Lartruvo and Verzenioare driving sales growth  a trend expected to continue in 2019   The company is also on a strong footing in terms of its pipeline with several positive late stage data readouts this year along with various regulatory approvals  A key regulatory success for Lilly was the FDA approval of Emgality galcanezumab  a calcitonin gene related peptide  CGRP  antibody for migraine prevention  which could emerge as a significant contributor to sales growth in 2019 and thereafter Several key regulatory and pipeline events are expected in 2019  Any positive outcome will push up the share price further Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK  Merck s earnings estimates have moved 1 9  north for 2019 over the past 90 days  The stock has soared 40 3  year to date Strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda  aided the company s strong performance this year  Within a very short span  Keytruda has become Merck s largest product  It is already approved for use in 12 indications across eight different tumor types in the United States  In fact  the Keytruda development program is also progressing rapidly  Several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States and Europe are due in 2019  which  if approved  can further boost sales Key recent nods for Merck include Steglatro and its fixed dose combinations for type II diabetes  two new HIV drugs   Pifeltro and Delstrigo   containing doravirine and Prevymis  letermovir  for cytomegalovirus  CVM  infection  Merck also gained several label expansion approvals for Keytruda and another cancer drug  Lynparza  which it markets in partnership with AstraZeneca  AZN  All these new drugs and line extension approvals can drive the company s pharmaceuticals sales in 2019 Merck s animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for the company Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ  Shares of J J s have risen 5 8  so far this year  Its earnings estimates for 2019 have moved 0 5  up in the past 90 days J J s Pharma segment is performing better than the market in 2018 so far despite the impact of biosimilars on sales of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis medicine  Remicade  Also  the Medical Devices and Consumer units are seeing improving organic growth trends J J has also raised its full year organic sales growth outlook thrice this year  Though quite a few key products in J J s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  we believe that new products in all segments  successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top line improvement in 2019  J J enjoys a robust multi year pipeline of new drugs and line extensions  Share buybacks and restructuring initiatives should provide bottom line support Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB  Shares of Biogen have increased 0 5  year to date  Its earnings estimates have been revised 1 6  upward for 2019 over the past 90 days Though Biogen has a strong position in the multiple sclerosis  MS  market  its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke etc  is encouraging  Spinraza  approved for spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  in 2016  has performed beyond expectations so far  witnessing a strong patient uptake in the United States and internationally  We expect Spinraza sales to remain solid in 2019  Meanwhile  Biogen has a sturdy portfolio of biosimilar drugs  which will continue to aid its top line  Biogen is optimistic that its biosimilars business has the opportunity to potentially double over the next couple of years We are encouraged by Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline with several having transformative potential  Multiple data readouts are anticipated next year Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY  Shares of Roche have climbed 1  this year so far  Its earnings estimates have been raised 2 6  for 2019 over the past 90 days Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market  In particular  the company dominates the breast cancer space with steep demand for its HER2 franchise drugs  The HER2 franchise includes drugs like Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise  Roche s oncology portfolio boasts drugs like Avastin and Tarceva for indications like lung cancer  Imuno oncology is another key focus area for Roche with the company currently having multiple candidates under development  Its immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq  has been a consistent performer as several label expansion studies on the drug are underway Roche is actively seeking acquisitions to strengthen its portfolio further  The company also has a robust pipeline and approval of new drugs will lead to growth In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 top tickers to buy and hold for the entirety of 2019 These 10 are painstakingly handpicked from over

Thousands of scientists are currently researching ways to use this same mechanism to alter human DNA but  cutting out  defective portions of the sequence and replacing them with the correct code   As many as 6 000 diseases are caused by genetic factors  including Alzheimer s  hemophilia  sickle cell disease  ALS and many cancers   The ability to identify and fix faulty genes could make many of these diseases effectively curable 
Research has delivered several methods to use CRISPR to target the genetic defects that cause specific diseases  but the most promising at this point uses an enzyme called Cas9 to deliver CRISPR to affected cells   Three companies currently have plans to do studies this year on human subjects using CRISPR Cas9 to address disease 
 has been one of the best performing stocks in the U S  in 2018  up nearly 200  YTD  Though already on the radar of traders and analysts  the stock got additional boosts from a 60 Minutes piece on the technology in April and favorable response to the company s presentation at a Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference last week 
CRSP is about to begin trials of CRISPR Cas9 in the treatment of two related genetic blood disorders in humans  B thalassemia and Sickle Cells Disease   The  approach  internally named CTX001  has had a Clinical Trial Application  CTA  granted for B thalassemia study in Europe and has an Investigational New Drug  IND  application pending for study on Sickle Cell Disease in the U S 
Though CRSP s potential therapies are still in the developmental stages and the company has yet to turn a profit  promising results in animal trials and joint ventures with Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   and Casebia Therapeutics have analysts turning more bullish on the potential of these technologies to one day turn into potential blockbuster drugs   CRSP is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Also focused on genetic therapies using the CRISPR Cas9 system   recently announced that its first cell therapy target will be acute myeloid leukemia and other potential hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors 
Intellia has a diversified strategy toward selecting disease targets using various types of genetic edits and using both in vivo and ex vivo delivery  insulating the company from the possibility of disappointing results in specific categories Intellia has partnered with  for in vivo delivery  specifically for liver disease and Novartis    for ex vivo delivery to treat various cancers 
Three analyst upward revisions in the past 30 days for both quarterly and 2018 earnings suggest increasing optimism about the future of NTLA s CRISPR therapies and the shares are up 34  in 2018  versus a return of  10  for the genetic therapies industry as a whole   NTLA is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Cambridge  MA based  is a discovery phase company applying CRISPR Csa9 genetic therapies to the treatment of Leber Congenital Amaurosis   a degenerative and debilitating eye disease   
Results from non human primate trials were encouraging  with test subject tolerating the injected treatment and with immunity to bacterial infections not impacting the pharmacological activities of the drug    Immuno response destroying the active properties of the drugs is sometimes a concern with CRISPR Cas9 therapies  
Editas also has drugs in the pipeline to treat cancer  muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis 
The company is bolstered by a strong balance sheet with  329 million in cash and equivalents and has thus far retained commercial rights to all but one of it s pipeline programs  EDIT is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

120607,342122,VRTX,Biotech Stock Round Up  Celgene Suffers Setback  Gilead Teams Up With Sangamo,opinion,"Key highlights of the week include FDA s refusal to file letter for Celgene Corp  s   NASDAQ CELG   ozanimod  Gilead Sciences  Inc  s   NASDAQ GILD   collaboration with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc  for using the latter s technology and positive CHMP opinion for Amgen Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   Xgeva  Incyte Corp    NASDAQ INCY   beat on revenues on strong Jakafi sales in fourth quarter 2017 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
FDA Refuses Ozanimod NDA  Following the announcement of the receipt of a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application   NDA   for multiple sclerosis candidate ozanimod  shares of Celgene are down in pre market trading  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis 
However  the FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were inadequate to allow a complete review  Hence  Celgene will request a Type A meeting with the FDA to ascertain the additional information needed for resubmission of the NDA 
The news comes as a great disappointment for investors as Celgene is taking desperate attempts to bolster its portfolio and reduce overdependence on lead drug  Revlimid  The company recently obtained antitrust clearance for its impending Juno acquisition  Celgene is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  You can see  
Gilead Collaborates with Sangamo  Gilead s Kite has entered into a collaboration agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc  Per the agreement  Kite will use Sangamo s ZFN technology to modify genes to develop next generation cell therapies for autologous and allogeneic use in oncology  In lieu  Sangamo will receive an upfront payment of  150 million and up to  3 01 billion in potential milestone payments 
Sangamo is also entitled to receive tiered royalties on sales of the potential future products resulting from the collaboration  On the other hand  Kite will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization of products under the collaboration  Sangamo shares skyrocketed to a high of  25 40 on the news of the collaboration as investors had lots to cheer for given Gilead s expertise in the biotech field 
CHMP Positive on Amgen s Xgeva Label Expansion  The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   of the European Medicines Agency has given a positive opinion to expand the current indication for Amgen s Xgeva to include skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma  Given the positive results of the phase III study   482  the candidate should get approval for the aforementioned indication 
The study results showed Xgeva successfully met the primary endpoint  demonstrating non inferiority to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first on study skeletal related event in patients with multiple myeloma  The FDA already approved the company s Supplemental Biologics License Application for XGEVA to expand the currently approved indication for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma in January 2018 
Vertex Initiates Phase III Triple Combination Study for CF  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX    a leader in cystic fibrosis   CF   market  announced the initiation of a phase III study  VX 659  tezacaftor and Kalydeco as an investigational triple combination regimen for patients suffering from CF who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation  The study is being conducted to support the submission of a NDA in the United States using data from the four week primary efficacy endpoint together with safety data through 12 weeks of treatment 
Earlier in the month  the FDA approved Symdeko for the treatment of the underlying cause of CF in patients aged 12 or older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene or who have at least one mutation that is responsive to tezacaftor ivacaftor

120608,342123,VRTX,Why Sarepta  SRPT  Jumped And We Sold,opinion,"Monday morning s news from Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  pushed shares to a 16 year high above  78 
The biotech company will file a new drug application  NDA  with the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year seeking accelerated approval for its second drug  golodirsen  to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  
What is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy DMD is a rare  inherited  muscle wasting disease that primarily attacks young boys whose genome doesn t properly produce the muscle protein dystrophin  Affected patients die in their mid 20s 
DMD affects 1 in every 3 500 newborn boys and very rarely it also affects girls  approximately 1 in 50 million girls   More boys have Duchenne because the gene that causes it   the dystrophin gene   is located on the X chromosome Sarepta already has commercial success with one DMD drug  EXONDYS 51  This produced 2017 revenues of  155 million  which are expected to nearly double this year for a drug whose average annual treatment cost starts at  300 000  but can be double that for larger boys because it is based on body weight 
Skipping the Genetic ErrorTo give you a better idea how rare and small this treatment population and market are  consider that EXONDYS 51 only treats 13  of the DMD population with that defect  And there are only about 5 000 DMD patients in the US Golodirsen is designed to treat patients whose DMD is caused by an error in the DNA sequence known as exon 53  The drug  administered via monthly infusions  works by  skipping  over that mutation and producing dystrophin  And only about 8 percent of the 5 000 DMD patients carry the exon 53 defect Cambridge  MA based Sarepta said the decision to seek a rapid approval of golodirsen was made after receiving a report last week that summarized a meeting with FDA officials held in February  This could result in accelerated approval in 2019  two years ahead of expectations But Adam Feuerstein  writing for STAT com  the watchdog journal of the life sciences and medicine  spoke with the CEO of Sarepta last night and sheds some interesting light on the situation  Below are some of his key notes in a column this morning   The  FDA  meeting  sought by Sarepta to seek regulatory guidance on golodirsen  could have been treacherous  In attendance on the FDA side were clinical reviewers who vehemently disagreed with the agency s top level decision in late 2016 to approve Exondys 51  Sarepta s first drug to treat DMD Among those once angry FDA officials  Ellis Unger  director of the Office of Drug Evaluation  who had called Exondys 51 an  elegant placebo  that should never have been approved But there was no residual hostility or hard feelings  including from Unger  during the February meeting  just a willingness to re establish a collaborative relationship with the company  said Sarepta CEO Doug Ingram  What we encountered were FDA people who were professional  productive  and helpful  They gave us straightforward  unequivocal guidance   said Ingram  who spoke with STAT on Sunday night   In exchange  I gave them my personal commitment that Sarepta will let golodirsen live or die by the data  We d be fully transparent  and we d be thoughtful about how we communicated with the agency and the public  
This is good news when so much of biotech investing land can be fraught with hazards where the incentives sometimes favor investor wealth over science and medical efficacy and safety 
But Feuerstein further explains the FDA gauntlet that lies ahead for golodirsen  First  the NDA won t be submitted until a long term safety study in animals in completed in Q4 
Second  Sarepta will still need to correlate research proving golodirsen generates dystrophin with real clinical outcomes like improved walking ability for patients Again  you can read the excellent Adam Feuerstein article in the link above Why We Sold SRPT From the Healthcare Innovators PortfolioLast week I wrote about several stocks making new highs in my Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio     bluebird bio  BLUE   Editas Medicine  EDIT   Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW   Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   Align Technology  ALGN   Intellia Therapeutics  NTLA  and Sarepta So why am I selling SRPT today if I just said last week that it wasn t  done yet  As with all public companies involved in complicated medical science  it s a full time job keeping up with the R D  Biotech is arguably the hardest investing field of all  even if you are a trained life sciences professional Since I don t have a degree in molecular biology  I have my homework cut out for me analyzing and keeping up with all the news  data  and FDA rulings And so after today s good news  I decided that we could take profits of 115  out of our Sarepta position and know that we captured the biggest chunk of risk reward available in the past year Here s what I told subscribers this morning   The gains have come quickly here as the company makes advances in clinical trials and  more importantly  with the FDA  But with the recent gains  we have quickly reached the point where lots of good news  and potential good news  is priced in to shares And that means the potential has risen for disappointments or delays to have an outsized affect on shares The bottom line for me is that the short to medium term risks outweigh the long term rewards for a stock that has so quickly realized its potential  Let s bag our  stock that doubled  and get ready for the next one CookerDisclosure  I own shares of ALGN  BLUE  EDIT  NTLA  EW  and VRTX for the  portfolio Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the Healthcare Innovators service ",2018-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-sarepta-srpt-jumped-and-we-sold-200297454,200297454
120613,342128,VRTX,Pharma M A Active This Week  4 Potential Buyout Targets,opinion,The current year began on widespread optimism  predicting a significant increase in drug biotech mergers and acquisitions  M A  activity  mainly buoyed by the new tax law enacted in December 2017 and purchasing newer technologies  The tax reform has lowered the tax rate and provided a low tax window to bring back huge cash stashed overseas  These will certainly improve the cash position of the companies and fuel M A activities amid struggling organic growth With a quarter of the year already gone by  we have seen quite a few billion dollar buyout deals being inked  For instance  Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG  acquired  to add a CAR T therapy to its pipeline for approximately  9 billion  Moreover  the company is in process to complete the  of Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of  1 1 billion  Also  Sanofi  PA SASY  in a bid to strengthen its blood disorder pipeline purchased  for  11 6 billion and even offered to buy Belgian Biotech Company   for  4 8 billion Additionally  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser Group withdrew from discussions  However  Glaxo announced its acquisition of Novartis    NYSE NVS   stake in their healthcare joint venture for  13 billion  Meanwhile late last month  Takeda also  to integrate Dublin based Shire into its portfolio to boost its core therapeutic areas Moreover  this week bore news of a couple of more M A deals  A brief description of the two deals is as follows Novartis to Buy AveXisNovartis inked a deal to acquire the U S  based clinical stage gene therapy company  AveXis  Inc   NASDAQ AVXS    to boost its presence in gene therapy and neuroscience space AveXis  lead gene therapy candidate  AVXS 101  is being developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy   SMA    a neurodegenerative disease  accounting for the highest genetic cause of death in infants  The only approved treatment for SMA is the Biogen s Spinraza Per the agreement  Novartis will close the acquisition in an all cash deal of  8 7 billion  The company proposed a cash tender offer of  218 per share for AveXis  common stock  The deal is expected to culminate in the second half of 2018   Read more   Alexion Wilson DealAlexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   announced that it will consolidate Sweden based Wilson Therapeutics in its portfolio to add a late stage candidate to its pipeline for the treatment of Wilson disease  a rare genetic disorder  The acquisition is line with the company s strategy to diversify its portfolio and lower its dependence on its blockbuster drug  Soliris Alexion has offered 232 Swedish Krona in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics  which translates into a total transaction value of  855 million  The buyout is expected to get wrapped up this quarter   Read more   In this article  we suggest three drug biotech companies as logical acquisition targets this year  The parameters counting for buying a drug biotech stock are the current sales performance of its drugs products  prospects of future sales growth and the quality of the company s pipeline  Takeovers of small cap drug biotech companies are very difficult to forecast and are quite frequent in the said space  Hence  these have been excluded from the discussion Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AGIO  Agios Pharmaceuticals  share price is witnessed to rally this week on speculations that the company might be bought by other big players in the pharma and biotech industry The company received an FDA approval for Idhifa  enasidenib  in August 2017 for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia   AML   with IDH2 mutation  lending a huge boost to its immense commercial potential in the target market  Agios  ivosidenib is under review in the United States as a therapy for relapsed refractory AML with IDH1 mutation  The candidate is also being developed for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies Agios  pipeline also includes a mid stage genetic diseases candidate  A consistent progress with its investigational candidates makes the company one of the most lucrative takeover options for other large players in the drug biotech space at the moment   Read more   Agios carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN  Companies with product pipeline portfolios comprising rare disease drugs are in great demand as there is less competition in the concerned space and the expensive treatments can garner huge profits  BioMarin is one such drug developer with a market cap of around  15 billion BioMarin s key orphan disease drugs  Vimizim and Kuvan  are doing well  backed by strong underlying patient demand trends  Also  another orphan drug Brineura s earlier than expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease is

and Roche might be interested in buying BioMarin BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank  3 Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ VRTX  For Vertex  a consistent expansion in patient population raised revenues quarter to quarter throughout 2017  Moreover  the approval to its third cystic fibrosis   CF   drug  Symdeko  tezacaftor ivacaftor combination   will further drive the company s sales  The company is hopeful that a positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in the ex U S  marketsMeanwhile  the company is focused on triple combination therapies for treating CF  which will further expand its patient population  The market cap of Vertex is more than  40 billion Vertex carries a Zacks Rank  3 Incyte Corporation  NASDAQ INCY  Incyte s strong oncology portfolio makes it an attractive pick for companies  namely Gilead  Amgen and Bristol Myers  Incyte s market cap is also around  15 billion The primary reason why Incyte is ready for buyout is because of the encouraging performance of its two marketed products such as  Jakafi and Iclusig  Jakafi is seeing a strong sales performance  driven by solid patient demand in the approved indications The company is also working on its further label expansion  Meanwhile  Incyte s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat  which is being studied in combination with other

120638,342153,VRTX,Celgene  CELG  Q4 Preview  Will It Beat On Earnings Again ,opinion,"Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Jan 25  before the opening bell 

Celgene s stock has tumbled 9 3  in the last year compared with the  s gain of 7 4  
Celgene has an excellent track record with the company beating earnings estimates in the last four trailing quarters  Last quarter  the company topped estimates by 1 6   Overall  the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 2 5  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter  This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 94   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Revlimid to Drive Growth
Earlier in the month  Celgene released preliminary results for 2017  The company expects earnings per share  EPS  of around  7 44 in 2017  up 25  year over year  Operating margin is anticipated around 58 1   For the fourth quarter  EPS is anticipated to be around  2 00  a 24  increase year over year  Operating margin is expected to be around 55 3   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fourth quarter is  1 94 and  7 37 for 2017 
Total revenues are expected around  3 5 billion in fourth quarter 2017 and  13 0 billion in 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  3 50 billion for the fourth quarter and  13 billion for 2017  Revlimid revenues are expected around  2 2 billion in the fourth quarter and  8 2 billion for 2017 
Revlimid  an oral immunomodulatory drug  is currently approved for several indications including MM  myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma  The drug performed well in the first nine months of 2017 and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap  Market share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug s growth 
Continued momentum in the core indication  label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line  The Zacks Consensus estimate for Revlimid currently stands at  2 2 billion for the fourth quarter 
Pomalyst revenues are expected around  442 million and  1 6 billion in 2017  Pomalyst Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed refractory MM  The drug s label was updated in the United States and the Europe to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and or refractory MM and impaired renal function which should boost sales 
Otezla revenues are expected around  371 million in the fourth quarter and  1 3 billion in 2017  The deep and persistent slowing growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets  especially during the entire third quarter led to weak performance of Otezla in the quarter which should impact sales in the fourth quarter also  Abraxane revenues are around  251 million in the fourth quarter and  992 million in 2017 
Meanwhile  the approval of Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML  R R AML  will further boost Celgene s portfolio  The drug was developed in collaboration with Agios Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ AGIO   
Celgene is on the look out of new deals and acquisitions given the recent setbacks   In January 2018  Celgene announced it will acquire Impact Biomedicines  The company recently announced that it will acquire smaller biotech Juno Therapeutics   NASDAQ JUNO   whose pipeline includes CD19 and CD22 directed CAR T cell product candidates for  9 billion 
During fourth quarter earnings call investors are expected to remain focused on the company s performance and label expansion efforts  along with updates on recent acquisitions

120667,342182,VRTX,Value Biotech ETFs To Buy Now,opinion,"The biotech sector has had a great year  with SPDR S P Biotech  MX XBI  ETF  adding over 39   as of Dec 11  2017   Ebbing tensions over the price gouging issue  hopes of easing regulation  positive clinical trials  FDA approvals of drugs and success in the immune oncology field led to this rally 
One of the top performers in the space Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF   HM BBC    is up about 50 8  in the year to date frame  as of Dec 11  2017   However  a steep price rise results in overvaluation concerns  Many may fear high beta sell off in the space next year 
Below we highlight a few factors that could power the rally 
Likely Tax Reform
With the tax reform a few hurdles away from enactment  there is a reason to cheer for biotech stocks  The reforms seek to lower the corporate tax rate from 35  to 20   which can boost drug biotech companies  The change in tax code will also permit companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a   read    
Upbeat Clinical Trials   FDA Approvals
Successful clinical trials for new drugs are also acting as tailwinds for the space  Notable improvement was noted in cancer drug data  Clovis Oncology   NASDAQ CLVS   said in June that the clinical trial data on its ovarian cancer drug treatment indicated that it may substantially help more patients than expected  The news acted as a catalyst to the entire space  read    
This month  impressive clinical data on  were released  Among breakthrough U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approvals  Vertex Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ VRTX   new FDA approval for cystic fibrosis drug and the Novartis AG breakthrough gene transfer treatment were notable 
Merger and Acquisitions to Perk Up 
Tax reform and cash repatriation may lead to a rise in biotech merger and acquisitions  In any case  mergers and acquisitions over the last few years have been great for biotech companies to reduce competition for the same kind of offerings and attain synergies  Tax reform should leave companies with more cash to pursue their dream deals  Expectations are rife  Sanofi  PA SASY   Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Merck  NYSE MRK  will announce M A deals in 2018 
ETFs to Tap

120669,342184,VRTX,Amgen s  AMGN  Xgeva Gets FDA Approval For Multiple Myeloma ,opinion,"Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  to expand the label of its key drug  Xgeva 
Xgeva is currently approved for the prevention of skeletal related events  SREs  in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases  With the latest FDA approval  the label of Xgeva will be expanded to include patients with multiple myeloma 
The FDA decision comes earlier than the PDUFA date of Feb 2  2018  A similar regulatory application is also under review in the EU 
In the past year  Amgen s shares have returned 13 8  in contrast to 1 7  decrease registered by the  

The FDA approval was based on safety and efficacy from the pivotal phase III  482 study  which enrolled 1 718 patients  The head to head study  which compared Xgeva to Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   Zometa  zoledronic acid   met the primary endpoint of non inferiority of the drugs in delaying the time to first on study SRE in patients with multiple myeloma 
Bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma can be quite damaging  Until now  bisphosphonates were the only treatment option available for bone protection in multiple myeloma patients  However  bisphosphonates may cause renal toxicity and lead to renal impairment  Xgeva  which is not cleared through the kidneys  offers a better treatment option for such patients 
Xgeva is key revenue driver for Amgen and generated revenues of  1 18 billion in the first nine months of 2017  up 3  year over year  We expect approval for the expanded patient population to help in further boosting sales of the drug

   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that VRTX has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Vertex Pharmaceuticals  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2017-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-earnings-season-could-be-great-for-vertex-pharmaceuticals-vrtx-200220646,200220646
120694,342209,VRTX,Vertex Gets CHMP Recommendation For Orkambi Label Expansion,opinion,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX   announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   has recommended approval of a label expansion for Orkambi in Europe  The company is seeking extension of its marketing authorization for Orkambi to include use in children with cystic fibrosis   CF   who are aged between 6 and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation 
We note that the European Commission generally follows the recommendation of the CHMP but is not bound by it  A decision is typically expected within three months of recommendation 
We remind investors that Orkambi is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of CF in patients aged 12 years and above who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CF transmembrane conductance regulator   CFTR   gene 
Vertex s stock has outperformed the  so far this year  Shares are up 101 9  compared with the industry s gain of 2 3  in the period 

The company believes that the label expansion will increase the eligible patient population by 3400 in Europe  The drug is already approved in the United States for this indication 
Orkambi generated net sales of  955 5 million in the first nine months of 2017  growing over 35  from the year ago period  The potential label expansion will further boost the drug s sales 
Meanwhile  the company has completed part 2 of a phase III study evaluating Orkambi in CF patients of two to five years of age who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene  Last month the company announced that the study met its primary endpoint of safety  Vertex expects to file applications for expanding Orkambi s label in this patient population to the regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe in the first quarter of 2018 
CF  a rare  life threatening disease  is estimated to affect approximately 75 000 people in the United States  Europe and Australia  Vertex currently has another CF drug  Kalydeco  in its portfolio  The company generated CF product revenues of more than  1 5 billion  including sales of Kalydeco and Orkambi  in the first nine months of 2017 
Moreover  to boost its CF portfolio and curb competition Vertex bought Concert Pharmaceuticals  Inc  s   NASDAQ CNCE   CF candidate  CTP 656  in July 2017 
The CF market has been attracting lot of interest with several companies developing their candidates as potential therapy for patients Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price

120698,342213,VRTX,New Pharma ETF PILL   What Investors Need To Know,opinion,"The pharma sector has been a moderate performer this year with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index adding about 10 4  so far this year  as of Nov 24  2017   underperforming the S P 500  up 15 3   and the Nasdaq  26 9   
But this underperformance did not eat into the issuer s enthusiasm  Direxion recently launched a triple leverage pharmaceutical fund  in the name of Daily Pharmaceutical   Medical Bull 3X Shares  
Let s delve a little deeper and find out what caused the issuer to shoot a leveraged fund on this apparently underperforming  at the current level  space 
Inside PILL
The fund looks to track 300  of the performance of the Dynamic Pharmaceutical Intellidex Index  The underlying index comprises common shares of companies that are into research and development  manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals and drugs of all types 
Abbvie Ord Shs  6 13    Bristol Myers Squibb Ord  5 19   and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  Ord  5 17   are the top three holdings of the fund  Pharmaceutical stocks occupy about 66 8  of the portfolio while biotechnology stocks account for the rest  The fund charges 1 13  annually 
How Does It Fit in a Portfolio 
Price gouging has been nagging the space  Though the threat has subsided a lot in the Trump era after a more vocal protest against it by his democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the campaign days  the sector still faces risks of price controversies  Still  the long term prospects of the space appear bright 
However  as we progress toward the close of 2017  the pharma sector continues to perform well on breakthrough U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approvals  success in the immune oncology field  and mergers and acquisitions  read    
In the third quarter of 2017  biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ VRTX   received a new FDA approval for cystic fibrosis drug    In early September  FDA approved Novartis AG s breakthrough gene transfer treatment 
Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   announced the buyout of Kite Pharma KITE for  11 9 billion in late August to foray into the trending CAR T Therapy space   The FDA s approval of Yescarta  axicabtagene ciloleucel   the  is expected to drive Gilead Sciences  read    
Overall  the fund is a good choice for those seeking to bet primarily on large cap stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector  These are large  stable companies that generate solid cash flow and add stability to the portfolio  Healthcare is one of the most defensive sectors in the U S  markets  This sector is expected to continue to benefit from increased M A activities  new drug approvals and innovations 
Competition 
Investors intending to target the space with lesser risk appetite may find the non leverage ETF PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio   WA PJP   more appealing In the leveraged ETF space  the newly launched fund may face stiff competition from Direxion Daily Healthcare Bull 3x Shares   AS CURE   and Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bull 3x Shares  and ProShares UltraPro Nasdaq Biotechnology   see  here  
While CURE gives 300  of the performance of the Healthcare Select Sector Index  LABU tracks 300  of the performance of the S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index and UBIO offers daily investment results that correspond to three times the daily performance of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index

120701,342216,VRTX,4 Drug Biotech Stocks That Could Be Buyout Targets In 2018,opinion,Last week  we issued an  where we mentioned that mergers and acquisitions  which were quite lean in 2017  may pick up significantly in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved The reforms aim to cut the corporate tax rate from 35  to 20   which can boost profits of large drug biotech companies  The change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one time tax rate of 10  These changes will definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug biotech companies  Also  with focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and large drug biotech companies struggling with organic growth  there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in large M As in 2018 Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch  large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines In this article  we discuss some mid  and large cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for companies like Pfizer   NYSE PFE    Merck   NYSE MRK    Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and others  What matters for buying a drug biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs products  prospects of future sales growth  and the quality of the pipeline The four companies we discuss have most of these factors going in their favor  Acquisitions of small cap drug biotech companies are very difficult to predict and quite frequent  Hence  these have been excluded from the discussion BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN  Companies whose product pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits  BioMarin is one such drug developer  Its market cap is around  14 billion BioMarin s key orphan disease drugs   Vimizim and Kuvan   continue to do well  backed by strong underlying patient demand trends  BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs  Brineura s earlier than expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease  a form of Batten disease  was also a huge boost for BioMarin Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well with approval for pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria expected in 2018  On the pipeline  we believe both late stage candidates   vosoritide   for achondroplasia  the most common form of dwarfism  and BMN27   for hemophilia A    have blockbuster potential BioMarin has already been the target of takeover speculation  Companies like Gilead  GILD   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ VRTX  For Vertex  2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two approved cystic fibrosis  CF    Kalydeco   Orkambi  CF is Vertex s main area of focus  With a consistent expansion in patient population  Vertex s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017 The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex U S  markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor VX 661  ivacaftor combination medicine Meanwhile  the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts  The market cap of Vertex is around  36 billion Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   Incyte s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead  Amgen and Bristol Myers  The market cap of Incyte is more than  20 billion The primary reason why Incyte is ripe for buyout is its two products on the market  Jakafi and Iclusig Jakafi  a JAK inhibitor  is the first and the only product to be approved by the polycythemia vera  PV  and myelofibrosis   MF     two rare blood cancers  Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications   In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug  the company is working on expanding its label further  Iclusig is approved for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia Meanwhile  Incyte s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat   being studied in combination with anti PD L1 agents of Merck  Bristol Myers and others   and Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis   approved in Europe and regulatory application to be filed in the United States in January 2018 Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN  Like BioMarin  Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra rare disorders  Its key drug is Soliris  approved for two severe and ultra rare disorders   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS    have been consistently doing well  Meanwhile  Alexion is working on expanding the drug s label to include additional indications  which if approved  can boost further sales growth  It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma  which are emerging as growth drivers  Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow up candidate  ALXN1210 Roche  Pfizer  or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion  The market cap of Alexion is more than  25 billion Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1

120723,342238,VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals  USG And J  Jill Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 13  2017    Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Nasdaq   NASDAQ VRTX       as the Bull of the Day  USG Corporation  NYSE   NYSE USG       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on J  Jill Inc   NYSE   NYSE JILL      Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Nasdaq      is the leading biotechnology company with a treatment for cystic fibrosis  CF  The company holds a strong position in this market with two commercial products  Orkambi and Kalydeco  Early in August  Vertex had said that it expects its CF franchise to deliver revenues of  1 87 billion to  2 1 billion in 2017 including Orkambi revenues of  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion The CF market represents huge commercial potential  It is a rare  life threatening disease estimated to affect about 75 000 people in North America  Europe and Australia  Vertex enjoys a strong position in this market being the first company to successfully develop a drug  Kalydeco  that treats the underlying cause of CF Vertex is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for new combination treatments of its so called  correctors   With the FDA granting priority review  a response should be out by Feb 28  2018 What is CF Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs  digestive system and other organs in the body  According to the Mayo Clinic   Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus  sweat and digestive juices  These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery  But in people with cystic fibrosis  a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick  Instead of acting as a lubricant  the secretions plug up tubes  ducts and passageways  especially in the lungs and pancreas Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care  people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work  and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades  Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid  to late 30s  on average  and some are living into their 40s and 50s Why Did VRTX Jump 20  in July On the morning of July 19  VRTX shares popped nearly  30 from  130 to  160  My colleague Brian Hamilton wrote about this in his Bull of the Day shortly after   On Tuesday July 18  management announced that three of their four next generation correctors in development to treat cystic fibrosis  CF  patients had positive Phase 1  and Phase 2 data Highlighting the report was the efficacy and safety shown by three different triple combination regimens  The data showed consistency across many regimen and patient populations  and is viewed as a game changer for the disease Given this positive data  it is expected that the company will be granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation  BTD  for their triplet regimens  cutting the 12 month timeline to 6 months  It is estimated that the 24 week Phase three trials will begin in the first half of 2018  and commercial treatments potentially be launched in the late part of 2019 This breakthrough therapy is expected to deliver increased sales and earnings growth over the next 5 years for Vertex if and when it eventually gets full approval  Further  it is estimated that these triplet regimens will penetrate almost 90  of the  9 billion CF market  USG Corporation  NYSE      is the  4 6 billion maker of construction wallboard with its iconic  ubiquitous brand Sheetrock  which just celebrated its 100th birthday earlier this year But the stock has struggled this year on the back of declining earnings estimates and it s back in the cellar of the Zacks Rank And this follows a strong 2016 which saw the company revenues  trough  and bounce back while USG shares more than doubled from  16 to  34 between January 2016 and February 2017 The recovery in sales was not matched by one in earnings though  Below is the Zacks proprietary Price   Consensus chart which plots changes in annual EPS estimates against the stock price   As you can see  annual EPS estimates for both 2017  blue line  and 2018  gold line  have been on the decline all of this year This pessimism about future growth took USG shares back down to  26  but they ve since seen a run back up to near the recent 52 week highs And right now  consensus sales estimates for 2017 have fallen back too  The current top line haul for this year is expected to be just  3 14 billion vs last year s  3 47 billion  for a 9 6  drop So while the economy is strong and real estate seems to be in high gear  this doesn t seem like a good time to be starting or adding to USG positions at 20X earnings Investors should at least wait until the estimates stop going down and start heading back up Additional

of the company s  to its third quarter fiscal 2017 guidance J  Jill now expects total company comparable sales in the range of  3  to  5   and a moderate decline in gross margin when compared to last

120724,342239,VRTX,Will Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Disappoint In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Quest Diagnostics Inc    NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 19 Last quarter  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 9 9   Also  Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7 1  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayAfter several quarters of sustained drag in the company s revenue per requisition performance last quarter saw a slight rebound  However  it still remains to be seen if this improvement is here to stay or not  The company s two Professional Lab Services  PLS  engagements   WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings  Inc   HCA    carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work Overall  we believe that a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially insured lives will continuously impact the company s volume  measured by the number of requisitions  environment till the economy turns around for better Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   This apart  unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the previously reported second quarter  While unit price headwinds hovered in moderate ranges  at approximately 1   over the last few years  the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too Also  over the last two years  Quest Diagnostics has faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues  The company is concerned about the CMS  Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA   We believe  reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company s performance this soon to be reported quarter too Notably  the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule  CLFS   However  this leaves no impact on its yet to be reported quarter s revenue numbers On a positive note  Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to repeat its well meaning efforts from second quarter 2017 by stimulating the company s performance via a two point growth strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence We are also optimistic about the company s successful execution of its strategy to grow esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth Additionally  Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing  prescription drug monitoring and industry leading wellness business  We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the third quarter as well  driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter We strongly believe all these recent developments to significantly contribute to the company s top line in the third quarter The company currently expects full year 2017 revenues in the range of  7 69  7 74 billion  annualized growth of

120725,342240,VRTX,4 Of The Most Efficient Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance Efficiency  which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory  Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  2  Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable  You can see  Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 19 Here are four stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   is engaged in discovering  developing  manufacturing and commercializing

biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor  Strong quarterly results  new product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year  Another factor that has contributed to the sector s surge is that President Trump s expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared These factors should continue to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next as well despite challenges like rising competition  pipeline setbacks  slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs  On the broader macro front  the proposed tax reforms  if approved  will leave more cash in the hands of these companies  The cash can be invested for mergers acquisitions  which have been relatively fewer

patients who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation  F508del Min   were presented last week  The data demonstrated that all three combinations led to pronounced improvement in

120800,342315,VRTX,Is A Beat In The Cards For Vertex  VRTX  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ VRTX   to beat expectations when it reports its second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26  after the market closes 
Year to date  Vertex s shares have soared 116 3  while the  has recorded an increase of 11 2  

Vertex s track record has been impressive so far  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three and missed expectations in one of the last four quarters  The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 406 25   In the last reported quarter  Vertex posted a positive surprise of 225  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors at Play
Sales of Vertex s both cystic fibrosis  CF  drugs   Kalydeco   Orkambi   rose in the first quarter  We expect this positive trend to continue in the second as well 
In May 2017  Kalydeco gained an FDA approval for use in patients 2 and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  CFTR  gene  Over 900 people in the U S  have one of these mutations  Following the approval  Vertex upped its Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance to  740  770 million  We expect this expanded indication to boost Kalydeco sales in the second quarter 
Orkambi s sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017  Last week  Vertex announced that it has struck a re imbursement agreement in Italy for Orkambi  thereby making the medicine more accessible in the country  Though the reimbursement agreement will not be beneficial in the second quarter  it should contribute to sales in the second half of the year  In the first quarter  the company had also mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year  it would contribute significantly to revenue growth this year 
Vertex is also evaluating some next generation CFTR correctors  VX 152  VX 440  VX 659 and VX 445  as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Data from VX 152 and VX 440 phase II and VX 659 phase I triple combination studies presented earlier this week  have showed that all three combinations led to a pronounced improvement in lung function  Phase II study on VX 659 is expected to be initiated in early Aug 
 Phase II studies on the fourth next generation corrector  VX 445  triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor   are already going on  Data from VX 445 and VX 659 phase II studies are expected in early 2018  Thereafter  upon discussion with regulatory agencies  Vertex will initiate its pivotal studies on one or more of these triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018 
If the triple combo regimes are successful  Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population 
Investor focus at the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens  crucial for long term growth of Vertex 
However  operating expenses are likely to shoot up as Vertex expands its pipeline 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model shows that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarterbecause it has the right combination of two key ingredients  For astock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate  earnings of 10 cents  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  earnings of 6 cents   stands at  66 7   This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Vertex currently flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   So its desirable combination makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Conversely  we caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   is scheduled to release its results on Jul 26  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 23  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  
Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG   is scheduled to release its results on Jul 27  The company has an Earnings ESP of  0 62  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Proteostasis Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ PTI    which is expected to release results on Aug 8  has an Earnings ESP of  6 56  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

120802,342317,VRTX,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  AGCO  Owens Corning  Five9 And Axcelis Technologies,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL  July 24  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  Incorporated          AGCO Corporation          Owens Corning   NYSE         Five9 Inc   NASDAQ         and Axcelis Technologies Inc   NASDAQ         

5 Stock Picks with Earnings Beat Potential

	Tapping stocks that come up with solid earnings is a common practice  But instead of picking them post earnings  investing in those that are like to beat market expectations may increase your gains manifolds 

Why Is Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 

	Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in serious question 

	There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In a such case  growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company s true health 

	On the other hand  Wall Street analysts study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate  So  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception  And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 

How to Find Out Those Gems 

	Since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind  It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release too as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to come ahead of expectations  or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10    Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 

Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20    We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  

Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20    This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 

 greater than zero   A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 

	In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 

Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10    Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 

Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000   High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around seven 

	Here are five out of seven stocks that passed the screen 

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated          The company is a developer and marketer of small molecule drugs  The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 46   It has a Zacks Rank  2 

AGCO Corporation          The company is engaged in the manufacturer and distribution of farm equipment  machinery and replacement parts in the United States and Canada  The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 5   It carries a Zacks Rank  1

120803,342318,VRTX,Biotech ETF Industry Outlook For Second Half 2017,opinion,"Biotech stocks have had a strong run so far in 2017 with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index soaring 19 4  year to date  YTD   This is in sharp contrast to last year s performance when the Index was down 19 1   There were several reasons for the sector s dismal performance last year foremost being the drug pricing controversy  
 
Apart from drug pricing  there were several other factors that impacted the sector    2016 was disappointing from an R D perspective with a fewer number of drugs managing to gain FDA approval  There were some high profile pipeline failures as well  Other factors that weighed on the sector include mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition   Read   
 
Recovery on the Cards
 
With the biotech sector performing well this year  it looks like the sector is set for a recovery  New product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products are some of the factors that could contribute to a sustained recovery in the sector  Tax reforms and cash repatriation would support a recovery as well 
 
Importantly  investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector  Expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected    Read   
 
Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices  The FDA is working on a plan to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next generation treatments  especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies 
 
Biosimilars Pose a Threat
 
Although biosimilars are yet to pick pace  they remain a major threat for biotech stocks specially companies that are set to lose patent protection for major blockbuster drugs in the next few years  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies 
 
M As to Pick Pace in 2H17 
 
Expectations are high that the biotech sector will witness an increase in M As as the year progresses    potential tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area  However  not many deals have been announced this year    a key reason could be a  wait and watch  approach regarding the drug pricing situation as well as tax reforms  Another deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over priced deals 
 
That being said  companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after  Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   immuno oncology and multiple sclerosis are in demand  Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after with quite a few deals being signed in these areas  Biotech companies like Incyte and Exelixis are often considered attractive takeover targets 
 
Faster Drug Approval Process
 
The FDA is working on streamlining the development process for drugs for rare diseases as well as for targeted cancer therapies  The agency is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications 
 
So far in 2017  the FDA has given its nod to 23 new drugs  already surpassing last year s total tally of 22  Among this year s approvals  drugs like Kevzara  adult rheumatoid arthritis  and Dupixent  eczema  have blockbuster potential 
 
According to an IMSQuintiles report  the late phase R D pipeline for the industry indicates that there should be about 40 45 new brand launches every year through 2021

VRTX Technical Analysis


VRTX opened trading yesterday at  129 21 which was exactly the same as the previous day s trading close  VRTX closed trading yesterday at  132 16 and spiked up after market to  165 45  equivalent to a 25  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that we are in unchartered territory as with the spike up VRTX is now trading at all time highs 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up VRTX had already been in an overall upward  dating back to March 28th when it traded at  89 67  VRTX has a  of 247 98 million shares and traded 1 90 times the normal daily trading  on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see VRTX open trading on Wednesday above  155 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  2 00 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

120881,342396,VRTX,Fresh Capital To Be Injected Into Biotech Stocks  5 Must Buys,opinion,The recent rally in tech stocks makes us wonder which other sectors are in a position to lead the charge  One sector that comes to our mind is biotechnology  which is well positioned to move north  Biotech stocks have appeared to come back to life following two years of a lull  A flurry of biotech stocks had topped in the summer of 2015  losing steam soon after Now  however  they are on the verge of a break out cashing on President Trump s tax plan spurring waves of buyouts  innovation reaching exponential levels and drug price outrage easing out  Hence  investing in solid biotech stocks seems to be judicious  Biotech to Break OutInvestors have steered clear of tech behemoths that constitute the bulk of growth stocks on overvaluation concerns  As they believe that they will simply lose too much money here  they repositioned themselves in biotech stocks   Even though this space was caught in the crossfire during the 2016 presidential election on  price gouging  concerns  it has recovered somewhat  Calithera Biosciences Inc   NASDAQ CALA    Esperion Therapeutics Inc   NASDAQ ESPR   and Puma Biotechnology Inc   NASDAQ PBYI   have all added more than 100  this year  a clear indication that when money flows into biotech stocks  they soar The iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  rose about 17  since Trump s win  It  however  has more room to climb as it is still down 23  from its all time intraday high attained in the July of 2015  This makes it an enticing bet for value investors  They look for companies that are fundamentally solid but underpriced and the IBB s components fit the bill M A to Spur Growth  An Island of InnovationTrump has promised to change the tax code so that companies can bring back cash held overseas  This in turn is expected to spur a series of buyouts among innovation starved biotech companies looking for growth  Quantum of deals in this sector has remained low for almost five years  Jay Rao  a medical doctor and money manager at Balyasny Asset Management  says that  M A and consolidation are inevitable  in the biotech sector  Big pharma companies  in the meantime  have already over  500 billion in cash to invest in merger and acquisition activities When it comes to innovation  investors look at Silicon Valley  But  biotech companies aren t lagging much  Rao added that  advances in biology and science are breathtaking  and they are creating tangible benefits for patients   Primary examples of such companies are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ REGN    Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   and Kite Pharma Inc   NASDAQ KITE   Drug Price Outrage EasedOne fear that has haunted biotech companies is the possibility of a draconian crackdown on drug prices in Washington D C  But  Rao said that Washington will find it difficult to impose any price controls with Tom Price as secretary of Health and Human Services since he has a history of rejecting this sort of policies Moreover  politicians are likely to crack down on products that are visible to consumers like EpiPen  We shouldn t forget that such a product is relatively cheap compared to some of the expensive specialized therapies  Furthermore  the pharma industry did a commendable job by showing politicians that drug costs constitute relatively a small portion of the overall health care expenses  At the same time  they argued that expensive drugs can save money by eliminating chronic diseases and keeping people out of hospitals 5 Top Biotech

5 Efficient Stocks for a Winning Portfolio

	Efficiency  a company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company s price performance  But  it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio 

How to Measure Efficiency 

	We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns 

Inventory Turnover

	Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 

Receivables Turnover

	This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 

Asset Utilization

	This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio implies that the company is failing to use its assets effectively 

Operating Margin

	Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 

	All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages 

Screening Parameters

	In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 

Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average 

	 Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers  

	The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 18 

	Here are five stocks from the 18 that made it through the screen 

Sanderson Farms  Inc   NASDAQ       is engaged in the production  processing  marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken  and also preparation  processing  marketing and distribution of processed and minimally prepared chicken  The compn has a Zacks Rank  1  The company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 8 53

5 Toxic Stocks to Steer Clear Of or Sell Short

	Investors who can precisely identify overpriced stocks are likely to emerge winners  In practice  the correctly priced stocks and the overblown toxic stocks are mingled in the market place in such a way that it becomes tough to identify them  Investors who can figure out the overpriced stocks and shun them at the right time are the ones who are likely to benefit 
	Generally  toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks and burdened with huge debts  In fact  the unreasonably high price of the toxic stocks is short lived as the current price of these stocks is higher than their intrinsic price  So  quite obviously  if you own such toxic stocks for a very long period of time  you are sure to see huge loss in your wealth 
	High price of the toxic stocks can be ascribed to an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental lacunae  Presence of such stocks in your portfolio may result in loss of wealth 
	However  if you can precisely spot the toxic stocks  you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls 
	While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets 
	So  just like owning stocks with growth potential  distinguishing toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to guard your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them Screening Criteria
	Here is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average    High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50   A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5    Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold    We have not considered Buy rated stocks that generally outperform the market 
	Here are five of the 26 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen Covanta Holding Corporation  NYSE      is a Morristown  NJ based alternative energy company that provides waste and energy services in the U S  and Canada  Over the past 30 days  its second quarter 2017 estimate widened from a loss of 11 cents per share to a loss of 15 cents  The company has a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   PTC Inc    NASDAQ       is a Needham  MA based software company engaged in developing  marketing and supporting software solutions  Over the past one month period  the current quarter estimates declined 26 1  to 17 cents  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3 Etsy  Inc   NASDAQ       is a Brooklyn  NY based Internet services company  It operates a marketplace to make  sell and buy goods online and offline worldwide  Over the last 30 days  its current quarter estimate changed from a break even point to a loss of a penny per share  The company has a Zacks Rank  3 
	Boston  MA based  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  NASDAQ       is a bio technology company  Over the past one month period  the second quarter 2017 estimate declined 66 7  to 5 cents a share  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3 Live Nation Entertainment  Inc   NYSE       is a Beverly Hills  CA based live entertainment company  Over the past seven days  its second quarter 2017 estimate remained unchanged at 17 cents a share

5 Toxic Stocks to Discard or Play Short for Profit 

	One of the important keys to successful investing is the proper identification of overpriced stocks and correctly priced ones  However  in reality  the overpriced toxic stocks and the fairly priced stocks are intermingled in the market place in such a way that it becomes extremely difficult to distinguish them  Investors who can figure out the toxic stocks and abandon them at the right time are likely to gain 

	Generally  toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are loaded with huge debts  Also  sometimes  the price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably inflated  The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only temporary as the intrinsic value of these stocks is lower than the current bloated price 
	The inflated price of the toxic stocks can be due to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawback  If you own such stocks for a very long period of time  you are sure to see huge erosion in your wealth 
	On the other hand  if you can pinpoint the toxic stocks accurately  you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls 
	While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets 
	So  identifying toxic stocks and throwing them away at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them Screening Criteria
	Here is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average    High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50   A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5    Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold    We have not considered Buy rated stocks that generally outperform the market 
	Here are five of the 19 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen Etsy  Inc   NASDAQ       is a Brooklyn  NY based Internet services company  It operates a marketplace to make  sell and buy goods online and offline worldwide  Over the last 30 days  its quarter estimates widened from a loss of a penny per share to a loss of 2 cents  The company has a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   Live Nation Entertainment  Inc   NYSE       is a Beverly Hills  CA based live entertainment company  Over the past 30 days  its second quarter 2017 estimates remained unchanged at 17 cents a share  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3 Salesforce com  Inc   NYSE       is a San Francisco  CA based computer software industry firm  Over the past one month period  its second quarter earnings estimate has declined 18 2  to 9 cents a share  Currently  the company carries a Zacks Rank  3

Best and Worst Drug Stocks from Q1

	After a tough and challenging 2016  pharma and biotech stocks have been showing signs of recovery this year  The sector started the year on a strong note with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 10 7  and 5 7   respectively  in the first quarter of 2017 

	Despite the drug pricing issue remaining a headline risk this year  investors have been gaining confidence in the sector based on strong results  R D success and innovation  FDA approvals  ramp up in new product sales and continued strong performance from legacy products  Expectations are also high that M As will pick up this year 

	There has also been some talk about speeding up the FDA approval process  Last year  the number of new drug approvals slipped to 22  well below the 45 approvals in 2015 and 41 in 2014  President Trump said that the FDA will be streamlined and the drug approval process will be much faster  The recently signed 21st Century Cures Act is a step in this direction  With the passing of this Act  expectations are that there will be more innovation in the sector and  maybe  a surge in new drug approvals  So far in 2017  13 drugs have been approved by the agency 

	While all these factors should work in favor of the sector  challenges remain in the form of additional competition  high profile pipeline setbacks  slowdown in growth of mature products and loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs 

	Here is a look at 3 of the best and worst performing drug stocks in the first quarter of 2017

120978,342493,VRTX,5 Toxic Stocks To Shun Or Play Short Right Now,opinion,Successful investing calls for the appropriate identification of overpriced stocks and correctly priced stocks  However  in practice  the overhyped toxic stocks and the fairly priced stocks are intermixed in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes difficult to distinguish between them  Investors who can correctly spot the overpriced stocks and shun them at the right time are the ones likely to make a profit Usually  toxic stocks are fraught with huge debt loads and susceptible to external shocks  Also  the unjustifiably high price of the toxic stocks is short lived as the intrinsic value of these stocks is less than their current price  Quite naturally  if you own such toxic stocks for a long period of time  you are sure to make huge loss in your wealth Higher price of the toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental lacuna associated with them  If you own such stocks for long  you are likely to see a big loss in your wealth On the other hand  if you can accurately pinpoint the toxic stocks  you are likely to gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  just like picking up stocks with strong growth potential  pinpointing toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average  High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50  A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5  Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold   We have not considered Buy rated stocks that generally outperform the market Here are five of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen PTC Inc    NASDAQ PTC   is a Needham  MA based software company engaged in developing  marketing and supporting software

5 Toxic Stocks to Shun or Play Short Right Now

	Successful investing calls for the appropriate identification of overpriced stocks and correctly priced stocks  However  in practice  the overhyped toxic stocks and the fairly priced stocks are intermixed in the marketplace in such a way that it becomes difficult to distinguish between them  Investors who can correctly spot the overpriced stocks and shun them at the right time are the ones likely to make a profit 

	Usually  toxic stocks are fraught with huge debt loads and susceptible to external shocks  Also  the unjustifiably high price of the toxic stocks is short lived as the intrinsic value of these stocks is less than their current price  Quite naturally  if you own such toxic stocks for a long period of time  you are sure to make huge loss in your wealth 
	Higher price of the toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental lacuna associated with them  If you own such stocks for long  you are likely to see a big loss in your wealth 
	On the other hand  if you can accurately pinpoint the toxic stocks  you are likely to gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls 
	While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets 
	So  just like picking up stocks with strong growth potential  pinpointing toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them Screening Criteria
	Here is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average    High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50   A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5    Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold    We have not considered Buy rated stocks that generally outperform the market 
	Here are five of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen PTC Inc   NASDAQ       is a Needham  MA based software company engaged in developing  marketing and supporting software solutions  Over the past one month period  first quarter 2017 estimate remained unchanged at 16 cents  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   Covanta Holding Corporation  NYSE       is a Morristown  NJ based alternative energy company that provides waste and energy services in the U S  and Canada  Over the past 30 days  its first quarter 2017 estimate remained unchanged at a loss of 20 cents per share  The company has a Zacks Rank  3 Live Nation Entertainment  Inc   NYSE       is a Beverly Hills  CA based live entertainment company  Over the past 30 days  its first quarter 2017 estimate widened from a loss of 32 cents a share to a loss of 33 cents 
	Wilmington  DE based Incyte Corporation  NASDAQ        is a drug discovery company  Over the last 30 days  its first quarter estimate widened from a loss of 80 cents a share to a loss of 87 cents  Incyte carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
	Boston  MA based  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ        is a bio technology company  Over the past one month period  the first quarter 2017 estimate remained unchanged at 4 cents a share  The stock currently has a Zacks Rank  3

120981,342496,VRTX,Vertex  VRTX  Q1 Earnings Top  CF Products Sales Strong,opinion,Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   reported first quarter 2017 earnings per share of 13 cents  including the impact of stock based compensation expense   which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents  Notably  the company had posted a loss of 13 cents in the year ago quarter  Strong product revenues and cost control led to higher profits in the quarter Excluding stock based compensation expense  first quarter adjusted earnings were 41 cents per share compared with the year ago figure of 9 cents Including upfront revenues of  230 million received from German phama company  Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA for the out licensing of four oncology programs  restructuring costs and other adjustments  reported earnings were 99 cents per share Vertex reported revenues of  714 7 million in the first quarter  up 79 5  year over year gaining from the upfront payment from Merck KGaA  Excluding the upfront revenues  adjusted total revenue was  482 3 million  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  459 1 million by 5 3  This year so far  Vertex s shares have risen 61 5   outperforming an increase of 4 8  for the Zacks classified industry CF Franchise Sales Rise Vertex s first quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis  CF  products Kalydeco and Orkambi  collaborative   232 6 million  and royalty revenues   1 5 million   CF product revenues were  481 million in the first quarter  up 22  year over year The company reported a 9  increase in Kalydeco sales to  186 million  Kalydeco sales gained from one time adjustments mainly related to European reimbursement agreements Orkambi  lumacaftor ivacaftor  delivered sales of  295 0 million  up 32  year over year  On a sequential basis  Orkambi sales rose around 7  in the first quarter supported by rapid uptake in the pediatric indication for which approval was received in Sep 2016 Cost DiscussionAdjusted  including stock based compensation expenses  research and development expenses increased 5 9  to  271 4 million in the first quarter due to higher costs related to progress on the CF pipeline  Adjusted  including stock based compensation expenses  selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 5 5  to  110 5 million due to increased investment to support the global launch of Orkambi Maintains 2017 GuidanceVertex maintained its 2017 guidance for Orkambi revenues  which was provided in early Jan 2017  while raising the same for Kalydeco  Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of  1 1  1 3 billion while Kalydeco revenues are estimated in the range of  710 to  730 million  higher than  690  710 million guided previously  Management said the uptick in guidance was the result of a one time gain received this quarter as well as strong demand trends for the product Management continues to believe that Orkambi sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017  Vertex has faced many challenges with respect to commercialization of Orkambi in ex U S  markets due to re imbursement hurdles  discontinuations by patients who had previously initiated treatment with Orkambi and a slower than anticipated launch in Germany Combined adjusted research and development  R D  and selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses in 2017 are anticipated in the range of  1 25  1 30 billion  Costs are expected to be higher than 2016 levels due to increased costs related to CF pipeline development and increased commercial investment to support Orkambi and Kalydeco Our TakeVertex s first quarter results were strong with the company beating expectations for both earnings and revenues as sales of its CF drugs rose Meanwhile  Vertex s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next generation CF correctors  Investor focus will now be on the triple combination CF regimens  which are crucial for long term growth at Vertex  Data from three triple combination regimes in CF patients are expected in the second half of this year  We remind investors that last month  Vertex announced positive data from two phase III studies evaluating Kalydeco in combination with VX 661  tezacaftor  in patients suffering from CF aged 12 years and above with two copies of the F508del mutation  Both studies   EVOLVE and EXPAND   met their primary endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function in patients with CF Based on positive outcome from the studies  the company is planning to submit regulatory applications in the U S  and EU in the third quarter of 2017 Meanwhile  the company is also looking to buy CF candidates  which can be combined with its tezacaftor  VX 661  and Kalydeco to create triple combinations Just last month  Vertex announced a definitive deal to buy the worldwide development and commercialization rights of Concert Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ CNCE   CF pipeline candidate  CTP 656 for an upfront payment of  160 million in cash Vertex plans to develop CTP 656 for potential use in future once daily regimens in combination with its other pipeline drugs to treat the underlying cause of CF Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Undoubtedly  the CF market has been attracting the interest of several companies like AbbVie  Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   and Sanofi   NYSE SNY    These companies are pursuing the development of CFTR potentiators  CFTR correctors and candidates with other mechanisms of action that can address the underlying cause of CF Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our

Nivalis Therapeutics  Inc   NVLS   a clinical stage pharmaceutical company yesterday announced their results for their phase 2 cystic fibrosis drug has failed  The study showed that the drug failed to reach its primary endpoints in the clinical trial

NVLS Technical Analysis

NVLS opened trading yesterday at  6 32 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  6 28  NVLS closed trading yesterday at  6 25 and crashed down after market to  2 95  equivalent to a 53  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that we are in unchartered territory as NVLS is now trading at all time lows Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down NVLS had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to September 20th when it traded at  34 60  NVLS has a float of 6 93 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday  For trading purposes  I would like to see NVLS open trading on Tuesday below  4 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 40 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down  My friend Ross over at Warrior Trading is applying his  to these types of stocks

We are taking a cautiously optimistic approach to our outlook given the uncertain macro environment in addition to the many initiatives and investments we are undertaking

121107,342622,VRTX,Biotech ETF Industry Outlook,opinion,"The biotech sector has had a rough start to the year with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining approximately 16  year to date  Sector specific issues like increasing political and media focus on high price tags for new drugs and the changing competitive scenario have been weighing on biotech stocks over the last few quarters 
 
However  the sector s fundamentals remain strong and mergers and acquisitions  M As   product approvals and positive data flow should act as catalysts   Read   
 
Drug Pricing to Remain in Focus 
 
With Presidential candidates  policymakers  the media and the general public focusing on the high price tags for drugs  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market 
 
According to the Oct 2015 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  affordability of prescription drugs remains at the top of the public s priority list for the President and Congress   focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices 
 
In this scenario  the drug pricing issue is not likely to die down easily    at least not until elections are over  Proposed health care plans include suggestions on how to rein in the prices of new drugs  Read   
 
Biosimilars Gaining Importance 
 
With the FDA approval of the first biosimilar in the U S   Sandoz s Zarxio   a biosimilar of Amgen s Neupogen  last year  this area is fast gaining importance with a lot of companies working on bringing biosimilars of blockbuster biologic treatments to market 
 
Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Celltrion s biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s blockbuster drug Remicade gained FDA approval earlier this year while the agency is expected to decide on the approval status of Amgen s biosimilar version of AbbVie s Humira in Sep 2016 
 
Deals to Continue
 
Licensing agreements and deals including those with opt in arrangements should continue being signed with immuno oncology remaining a favorite area  Moreover  with valuations approaching reasonable levels  we could see several merger and acquisition agreements being announced as the year progresses  Quite a few of the major biotech companies are rumored to be on the look out for suitable deals  Meanwhile  small bolt on acquisitions will continue 
 
New Products Should Gain Traction in 2H16
 
Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  Some of the important new product approvals include cystic fibrosis treatment  Orkambi  heart failure treatment  Corlanor  PCSK9 inhibitors   Repatha and Praluent  and Genvoya  HIV  
 
Meanwhile  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 16 new drugs including Epclusa  HCV  Ocaliva  rare  chronic liver disease   Zinbryta  multiple sclerosis   and Venclexta  chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with a specific chromosomal abnormality  among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis and Imbruvica 
 
ETFs in Focus
 
Highlighted below are some biotech ETFs   ETFs present a low cost and convenient way to get a diversified exposure to the sector

Conclusion 
 
 High risk and high returns  is a term often associated with the biotech sector  Biotech drugs  which are developed through a biological process system or by using living organisms  require a lot of investment  The drugs are complex in nature and take several years to develop  Companies which hit the bull s eye become overnight success stories with shares even doubling or tripling on positive news  However  negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies 
 
Strong pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  growing demand for drugs especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth in this sector 
 
On the flip side  the high cost of treatments  pricing controversies and the threat of biosimilars remain dampeners for this high risk high return sector

3 Drug Stocks that Could Benefit from Key FDA Events This Month

The drug development process is often lengthy and time consuming and requires the utilization of a lot of funds and resources  It may well take a drug anything between 10 12 years to be successfully developed and reach the market  In such a scenario  key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance   companies which hit the bull s eye become overnight success stories with shares even doubling or tripling on positive news while negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies 

Here is a look at three stocks that have important regulatory events scheduled for this month Spectrum Pharmaceuticals  Inc  s     new drug application for Qapzola  apaziquone  will be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel later this week  The FDA s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee is meeting on Sep 14 to review the NDA   the proposed indication for the product is for the immediate intravesical instillation post transurethral resection of bladder tumors in patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer 
	Advisory panels provide the FDA with independent opinions and recommendations from outside experts on new drugs as well as FDA policies  While the agency is not required to do so  it usually follows the advisory committee s recommendation  Therefore  FDA advisory panel meetings are closely followed by investors as they give an insight into the FDA s final decision regarding the approval status of the candidate  A positive panel recommendation would be a major boost for Spectrum  a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock 

   

Next on the list is biotech major  Amgen Inc      which has an important regulatory event coming up later this month with the FDA expected to decide on the approval status of the company s Biologics License Application  BLA  for ABP 501 
	ABP 501 is a biosimilar candidate to AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV   s    Humira  an anti tumor necrosis factor alpha  TNF    monoclonal antibody  which is approved in many regions for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases  With an FDA advisory panel voting in favor of ABP 501 earlier this year  expectations are high that the FDA will give its nod to ABP 501 on the target action date of Sep 25  2016 
	Why is this approval important for Amgen  Well  Amgen is pretty committed to the biosimilars effort and if approved  ABP 501 would be the first biosimilar from Amgen s pipeline to gain approval  The Zacks Rank  3 stock has quite a few biosimilars in development including biosimilar versions of cancer drugs  Avastin and Herceptin  Amgen has even tied up with Japanese company  Daiichi Sankyo  to commercialize nine biosimilars in Japan 
	Last year  on an analyst call  Amgen had said that it expects to launch five new biosimilars between 2017 and 2019  The biosimilars opportunity represents annual revenues of more than  3 billion for Amgen  Humira brought in 2015 sales of  8 4 billion in the U S  alone where the composition of matter patent is expected to expire in Dec 2016 
	But even if it gains FDA approval  Amgen will have to take a decision regarding its launch plans for ABP 501 considering AbbVie has initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against the company 

   

Third on the list is Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Inc      a company focused on cystic fibrosis  CF  treatments  which is currently looking to expand the label of its CF treatment  Orkambi  Orkambi  approved in Jul 2015  for the treatment of the underlying cause of CF in people  ages 12 and above  with two copies of the F508del mutation  is currently under FDA review for use in the 6 11 years age group  Approval for this age group would expand the patient population by about 2 400 in the U S  A response from the agency is expected on Sep 30 and approval would be a positive catalyst for this Zacks Rank  3 stock  You can see

121150,342665,VRTX,How Does Brexit Impact Healthcare Stocks ,opinion,Now that the UK has decided to leave the EU  the global market is in turmoil leaving everyone jittery about the impact of this decision  Some of the immediately pressing concerns are a possible recession in the UK  unemployment woes  a plunging pound  and uncertainty regarding M A deals in the UK among others A big question is how will Brexit impact drug companies The first thing that comes to mind is the impact of Brexit on the drug approval process in the UK and EU  Currently  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  looks into the approval process under a centralized authorization procedure which allows drug companies to submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA  Under this process  the companies are able to market their medicines throughout the EU on the basis of a single marketing authorization thereby saving cost and time But with Brexit  a lot now depends on whether the UK will remain within the ambit of the EMA the way countries like Norway are or whether the UK will set up its own regulatory authority for drug approval  If the first scenario prevails  the approval process will continue as it is  However  if the UK sets up its own regulatory agency  the approval process could end up being lengthier as well as more expensive for companies seeking UK and EU approval for their drugs Meanwhile  the EMA  which is based in London  will now have to look for new headquarters Another factor that could be impacted by Brexit is the flow of research funds into the UK from the EU  With Britain exiting the EU  more of these funds could be diverted to other countries or research hubs On the other hand  the falling pound should prove to be a tailwind for companies like GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK    Moreover  most of the drug companies generate a major part of their revenues from the U S  though companies like Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN    Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX    Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   among others do generate quite a bit of revenues from Europe  Nevertheless  that should not be a cause for concern in the long term as factors like an aging population  growing medical needs  and easier access to medical products will continue driving demand for healthcare products While Brexit does create economic uncertainty and there could be some near term volatility in the sector  the general verdict is that Brexit s impact on drug stocks will be limited  What could end up being more concerning is the exit of additional countries from the EU Medical Sector Price IndexGlaxo  Celgene and BioMarin are all Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  while Alexion is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock and Vertex a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-does-brexit-impact-healthcare-stocks-200138430,200138430

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Dump These 5 Toxic Stocks to Avoid Portfolio Bleeding 

	Investing in a stock whose current valuation exceeds its true inherent potential  is bound to result in loss over time  Spotting such toxic stocks accurately on a regular basis and dumping them at the right time is one of the keys to a winning investing strategy 


	Overpricing of these toxic stocks can be ascribed to irrational exuberance associated with them  And if you own such stocks for an unreasonable period  they could end up significantly eroding your wealth 
	However  if you can detect toxic stocks  you may gain in a bear market by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows one to sell a stock first and then purchase it when its price falls 
	Naturally  short selling excels in bear markets  while it typically loses money in bull markets

	Here is a winning strategy that will help you identify the over hyped toxic stocks

	   P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50  A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued 
	    Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5  Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks point to analysts  pessimism

121154,342669,VRTX,Nivalis  NVLS   Can The Stock Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Nivalis Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ NVLS   is expected to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 1  Last quarter  the company had posted a negative surprise of 15 91   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Nivalis  a development stage pharmaceutical company  is focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of treatments for cystic fibrosis  CF   With no approved products in its portfolio at the moment  Nivalis does not generate revenues yet  In this scenario  investor focus will be on the company s progress with regard to its lead candidate  cavosonstat  N91115  
Recently  the company announced the completion of enrollment in the phase II study evaluating cavosonstat for the treatment of patients with CF  who have two copies of the F508del mutation  when added to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  s   NASDAQ VRTX   Orkambi  Top line data should be out by the end of this year 
During the quarter  Nivalis dosed the first patient in a second phase II study on cavosonstat  This proof of concept study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of cavosonstat as add on therapy to Vertex s Kalydeco in adults who have one copy of the F508del mutation and a second mutation that results in a gating defect in the CFTR protein  Data from the study is expected in the first half of 2017 
Meanwhile  Nivalis is expected to see a sequential rise in operating expenses due to continued investment in the development of cavosonstat among other things 
Surprise History
Nivalis  performance has been disappointing over the last four reported quarters  While the company has missed expectations on three occasions  it posted in line results in one  Overall  the company has delivered an average negative miss of 71 27  NIVALIS THERAPT Price and EPS Surprise
   What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nivalis is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 52 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Though Nivalis  Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of the ESP  an ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of health care stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
United Therapeutics Corp    NASDAQ UTHR   has an Earnings ESP of  3 37  and a Zacks Rank  2  It is scheduled to report second quarter results on Jul 28 
Bristol Myers Squibb Co    NYSE BMY   has an Earnings ESP of  1 49  and a Zacks Rank  1  It is also scheduled to report second quarter results on Jul 28 ",2016-07-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nivalis-(nvls):-can-the-stock-surprise-this-earnings-season-200144486,200144486

121191,342706,VRTX,Headline Risk Is Poison For Pharma And Biotech,opinion,"With yesterday s 300 point collapse  the Dow Jones 30 is now down 7 3 percent since January 1st  Other indexes have cratered as well  The smaller company Russell 2000 has shed over 11 percent  In the midst of this carnage  investors are understandably searching for  safe haven  stocks that generate dividends  are inexpensive  and offer less volatility than the overall market  Unfortunately  these ports in the storm are few and far between at the moment  People are looking for any excuse to sell stocks right now  which means anyone looking to buy has to be particularly sensitive to headline risk 
Today no sector faces greater headline risk than the biotechnology and pharmaceutical space  especially companies that have engaged in price gouging  In this toxic environment  names like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  N VRX   Shire PLC  O SHPG   Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  O VRTX   Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc  O BMRN   and others are the financial equivalent of the Zika virus 
On Thursday  the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold hearings to investigate exorbitant drug price increases  The committee s ranking Democrat  Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings  and other committee members will grill Valeant s interim CEO Howard Schiller  The management of Turing Pharma which first made headlines last fall for astronomically jacking up prices on an obscure but important medicine will also be questioned  News outlets will broadcast the hearings far and wide  and company stocks could very well drop  some precipitously  as negative sound bytes make their way through the media 
Politicians will take every opportunity to exacerbate this negative publicity  The presidential campaign is just starting to heat up and nothing gets attention like exposing corporate greed  At a recent town hall Hillary Clinton read a note about a Valeant migraine medication that cost 356 percent more than it did a year earlier  Hillary did not mince words   This is predatory pricing  it is unjustified  it is wrong   she said  adding   I m going after them  we are going to stop this  
Guess what  Hillary is right  I ve made no secret about my disgust for Valeant s now publicized  buy and burn  strategy of acquiring smaller drug companies and axing research and development spending while ripping prices higher  Since Clinton first raised the issue of drug prices back in September  Valeant has garnered more bad press for its secret use of specialty pharmacies  The company s sales force instructed doctors to get patients to buy Valeant drugs from those pharmacies so that the ultimate payer either a for profit insurer or Medicaid and Medicare would be coerced to pay for high priced Valeant drugs even when less expensive and equally efficacious alternatives existed 
What has disgusted me even more than Valeant s business practices is the investment community s defense of the company  Numerous high profile firms hold large stakes in Valeant  Bill Ackman s Pershing Square  N SQ   Jeff Ubbin s Valueact  Steve Mandel s Lone Pine Capital and Glenn Greenberg s Brave Warrior Advisors all own millions of shares  When news of these transgressions came to light  I assumed these wealthy managers would denounce the company and exit their positions  I was wrong  One after another  they defended Valeant  None  to my knowledge  unloaded their holdings  Unbelievably  Ackman increased his stake in the company and  in his annual letter  blamed  attacks by short sellers and the termination of a distribution agreement  for its stock s decline  Wow 
Valeant deserves all of the negative press it receives  It massively overcharges taxpayers for drugs  Hopefully  Congress instructs Medicare and Medicaid  whenever possible  to help patients buy anything but Valeant drugs  And hopefully state and municipal pensions redeem all of their money from firms funds that continue to own stocks in predatory drug companies  These are businesses that prey on the sick and the ill informed  And fund managers who own their stocks are doing the same ",2016-02-04,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/headline-risk-is-poison-for-pharma-and-biotech-383184,383184

121229,342744,VRTX,The Significance of Round Numbers ,opinion,"The round number theory is a strategy we like to employ here at ChartSmarter  Very simply stocks seem to stall and find support at the round figures  There are some that are more important than others to me like 20  50 and 100  but you will frequently find stocks exhibit certain behaviors around all of them  VMW for one bounced precisely off the round 80 figure on 10 22 after falling 7 1  after its last earnings report and has since traded up 6 1 2 handles  There are many examples and lets look at 3 that were recently highlighted in our Game Plans 
In our Wednesday 10 15 Game Plan we looked at Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ VRTX   VRTX is a pharma play now up 57  YTD and 91  over the last one year period  Notice how the stock grappled with resistance at the round par level in early July before smashing through on 9 19 jumping 6 6  on huge trade  We recommended a buy at the round 100 number on 10 15 and to stress the importance of CLOSING prices notice how it traded as low as 96 43 before recovering almost 5 handles to finish above 100  VRTX is now 16 handles HIGHER from the highlighted entry 
Stocks that can be bought at the round numbers are VRTX  VRTX we last profiled in our Thursday 9 18 Game Plan with a 96 50 cup with handle trigger that was taken out on that session and for good measure it rose an additional 6 6  the following day on enormous trade  taking out the round par figure for the first time ever  It went on to gain almost 10  the following week  The stock has gained 40  YTD and 47  over the last one year period  VRTX is off a quick 11  from its all time high and with the volatility recently in the group  look at GILD today  this name could trade back to par in a heart beat and lets take advantage their with a long position Trigger VRTX 100   Stop 95 30 In our Tuesday 11 4 Game Plan we looked at EA  EA is a best of breed gaming play up a very smart 80  in 2014  On 10 28 the stock gapped up 3 8  after a well received earnings report and pierced the round 40 handle for the first time in 6 years but was unable to CLOSE above it  The following session it closed just beneath it before finally finishing above 40 on Halloween  EA has held that number ever since and it looks like firm support now  Further the weekly chart displays very tight  bullish action the last 2 1 2 weeks  We recommended a buy at 40 25 and it is now UP more than 2  above that pivot and a move above 41 50 can be added to 
Stocks that can be bought at the round numbers are Electronic Arts Inc  NASDAQ EA   EA is a consumer play that is higher by 79  YTD and by 60  over the last one year period  Last week EA reported earnings on Wednesday and it rose 3 8   taking out a 38 40 double bottom trigger in the process  In fact it lost ground just once in 2014 after releasing numbers on 7 23 down 6 2   Other than that it jumped 21 and 1 6  on 5 7 and 1 29  Notice the precise support at the 200 day SMA on 10 15 and the nice finish that session at highs for the day  The stock recently took out the round 40 handle for the first time since the fall of 2008 on Friday  Lets look to enter on a slight pullback toward that figure at 40 25 Trigger EA 40 25   Stop 38 90 
In our Thursday 10 30 Game Plan we looked at Carbo Ceramics Inc  NYSE CRR   CRR is an idea that is still in play on the short side  The stock has made pit stops at 50 point intervals since having issues with the round 150 number in June and July  The 100 level was support in August and September  and now the 50 figure is holding as tenuous support  A drop below the 50 number could be hazardous for this name that is more than 67  off its recent 52 week high made just 4 1 2 months ago 
Stocks to be considered shorting opportunities are CRR  CRR is a member of the energy equipment group and it has been decimated more than actual group  which is hard to do  It is 66   2 3rds of its value not a typo  off its recent 52 week highs  Notice how the round numbers come into play with CRR as the 150 handle was resistance in July  100 was support between the beginning of August through mid September  and now 50 is support for the last couple weeks  This stock REPORTS tomorrow and if it opens higher and then reverses below the round 50 number take a short  do not play it if it gaps below that round number  In that scenario you can try a short if it reverses higher into the 50 handle  Those round numbers are something  huh Trigger CRR 49 75   Buy stop 53 ",2014-11-12,Douglas Busch,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-significance-of-round-numbers-232283,232283

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed last Friday which  heading into the first full week of 2015 week  sees the equity index ETF s looking as though they may continue to the downside 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue in its tight range while oil continues lower  The dollar looks strong and should continue higher while US Treasuries are biased higher  and on the edge of a breakout  The Shanghai Composite continues to look strong but very overbought while Emerging Markets are weak and biased to the downside  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  SPY  IWM  and QQQ  despite the moves lower this week 
Their charts show a downside bias with the QQQ leading the way and the IWM the strongest  possibly confirming a rotation from one to the other  The possible reversal candles seen Friday could always kick in and the indexes might move higher though

121232,342747,VRTX,J P  Morgan Chimes In With Ratings On BioTech Stocks,opinion,J P  Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov rated a slew of bio technology stocks on January 5th  including Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   Regeneron  NASDAQ REGN   Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG   Biogen Idec  NASDAQ BIIB   and Acorda Therapeutics  NASDAQ ACOR   Kasimov s ratings are mostly Bullish  however he has a few reservations about some stocks Vertex Pharmaceuticals Vertex  NASDAQ VRTX  develops new medicines for people with serious diseases  The final readout of Vertex s 12 week Phase II study data of its cystic fibrosis treatment  Kalydeco  in homozygous patients is expected during the first quarter of 2015 Kasimov s firm reiterated an Overweight rating on Vertex with a  130 price target  expecting an eventful 2015 for the company  The analyst anticipates  continued geographic label expansion for Kalydeco plus the likely US EU approval of the VX 809 Kalydeco combo to drive significant top line growth   In addition   There s also the potential for significantly more LT growth driven by VX  661 Kalydeco  which will generate data imminently and is poised to enter an extensive pivotal program in 1H15 evaluating several CF populations  including the difficult to treat heterozygous F508del  Regeneron Regeneron  develops and manufactures treatments for serious medical conditions  The company s key product is Eylea  which is used to treat age related macular degeneration  In the third quarter of 2014  U S sales of Eylea increased 23   marking over 60  of the company s total revenue  In addition  Regeneron currently has 16 different treatments in clinical development Kasimov reiterated a Neutral rating on Regeneron with a  402 price target  citing potential for significant longer term value creation  The analyst noted   It s hard to argue with REGN s recent success  and we believe the pipeline offers the potential for even more long term optionality  That said  we are maintaining a Neutral rating  as we suspect nearer term drivers are largely already appreciated by investors  Gilead Sciences Gilead Sciences shares dropped a couple weeks ago when Express Scripts made a deal with Gilead s competitor  AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   to exclusively distribute their Hepatitis C treatment to their customers  However  Gilead made a comeback by striking a deal with CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  on January 5th in which the pharmacy will now exclusively offer Gilead s hepatitis C drug  Harvoni Kasimov maintained an Overweight rating on the company following the announcement of Gilead s deal with CVS  The analyst explained  This is clearly a positive  albeit unsurprising  development for GILD following the exclusion of its drugs from ESRX s formularies as announced in late Dec   Kasimov thinks   this news should go a long way toward easing fears around GILD s longer term market share  Celgene Corporation Celgene Corporation is best known for developing cancer and inflammatory fighting drugs  The company s best selling drug is Revlimid  a therapy used for multiple myeloma  The drug originally came on the market in 2006  Since then  sales of Revlimid have continued to steadily increase  reaching  1 3 billion in the third quarter of 2014 However  Kasomiv reiterated a Neutral rating on Celgene with a  120 price target  noting a lack of  incremental drivers of near term upside that aren t already appreciated by investors   Although the analyst is  impressed by the continued growth of the Revlimid franchise  strong launches of Pomalyst and Abraxane  and compelling pipeline assets  GED 0301 and earlier partnered programs    He has a neutral rating  as  he  await s  additional drivers that are incremental to current expectations  Biogen Idec Biogen Idec specializes in developing therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative  hematologic and autoimmune diseases  In the beginning of December  Biogen announced positive interim results from an early stage study of their Alzheimer s disease treatment called BIIB037 that attacks amyloid plaques in the brain  The company is now planning to move  aggressively  into Phase III  the most advanced stage of studies  This is generally the last step before seeking regulatory approval Kasimov reiterated an Overweight rating on Biogen with a  407 price target  revealing updated thoughts on the company  The analyst noted   In our view  BIIB s pipeline is one of the most compelling in large cap biotech  with highly innovative programs like LINGO in MS and various Alzheimer s assets that  while early stage  have the potential to produce high profile data in 2015   Beyond this   strength in MS  Tecfidera specifically  and hemophilia should drive top and bottom line growth   Kasmov concluded   All in  we anticipate this combination of meaningful earnings growth plus significant pipeline optionality to generate investor interest in 2015  Acorda Therapeutics Acorda Therapeutics  NASDAQ ACOR  is best known for developing drugs that improve neurological function in people with multiple sclerosis  spinal cord injuries  and other disorders of the central nervous system  Around mid Decemember  Acorda Therapeutics acquired Civitas Therapeutics after Civitas officially cancelled its plans for an initial public offering  Acorda Therapeutics acquired Civitas for  525 million Kasimov set a Neutral rating on Acorda Therapeitics  believing the company has a lack of meaningful catalysts coming into 2015  Although the analyst is  particularly intrigued by the recent acquisition of Civitas  a potentially transformative deal at a purchase price of only  1x management s conservative peak sales estimate  ACOR shares were up 40  in 2014  not leaving much to look forward to in 2015 Cory Kasimov has successfully made 15 general ratings out of 30 total over the past year  earning a 50  success rate recommending stocks and a  16 6  average return per recommendation ,2015-01-06,Uri Gruenbaum,https://www.investing.com/analysis/j.p.-morgan-chimes-in-with-ratings-on-biotech-stocks-237555,237555
121233,342748,VRTX,Massive Froth  Negative Divergence  Leading Sector Breakdowns,opinion,Where to start  We can first take notice of how froth has been consistently out of control for roughly sixty consecutive weeks save two of them  Only two of them have had bull bear spreads of under 30   That was last October when we were correcting  Most of the time we have been above the dangerous level of 35   We have also spent  I believe  at least ten weeks over 40   We are at 42 5  coming in to this week  That s completely out of control  You can pretend to deny it  or even ignore it  but it s not going away just because you re bullish and wish it weren t so Due to the actions of our leader  Fed Yellen  the market has found a way to hold up under this tremendous froth longer than anyone could have thought humanly possible  I  for sure  never thought it possible  The most we have corrected from this type of froth is 9 9  on the S P 500 last year and that loss was taken back very quickly once things calmed down just a bit  The desire to be involved in the market overwhelmed every attempt by the bears  We still don t know  even at 42 5  on the spread  if the froth is actually kicking in for real  Maybe this is nothing more than a simple pullback before trying higher again  It doesn t seem that way to me  but  hey  what do I know  The marker reacted in a way today consistent with froth finally starting to make some noise  I ll discuss more of that below  Today was not a good day for the bulls for many reasons  but  to me  froth was the biggest catalyst to the move lower So what happened today that is really bad for the bulls  We turn our attention to the charts of the transport  biotech  semiconductor  and bank sector charts  All of them with gap downs  and all of them losing  in unison  their 50 day exponential moving averages on those key daily charts  The 20 s on the bios  The first time in a very long time that we have seen that type of behavior  A total change of trend not seen in quite some time  and whenever you have a change of trend of this magnitude  you better take notice Each one of those sector charts have been strong  If one gets sold the market turned its attention to the other sectors to make up the difference  The market found a way to rotate the cash around and keep market prices higher  Today we did not see rotation  and that  too  is a massive change of trend  This is the first time the bulls could not find a way to get a key  leading sector to rise when they needed it to  They lost their hold on the process of rotation  A first  A portent of things to come  Not sure  but definitely worth noticing  If those sectors don t immediately come back  and take those lost 50 s back  things could get ugly very quickly  Four of the key  leading sectors and none of them could stop the bleeding today  Respect it for the potential message that reality may be sending Lessons taught  The market is famous for doing this over and over  Wash  rinse  and repeat this process for what seems like forever  New traders come in and enjoy the fruits of getting involved to some degree with the froth  Over time the stocks run higher and higher and those traders can t take it any longer  The need to get fully involved is overwhelming  Emotion kicks in and they run in to these stocks with everything they have  In this case  those biotechnology stocks  the bubble of this bull market and the allure of what was possible  is just too much fun to not get involved  And as usual  you can t make the following reality up  Biogen Idec Inc   NASDAQ BIIB   the biggest froth of them all  had its largest volume up day ever on Friday  The stock was up tremendously prior  and the emotion was just too high for traders to ignore The same day  the index ETF iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  had its largest volume of the year and it  too  has been slaughtered ever since  I can name many more in that sector but the list is too long  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  NASDAQ VRTX   Kite Pharma  NASDAQ KITE   Bluebird Bio  NASDAQ BLUE   Esperion Therapeutics  NASDAQ ESPR  and many others also culprits of froth  The full list is over thirty long  The carnage too intense to take for most  Some even showing distribution volume off the top  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  for example  These stocks will recover some and have great rallies but the technical damage is in  They should struggle for some time to come in between those quick  strong rallies  The market  in the biggest bubble of this bull  takes out the masses once again  Wash  rinse  and repeat The monthly charts have negative divergences  They also have very elevated oscillators  That combination  over time  usually plays out to the down side  but  of course  timing that is never easy when you have such a protective Fed Governor  Her actions regarding rates are keeping folks involved when one would think it s impossible  The daily chart on the Nasdaq has joined the party regarding negative divergence  Again  there s no way to know if  and when  it ll kick in  but it s there  and needs to be respected  If it plays out  things could get somewhat ugly for a while  The point  of course  being that nothing is easy for the market here when you add up the potential negatives Ms Yellen keeps trying  Maybe she ll get away with it a while longer  but there are enough problems to keep me thinking cash is great  If you want some scratch after today s poor action that s up to you  To me  extreme caution is warranted  That said  and this is very critical for the bears  Stop with the excuses  You have everything on your side  You couldn t ask for more positives  The market needs to stop the rally moves higher every time we have a decent down day  The bears need a thrust lower  No more excuses  Keep the markets oversold the way the bulls keep them overbought  Can t rally hard every time any key  time frame charts hits 30 RSI  The bears have their chance  Time to seize the opportunity and thrust this market lower  We shall see what they can do ,2015-03-26,Jack

121234,342749,VRTX,Will Gilead Sciences Buy Vertex ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  has been rolling in the money since the release of its hepatitis C drug duo  Sovaldi and Harvoni  Now investors are wondering how Gilead will put its pile of cash to work 
In its Q4 earnings report Gilead announced that its cash position had increased from  2 6 billion to  11 7 billion in one year  On top of quadrupling its bank account  Gilead repurchased  5 3 billion worth of stock throughout 2014 
On April 21 Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges put out a note suggesting that Gilead make a bid for Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX   Vertex has a cystic fibrosis drug which appears promising and could fetch huge returns  With Vertex s market cap at  30 billion  Porges  estimate of  45 billion seems reasonable 
Gilead s biggest problem right now is a good one to have  The company is making so money that it needs to find efficient ways to spend its cash  Thus far  management has been a steward of capital  avoiding high risk maneuvers  Gilead s largest expense in the past year was its share repurchase program 
Aside from  5 3 billion in buybacks Gilead s next largest expenditure was the acquisition of Phenex Pharmaceuticals reported back in January which could cost up to  470 million  With the acquisition of Phenex  Gilead wrapped its arms around several potential treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  a common liver disease 

Harvoni was FDA approved in October 2014 and drove a huge earnings beat for Gilead last quarter  This quarter Estimize contributors expect more of the same  The consensus estimate from 140 contributing analysts is that Gilead will report earnings of  2 48 per share on top of  7 04 billion in revenue  Compare that to the estimate from Wall Street   2 16 in EPS and  6 76 billion in sales 
Since the release of Sovaldi in FQ1 2014 Gilead has trampled the Wall Street earnings consensus 3 times and reported in line just once  When biotech companies release new drugs  the first 2 quarters after the release often show a great deal of uncertainty  The Estimize community is setting the bar high in a show of faith that Gilead will report a strong quarter 
The expectation from Estimize is that Harvoni will drive a 68  year over year increase to earnings and a 41  improvement in revenues  Apart from roaring financial results  investors will look to see if Gilead has figured out a way to spend its mountain of cash  potentially on a blockbuster acquisition ",2015-04-29,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-gilead-sciences-buy-vertex-250101,250101
121235,342750,VRTX,Shares of Vertex Increased Nearly 8  In Pre Market Trading,opinion,"On May 12  the FDA advisory committee recommended that the FDA approve Vertex Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ VRTX  Orkambi therapy to treat cystic fibrosis  Shares of Vertex increased nearly 8  in pre market trading following the announcement The FDA advisory committee provides the FDA with independent sources verifying the safety and efficacy of the new therapies  The FDA has agency over making the final approval decision but often follows the advice of the advisory committee  The FDA is expected to announce Orkambi s final approval or rejection by early July 
Orkambi is an oral medication taken in tablet form  It is intended for use in people with cystic fibrosis over the age of 12 who have two copies of the F508del mutation  which is the leading cause of cystic fibrosis  According to Vertex  there are approximately 8 500 people in the United States who fit this criteria  representing the largest group of people with cystic fibrosis  If approved  Orkambi will be the first medication to treat this population of cystic fibrosis patients 
If Orkambi is approved  analysts estimate it could bring in  1 6 billion in revenue over the next year and more than  4 billion by 2020  However  health care experts are already concerned about the potential high cost of Orkambi and the burden it will pose on insurance companies and pharmacies 
According to    of J P  Morgan reiterated an Overweight rating on VRTX with a  138 price target on May 12 following Orkambi approval from the FDA advisory committee  Kasimov noted he was not surprised that the FDA advisory committee approved Orkambi due to  the high unmet need of CF patients and the lack of current treatments   Although  things got dicey for a moment or two  while the advisory committee discussed the drug  the committee ultimately  voted almost unanimously  in favor of its approval  Looking forward  Kasimov remains confident that Orkambi will be approved by July 
Cory Kasimov has rated Vertex Pharmaceuticals 5 times since July 2014  earning a 100  success rate recommending the stock with a  10  average return per VRTX rating  Overall  Kasimov has a 61  success rate recommending stocks with a  10 4  average return per recommendation 
Separately on May 12   of Canaccord Genuity reiterated a Buy on Vertex Pharmaceuticals with a  150 price target 
Walsh expected the FDA advisory committee to vote in favor of Orkambi and is confident that the FDA will fully approve it by July  He added that pricing of the drug may be impacted by a  modest treatment effect observed in P3 trials   However  Walsh s KOL consultants predict Orkambi will penetrate more than 90  of the target population  so  the total Orkambi market opportunity will be primarily determined by price   Walsh continues   However  we remind investors that our reimbursement specialist KOL  who advises pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on pricing strategies  argues that pricing on par with Kalydeco is more likely   Kalydeco is an already approved cystic fibrosis drug developed by Vertex but aimed at a smaller population of CF patients 
Adam Walsh has rated Vertex twice before in the past two months  earning a loss of  1 4  between both ratings  Overall  Walsh has a 76  success rate recommending stocks with a  28 3  average return per rating On average  the top analyst consensus for Vertex Pharmaceuticals on  is Moderate Buy ",2015-05-13,Sarah Roden,https://www.investing.com/analysis/j.p.morgan-and-canaccord-genuity-are-confident-that-vertex-pharmaceutica-251623,251623

 Business
PRQR is an innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of RNA based therapeutics for the treatment of severe genetic disorders  Utilizing unique  proprietary RNA repair technologies  PRQR believes it will be able to treat genetic disorders in which a single protein is defective due to certain types of genetic mutations  
PRQR designs its therapeutic candidates to specifically target and repair the defective messenger RNA  or mRNA  that is a product of a mutated gene in order to restore the expression and function of normal  or wild type  protein  PRQR s primary focus is on the development of a disease modifying therapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis  or CF  a genetic disease that affects an estimated 70 000 to 100 000 patients worldwide and causes early morbidity and mortality  CF is a genetic disease that currently has no cure  The median age of death for CF patients is 27  and more than 90  of CF patients die from respiratory failure  
To date  all but one of the therapies approved to treat CF patients are designed to treat the symptoms of the disease rather than address the underlying cause  CF results from mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  or CFTR  Although there are more than 1 900 different genetic mutations that cause CF  the DF508 mutation that PRQR is targeting is the most prevalent and is present in approximately 70  of all CF patients 
PRQR is also developing a treatment for Leber s Congenital Amaurosis  or LCA  the leading genetic cause of blindness in childhood  Further  based its own research and initial selection criteria  PRQR believes that its RNA repair technologies can potentially be used to treat a broad range of other severe genetic diseases that are currently untreatable or have limited effective treatment options and have to date identified more than 50 potential target indications  
Lead product candidate PRQR s lead product candidate  QR 010  has generated compelling data in pre clinical studies  which PRQR believes supports its potential as a disease modifying therapy for CF patients  PRQR intends to advance QR 010 into clinical trials in CF patients with the DF508 mutation  which affects approximately 70  of all CF patients  In the fourth quarter of 2014  PRQR plans to file an IND  investigational new drug  with the FDA  file a  CTA with the EMA and initiate the first clinical trial directly in CF patients 
PRQR is also studying applications of RNA repair technologies for mutations other than DF508 that could potentially be used to treat an additional 10  of CF patients  including those with the G551D mutation 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics  Inc  agreementIn August 2014  PRQR entered into an agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics  Inc   or CFFT  a subsidiary of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation  pursuant to which CFFT agreed to provide PRQR  with up to  3 million to support the clinical development of QR 010  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is a professional patient advocacy organization that supports select CF drug development programs by providing financial support and access to its Therapeutic Development Network  a network of CF key opinion leaders  as well as to an extensive clinical trial network infrastructure 
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement  PRQR is obligated to make a one time milestone payment to CFFT of up to approximately  80 million  payable in three equal annual installments following the first commercial sale of QR 010  the first of which is due within 90 days following the first commercial sale  PRQR is also obligated to make a one time milestone payment to CFFT of up to  3 million if net sales of QR 010 exceed  500 million in a calendar year  Lastly  PRQR is obligated to make a payment to CFFT of up to approximately  6 million if PRQR transfers  sells or licenses QR 010 other than for certain clinical or development purposes  or if PRQR enters into a change of control transaction  
FinancingTo date  PRQR has financed operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  and to a lesser extent from funding from governmental bodies and patient organizations  including Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics  Inc   or CFFT  a subsidiary of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation  From inception on February 21  2012 through June 30  2014  PRQR raised gross proceeds of approximately  45 6 million from private placements of equity securities  including  2 500 000 from the conversion of a convertible loan   2 588 000 in loans from a governmental body and approximately  143 000 in grants from patient organizations 
As of June 30  2014  PRQR had cash and cash equivalents of  38 193 000  To date  we have not generated any revenues from royalties or product sales  Based on our current plans  we do not expect to generate royalty or product revenues for the foreseeable future  
Intellectual propertyPatent Rights Relating to PRQR s Cystic Fibrosis Program  With regard to the lead product candidate  QR 010  PRQR owns an international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty  or PCT  relating to certain aspects of PRQR s RNA repair technology platform  including method of use claims relating to the use of certain single stranded oligonucleotides  particularly modified RNA oligonucleotides  for making a change in the sequence of a target RNA molecule in a living cell  as well as composition of matter claims relating to PRQR s QR 010 product candidate 
The term of any patents resulting from this application  if issued  would be expected to extend to July 2033   In addition  in May 2012  PRQR entered into an exclusive license agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital  or MGH  to obtain rights to a patent family with claims directed to an alternative RNA repair platform that uses an RNA oligonucleotide complex rather than a single stranded oligonucleotide  
This patent family includes an issued U S  patent with a composition of matter claim directed to an RNA oligonucleotide complex containing two specific oligonucleotide sequences for modulating the expression or activity of a CFTR gene product  and an allowed U S  patent application with method of use claims relating to the treatment of a symptom of cystic fibrosis in a subject by administering to the subject an RNA oligonucleotide complex comprising two oligonucleotides  as well as a composition of matter claim directed to a specific RNA complex for modulating the activity of a CFTR gene product  The issued and allowed claims  however  cover elements of PRQR s RNA repair technologies  but may not cover the QR 010 product or its use  The term of the issued U S  patent is expected to extend to October 2027  and the allowed U S  application  when and if issued  would be expected to extend to March 2025  
In addition  PRQR has rights in a pending U S  patent application in which it will pursue composition of matter claims relating to QR 010  The term of any patent resulting from this application  if issued  would be expected to extend to March 2025 
Patent Rights Relating to PRQR s LCA Program  With regard to the LCA Program  in April 2014  PRQR entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Radboud University Medical Center  Nijmegen  the Netherlands  to obtain rights in a patent family with composition of matters claims directed to certain antisense oligonucleotides for treating LCA and method of use claims relating to modulation of the splicing of the CEP290 gene product  
Patent applications currently are pending in the U S  as well as Brazil  Canada  Australia  Europe  and Eurasia  The term of any patents resulting from these applications  if issued  would be expected to extend to 2032 
CompetitionPRQR believes that a significant number of products are currently under development  and may become commercially available in the future  for the treatment of conditions for which PRQR may try to develop product candidates  PRQR ise aware of multiple companies that are working in the field of CF therapeutics  including major pharmaceutical companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ VRTX   F  Hoffmann LaRoche Ltd   Novartis  NYSE NVS   Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD   Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   Targeted Genetics  Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   and Bayer AG NA  XETRA BAYGN  
If PRQR s lead product candidate  QR 010  is approved for the indications currently being pursued  it will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently marketed  For example  Vertex s Kalydeco is approved for use by the FDA and works to improve the function of the defective CFTR protein in CF patients with the G551D mutation and certain other gating mutations  Vertex is currently seeking marketing approval for additional mutations  which would increase Kalydeco s target population to up to 10  of the total CF patient population  Vertex is also developing lumacaftor  VX 809   which is intended for a  much broader CF patient population  including patients who are homozygous for the DF508 mutation  In June 2014  Vertex announced that its two Phase 3 clinical trials of lumacaftor  when used in combination with Kalydeco in CF patients homozygous for the DF508 mutation  showed statistically significant improvement in the study s primary endpoint of improved lung function  compared to placebo  Clinical trial results are considered statistically significant when the probability of the results occurring by chance  rather than from the efficacy of the drug candidate  is sufficiently low 
When that probability is less than 5   or pOther signs of clinical improvement were either limited or not statistically different from placebo  PRQR believes these studies validate that DF508 CFTR is a treatable target and indicate there is need for more efficacious therapies  There are also a number of products that are marketed or in clinical development for the treatment of symptoms manifested in CF patients  These treatments include inhaled antibiotics  mucus thinners  pancreatic enzymes and anti inflammatory drugs
