8438,229953,RS,Is Reliance Steel A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 11  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 89  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Reliance Steel s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Reliance Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 93  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel has a P S ratio of about 0 57  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel currently has a Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Reliance Steel is just 1 55  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 61  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives RS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen seven down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 8 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped by 3 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus      Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineReliance Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a top industry rank  among Top 10  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence on the stock On the flipside  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector  Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without  More importantly  it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices  I encourage you to get the report now   before the next wave of innovations really take off ,2017-08-24,Zacks Investment

8453,229968,RS,Trump s Steel Import Probe  U S  Steel Over Reliance ,opinion,"Domestic steel maker United States Steel and its foreign rival Reliance Steel are scheduled to report first quarter earnings next week  Both companies are expected to come up with stellar performances  Which of these will come out ahead  Such a comparison comes into sharp focus considering Trump s latest policy imperative  steel imports 
Trump Probe Bolster Steel Stocks
After being stuck in a long rut  steel stocks rebounded yesterday  The industry s rebound was backed by President Trump s announcement of an investigation into whether cheap steel imports from China and other nations are hurting our national security  President Trump said yesterday that  steel is critical to both our economy and our military  and it is a  historic day for American steel   Following this statement shares of United States Steel   NYSE X    AK Steel Holding Corporation   NYSE AKS   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   increased 7 4   8 6  and 6 8   respectively 
U S  Steel had acknowledged earlier that it entered 2017 with improved market conditions than what it had faced at the onset of 2016  The company said that it expects net earnings of around  3 08 per share for 2017 should market conditions remain robust  This came as a breather for the company s analysts after it incurred an adjusted loss of  1 60 per share last year 
Reliance Steel   Aluminum   NYSE RS    in its fourth quarter of 2016  projected demand to be up by 8  to 10  on a sequential basis in the first quarter of 2017  Moreover  the company had forecast average selling price to increase 2  to 4  from the fourth quarter of 2016 
Price Performance
Shares of both United States Steel and Reliance Steel notched up gains in the last year but U S  Steel is a clear winner on this count with a return of more than 55 9  in the last twelve months  In contrast  Reliance Steel increased only 7   falling behind the S P 500 which rallied around 11 6  during the same period 

Valuation
Though United States Steel and Reliance Steel belong to different Zacks categorized industries  the average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio is one of the best valuation multiples for the steel sector  This is mainly because steel companies have a large amount of debt and EV  Enterprise Value  

Coming to EV EBITDA  United States Steel is the one which lags behind with a ratio of 12 12 compared with 7 18 for the  industry  On the other hand  Reliance Steel has an EV EBITDA ratio of 9 74  which is in line with the  industry  

Dividend Yield

In the last year  the dividend yield for Reliance Steel was higher than the broader industry  While the Metal Producer Distributor industry offered a yield of 1 15   Reliance Steel returned 2 34   U S  Steel falls marginally short on this count  providing a dividend yield of 0 66  compared to the industry average of 1 12  

Earnings History and ESP
Riding on higher revenues  Reliance Steel posted profits of  61 7 million or 84 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents  Additionally  its revenues rose around 1 7  year over year to  2 06 billion in the reported quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03 billion   Read more   
In contrast  U S  Steel recorded net loss of  105 million or 61 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016  The results included unfavorable adjustments of  152 million  However  barring one time items  earnings were 27 cents per share that outstripped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a penny per share  Moreover  revenues of  2 650 million trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 666 million  but increased 3  year over year   Read more   
Considering a detailed earnings history  Reliance Steel delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 7 1   In comparison  United States Steel delivered an earnings beat in only two of the trailing four quarters  but posted an average positive earnings surprise of more than 630   When considering   Reliance Steel s ESP is at 4 32   while United States Steel s ESP stands at 14 71  
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that Reliance Steel holds an edge over United States Steel only when considering dividend yield and valuation  However  U S  Steel registered a better price performance  has a better Earnings ESP and delivered a significantly higher average positive earnings surprise  Also  on the rank front  U S  Steel sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Reliance Steel carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

8455,229970,RS,Nucor  The Best Shining U S  Steel Stock,opinion,"Recent History of Steel Stocks
The U S  steel industry has been in a downtrend since the 2008 global recession due  in large part  to China s dumping of cheap steal into the market  The chart below illustrates just how much the imbalance of China s imports and exports of steel has widened since 2009 
Source  This supply and demand imbalance has pushed steel prices lower which has weighed heavily on producers such as United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  and Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD   However  sentiment for this sluggish industry changed following the election of President Donald Trump and his  America First  focus 
What Makes Steel Stocks Shine Now 
Just last month  President Trump ordered a   The potential outcomes of this Section 232 investigation could be additional tariffs and or  limiting imports of foreign made steel  This could help inflate U S  steel prices which would ultimately help U S  steel manufactures 
Global demand also appears to be on the uptrend  The  reported in April that the global steel capacity utilization is up by 26   its highest level in nearly two and half years 
More recently on May 24th   Credit Suisse   the entire steel sector highlighting that its  channel checks with U S  traders and OEMs indicate that a structural change is taking place with respect to U S  trade  which the market is underestimating  
Tailwinds appear to be building in the U S  steel market 
Why Nucor 
Nucor Corporation is an American steel and related products producer  It is the largest steel producer in the U S  and also the largest minimill steelmaker  The use of minimills in steel manufacturing rather than traditional methods of melting the scrap steel adds more value to Nucor when compared with traditional manufacturers such as U S  Steel Corp and AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  
Minimills are already experiencing a comeback and have been a bright spot in the industry  Bradford Research  that profits for minimills are up 50  to 100  compared to this time a year ago 
In addition  Nucor is a well diversified and well positioned U S  steel company  Over the last several years  the company focused on expanding its business in new areas such as Canada and Mexico to help combat geographic specific downturns  These precautious actions should pave the way for tremendous growth going forward in addition to any potential comeback in the U S  steel market 
The company s 2016 EBITDA and EBITDA margin of  2 116 and 13 1   respectively  reached a level not seen since 2008  Furthermore  the company s unique  helped Nucor stay profitable though the steel industry s downturn as shown below 
Nucor s profit and returns are also well above its industry peers and the materials sector as a whole as illustrated below 
Peers include  X  Commercial Metals Company  NYSE CMC   AKS  Worthington Industries Inc  NYSE WOR   Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  NYSE RS   Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation  NYSE AP  and Handy   Harman Ltd  NASDAQ HNH   
Nucor s Quality Margin of Safety
Nucor shares also look attractive on a fundamental cash flow basis  When applying Wall Street projections to eleven separate valuation analyses  finbox io calculates an intrinsic value estimate of  62 75 that implies 8  upside 
Nucor is a diversified  high quality business with a consistent track record and looks to be trading at a discount  A potential increase in global demand coupled with President Trump s trillion dollar investment plan and section 232 investigation provide additional upside for Nucor shareholders

8456,229971,RS,Should Value Investors Consider Reliance Steel   Aluminum  RS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 64  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel   Aluminum s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Metal Products   Distribution industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 34  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel   Aluminum stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a P S ratio of about 0 60  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel   Aluminum currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel   Aluminum a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Reliance Steel   Aluminum is just 1 48  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 67  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel   Aluminum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives RS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat positive trend the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineReliance Steel   Aluminum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 42  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two year  the Zacks Metal Products   Distribution industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More

8458,229973,RS,Reliance Steel   Aluminum Stock Shares Fall as Company Cuts ,opinion,"Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  
Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  NYSE RS   metals service center company yesterday announced that they be cutting their second quarter 2017 guidance numbers 
Reliance now expects their second quarter diluted earnings to be in between  1 30 to  1 40 per share which is down from previous guidance numbers of  1 50 to  1 60 per share 
Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Comments
 As a result of challenging market conditions  the positive momentum experienced for both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2017 did not accelerate as originally anticipated into the second quarter of 2017  In addition  increased uncertainty in regard to metals pricing has placed downward pressure on the Company s gross profit margin  Despite these changes in market conditions  Reliance continues to believe that it can sustain a reported LIFO gross profit margin within the range of 27  to 29    
RS Technical Analysis


RS opened trading yesterday at  72 99 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  72 44  RS closed trading yesterday at  72 51 and crashed down after market to  67 70  equivalent to a 7  decrease from the closing price 
Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time RS traded below these levels we have to go back to November 4th  2016 when it traded at  67 03  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down RS had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to March 1st when it traded at  86 27  RS has a  of 70 41 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see RS open trading on Tuesday below  69 30 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My  would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

Factors to Consider
Reliance Steel  last month  provided its updated earnings outlook for the second quarter  The company anticipates earnings per share in the range of  1 30  1 40 for the second quarter of 2017 compared with the previous outlook of  1 50  1 60 per share Reliance Steel announced that the favorable momentum it witnessed with respect to demand and price in the first quarter of 2017 will not accelerate into the second quarter as it had expected earlier owing to challenging market conditions  The company s gross profit margin also witnessed a downward pressure due to increased uncertainty in metals pricing   Reliance Steel remains optimistic regarding market demand and lower imports  The company is expected to gain from strong momentum across automotive and aerospace markets  It is also likely to benefit from its aggressive acquisition strategy  broad and diversified product base and wide geographic footprint  The company also remain focused on boosting gross profit margin and maximizing market opportunities to drive earnings while managing operating expenses and inventory levels  However  the company s business in the energy markets is expected to remain under pressure due to depressed oil pricing  The non residential construction market  Reliance Steel s biggest end market  also remains on a slow road to recovery  Reliance Steel s shares have lost 5 2  in the last three months  underperforming the  s decline of 2 4    Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Reliance Steel is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Reliance Steel is currently  0 73   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at  1 37 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 38 per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  Although Reliance Steel s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Note that Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions  Stocks to Consider Here are some other companies in the industrial space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  AGCO Corporation   NYSE AGCO   has an Earnings ESP of  2 88  and a Zacks Rank  1 You can see  AptarGroup  Inc    NYSE ATR   has an Earnings ESP of  1 03  and a Zacks Rank  2  Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT   has an Earnings ESP of  2 38  and a Zacks Rank  2  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market  Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2017-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reliance-steel-(rs)-to-post-q2-earnings:-what's-in-store-200203024,200203024

8478,229993,RS,Should Value Investors Pick Reliance Steel   Aluminum Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 01  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 48  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel   Aluminum s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 15 03 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Nonetheless  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 55  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel   Aluminum stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a P S ratio of about 0 71  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 56 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel   Aluminum currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel   Aluminum a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Reliance Steel   Aluminum is 12 00  a level that is lower than the industry average of 15 89  Clearly  RS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel   Aluminum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives RS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below However  this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s prospects in the near term look good Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus    Bottom LineReliance Steel   Aluminum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a Zacks Rank  3  the stock enjoys an impressive Zacks Industry Rank  among top 2  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  which hints at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb

8480,229995,RS,5 Best Bets For The Q2 Earnings Season ,opinion,Now that the focus has shifted from the surprise outcome of the British referendum  market direction is likely to be guided by the Q2 results  The formal commencement of the earnings season is about a week away  but major companies that have already reported are revealing a trend that has a lot in common with the last five quarters However  there are some factors working in favor of results this time around  Commodity prices have recovered substantially and forex woes have also receded to a large extent  This is why it makes good sense to pick stocks that are likely to report strong Q2 results and also have strong fundamentals to back them Energy  Finance  Tech Likely to DisappointOil prices have posted quarterly gains due to a weaker dollar  fall in the U S rig count  rise in gasoline consumption and worldwide outages  However  results from energy companies are likely to be the most disappointing and will weigh on Q2 earnings as a whole  According to Zacks estimates  total earnings for the sector s S P 500 stocks will fall by 78 9  on a 27 1  decline in revenues The other major sectors  which will act as a drag on Q2 earnings  are finance and technology  Q2 earnings for the finance sector s S P 500 stocks are projected to fall by 5 8  on a 0 3  decline in revenues  A soft interest rate environment and sliding benchmark treasury yields are the primary reasons for the sector s woes In technology s case  Apple s  AAPL  earnings alone will weigh on other stocks from the sector  A 28 4  fall in earnings is expected for the iPhone maker on a 15 2  decline in revenues year on year  This will send the sector s earnings 4 5  lower despite a 0 4  increase in revenues  Why Q2 Could be BetterSecond quarter earnings will begin in earnest with Alcoa  NYSE AA  reporting on Jul 11  Some S P 500 companies that have already released results offer a mixed picture  However  a fair conclusion can only be drawn after more companies report earnings  As of now  Zacks estimates for S P 500 companies indicate that earnings will decline by 6 2  on a 0 7  decline in revenues Despite the fact that this could be the fifth successive decline in earnings  an improvement in the current trend could still emerge  This is because of the significant recovery in commodity prices  Additionally  the dollar had declined somewhat during the quarter  which in turn was one of the reasons for an increase in oil prices Our ChoicesDespite the fact that we are likely to witness another decline in earnings  the overall picture could still improve  This is why it may be prudent to invest in stocks which are likely to post favorable Q2 results One could narrow down the list using a positive Zacks  as a guide  along with a favorable Zacks Rank    1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement

Factors to Influence Q2 Results
Interpublic derives a major portion of its revenues from outside the U S  This exposes the company to foreign currency translation impacts  A stronger dollar can have an adverse impact on second quarter revenues  In addition  the company faces other risks like local legislation  monetary devaluation  exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions  which may hamper revenue growth in the to be reported quarter 
Uncertainties regarding Brexit affected the markets through the latter half of the second quarter of 2016  leading to the referendum in late June  These macroeconomic risks make companies cautious about advertising and marketing outlay  thereby squeezing advertising budgets  This might prove to be a strain on Interpublic s upcoming quarterly results  Also  advertising companies are currently under pressure as major advertising spenders are reviewing their agency accounts 
However  Interpublic s digital capabilities  diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage to its clients  The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration integration across agencies through technological improvement  Moreover  the company continues to look for strategic investments acquisitions to expand in high growth regions and key world markets For 2016  the company has a cautious stance and expects organic revenue growth of 3 4   with 50 basis points of operating margin improvement over the previous year

8505,230020,RS,Margin Debt And The Next Stock Market Crash,opinion,The latest fear on Wall Street is that record levels of margin debt may end up toppling the stock market rally  NYSE margin debt recently reached its highest level since 2007 before the last major stock market peak and credit crash  Stephen Suttmeier  technical research analyst at Bank of America  noted that margin debt rose 28  in March from a year ago to  380 billion  That figure is slightly below the July 2007 peak of  381 billion  although analysts speculate that April s margin debt totals  which haven t yet been released  have already surpassed this mark Suttmeier told The Wall Street Journal that the currently high margin debt levels are  contrarian bearish   While high margin levels have coincided with major market tops of the past  there s an important twist to this particular indicator  In order to confirm that a top has been made  margin debt levels normally turn down before major indices like the S P 500 peak  See the following graph  courtesy BoA Merrill Lynch  It s no surprise people have been taking on more risk as the market has moved to record highs   writes Steven Russolillo in The Wall Street Journal   But the question is what happens when the easy ride higher turns south and some of that margin debt turns into margin calls   The article goes on to warn of a potential selling wave if stock prices reverse and margin calls lead to mass liquidation   A wave of margin calls can worsen selling pressure on stocks and was seen as partly to blame for the market s woes during the financial crisis   writes Russolillo  While it s true that rising margin debt levels should be viewed as a potential yellow flag for the stock market  other indicators don t yet suggest the rally has reached bubble proportions  As economist Ed Yardeni pointed out in a recent    Valuation multiples aren t flashing irrational exuberance yet  but that could change quickly in a debt financed melt up of stock prices   Yardeni suggests that while NYSE margin requirements have been unchanged since January 1974  Fed Chairman Bernanke could boost the requirement later this year in response to charges that the Fed s stimulus program is leading to a stock market bubble  Lest investors forget  margin requirement hikes can take a huge toll on investor psychology and can completely take the wind out of a market s sails  Remember the gold and silver margin increases of 2011  anyone  GoldThe price of gold was last quoted at  1 422  basis June futures  after slipping on May 10  After a decent short covering rally since bottoming in mid April  gold has encountered resistance at the overhead 30 day moving average intersection at the  1 478 level   The all important test of support following the April bottom is likely underway  This is normal following a major bottom and recoil rally like we ve seen in the gold market in recent weeks  After the initial rally it s common for price to test the previous low   either by making a higher low  a double bottom or  if worse comes to worse  a lower low  The current pullback and test of support over the next few days will be very revealing as to just how strong and serious the buyers really are  One reason I haven t recommended long positions in gold yet despite the recent close above the 15 day MA is the fact that gold s relative strength line still hasn t broken its downward trend  Currently the relative strength line for the gold ETF  IAU  is testing the recent lows in a sign of relative weakness  Relative strength  RS  isn t an infallible indicator for gauging the upside or downside potential of gold but at the same time it s not something to be ignored  An upward reversal of the RS line from here would be a welcome change of gold s internal condition and would give us greater confidence in gold s internal strength going forward ,2013-05-12,Clif Droke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/margin-debt-and-the-next-stock-market-crash-166558,166558

8526,230041,RS,Is Reliance Steel  RS  A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 16  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 22  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 14 11 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Industrial Products Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 64  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Reliance Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 31  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel has a P S ratio of 0 55  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives RS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one upward and two downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the current year estimates have seen two upward revisions and two downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate inched down 0 8  over the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineReliance Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 41  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best performing

8587,230102,RS,Is Reliance Steel  RS  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors   ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 44  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 08  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 52  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers    We should also point out that Reliance Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 57  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Reliance Steel has a P S ratio of about 0 72  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  RS is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Reliance Steel currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for Reliance Steel is just 0 72  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 96  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles      What About the Stock Overall    Though Reliance Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of D  This gives RS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen four upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period      This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 8  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has improved by 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus
 
   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Reliance Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 18  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Metal Products   Distribution industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ",2019-12-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-reliance-steel-rs-a-profitable-pick-for-value-investors-200494925,200494925

8628,230143,RS,Stockbeat   U S  Steel Jumps Despite Goldman Warning Low Prices Signal Pain Ahead,news,"Investing com   United States Steel rallied on Tuesday despite Goldman Sachs downgrading the company and warning that the backdrop for the steel industry is flimsy amid  materially  lower steel prices 
United States Steel  NYSE X  was up 4 8   shrugging off the downgrade amid a broader based rally in markets as expectation for an interest rate cut after Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said the central bank would  act as appropriate  to support the domestic economy 
Goldman Sachs downgraded U S  Steel to sell from neutral  The investment house also cut its price target on the stock to  11 from  17  warning lower steel prices will lead to further earnings cuts and possibly hurt the company s bloated balance sheet  U S  Steel hit a 52 week low of  11 67 on Friday  The Goldman downgrade is fairly aggressive  The consensus target of analysts polled by Investing com is still  18 15 
The bank also cut its price targets on a slew of the other names in the sector including  Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD   AK Steel  NYSE AKS    Nucor   NYSE NUE    Schnitzer Steel   NASDAQ SCHN  and Reliance Steel   Aluminum  NYSE RS  
 Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016  and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the U S  market   said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn 
President Donald Trump said last month the U S  would lift steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada and Mexico  But also left the door open to reimpose the tariffs if the two nations failed to curb any surge of metals imports beyond historical levels 
As part of the U S  Mexico Canada Agreement  the trio agreed to more closely monitor where the metals imported into North American originate from  with China accused of flooding the market with cheap metals ",2019-06-04,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--us-steel-soars-despite-goldman-warning-low-prices-signal-pain-ahead-1887958,1887958
