14464,235979,JEF,Asset managers farm out trading as costs and complexity climb,news,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Helen Reid
LONDON  Reuters    It s 10 o clock at night  and Benjamin Arnold s day is just beginning  The former Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  trader is gearing up to trade equities in Asia from his small office thousands of miles away in Park City  Utah 
He s not trading his own book  but rather is taking orders and executing trades for a client  an Asian asset manager 
After almost 15 years working at hedge funds and banks  Arnold launched an outsourced trading firm  joining a growing crop of niche companies aiming to tap burgeoning demand for outside help from small and mid sized asset managers 
 There comes a time when you have to decide between standing by and watching the world change or stepping up and becoming that change   the 37 year old said 
A heavier regulatory burden on money managers  razor thin margins and rapid technological developments in trading are driving many to cut costs and hire outside firms to handle their day to day trading 
The pace of demand has accelerated this year in particular as asset managers feel the pinch following the introduction in 2018 of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive  MiFID II  which slapped more onerous paperwork on them 
It is as much as 40  cheaper for small to medium sized fund firms to hire an external trading company than employ two traders themselves  according to interviews with executives from more than a dozen asset managers  banks and brokerages  as well as industry experts 
Michael Broadbent at Ergo Consultancy  which helps set up trading desks and advises fund managers on regulation  has seen a  giant switch  this year 
 It is almost impossible for an in house trading team to stay focused on every new and opening liquidity venue  electronic broker  non incumbent exchange and crossing network while continuing to execute their existing business to a MiFID II standard of best execution   he said 
The industry is still in its infancy  but industry experts say it is one of the fastest growing segments in prime brokerage  which covers the complex financial services needs of big institutions 
They reckon about two dozen firms offer outsourced trading services with at least four  including  Wells Fargo   N WFC   BTON Financial and Arnold s Meraki Global Advisors  venturing into the business this year  That compares with just a handful a few years ago  they say 
Last month  mid sized broker INTL FCStone  O INTL  bought U S  outsourcer Fillmore Advisors to bolster its prime brokerage offering 
The gap in the market being filled by boutique outsourcers  like Fillmore  Arnold s Meraki  Tourmaline Partners and CF Global  is prompting some big banks and brokerages to try to grab a slice of the action 
 Northern Trust  Corp  O NTRS  and Jefferies Financial Group  N JEF   for example  have set up their own outsourcing teams of traders working for a range of clients 
Such outsourced trading desks effectively work as units of  buy side  investors like asset managers  and include all the analysis  administration and compliance services an in house team would provide  They are distinct from a bank or brokerage s regular  sell side  trading operations which simply execute trades on a client s behalf 
GROWING POPULARITY
One in every five fund firms with over  50 billion worth of assets will outsource some portion of their trading desks by 2022  according to research by financial consultancy Opimas  Global revenues in the outsourced trading business are about  450  500 million annually and expected to grow 20 30  a year  it said 
The practice of farming out trading functions has been around for years  but it is becoming increasingly attractive for small and mid sized asset managers who may not be trading frequently or in big enough volumes to justify the cost of maintaining an in house desk 
Opimas estimates it works out cheaper to hire an outsourced firm if an asset manager s equities trader is handling less than  1 5 billion in annual trading volume 
 We like to stick to our knitting   said Karen Zachary  chief operating officer of Crux Asset Management  which uses Northern Trust to handle all its day to day trading so it can focus on strategy 
London based EdenTree Investment Management  with 2 7 billion pounds   3 28 billion  assets under management  is considering outsourcing its dealings  said one of its fund managers  Chris Hiorns 
By outsourcing  asset managers would typically spend about 5 basis points per trade  compared with the equivalent of around 8 basis points if they traded in house  according to the market players and researchers interviewed 
Experts estimate it costs about  1 5 million per year to operate a three member trading desk  and small to mid sized fund firms typically employ two to three traders  Then there are the costs of reporting trades to regulators and additional compliance due to MiFID II 
Needs vary among asset managers  some like Crux hire an outside company to handle all their execution  while London based Hermes Investment Management  for example  relies on CF Global for its emerging market and Asia ex Japan equities  and keeps its own traders for other assets  Some use trading firms to cover inconvenient time zones like Australia 
 8 BILLION PER TRADER
For the banks and brokerages who are increasingly offering outsourced trading  it represents a much needed source of extra income as they too have been squeezed by regulation and are grappling with perennially low interest rates 
 The sell side is facing its own challenges  as fixed costs are rising while the commission pool is shrinking   said Richard Johnson  a senior analyst at research firm Greenwich Associates 
 Within this dynamic  outsourced trading desks have created a strong niche and compelling value proposition  
U S  based Northern Trust ventured into the business almost two years ago and now has 32 clients including Fundsmith and Mobius Capital Partners 
Gary Paulin  head of institutional brokerage at Northern Trust  said his outsourcing team of 18 traders processed equity trades worth  145 billion last year for its various clients 
That s about  8 billion per trader 
Jefferies Prime Brokerage launched its outsourced trading business in June last year  and now has 70 clients  according to John Laub  co head of prime brokerage at Jefferies 
According to Laub  under 10  of their start up clients were using outsourced trading in 2016  while the figure for start up funds today is  north of 70   
Aside from cost savings  outsourced trading desks also offer big broker networks  which are increasingly necessary under MiFIDII 
The rules require money managers to prove to clients they have traded in the most efficient way possible   known as  best execution    piling on extra pressure as they battle competition from passive funds  which track markets rather than trying to outperform them 
 It s a really cumbersome process with around 80 reporting fields  it s a real pain and it costs money   said Paulin at Northern Trust 
Tourmaline Partners  for instance  says it has access to 400 brokers through its almost 40 traders in London  Stamford in the United States and Sydney  Australia 
They handled  175 billion worth of trades last year  Andrew Walton  head of its European business  said he expects that to rise by a fifth this year 
For experienced traders like Meraki s Arnold  this fast growing outsourcing sector also offers a new lease of life as bustling trading rooms steadily dwindle in the era of algorithms and automation 
 I believe that outsourcing in the asset management community is still in an early growth phase and that more and more managers will utilize firms like ours   he said ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/asset-managers-farm-out-trading-as-costs-and-complexity-climb-1946403,1946403

134288,355803,JEF,Cryptocurrency Flash Crash Is Said to Draw Scrutiny From CFTC,news," Bloomberg     A popular digital coin exchange is drawing scrutiny from U S  regulators over a June flash crash that erased most of the value in the second largest cryptocurrency before traders had time to blink their eyes 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has requested information from Coinbase Inc  about a June 21 incident on its GDAX platform in which the ether digital token suffered a precipitous drop  falling to 10 cents from  317 81 in milliseconds before quickly recovering  said two people familiar with the matter 
Among the issues the agency is focused on is what role leverage might have played in the plunge  as Coinbase allowed traders to use borrowed money to make bigger wagers than would have otherwise been possible  said the people  who asked not to be named because the review isn t public 
The CFTC inquiry is the latest sign that federal authorities are growing worried about a market with scattershot oversight that has attracted big money  Coinbase  which says it has served 10 6 million customers and facilitated  20 billion in digital currency transactions  is regulated by various states through a patchwork system 
It s not registered with the CFTC  the main U S  watchdog of currency futures  Coinbase doesn t allow traders to buy and sell derivatives  and firms don t typically fall under the regulator s direct jurisdiction unless they allow swaps trading  Coinbase does hold licenses with financial agencies in dozens of states  as well as Puerto Rico  according to its website 
 Full Cooperation 
The CFTC sent San Francisco based Coinbase a letter with a list of questions  including queries about margin trading  one of the people said  Coinbase began offering margin accounts in March  as it sought to attract institutional investors by providing them loans to amplify their bets  The company disabled the service after the June crash 
 As a regulated financial institution  Coinbase complies with regulations and fully cooperates with regulators   the company said in an emailed statement   After the GDAX market event in June 2017  we proactively reached out to a number of regulators  including the CFTC  We also decided to credit all customers who were impacted by this event  We are unaware of a formal investigation  
CFTC spokeswoman Erica Elliott Richardson declined to comment 
 12 5 Million Trade
Coinbase s ether plunge was caused by a single  12 5 million trade    one of the biggest ever    that prompted selling by other investors  The decline triggered automatic sell orders from traders who d requested to bail on the currency if prices dropped to certain levels  and led GDAX to liquidate some margin trades 
While the drop was dramatic  it was also temporary  Computer algorithms quickly started issuing buy orders that drove prices back up to  300 within 10 seconds 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have surged this year  But regulators and financial executives are concerned that investors are inflating a bubble that s destined to pop  South Korea banned margin trading in bitcoin and ether Sept  29 after China earlier cracked down on digital currencies  Last month  JPMorgan Chase   Co  Chief Executive Officer Jamie  NYSE JPM  Dimon likened cryptocurrencies to the infamous Dutch tulip bulb mania of the 17th Century 
Sharp Reversal
One risk of allowing margin trades is that in a sharp market reversal  trading platforms could run into problems if investors can t repay the money they ve borrowed 
That s what happened in January 2015 when the currency brokerage FXCM Inc  almost toppled after Switzerland shocked markets by letting its currency appreciate  When the franc jumped  FXCM customers lost more money than they had in their accounts  forcing the company to seek a  300 million bailout from Leucadia National Corp 
Coinbase s GDAX had a margin  NYSE LUK funding limit of  10 000  To qualify  investors had to meet at least one of several qualifications laid out under federal law 
For instance  individuals can only trade with borrowed money if they have more than  5 million invested in various financial markets and are using their margin accounts purely to hedge risks  Individuals are exempt from the hedging requirement if they have more than  10 million invested  The rules are looser for institutional investors  such as hedge funds and corporations 
Rising Complaints
Last year  the CFTC sanctioned a different digital token market  Bitfinex  for allowing investors who didn t meet the  10 million threshold to make margin trades  Bitfinex also broke the law because it didn t deliver some bitcoins that investors had bought using leverage within a required timeframe  the CFTC said  Instead  it held the tokens in accounts that it owned and controlled  according to the regulator  Bitfinex agreed to pay  75 000 to settle the case  without admitting or denying the allegations 
Coinbase has suffered outages and other performance problems as it s struggled to handle the surge in volume that s accompanied skyrocketing cryptocurrency prices  It has also faced a sharp increase in customer complaints  Almost 500 consumer grievances have been flagged about the company this year on a database maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  compared with just six for all of 2016 
Coinbase and investors who use it to trade have piqued regulators  interest in the past  In 2016  the Internal Revenue Service asked a court for permission to serve a summons against Coinbase  seeking records about taxpayers who have traded digital currencies 
It also has attracted prominent investors including Marc Andreessen s venture capital firm and the New York Stock Exchange  In August  Coinbase received  100 million from a group led by Institutional Venture Partners  a Menlo Park  California based venture capital firm ",2017-10-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/cryptocurrency-flash-crash-is-said-to-draw-scrutiny-from-cftc-535278,535278

134307,355822,JEF,5 Excellent GARP Picks With Discounted PEG,opinion,The investment pattern of the millennials is gradually tending toward hybrid investment from pure play theories like growth or value  According to them  to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined GARP  growth at a reasonable price  investment  often known as a special case of value investment  is finding prominence among new generation stakeholders  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  And here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the growth element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening The Timken Company   NYSE TKR    This company develops and

134367,355882,JEF,Folger Hill hedge fund stumbles after pedigreed start,news,By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne BOSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Folger Hill Asset Management has suffered through investor redemptions and losses that have cut the hedge fund firm s assets by nearly one third from its 2015 peak  people familiar with the situation told Reuters  Launched in 2014 by an acolyte of SAC Capital Advisors founder Steven A  Cohen  Folger Hill was one of the most prominent hedge funds to come on the scene  Its founder  Solomon Kumin wanted it to be similar to SAC in that it would have many portfolio managers pursuing a variety of strategies for high returns  Kumin raised about  1 1 billion by telling investors its diverse array of stock market bets through talented managers meant Folger Hill would perform well in good markets and bad  But through mid August  its main fund was down about 5 percent  having recovered from more severe losses earlier in the year  said the sources  They were not authorized to publicly disclose performance information  which is closely guarded in the secretive  3 trillion hedge fund industry  Recent declines have occurred after a 3 2 percent drop in 2015  As of mid August  Folger Hill s assets had fallen to about  750 million from its post funding peak as some investors who were able to redeem their funds lost patience  Brad Balter  managing partner at hedge fund investment firm Balter Capital  said the drop was consistent in the industry with people leaving funds with high fees that do not perform quickly   That s not a plus for high fee models   Balter said  Folger Hill is far from being the only struggling hedge fund  The industry s performance has suffered in recent years  because of factors ranging from low interest rates to subdued volatility to bad bets on individual stocks  Hedge funds have also taken a reputational hit as a small but highly publicized group of big investors have abandoned them  But Folger Hill s decline is notable because of the high hopes that accompanied its launch  Kumin had been chief operating officer at Cohen s SAC  which generated annual returns of 30 percent  on average   SAC pleaded guilty in 2013 to civil charges of insider trading  agreed to stop managing funds for outside investors and paid a  1 8 billion fine  Cohen settled with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission this year and was barred from managing outside investor money until 2018  Soon after SAC s plea deal  Kumin started raising money for his own fund   Kumin told potential investors he expected to deliver strong returns in all markets and that there would be tight risk controls  according to marketing material viewed by Reuters  Folger Hill required a steep  5 million minimum for the privilege of being an investor  It charged performance fees of up to 20 percent  in addition to expenses  for those who could redeem their money the most easily  Kumin  41  is a horseracing fan who named his fund after a place in Nantucket for sentimental reasons  He located Folger Hill s offices in New York and Boston  where he owns a townhouse in the exclusive Beacon Hill neighborhood  One of the horses he has an ownership stake in  Wavell Avenue  won the Breeders  Cup Filly and Mare Sprint last year  Another  Exaggerator  won the Preakness Stakes and placed second at the Kentucky Derby this year  FEE PRESSURE Kumin scored a big win when Jefferies Group parent Leucadia National Corp  NYSE LUK  provided an anchor investment of  400 million  The firm committed its capital for five years ending in August 2019  Leucadia Chief Executive Richard Handler and President Brian Friedman joined the Folger Hill s board  Some investor share classes required commitments of as much as three years  according to fund materials seen by Reuters  Other investors who agreed to pay hefty fees have no lockup period  In an emailed statement  Handler said Leucadia stands behind Folger Hill   Folger Hill has recently gained some positive momentum with their performance and new portfolio hires over the past 3 4 months   Handler said   We look forward to helping them continue to build their firm   Balter Capital s Balter said multi manager hedge funds in particular are falling out of favor given their relatively high fees  Losing bets can easily cancel out winners because their investments are so diversified  Although Folger Hill s losses in 2015 happened as rival multi managers posted some of the best returns in the hedge fund industry  it has more company in losing this year  Multi manager funds including Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s Senfina Advisors and Citadel s Global Equities fund are doing poorly     Big name funds with other strategies  like Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management  Brevan Howard Asset Management and Tudor Investment Corp are also struggling  During his time at SAC  Kumin built a reputation as one of Wall Street s best talent scouts  He stacked his own firm with people who had worked at places such as Highfields  D E  Shaw   Co  PointState Capital and BlueCrest Capital Management  An important condition of employment  managers who lost 10 percent peak to trough could be fired  Folger Hill let a handful of managers go earlier this year as losses mounted  one person familiar with the firm said  Its main fund lost 13 percent in the first quarter  largely because of an 8 percent drop in February  Folger Hill in the past few months hired new portfolio managers  including two analysts from Citadel  It now employs 17 portfolio managers in total  Despite its troubles  the firm is moving ahead with plans to launch an Asia focused strategy in October  according to a person familiar with the situation  The person said the firm has already raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the strategy

134393,355908,JEF,FX broker FXCM gets rescue from Jefferies parent Leucadia,news,"Retail foreign exchange broker FXCM Inc   NYSE FXCM  reeling after customers lost more than  200 million from the surging Swiss franc  will get a  300 million loan from Leucadia National Corp  NYSE LUK  to keep operating  the companies said in a statement Friday 
Large global banks and retail brokerages were hit hard by the Swiss National Bank s sudden move Thursday to scrap its three year old cap on the value of the Swiss franc against the euro  EUR CHF  
FXCM said Thursday that client losses may have left the brokerage with too little capital Leucadia  the parent of investment bank Jefferies  which advised on the deal  will invest  300 million in a two year senior secured term loan with an initial coupon of 10 percent  The deal  which was expected to close Friday afternoon  also gives Leucadia an undisclosed percentage of a potential sale of FXCM 
 Leucadia s support and this financing are by far the best alternative for FXCM  our customers  our shareholders  and all other relevant constituencies   said Drew Niv  FXCM chief executive officer 
Top executives from FXCM went through company books until at least 5 a m  on Friday  according to a source close to FXCM  Regulators were in FXCM s offices in downtown Manhattan  according to two sources 
FXCM needed to act quickly  In its Thursday statement  the brokerage said client losses would result in a shortfall to the company of about  225 million and that it  may be in breach of some regulatory capital requirements  
 The key factor here is time  as regulators tend to be impatient once capital requirements are breached   analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a Friday note 
In its statement  Richard Handler  Leucadia s CEO  and Brian Friedman  the firm s president  said they had worked with Jefferies and FXCM over the  past approximately 36 hours  to come to a deal  UBS acted as financial advisor to FXCM 
FXCM shares lost nearly 90 percent in premarket activity on Friday to  1 49 a share  and did not trade during the regular New York Stock Exchange trading session  The shares resumed trading in the after hours session  recovering a bit from the premarket losses  but the stock  FXCM K  was still down 70 percent to  3 81 a share from Thursday s close of  12 63 
Those who sold the stock in premarket action Friday morning will take big losses  The fact is if you sold at  1 49 in premarket that s a decision you made and you re out of it   said Ken Polcari  director of the NYSE floor division at O Neil Securities in New York 
Shares of Leucadia were halted during the trading day at  21 84 a share  They lost 0 8 percent to fall to  21 04 after resuming trading in after hours action In Washington  a spokeswoman for the U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission said earlier that the agency was reviewing the company s situation but declined to give details 
FXCM and other brokerages were hit hard after the Swiss National Bank surprised markets by abandoning its cap against the euro  That caused the euro to suffer its biggest ever one day fall against the franc  dropping 18 percent for the session and losing some 30 percent on an intraday basis 
 BLACK SWAN  EVENT
Retail currency trade makes up nearly 4 percent of global daily spot turnover of nearly  2 trillion  the latest survey from the Bank of International Settlements shows  having grown from almost nothing in the 1990s 
In a note to clients  Sandler O Neill analyst Richard Repetto wrote  we ve been informed that FXCM offered clients leverage of 50x  often the standard in the U K   for EUR CHF  euro Swiss franc  trades  
 We believe this high leverage combined with the unique  black swan like  event of the floating of the Swiss franc contributed to the steep customer losses at FXCM   he wrote 
Black swans are events seen as improbable and come as a major surprise to the market  Such events happen much more often than most market participants expect 
Shares of other brokers with retail foreign exchange businesses were mixed on Friday 
Interactive Brokers Group Inc  NASDAQ IBKR  lost 0 6 percent to close at  28 09 a share  The company said customers lost  120 million beyond their collateral  equal to less than 2 5 percent of the company s net worth

134394,355909,JEF,Echoes Of Swiss Franc Shock Reverberate Around The World,news,"By   

The Everest Capital Global hedge fund may be neither the first nor the last currency market participant to feel the pain caused by the Swiss National Bank s surprise decision to discontinue its fixing of the minimum exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro last week  but the fund s suffering might be notable because it appears to have resulted in its shuttering  Bloomberg News reported 
Marko Dimitrijevic  who founded Everest Capital LLC in 1990  will close his company s largest fund due to losses associated with massive movements in the currency market after the Swiss National Bank s unexpected announcement Thursday that it was abandoning its policy of pegging the exchange rate at 1 20 Swiss francs per  1 00  according to a person familiar with the firm cited by Bloomberg News 
Basically  Everest Capital Global had bet  big  the Swiss franc would depreciate in value  indicated Bloomberg News  source  who requested anonymity because the information is private  Based in Miami and Singapore  the company had about  830 million in assets under management at its largest fund at the end of last year  according to a client report cited by the news agency 
An emerging markets specialist  Everest Capital will continue to manage more than  2 billion in assets at its other funds  which do not have the same kind of exposure to the Swiss franc as did their sibling  a person familiar with the company told the Wall Street Journal 
Other hedge fund firms suffering Swiss franc shock include the London based Comac Capital LLP  managing  1 2 billion  and the South Norwalk  Connecticut headquartered Discovery Capital Management LLC  managing  14 7 billion  the Journal reported 
Armel Leslie  an Everest Capital representative at the public relations agency Peppercomm  declined to comment to Bloomberg News about the Global fund s closing  And Everest Capital did not reply to an email message about it sent by International Business Times before the publication of this article 
The Swiss central bank s surprise move to scrap its three year old policy on the euro Swiss franc currency pair  or EUR CHF  caused the franc Thursday to skyrocket as much as a record 41 percent against the euro and to soar more than 15 percent against all the 150 plus currencies tracked by Bloomberg  the news agency said 
It also led to important losses for Barclays PLC  Citigroup Inc  and Deutsche Bank AG  among other financial institutions  Bloomberg News reported 
The extent of the currency related pain at FXCM Inc   an online provider of foreign exchange trading services  resulted in the Leucadia National Corp  agreeing to supply the company with  300 million in cash financing  the firm said in a statement Friday 
FXCM said the financing would enable it  to meet its regulatory capital requirements and continue normal operations after  Thursday s  loss of  225 million due to the unprecedented actions of the Swiss National Bank  
Under the agreement  Leucadia invested  300 million in FXCM in the form of a senior secured term loan with a two year maturity and an initial coupon of 10 percent  the loan recipient said  Both parties are based in New York 
FXCM CEO Drew Niv said in the statement   Leucadia s support and this financing are by far the best alternative for FXCM  our customers  our shareholders and all other relevant constituencies

Below is a summary of key details being shared by FXCM  which are updates from previous reports 

 203 million debt outstanding   as of September 30th  FXCM owes Leucadia  203 million from the  300 million of funding provided to them in January  This is greater than the  195 million figure announced in mid September  The increase is most likely linked to additional accrued interest since FXCM s previous update

Taking the unusual step of reporting after the close on a Friday last week was Leucadia National Corporation  N LUK   Within the forex world  Leucadia is best known for having provided  300 million in financing to FXCM  N FXCM  following the January 15th 2015 Swiss franc crisis that nearly sent the global broker out of business  In the aftermath  FXCM has been selling non core assets to cover the debt and is emerging as a retail focused forex broker 
As part of its Q4 results  Leucadia provided an update on its relationship with FXCM  According to Leucadia  as of December 31st 2015  FXCM had  192 7 million debt outstanding with it after having paid  144 7 million of principal  interest and fees during 2015  The  192 7 million figure is a decrease from the  203 million amount reported by FXCM for the end of September 
In addition  the deal with Leucadia included variable payments that would be owed to Leucadia beyond the debt s principal and interest portion of their agreement  These payments include 50  of the next  350 million  then 90  of the next  500 million and 60  of any amount thereafter  By including these payments  Leucadia in essence has set itself up for a large payday in the event that FXCM is sold  with it slated to collect well over 50  in any acquisition price  Also included was the right by Leucadia to require FXCM to sell itself  thus allowing Leucadia to profit on the variable portion of their financing agreement 

Towards the end of December 2015  shares of FXCM rocketed higher from below  6 to just under  20  While short covering had been cited as providing a boost to FXCM s shares  helping ignite the firm were also rumors of an agreement with Leucadia of a debt restructure to allow for more long term value creation for FXCM shareholders  There can be no assurances that an agreement will be reached On this subject  Leucadia stated that it had in fact  discussed restructuring the variable portion of distributions in a manner that is consistent with a sustainable long term and value enhancing strategy for both companies   However  it added that  there can be no assurances that an agreement will be reached  
For Leucadia  the improvement in FXCM s stock price allowed it to increase the stated fair value of its investment in FXCM to  625 7 million  This is an improvement from  613 million that was recorded by Leucadia in at September 30th 2015  Overall  according to Leucadia  the firm stated that it recognized  491 3 million of unrealized and realized gain on the FXCM investment for 2015

	The Dow was still able to close at a fresh record with a gain of 0 24   or about 58 points  to 24 290 1  However  at one point this morning  the index was up by more than 250 points  The S P spent most of the session on the positive side  yet finished lower by 0 11  to 2639 4  Another big story right now is the ongoing flight from tech  which continued today with a 1 05  plunge in the NASDAQ to 6775 4 
	This promises to be another busy week  The tax drama is not over yet  as the House and Senate versions need to be reconciled before making it to President Trump s desk  Also  there s a heavy schedule of economic data all set for the first full week of December  which will end with the Government Employment Situation report on Friday  And we ll also have to keep our eyes on Congress and its attempt to agree on a funding bill by Friday to avert a government shutdown

	 But both chambers still have to reconcile their differing bills into one for the President to sign  Most are optimistic that this will get done in short order  But nothing is done in DC until it s done 
	 However  traders likely became a bit cautious ahead of Friday s  Dec  8th  deadline for a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown  Leaders of both parties will meet with the President at the White House on Thursday  But that leaves little room for error  Hopefully  some compromise can be reached  Nobody  whichever side of the aisle you re on  wants to see a shutdown  especially during the holidays      Kevin Matras

134436,355951,JEF,Is Leucadia National  LUK  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Leucadia National Corporation   NYSE LUK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Leucadia National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 7  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Leucadia National s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 18 5  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Leucadia National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Leucadia National has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Leucadia National currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LUK a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Leucadia National is just 1 1  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  LUK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Leucadia National might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives LUK a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past thirty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 3 6  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has risen nearly 6 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Leucadia National Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLeucadia National is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a decent industry rank  top 42  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio

Fed Describes Q1 Sluggishness as Temporary

5 Top Ranked Stocks to Buy on Service Sector Gains 

	Following the recent spate of disappointing economic reports  the economy finally sent out a crucial positive signal on Wednesday  Data released by both the Institute of Supply Management and private information provider Markit indicated that the services sector had undergone an expansion in April 

	Meanwhile  even as it took cognizance of sluggish growth conditions at its recently concluded meeting  the Fed believes such weakness is temporary  The central bank expects growth to pick up later this year and it makes good sense to invest in stocks from the services sector  given that they account for a bulk of the country s GDP 

ISM Services Gauge Improves

	The ISM services index increased from the level of 55 2 recorded in March to 57 5 for April  This is the second highest reading recorded over a period of 18 months 

	Additionally  April marks the 88th consecutive month of gains for the index  Growth was experienced across most industries  with 16 of the 18 services sectors experiencing expansions  Leading the pack were the wholesale and retail trade  arts  utilities and mining sectors 

	Both the ISM Prices Index and Business Activity Indexes experienced increases  Notably  the New Orders Index increased from 58 9 to 63 2 in April  which is the gauge s best reading since Aug 2005  Additionally  the Markit U S  Services PMI increased from 52 8 in March to 53 1 in April  According to the information provider  growth has now been experienced in every single survey period since Mar 2016 

Fed Describes Q1 Sluggishness as Temporary

	Acknowledging a cooling off in the economy during the first quarter  the Fed refrained from raising rates at its recently concluded two day policy meeting  Unlike the completely bullish tone of earlier minutes  the Fed also said that household expenditure had increased only modestly and inflation remained below its target have come to of 2  

	At the same time  the central bank dismissed the slowdown in first quarter GDP growth as transitory  According to the Fed  job gains have been  solid   justified by continuing growth in consumer spending  As per estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  personal income increased  40 0 billion or 0 2  in March against the Consensus estimate of 0 3   The central bank also hopes that  gradual adjustments  in monetary policy would result in expansion of economic activity  strengthening of the labor market  and stabilization of inflation rate around 2  over the medium term 

Our Choices

	An expansion in services activity indicates that the sector is in fine fettle  Continuous growth has ensured that services are well poised to gain from the pickup in growth in the months ahead 

	Adding stocks from the sector to your portfolios looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 

	This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

134486,356001,JEF,Crane  CR  Poised For Growth Despite Macroeconomic Risks,opinion,"On Nov 30  2016  Zacks Investment Research downgraded renowned diversified operations company Crane Co    NYSE CR   to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  from a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Going by the Zacks model  companies with a Zacks Rank  3 have strong chances of performing in line with the broader market 
Why on Hold  
Crane Co  s business is currently encircled a number of bullish and bearish aspects 
Following the third quarter 2016 release  Oct 24  2016   Crane Co  shares recorded an average return of 21 43   which outperformed the average Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry return of 5 63   The company is poised for long term growth on the back of a large client base and diversified product portfolio  Also  new acquisitions  higher demand from Fluid Handling as well as Payment   Merchandising customers are expected boost near term sales and profitability 
Based on these positives  Crane Co  revised its full year 2016 adjusted earnings guidance range to  4 12  4 20 per share from  4 00  4 20 expected earlier  Free cash flow is now anticipated in the  200  225 million range as against  195  220 million expected earlier  A greater cash flow will enable the company to return more to its shareholders  Over the long term  Crane Co  targets total payout ratio of 40 50  
However  we note that the benefits from the aforesaid aspects might be partially offset by certain headwinds  Crane Co  expects normal seasonality to hamper engineered materials and merchandising systems businesses  while less favorable mix is likely to impact fluid handling business in the fourth quarter 
The company s geographical diversification exposes it to adverse currency movements as well as adverse trade regulations and uncertain economic conditions in the foreign markets it serves  Also  intense competition exposes the company to risks of market share loss 
Over the last seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock is pegged at  4 18 per share for 2016 and  4 43 per share for 2017  reflecting brokers  neutral stance   CRANE CO Price and Consensus

134503,356018,JEF,Danaher  DHR  Q3 Earnings Top Estimates  Revenues Up Y Y,opinion,Danaher Corporation   NYSE DHR   reported adjusted earnings of 87 cents a share in third quarter 2016  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents by 4 8   Notably  adjusted earnings increased 22 5  on a year over year basis The upside in the company s bottom line can be attributed to its effective Danaher Business System   DBS   that focuses on three critical areas    quality  delivery  and cost   innovation  Moreover  a decent top line performance led to high teens adjusted earnings growth during the quarter Revenues by SegmentDanaher reported total sales of  4 132 1 million  reflecting an increase of 17 7  year over year  However  the sales figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 149 million Improvement in third quarter revenues mainly came on the back of positive contributions from acquired businesses  which accounted for 14 5  of growth   Also  core businesses grew 3  year over year  The company s diversified portfolio was conducive to top line growth This is Danaher s first earnings release since it completed the spin off of Fortive Corp    NYSE FTV   on Jul 2  The spin off was announced in second quarter 2015  Post spin off  Danaher has reorganized its business into four segments  namely Life Sciences  Diagnostics  Dental  and Environmental   Applied Solutions Life Sciences revenues rose 64 6  year over year to  1 325 million  Operating margin for the quarter increased 900 basis points  bps  to 15 4   Robust sales of mass spectrometers particularly in China  India and Western Europe led to the sales growth  Also  strong demand for flow cytometry and particle counting products added to the strength of this segment  It also benefited from increased government investment in China  Impressive growth in operating margin came on the back of higher sales volumes and incremental year over year cost savings associated with restructuring actions and improved productivity Revenues at the Diagnostics segment increased 3 1  year over year to  1 213 million  Also  operating margin at the segment increased 250 bps  year over year to 16 0   Higher sales of consumables in China  Europe  India and North America fueled growth in the acute care diagnostic business  and drove this segment s growth  Also  increased demand for advanced staining instruments and consumables mainly in North America and China favored the top line  Operating margin growth was driven by higher sales volumes  improved productivity and cost savings associated with restructuring actions Revenues at Dental were up 3 7  year over year to  676 million  Also  operating margin increased 20 bps to 15 0  Sales growth for this segment was driven by strong demand for implant systems  particularly in high growth markets  Also  higher sales of orthodontic products  primarily in Western Europe  China and Russia as well as dental equipment in high growth markets beefed up the top line  Growth in operating margin was mainly led by cost savings associated with restructuring actions and other productivity improvement initiatives At the Environmental   Applied Solutions segment  revenues were up4 3  year over year to  918 million  However  operating margin declined 20 bps to 25 3  on a year over year basis  Impressive performance by the water quality business  product identification businesses  marking   coding equipment  packaging and color solutions and lab chemicals drove sales Also  on a year over year basis  operating profit margin improved 320 basis points to 16 9  Notable Activity during the QuarterDuring the quarter  Danaher Corp  inked a definitive agreement to buy molecular diagnostics company Cepheid   NASDAQ CPHD   for  53 00 per share  Under the deal  Cepheid will become part of Danaher s diagnostics unit  The deal makes strategic sense as Danaher has a huge diagnostics business  but does not enjoy a strong foothold in molecular diagnostics  in which Cepheid is a market leader Cepheid s comprehensive installed base  test menu and pioneering product portfolio will fortify Danaher s presence in this high growth segment  Per Danaher  Cepheid s addition will boost operational efficiencies and expand margins in its  5 billion worth diagnostics unit  Cepheid is likely to generate  618  635 million in revenues this year  which will add to Danaher s  5 billion revenue base This apart  the company has also announced the acquisition of Phenomenex that will bolster its Life Sciences segment  Both of these acquisitions are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 DANAHER CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    LiquidityDanaher exited the quarter on Sep 30  2016  with free cash flow of  701 million  a significant increase from  518 million recorded as of Oct 2  2015 GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release  Danaher provided its guidance for fourth quarter 2016  The company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  1 01 to  1 05 Also  Danaher raised its full year 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to  3 57 to  3 61 from the previous range of  3 53 to  3 60 Our TakeDanaher s DBS model has helped it to deliver yet another impressive quarter  Danaher is gradually evolving as a healthcare company  It has widened its presence in the healthcare and dental markets  which are expected to benefit from the rise in the aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness  Also  the company s strategic acquisitions have acted as a fundamental catalyst  propelling the top line significantly  Going forward  we believe Cepheid and Phenomenex buyouts will help the company unlock multiple growth opportunities in its Diagnostics and Life Sciences segments Danaher currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Another equally ranked stock in the sector is Leucadia National Corporation   NYSE LUK    You can see  Leucadia National is a diversified financial services holding company engaged in personal and commercial lines of property and casualty insurance  life insurance  banking and lending and manufacturing  This company has been witnessing upward revisions in its 2016 earnings estimates over the past four weeks from 11 cents to 20 cents Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are

134538,356053,JEF,Danaher  DHR  Beats On Q2 Earnings  Guidance Lowered,opinion,Danaher Corporation   NYSE DHR   reported adjusted earnings of  1 25 a share in second quarter 2016  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 09 by 14 7   Notably  adjusted earnings increased 16 8  on a year over year basis The upside in the company s bottom line can be attributed to its effective Danaher Business System   DBS   that focuses on three critical areas    quality  delivery  and cost   innovation  Moreover  a decent top line performance boosted high teens adjusted earnings growth during the quarter Revenues by SegmentDanaher reported total sales of  5 785 million  reflecting an increase of 16 6  year over year  However  the sales figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 798 million Improvement in second quarter revenues mainly came on the back of positive contributions from acquired businesses  which accounted for 15  of growth   Also  core businesses grew 2  year over year while currency fluctuations had an adverse impact of 0 5  on sales Revenues at the Test   Measurement segment declined 3 5  year over year to  650 million  Also  operating margin at the segment declined 210 basis points  bps  to 22 2   The overall decline in revenues was triggered by a slowdown across all major geographies and product lines The decline in operating margin was a result of poor sales at existing businesses  strengthening of the U S  dollar and rise in operating expenses on account of product development  sales and marketing growth investments Revenues at the Environmental segment increased 7 5  to  958 million  Also  operating margin at the segment was down 140 bps year over year to 21 1   Price increases of products at this segment proved conducive to sales  Higher sales of instruments and related consumables and services in Western Europe  China and Latin America fuelled growth at the analytical instrumentation product line  Also  strong performance of chemical treatment solutions and ultraviolet water disinfection product lines boosted the top line Higher costs associated with product development  sales and marketing growth investments and foreign currency headwinds proved to be a drag on the operating margin performance Life Sciences and Diagnostics revenues rose 41 5  year over year to  2 603 million  Operating margin for the quarter increased 90 bps to 16 4   Growth of the installed base of instruments in Asia and consumables sales in Europe and China fuelled growth at the Diagnostics business in the quarter  Higher sales of the company s broad range of mass spectrometers and microscopy products proved conducive to sales Impressive growth in the operating margin came on the back of higher sales volumes and incremental year over year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and improved productivity Revenues at the Dental segment were up 4  year over year to  715 million  Also  the operating margin increased 110 bps to 15 3   Growth in dental sales came on the back of increased demand for implant systems  particularly in Western Europe and orthodontic products in all major markets  Also  strong sales of dental equipment in North America added to the strength of this segment  Growth in operating margin was mainly led by cost savings associated with restructuring actions and other productivity improvement initiatives At the Industrial Technologies segment  revenues inched down 0 5  to  859 million while the operating margin declined 30 bps to 25 3   both on a year over year basis  Weaker demand in business  packaging and color solutions in geographies like North America and other high growth markets proved to be a major drag  Also  weak demand in agricultural and construction and certain medical related end markets proved to be a drag on automation sales LiquidityDanaher exited the quarter on Jul 1  2016  with cash and equivalents of  4 097 6 million  a massive increase from  664 3 million recorded as on Apr 1  2016  The company s long term debt declined to  12 007 7 million compared with  12 194 7 million as on Apr 1  2016 GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release  Danaher provided its guidance for third quarter 2016  The company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 80 cents to 84 cents for the quarter However  on account of the recent Fortive Corporation   NYSE FTV   spin off and other adjustments  Danaher has revised full year adjusted earnings guidance down to  3 53 to  3 60 from the previous range of  4 85   4 98 DANAHER CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Going ForwardDanaher posted yet another quarter of impressive financial results with both decent year over year growth in the top and bottom line amid macroeconomic headwinds  Going forward  we are particularly upbeat about the company s prospects post the Fortive spin off  Danaher will now have about  16 5 billion in sales and will be in a better position to focus on its life sciences  filtration  water quality and product identification businesses  The new company called Fortive will be headquartered in Everett  WA  This split will expand the opportunities for capital deployment for both the companies  Also  the thriving biopharma markets  company s leading brands  dominant share in multi billion markets and solid customer base add to its strength Despite this long term growth potential  we believe that the company s downward revision of full year earnings estimates mirrors the escalating adjustment costs related to the split that will likely put margins under pressure  Also  softness in certain product lines in major geographies coupled with currency fluctuations will likely weigh down on this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company s

134559,356074,JEF,Energy Recovery  Actuant  Mylan  Wells Fargo And Leucadia National Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   October 03  2016    highlights Energy Recovery  NASDAQ      as the Bull of the Day and Actuant  NYSE       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   NASDAQ     Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   NYSE     and Leucadia National  NYSE LUK   NYSE      

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

Energy Recovery  NASDAQ       is an energy solutions provider to industrial fluid flow markets  The stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and today it is the Bull of the Day 

Why I Like It

	This is a small cap stock in a  risk on  environment 

	Small cap stocks have been out performing of late 

	Consistent monthly increases in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 and 2017

	Potential return to favor sector following recent OPEC news 

Follow Brian Bolan  and on  at the same address  

The Recent Numbers

	I like to do a review of the most recent quarter for stocks that I highlight as Bulls of the Day  ERII reported the June 2016 quarter back in early August  so we are a month away from the company reporting the September quarter 

	The most recent quarter was a beat on bottom  The company posted EPS of  0 01 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for a loss of  0 01  Revenue came in  1M below expectations for a 1 2  negative revenue surprise  As a result  the stock was bid up by 12 5  in the session following the report 

Description

	Energy Recovery is an energy solutions provider to industrial fluid flow markets  The Company s solutions convert wasted pressure energy into a reusable asset and preserve or eliminate pumping technology in hostile processing environments  It operates through two segments  Water  and Oil   Gas  Its Water Segment focuses on products sold for use in reverse osmosis water desalination  Its Oil   Gas Segment consists of products sold for use in gas processing  chemical processing  and hydraulic fracturing 

Earnings History

	The company has a good history of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  There has been one miss  one meet and three beats in the last five reports 

Estimates

	The estimate picture is a thing of beauty  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 moving higher in each of the last four months  The 2016 number moved from  0 43 in June to  0 50 in July  Then two cents were added in August and another three cents in September to bring the current estimate to  0 55 

	The 2017 number also moved higher with the 2016 estimate  jumping up from  0 38 in June to the current reading of  0 47 

Valuation

	Investors have to pay up for growth like this  Keep in mind that ERII is slated to show earnings growth of nearly 600  and revenue growth of more than 115  this year  This has driven the forward PE to more than 29x while the industry average is at 22x  The price to book multiple of 14x seems out of whack  but the 5x industry average is also looking rather high  Finally  the 16x price to sales number should adjust lower when this year is over and the growth is in place 

  

Actuant  NYSE       keeps beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on top and on bottom  It is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is the Bear of the Day  Let s take a look at why this is the case 

Description

	Actuant  headquartered in Milwaukee  Wisconsin  is a diversified industrial company with operations in 15 countries  Actuant offers products under such established brand names as Enerpac  Gardner Bender  Milwaukee Cylinder  Nielsen Sessions  Power Packer  and Power Gear 

Recent Earnings

	ATU beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 29 by a penny  Revenue came in at  276M while the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for  278M 

Estimates

	The Zacks Consensus Estimate has been falling over the last few months  The FY16 estimate stood at  1 58 in December of last year and then fell to  1 36 in April  The estimate currently states at  1 08 

	Next year has also seen a move lower in estimates with the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from  1 90 to  1 36 over the same time period 

	The decline in estimates is the main reason this is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and the Bear of the Day

Here s What an Investment Bank CEO Told His Employees About Inequality

	After the recent controversies that resulted in the CEOs of Mylan  NASDAQ     and Wells Fargo  NYSE      testifying before Congress  the American public is understandably skeptical of corporate leadership  Richard Handler  the CEO of investment bank Jefferies and its parent company Leucadia National  NYSE       is trying to make sure his clients trust his company 

	Handler s method of ensuring trust in his company came in the form of an open letter to his clients reminding them to be understanding about the income divide in this country  Handler s note pointed out that the gap between the  haves  and the  have nots  has grown  and he highlighted the frustration of many people struggling in this country

	Nevertheless  Handler made it clear that Jefferies would not stand for this type of behavior in its own ranks
