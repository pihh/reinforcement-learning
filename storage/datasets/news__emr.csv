14478,235993,EMR,Deere s Dour Outlook Tests Faith in Manufacturing Rebound,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Deere   Co  results show the trouble with reading the economic tea leaves 
The maker of tractors and construction equipment slumped on Wednesday after announcing a  depressed outlook for fiscal 2020 that caught investors off guard  Deere expects net income to be no higher than  3 1 billion next year  a decline relative to 2019 and well below the  3 46 billion analysts had been modeling  Here was investors  response 
The root of the disappointment is Deere s expectation that global agricultural and turf equipment sales will slump 5  to 10  next year  Heading into earnings  there was optimism that Deere might even see growth in that division  should the prospect of a trade deal and the Trump administration s plans to pump financial support into the farming industry incentivize growers to finally swap out aging equipment  Indeed  data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that capital spending excluding aircraft  increased in October by the most since the start of the year  adding credence to the idea that the slowdown in industrial growth is bottoming out 
With the trade war still lingering in the background  though  it appears Deere CEO John May isn t banking on much of anything  That seems the prudent path to take  For one  May only just ascended to the CEO role this month and is likely disinclined to set goals he can t guarantee in such an uncertain environment  3M  NYSE MMM  Co  s Michael Roman  who s cut guidance an  absurd number of times in his short tenure  should probably take note   But even CEOs who have been around for a while would have trouble predicting how their customers will act six to nine months down the road  This industrial downturn has been different from others in that it s not a function of supply and demand dynamics but of political uncertainty  Manufacturing data can naturally be lumpy given the volatile timing of big projects  or in the case of this year  the General Motors Co  NYSE GM   labor strike  But the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations makes the trajectory of any recovery particularly  difficult to predict 
The tariffs that China and the U S  have levied against each other have made inventory management something more akin to an Olympic sport as companies try to get ahead of the levies but also guard against getting stuck with a bunch of unwanted goods  That challenge was reflected in Deere s outlook  Looking at the broader market  Deere expects demand for agricultural equipment to drop 5  in the U S  and Canada  while the European  South American and Asian markets are seen remaining flat  That s not as severe as Deere s forecast for its own business  a dynamic which Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says likely reflects an expectation that dealers are still sitting on too much inventory and will work through that before placing new orders  An upwardly revised GDP figure released Wednesday of 2 1  for the third quarter also reflected inventory accumulation    
Point being  no one really knows anything  and  everyone is afraid of moving in the wrong direction  One reason Deere s lackluster guidance hit its stock particularly hard is that the forecast wasn t accompanied by much detail on restructuring that the company had previously indicated would be forthcoming  The company will implement a voluntary separation program for some employees that should save about  150 million annually when combined with 2019 cost cutting efforts  If the outlook is really as bad as Deere claims  though  you would think we would see something more substantive on cost cuts  But to get aggressive with restructuring  Deere also has to be confident that this market isn t going to turn around on a dime if there is in fact a legitimate trade deal  lest it end up short staffed  
The Trump administration is quickly running out of ways to describe the trade talks and proximity to a  phase one  agreement  One day we were down to the   short strokes   the next we re in the rather morbid sounding   final throes   But while investors are more than happy to price in those words as a done deal  CEOs are thinking differently  Deere s downbeat guidance follows similar outlooks from   Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   and  Emerson  NYSE EMR  Electric Co  that in certain lights could be construed as conservative  Or they might just be accurate ",2019-11-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deeres-dour-outlook-tests-faith-in-manufacturing-rebound-2029718,2029718
14479,235994,EMR,Exclusive  Former Honeywell CEO in bid talks for Vertiv   sources,news,"By Rebecca Spalding and Mike Spector
 Reuters    A company led by former Honeywell International Inc  N HON  chief executive David Cote and backed by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  is in talks to acquire U S  backup power equipment firm Vertiv for more than  5 billion  including debt  according to people familiar with the matter 
Cote s firm  GS Acquisition Holdings Corp   is a so called special purpose acquisition company  SPAC   which raised  690 million in an initial public offering last year to buy a company without telling investors in advance what that would be 
GS Acquisition could use the money it raised in the IPO  in addition to debt financing  to acquire Vertiv from private equity firm Platinum Equity  The negotiations are ongoing  and there is no certainty a deal will be reached  the sources said  asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential  Vertiv has also drawn interest from other potential bidders  one of the sources added 
Vertiv declined to comment  Representatives for Platinum Equity and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Cote could not be immediately reached for comment 
Based in Columbus  Ohio  Vertiv manufactures systems and provides maintenance for backup power and other safety systems to data centers  communication networks  and commercial and industrial environments 
Vertiv is the former network power business of Emerson Electric  N EMR   which Platinum Equity acquired three years ago for about  4 billion  in one of the largest deals the Los Angeles based buyout firm had ever completed  Emerson kept a minority interest in the company  according to a statement at the time 
In 2017  Platinum agreed to sell Vertiv s automatic transfer switch business to Schneider Electric  PA SCHN  for  1 25 billion 
Reuters reported last year that Platinum Equity was exploring a sale of Vertiv with advice from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  
Cote served as Honeywell s CEO between 2002 and 2017  He is now leading Goldman s first SPAC  as the investment bank seeks to expand its asset management division ",2019-12-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-former-honeywell-ceo-in-bid-talks-for-vertiv--sources-2031840,2031840
14480,235995,EMR,Democratic presidential hopeful Klobuchar sets out tough stance on China  Russia,news,"By Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar on Wednesday said she would rebuild U S  foreign alliances and take tougher stances on U S  relations with China and Russia than President Donald Trump if she is elected 
 We don t seek conflict with China or Russia  but we are also not going to allow them to break up the international system that has enabled peace  stability  and prosperity   she said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington 
Trump has provided military aid to Ukraine to help it fight Russian backed separatists  but critics say other policies  like the withdrawal of U S  forces from northern Syria  have aided Russian leader Vladimir Putin  He has introduced tariffs on Chinese goods  igniting a trade war  but has not been eager to criticize China over human rights abuses 
Foreign policy has not been front and center in the nominating contest  in which 15 Democrats are competing to take on Trump in the November 2020 election  beyond criticism of Trump s diplomatic style 
But progressive U S  Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have contrasted their dovish foreign policy approaches with former Vice President Joe Biden  who is leading in the polls and emphasizes restoring U S  alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  
Klobuchar said she would recommit the United States to NATO and strengthen sanctions to combat what she called Putin s  aggression  
She said the United States should speak out about China s treatment of Uighur Muslims and the crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong  although she said those issues should be not be part of trade negotiations with China 
 We don t want to prevent China from growing and succeeding  but we do want to prevent it from doing so at the expense of others  including Americans   she said 
She dismissed Trump s seemingly tough stance on China as  rhetoric  and said his trade war was costing U S  jobs
Like other Democrats  Klobuchar would strengthen U S  diplomacy  but was also committed to  maintaining our military superiority over any adversary that would challenge us   she said  adding  duplicative and unnecessary  military spending should be reviewed 
Klobuchar only gets between 2  and 3  in most nationwide polls on the Democratic nominating contest but has polled better in some states that vote or caucus early 
An Emerson  NYSE EMR  College poll in Iowa conducted between Dec  7 and 10 found that 10  of Iowans would support Klobuchar in that state s Feb  3 caucuses  the first in the nation ",2019-12-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/democratic-presidential-hopeful-klobuchar-sets-out-tough-stance-on-china-russia-2039262,2039262

The firm estimates 750 000 barrels of oil production per day from the region by 2025  However  the integrated energy player s downstream   chemical units significantly underperformed in the first nine months of 2019  The units are unlikely to recover in the fourth quarter owing to scheduled maintenance activities

173701,395217,EMR,Fly Emerson Air  How a U S  company deploys its seven corporate jets,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Tim McLaughlin BOSTON  Reuters    As Tiger Woods staged his dramatic comeback at Augusta National Golf Club earlier this year  most of Emerson  NYSE EMR  Electric Co s fleet of luxury corporate jets swooped in  Its planes arrived at Georgia s Augusta Regional Airport from all over the United States  flying in from Austin  Dallas  Houston  New Orleans  New York and the industrial conglomerate s hometown of St  Louis  according to U S  Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  records  By the time Woods sealed his fifth Masters victory on April 14  Emerson pilots had landed 13 times at the airport during the four day tournament  Emerson  which is in the vital but unglamorous business of making products such as measurement and control systems used by manufacturing companies  is now taking heat over its ownership of eight aircraft  The fleet consists of seven jets and one helicopter  according to St  Louis County Assessor records  Hedge fund D E  Shaw  which owns more than 1  of the company  earlier this month wrote to Emerson s board and spotlighted the  great expense to shareholders  of its corporate jets  seeing them as emblematic of a  bloated structure and expense base   The fund is agitating for big changes at Emerson  including splitting it in two  and is seeking support from other shareholders   Its case is that Emerson s stock has lagged badly  partly because of elevated costs  Its shares rose 12  in the past five years  a period in which the S P 500 gained 53   In the three fiscal years ending in 2016 to 2018  Emerson s selling  general and administrative expenses surged 23  but its net sales rose only 20    Soon after D E  Shaw s campaign became public in a Reuters story on Sept  27  Emerson announced a review of its operations  Aviation costs will be part of that   The company  which employed 87 500 people in 2018  declined to answer Reuters  questions about its aircraft  A spokeswoman declined to say who was ferried to Augusta and other destinations  and whether people were being taken to the tournament or were traveling for some other reason  Emerson has a South Carolina facility near Augusta   The size of the fleet and the number of times Emerson s Chief Executive David Farr uses the planes for personal trips is out of step with most major U S  companies  Some others have sold their jets  and those retaining them have smaller fleets than Emerson  National Business Aviation Association data show  A Reuters analysis of FAA records shows that Emerson s planes have made 260 flights in the past 90 days  This month alone  the jets were tracked in Alaska  California  China and New York  There also have been recent trips to Boston  Minneapolis  New Delhi  Japan and Washington  D C  The intensity of the flying  and other details about how Emerson s aviation arm operates  have not been previously reported  The information is gathered from flight and local authority records as well as from interviews with former staff at the operation   SECURITY ARGUMENT Certainly Emerson executives do need to travel as the company has more than 200 manufacturing sites and more than half its sales are abroad  but it is the way they do it that has sparked questions among investors  In its annual proxy statement  Emerson says it requires Farr to use the company s aircraft for all his travel  including personal trips   to promote business efficiency and safety   This reasoning is challenged by corporate governance expert Jonathan Macey  a Yale Law School professor  Given tight security at most airports that argument  is just balderdash   he said  Private aviation business experts counter that security is an issue not just for the executive but for the things they may be working on or discussing while traveling  On a private plane  they don t have to worry about anyone listening in on their business dealings   said SherpaReport s Nick Copley  who analyses the private aviation industry   DOG ON HIS LAP Luxury jet flying can be a family affair for the CEO  Photographs posted on the Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page of his son Andrew in August 2007 show Farr flying with a small brown dog on his lap  His son and a handful of his son s friends  teenagers at the time  are pictured sitting in a jet s plush chairs eating pastries  In the fiscal year to September 2018  Emerson estimated Farr s personal jet travel cost it  369 000  according to a filing  It said he reimburses the company for personal trips based on first class ticket prices  but Emerson does not disclose how much he pays  The cost was higher than for CEOs at many other manufacturing companies  Michael Roman  the CEO of 3M  NYSE MMM  Co  whose sales are almost double Emerson s  cost his company  56 743 in personal aircraft use last year  The fanciest jet in Emerson s fleet is a 2013 Dassault Falcon 7X  which it bought last year for an undisclosed sum  The price tag for the plane  which seats up to 16 and can be equipped with an on board shower  would be between  25 million and  30 million  according to SherpaReport com  Emerson employs enough staff to run a small airline  including pilots  schedulers  hangar security  and at least one summer intern  according to former employees and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  pages of current employees  Annual costs for operating the fleet are estimated to be  20 million to  25 million  according to Liberty Jet Management s expense calculator  That excludes costs of buying the planes   The Augusta trips alone would likely have cost  120 000  Copley estimates  Expenses include  61 122 Emerson paid in real estate taxes for its hangar  and property taxes of  112 000 for the jets  local tax records show   COUNTRY RETREAT  Both Emerson s St  Louis headquarters and its corporate retreat some 40 miles  64 km  away in Winfield  Missouri  have helipads  Photographs posted by Emerson pilots on Facebook show the company s Bell 412 helicopter  identifiable by its tail number  at Winfield  The retreat has a conference center  a tennis court and swimming pool on more than 400 acres  according to the county assessor and real estate records   Emerson s ties to Augusta  the exclusive golf club  date back to Farr s predecessor  Charles Knight  who was one of only about 300 members  Farr is an avid golfer  He told Forbes in March he had  dragged everyone from my wife to friends and Emerson colleagues for a round   in the United States  Ireland and Scotland  Neither Emerson nor the club would comment on whether he belongs to Augusta  The corporate jet s heyday was in the 1980s when tobacco to food conglomerate RJR Nabisco had 10  The book  Barbarians at the Gate  The Fall Of RJR Nabisco  details how one jet was flown across the United States with the CEO s dog as the key passenger  By 2008  at the height of the financial crisis  attitudes were very different  CEOs of U S  auto companies were criticized by lawmakers for traveling by corporate jet when they were seeking a bailout from the government  Even St  Louis beer maker Anheuser Busch  whose fleet once matched Emerson s  now owns only one jet and one helicopter after the company was acquired by Belgium based InBev   Charlie Horton  who worked at Emerson as a flight department maintenance supervisor more than 20 years ago  said Emerson and Anheuser once competed to see who had the best looking fleet in St  Louis   
 I d have to say they are the best maintained aircraft in aviation   Horton said of the Emerson fleet   It s almost like a scheduled airline  ",2019-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fly-emerson-air-how-a-us-company-deploys-its-seven-corporate-jets-2007474,2007474

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  ladies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  Welcome to Emerson s investor conference call  Operator Instructions This conference is being recorded today  February 4  2020 I would now like to turn the conference over to our host  Pete Lilly  Director of Investor Relations at Emerson  Please go ahead Pete Lilly    Director of Investor RelationsThank you so much  and welcome  everyone  to Emerson s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call  I m joined today by David Farr  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Frank Dellaquila  Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Mike Train  President  and of course  Tim Reeves  Director of Investor Relations  Emeritus Timothy Reeves    Director of Investor RelationsEmeritus  I graduated Pete Lilly    Director of Investor RelationsPromotion  I encourage you all to follow along in the slide presentation  which is available on our website  I ll start on slide four with the results of the quarter  Underlying sales growth came in slightly below expectations  flat year over year  driven by softness in global discrete markets and North American upstream oil and gas activity  Despite lower sales  operations executed well to deliver adjusted EPS of  0 67  spot on the guidance we ve provided in the fourth quarter call  Automation Solutions underlying was up 1   which was somewhat below management s expectations  primarily due to the aforementioned U S  discrete and upstream market softness  Demand in other global process and hybrid markets remained stable  Importantly  we also saw several large LNG projects booked in the quarter after delays from the second half of the year    of the last year Commercial   Residential Solutions was in line with expectations  down 1   reflecting continued softness in global professional tools and cold chain markets  somewhat offset by stronger markets in Europe and Asia  Middle East and Africa  The company initiated  97 million of restructuring actions in the quarter  well above the  70 million discussed on last quarter s call  These actions  combined with incremental actions from the second half of last year  are expected to drive improved profitability in 2020  Cash flow performance was solid in the quarter with free cash flow up significantly versus prior year  reflecting 94  conversion of net income  Turning to slide five  We ll review the P L  First quarter gross margin was roughly flat at 42 4  as favorable price cost was offset by unfavorable business and regional mix  primarily due to lower U S  shale and highly profitable upstream and discrete markets SG A as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points to 27 1   However  this includes 150 basis points of unfavorable impact from higher stock compensation due to a higher stock price  Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins  which exclude restructuring and related costs  declined 180 basis points and 170 basis points  respectively  Importantly  these changes include 220 basis points of combined unfavorable impact from stock compensation  pension and FX losses  Excluding these impacts  adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins were up 40 and 50 basis points  respectively  reflecting strong read through of prior year restructuring actions  Turning to slide six  From a geographic perspective  we saw mixed underlying sales results in Q1  The Americas were down  below expectations due to weak U S  upstream oil and gas and discrete end markets  The United States and Canada were down 3  and 1   respectively  and Latin America  up 4   Europe was down slightly with 2  growth in Western Europe  offset by sluggishness in Eastern Europe  Asia  Middle East and Africa was up 6   led by China up 6  and strong growth in the Middle East Turning now to slide seven  Total segment adjusted EBIT margin dropped 40 basis points to 15 4   reflecting the negative impacts of foreign transaction losses as well as unfavorable business and regional mix  These items totaled 80 basis points unfavorable impact  As previously mentioned  stock compensation costs increased due to a higher stock price  and pension costs increased due to lower discount rates  Corporate and other costs  excluding restructuring and related costs  was favorable  Q1 cash flow performance was solid  Operating cash flow increased by over 30  to  424 million  And free cash flow of  310 million represented 94  conversion  Turning to slide eight  We will bridge first quarter EPS  Tax  stock compensation  pension and foreign exchange transactions totaled  0 13 headwind for the quarter  which was in line with guidance  Operations  share repurchases and lower interest costs delivered  0 05  also in line with guidance to net  0 67 of EPS on an adjusted basis  In summary  operations and balance sheet delivered our target EPS contribution on lower than expected sales  We will now review business platforms  turning to slide 10 Automation Solutions underlying sales came in somewhat below expectations at 1  growth for the quarter  December trailing three month underlying orders were up 2   driven by several large LNG bookings that had been delayed from the second half of last year  Of note  backlog grew by 7  to nearly  5 billion on a sequential basis compared to last quarter  The Americas underlying sales were down 1  as discrete and upstream markets continued to soften  Europe sales were also down 1  as low single digit growth in Western Europe was more than offset by weakness in Eastern Europe  Asia  Middle East and Africa grew 6  led by China and the Middle East  Our long cycle businesses continued steady growth with both Systems and Final Control up mid single digits  Adjusted EBITDA margin was down 60 basis points  reflecting 50 basis points unfavorable impact of FX transaction losses as well as unfavorable mix resulting from the year over year decline in the more profitable North American upstream and discrete markets  Excluding these impacts  the business delivered improved adjusted segment EBITDA margins on lower than expected sales  reflecting the benefit of 2019 restructuring actions In the quarter  restructuring actions totaled  83 million across the platform  These actions  together with approximately  30 million of incremental actions in the second half of 2019  are expected to support improved adjusted segment margins on flat to slightly positive underlying sales for the year  Now turning to slide 11  Commercial   Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 1   December trailing three month underlying orders were also down 1   The Americas underlying sales were down 3  as North American residential HVAC markets remained soft and slower industrial markets weighed on professional tools and cold chain demand  Latin America grew by 6   Asia  Middle East and Africa grew 5  with mid single digit growth across China  the rest of Asia and the Middle East  Commercial   Residential Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points  primarily reflecting favorable price cost and the benefit of prior year restructuring actions  For the quarter  restructuring actions totaled  10 million  Combined with approximately  5 million of incremental actions from the second half of 2019  we expect improved profitability for the year on slightly negative underlying sales Turning to slide 13  we ll cover the updated guidance  Despite some progress toward trade resolution  we continue to expect geopolitical tensions  pending elections and corporate focus on cost cutting to drive a no    a low to no growth environment in 2020  On the full year  there is no change to our expectations for underlying sales  Of note  this outlook does not include any potential impacts from the unfolding coronavirus  which will be discussed later in the call  As highlighted on the last call  Emerson has managed multiple economic slowdowns in our history  And in the current environment  we have shifted our management investment focus from a growth mindset to a cost mindset  We initiated this process last year  increasing restructuring investments  35 million in the second half of 2019  Today  we announced the next phase of that plan  For fiscal year 2020  we expect total restructuring spend to be approximately  215 million  of which  175 million will happen within the Automation Solutions platform  Commercial   Residential Solutions and Corporate will each take  35 million and  5 million of actions  respectively Of note  during our upcoming investor conference  we expect to present an additional detail of the outcome of the Board s review announced on October 1 as well as update the longer term guidance framework beyond 2020  We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of  3 55 to  3 80  an increase of  0 07 at the midpoint  reflecting the benefit of 2020 cost actions  We expect minimal net cash impact from restructuring actions  Operating cash flow is now expected to be  3 15 billion  and capex spending has increased to  650 million  leaving our free cash flow target unchanged at  2 5 billion  Please turn to slide 14  This slide bridges our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance  The starting point for the bridge is 2019 GAAP EPS of  3 71  Walking across to the right  we have adjusted 2019 EPS of  3 69  which excludes  0 14 of favorable discrete tax items and adds back  0 12 of restructuring charges  Continuing from  3 69  we expect a total of  0 26 of headwind this year for tax  FX  stock comp and pension  Largely offsetting these headwinds  we now expect  0 15 of operational improvement on flat to slightly down sales  up from  0 08 discussed in our prior guidance  reflecting the benefit of 2020 restructuring actions We also expect  0 09 of EPS from improved debt cost structure and a strong balance sheet with  1 5 billion of planned share repurchases  This gets us to a full year adjusted EPS midpoint of  3 67  Please turn to slide 15  This slide lays out our second quarter 2020 guidance  The underlying sales outlook for the quarter is flat  reflecting continued headwinds in North American upstream and global discrete markets  Note that this outlook does not include any potential impact of the coronavirus  Despite continued North America mix headwinds  we expect total segment adjusted EBIT margin up 20 basis points and EBITDA margin up 60 basis points  driven by the benefit of prior year restructuring actions  We expect adjusted EPS of  0 81  which excludes  50 million of planned restructuring actions in the quarter  Please turn to slide 16 This slide lays out the first and second half adjusted EBITDA margin progression for our business  assuming the midpoint of their respective underlying sales guidance  We expect first half restructuring spend totaling approximately  145 million across both platforms  These investments  together with easing mix headwinds and favorable price cost  drive significant margin improvement in the second half  with Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin up approximately 150 basis points and Commercial   Residential Solutions up approximately 100 basis points  We plan to exit 2020 with an improved cost structure that yields stronger earnings and cash as we go forward  and we look forward to laying out our long term plans at the investor conference on February 13  And now please turn to slide 18 And with that  I will turn the call over to Mr  David Farr David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  I want to welcome all the Emerson investors this afternoon and the analysts that follow Emerson in our markets we serve as we discuss our first quarter results and what we expect for the full year  I also want to thank all the Emerson leaders around the world and for all the Emerson employees that make this    made this quarter happen and are implementing the total aggressive cost resetting programs to make Emerson stronger  more competitive as we deal with this challenging and uncertain global industrial and commercial markets  Thank you very much for your efforts  As you can see for the first quarter press release  it s been a busy  busy first quarter executing around our two and half year cost resetting efforts  As you know  we accelerated the fourth quarter cost resetting by about  35 million  That money and those savings are flowed into this year  built into the plan originally and from a savings dollar for dollar  maybe a little bit more than a dollar per dollar based on the    it was a headcount reduction program In the first quarter  we did  97 million  Part of that includes corporate  where we took down the Emerson plane fleet to 5  and we sold the helicopter  We are expecting  for the total year  around  215 million of restructuring  And in total  you ll see next week well over  420 million   425 million of cost reductions during this time period  over this two and half year time period  with savings well north of  425 million  And we re expecting incremental savings on the first quarter restructurings around  50 million  The big issue now is we re starting to attack and go after the access facilities and the higher cost structures will pay back more in  21 and  22  But we re going to continue to drive    and you could see well into the second half this year and well into 2021  We will have over dollar for dollar savings when it s all said and done  and the execution is going pretty well at this point in time  I m pleased with it  We reviewed with it at great detail yesterday with the Board  Well more than 3 5 hours of details with the Board as they understood what we re doing to make sure we re taking permanent cost actions  permanent cost setting and not damaging the core quality of investments  the technology and the customer service support that we have out there  not damage the long term viability and franchise businesses that we have at Emerson As you know  we have our annual investors conference next week in New York City on February 13  It s going to be    not be on Valentine s Day  It s unusual for me  So you guys get    make sure you do everything special for your spouse that evening  but we re going to be doing our call    our investors conference in the morning  Details around the global cost resetting to drive the new peak margins  where we laid out very detailed with a lot of growth    the very little growth environment  You ll see what we re trying to undertake and how we re trying to do it  the timing  the annual savings when they re flowing in  when we re going to reach those margins from an EBIT basis  in an EBITDA basis  At the same time  we re taking very significant actions around the corporate headquarter structure not only here in St  Louis but around the world as we look at best ways to optimize our cost structure  looking between the Automation Solutions and the Commercial   Residential  This is driven internally by the key leaders  the business leaders and the corporate leaders  but also with the support of McKinsey as we looked at how we could optimize Emerson s efficiency  effectiveness and profitability to drive record levels of margins by each of the major business units  Lal  Bob and I will put more color on this next Thursday  but we have very good progress As you can see  in the second half of this year  Automation Solutions margins are starting to pop up  Bob took after this last year  Bob and his team  Bob Sharp  and they re already seeing improvement in the underlying profitability of the businesses  So the actions are taking hold  and they re doing a good job  and we ll talk a lot more about that as we go forward  But as the global Emerson employees know and know full well  we are fast in the execution mode right now  And we cannot depend on the fact that there s no growth out there  We are figuring out how to grow our profitability  how to grow our earnings and grow our cash flow in a no growth  low growth or maybe a negative growth environment  I m ignoring the coronavirus right now  Both Mike Train and I will talk a little bit about this and what we see at this point in time  But it s definitely  definitely going to have an impact in the near term  medium term  and potentially  long term as we look at this  As you could see  our total orders are trending in the plus two  minus two range right now  trending right now toward the 0 as we look at the current month in the current quarter  It tells me that we are trending very tightly in the range that we ve laid out for underlying sales  We continue to look for those catalysts that drive up in North America and other markets of the world But as I look at the world order pace  I look at the sales pace right now  North America is weak  weaker than we thought  Western Europe is about in line  2  to 3   Eastern Europe s down  primarily driven by Russia and Turkey  The Middle East and Africa  which we were just in  was    is doing better  and several large projects are happening under way  In Asia Pacific  as of the middle of January  was trending pretty well and had pretty good growth in the first quarter  and we still look at pretty good growth for the full year there  My concern as I look at the next couple of quarters is  I don t see the catalyst that drive the fundamental pick back up in the U S  at this point in time  I don t see Canada  nor have I seen Mexico and other parts of Latin America  What we re trying to do right now is control our destiny through our costs and cost resetting to figure out how to drive better earnings and cash flow through this cost reset  If growth comes and we get it  so be it  but we re going to have to fight  I believe  all year long for incremental pockets of growth and things are continuing to happen to us  As you could see  the global markets are not easy at this time  They re definitely not easy  I do see opportunities for growth out there  But I don t see how and when we will get to those levels at this point in time I know people believe there will be a stronger second half  But from my standpoint  right now  I m not betting on that  This company is betting on very low growth  moderate growth or no growth  and we re driving the actions necessary around that  Operating cash flow will be good  You saw the first quarter  We had very good operating cash flow for the first quarter  Some of that was trapped  in my opinion  working capital on the balance sheet  We also had some cash flow based on taxes  Frank had done some restructuring  Frank and his team  restructuring taxes that flowed through in that first quarter  That should continue to help us as we go into the first half of this year  Overall  I think our cash flow is going to be up nicely in the  3 15 billion to  3 2 billion  Right now  as we reviewed with the Board  and how we see this  assuming no significant acquisitions  we re going to pay back  1 2 billion in dividends  We re working on our 64th year of increased dividends  Our dividend ratio  as you look at free cash flow  is dropping down below 50  Our share repurchase somewhere around 1 5  assuming no significant acquisitions at this point in time So close to 85  of our cash flow should be repaid back to shareholders in support of what we re trying to do with our shareholders  Again  if we have the opportunities for acquisitions  we ll take them  We re also assuming higher capital spending this year  We ve raised capital spending up to that  650 million range   650 million range  in support of the actions we re taking as we build new best cost locations around the world  as we ve continued to reset our facility structure and our cost structure  Our acquisition funnel right now is pretty small  People are very nervous about selling assets at this point in time with the uncertainty around the cycle now with China situation  We have  in the process  we re in the process right now of closing two nice little bolt on acquisitions worth about  120 million of sales    or not sales   125 million of value purchase price  both    one in Automation Solutions  one in Commercial Residential Solutions  both in the control element part of the pyramid that we always talk about  While Mike and I are joined    and we re going to tag team a little bit on China  give you some insights to this Let me give a brief overview  I m going to turn over to Mike  and we ll go back and forth here  The China situation first  I want to say something to all my employees  We have 11 000 employees here  We are in constant touch with them  We have the ability to communicate to 80 000 of our employees on an ongoing basis  every minute  every day  Our hearts are going out with all the people that are locked up in their apartments right now  Fortunately  we are all safe at this point in time  But clearly  they re in their apartments  They re working  communicating  obviously  by phone  by email  as they try to figure out how do we get ready to get going as we come out of this  But our thoughts are with them at this point in time  and it s a concern that we have relative to all our employees  not only there  but also around the world  As I look at this right now  it will be a negative impact  and I ll let Mike go through some points here  But from my perspective  assuming that they do allow us to start manufacturing again  and we started  you can see in the supply chain  again  on February 10  I still believe we ll have somewhere between  50 million and  100 million of sales impact  Now folks I m giving you my feel for knowing China and my feel for what I think is going to happen  If this extends  that number will go up  but I m just giving you my feel As I look at the sourcing situation we ll show you  I am concerned about the start up of this  and Mike will give you some numbers around that  I m concerned about the customers and how fast they ll come back up in lot  We also have a lot of our customers that do a lot of manufacturing and shipping out of there  and we have components here and there  and I m concerned about some of that work going on  My perspective is  as I look at the number of  50 million to  100 million right now  some of that will be permanently lost  depending on Bob Sharp s business and the heating system marketplace  Once the heating system is gone  you re going to wait for the next year  I firmly believe that Automation Solutions  assuming this doesn t go too long  should make it up before the fiscal year is done or within the calendar year  But again  what I m looking at right now is the feel that we have based on how long we re going to be shut down and our sort of estimate of how quick this thing will start up So Mike  why don t you give them a couple of facts  and we ll go back and forth and talk a little bit more Michael Train    President of Emerson and Chairman of Emerson Automation SolutionsAll right  Great  David  great to be with everybody this afternoon  Thank you very much  First of all  I also want to share my thanks to our China team  our 11 000 employees  We recently celebrated our 40th anniversary in China  Today  we have a terrific business in China  nearly  2 billion in size  and again  almost 11 000 employees  And we had a solid Q1 in both platforms in that mid single digits that Pete talked to  Secondly  January 15  we saw the signing of the U S  China trade deal  which was pretty important  That Phase one deal is pretty important to us  I think it also    there were announcements on both sides  which would be Phase two discussions commencing shortly  We re excited by that  It s going to take some time  but we re excited about that  So I wanted to highlight that  But just about that  that same time is when people were recognizing that we have this coronavirus issue  Our employees went out on January 24 for their Chinese New Year holiday  They ve been out now for 11 or 12 days  And currently  under the government regulations and guidance  we intend to start    restart our facilities next Monday  on February 10  But we need to make sure that happens  And we ll be watching that  And I think we can report on that a little bit next week   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we can Michael Train    President of Emerson and Chairman of Emerson Automation SolutionsI think some of the issues that we re going to face are going to be around as you restart these facilities  Obviously  we re going to have to manage our facilities  We have the temperature monitoring  We have travel restrictions  We re doing everything we need to manage  But our supply chain  I think  will be suffering that    despite best efforts  It s just going to be a rocky start  The logistics  the supply chain  sub suppliers and all those kinds of things  So   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHow much do we have in our supply chain right now  both for China  Mike Michael Train    President of Emerson and Chairman of Emerson Automation SolutionsSo our supply chain in China s about  750 million   500 million stays in China   250 million actually goes out to the global business  So have impacts in China  we ll have impacts beyond China  in terms of that  And again  as you were highlight  we have several global customers that use China to build their projects  their modules  that kind of thing  And we re going to see some impacts there that would impact business in other regions beyond China as well  So we re starting off with kind of the view of what s going to happen here  I think next week will be a big important week  We ll learn some more things as we go forward  And then maybe we could comment  Again  there s no saying what s going to happen there David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe ll do that  Thanks  Thank you  Mike  As I look at this  I referred to the Board yesterday and today  for the people    I m aging myself here  the Apollo space programs  in the five or six minutes  we have their reentry blackouts  We are in that reentry blackout period for China right now  We do not know what we don t know at this point in time  But clearly  the organization for China  who I know are listening on this phone or will be listening on this phone when they get    wake up  are doing everything they possibly can to get ready right now  I just know that the supply chain  the uncertainty  logistics  all these different things  there s a lot of moving parts  the sub supply chains  the feeders to our supply chain  there s a lot of components here  So for people not to think that it would not be a negative short term  I don t think they re thinking straight  It will be a negative It will be a negative for the global economy  It will be  potentially  bigger  if it doesn t get started  This thing drags on long time  But right now  our feeling is right  it s not going to drag on  But we re just getting ready for it  and we re trying to get    we re planning everything around this  so we can execute and make sure they have the resources they need to get the job done  They re all geared up to come back to work  We ll give you an update on the 14th as we look at    on the 13th  I m sorry  as we look at what happens at 10th  11th and 12th because we ll get a good feel for this  My gut tells me  it will be a slow recovery  and they ll get their act together and things will happen  But again  we are in that Apollo space program reentry  five to six minutes  where no one knows what s going on  And when I talk to you on the 13th  you ll give me   Houston  we re live   and we ll talk about that  So again  that s how we see at this point in time  I don t want to scare people  But it s the facts We do a very major business in China  We re very strong in China  We have a good sense of China  I have    Mike and I both managed and worked in China for many years together as a team  and we spent a lot of time there  And we re supporting our employees  we re supporting the government  we re supporting our government as we try to work through this  But that s where we sit at this point in time  And we ll keep you informed  So I want to thank all the employees  I want to thank the Board s engagement  And I also want to thank the shareholders engagements that I ve been having in the last several months  and I will continue to have with our shareholders With that  we ll open the lines and we ll take some Q A to see if we can get some clarity around the concerns and questions people have out there  Thank you Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good afternoon David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon John John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystSo thank you for all that color around China  I guess  just maybe a point of clarification  you kind of detailed what you think the impact could be  but then I guess going through the prepared remarks and looking at the release  you have some comments that the guidance excludes any impact from the coronavirus David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCorrect  Correct John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystJust trying to    so how do we kind of sensitize that  Is it in the plus the  0 02 minus that you call around next quarter  Or would it actually be greater than or lower than   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say it s in the plus or minus  0 02 right now in that quarter  John  to be honest  Now we re assuming that we re going to have starting up in the 10th  February 10  and we have a slow ramp  So I see some potential impact to the year  that  50 million to  100 million  That plus or minus  0 02  I would say  covers that right now based on what we re seeing on slow start  Now if we re sitting there in New York next week and I m saying   Hey  this thing is really grinding and having a hard time both with our customer standpoint and also our supply chain standpoint  we ll have to reconfigure that   But right now  that s how we have this factored into play  that plus or minus  0 02  You re exactly right John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Great  And then just thinking about the margins for the quarter in Automation Solutions  you called out a couple of things in the prepared remarks  I m just    as I m looking at mix for the balance of the year  thinking about North America  about discrete  about maybe some OE greater than aftermarket at some point here  How are you thinking about the cadence of seeing mix be  I guess  maybe less negative as we go through the year  Or how are you thinking about that David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we are    what we would like to see happen in the cadence of the year  obviously  the first quarter flow  North America was really very negative for us  The discrete business is very negative for us relative to our discrete around the world  So very high profit business  both of those  So the cadence will be expect    I think we re going to continue to see strong KOB 3  which does help us  I think our cadence is that we see some stability within the oil and gas market space in North America  not growing  but stabilizing  So as we look at the channels  as we look at our customer base  we ll see some improvement in the flow and discrete business  which will help us a little bit on the margin pressure And then the rest of the help is going to come from all the restructuring  but you called it right  The flow and the discrete right now in North America is a very challenging issue for us  It was very difficult in the last two quarters  And as we look at this right now  our plan is we see some stability  some improvement  which will help put a little margin wind to our back as we get into that second half  and that s where we see it right now  And obviously  you ll be able to tell on our order releases and our comments  basically  how we re seeing it  If you start seeing us say   Hey  things have stabilized  Things have improved   You ll know  John  that we re seeing a little bit better improvement around that flow business  which is very important to us John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you for the color  I ll pass it along David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou re gonna make it next week John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystOf course  I ll be there  Yep David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay OperatorThe next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citi Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystGood afternoon  guys can t wait for the   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Andrew Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystHow are you doing David  So I know you don t want to give us too much color or more color around the  425 million program before the Analyst Day  But as your Board and the consultants reviewed your cost  that opportunity from  what it looks like in FY  20 for the initial  215 million  It looks like the majority is focused on AS versus C RS or Corporate  So when all said and done  how much confidence does the program give you to get AS margin back up to the 19  margin that you ve previously talked about David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So I mean  my confidence level and the Board as I said  the Board spent 3 5 hours on these actions  We re talking about the Board confidence  my confidence is extremely high at this point in time  extremely  We are taking serious actions  Bob s business started  you well know  Bob s on his sixth quarter of negative sales  Bob started his cost out seven quarters ago  So if you look back at his major restructuring  it actually started in late  18 throughout 2019  So what he s working on right now are actions around fixed facilities to try to take some fixed facilities offline and consolidate  So his are a little bit different  That s why you haven t seen a lot with Bob right now  his business over the next couple of years  and he ll be doing a fixed savings  and he s starting to get that  I feel very  very confident  Now I m involved in reviewing the work with Lal and Ram  the Board and I looked at in detail  and we look at the costs  I feel very good about those savings  I feel very good about the bridge chart that we re showing you from the second half  I think the question    the previous caller  John  asked is very relevant relative to that mix issue  which needed stability  But as I look at the actions they re doing right now in the short term  because it s very much people oriented and then we re starting to take some of the longer term facilities  so I feel very confident we ll start seeing that margin move up in the second half  Anything you want to add to that  Frank Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think we ve got a good plan going forward  We re looking for a significant margin improvement in the second half  And a lot of it does depend on the pace of business in the mix  The restructuring actions will kick in  and we re pretty confident in the margin development as we go through the year David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd McKinsey reported to the Board yesterday in the work that we did between the two business units and Corporate  and we have additional actions that we can deal with probably starting in another couple of years  We want some backup stuff and some other opportunity  but let s put it this way  our hands are pretty    our plate s pretty full right now with actions we ve got going on  And    but we re going to study and lay them out and see how we can start flowing some or maybe later this year  early next year to give us some protection in case    I m not supposed to swear  but I m going to swear   Oh   Indecipherable  happened   But from my perspective  we re trying to cover that  McKinsey did a good job explaining how we re protecting what makes Emerson unique  our franchises and the corporation culture  but at the same time  look how we could be more efficient and more effective  It was a very good discussion around from the Board perspective as they pulled back the sheets Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystAnd then you mentioned when you released December orders that they did display some signs of picking up in AS  really in LNG  You said that again today  AS backlog increased 7  sequentially  So did you see a bit of an uptick in project releases by customers  Do you think they become more cautious again as the coronavirus continues to spread  And maybe stepping back  it s been a little while since you updated us on the large project funnel  do you still have  1 billion of projects that you ve been told you ve won but haven t booked  And is your project funnel improving  decreasing or roughly stable David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I mean  you ve hit a nail in the head here  The issue right now  I think the North America projects we re starting to see release  I m very worried as I m sure my customers are worried about because a lot of that business is going to be shipped    production will be shipped to China  And so my concern is if this coronavirus goes longer  it could delay those projects  and it could slow down some of the projects we think that should be released here in the next couple of months  So this    the coronavirus has an impact on many  many things relative to our business base  So therefore  that s why we are still convinced that the second half could be a challenge for us  and that s how we re banking at that zero growth because of things like that  Now the projects we see releasing  and I still believe will release  are the Middle East and India  Those projects are separate from the work been going on in China  But I would say the Middle East  Mike  you and I were just there  China  I mean  the India projects  So I feel good about those  And I think that will help us as we fill up that pipeline for the second half of the year and then as we move into 2021  But we ve got to get some settlements  some resolution on the corona  We ve got to get some traveling  And if we don t  then that s going to clearly slow down some of the North America projects Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystThanks Dave  See you next week David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSee you next week Andrew  Thank you OperatorThe next question is from Gautam Khanna at Cowen and Company Gautam Khanna    Cowen and Company    AnalystHi  good afternoon  guys David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Gautam  How are you doing my friend Gautam Khanna    Cowen and Company    AnalystDoing well thanks David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSan Francisco friends out there weren t too happy about that Super Bowl game where they Gautam Khanna    Cowen and Company    AnalystI know right  tough to Watch the meltdown David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou guys have a watch it because it s no East Coast team in there  Okay  we well know Gautam Gautam Khanna    Cowen and Company    AnalystNot the same about the Patriots  Yes  I was just curious  what is your expectation this year for KOB one as a percentage of Automation Solutions revenue David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  I m rubbing my rally monkey s head here a little bit  Gautam  So I can see if    OK  So I ll give you my feeling right now  OK  I think we re going to be around 25  for KOB one  I think we will be 57     57   58  for KOB 3  and so what s that mean for the    18  for KOB two  That s where I think we re going to be right now  And I don t have any crystal ball more than you  but that s where I see    I look at the pipelines  I look at the things we re talking about right now  We are    we shared with the Board we re not backing off any of the KOB three investments  We have the organization highly motivated to try to take some market share on installed base  We re focusing other things that cut our costs around  But that area right now is ripe for us to continue to take share  And we want to build that KOB three up strongly because those projects will start flowing  and it ll help us offset the margin dilution from the projects Gautam Khanna    Cowen and Company    AnalystGot it  And not to steal thunder from next week  but how far out do you anticipate providing long term financial targets  This is a fiscal  22  Or what are you thinking  Like how long are you right now projecting David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think we re going  23  We re going to go  23  We will bridge    we will bridge the  450 million  And what we see    I mean  as you know  I try to be honest and transparent  sort of like the Iowa caucus  I will try to bridge for the 2021 numbers  These guys are all    they can t handle this    they can t handle the truth  They could not be in any movies like me  But they    we ll bridge that  so you can see what    the  450 million we talked about  and then we ll talk about what we see going on going forward  You re going to see a much lower sales forecast as we manage the growth to keep it    we re focusing on the cost and until I see some really strength in what s going to happen to underlying growth  we re going to keep that growth rate down and manage around costs  So we ll give you that bridge  But think  23  but also    I ll tell you what I think about  21 and what we told you last year  I always try to bridge what I committed to Gautam Khanna    Cowen and Company    AnalystI appreciate it  Thanks  Good luck guys David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll the best to you  See you next week OperatorThe next question is from John Inch at Gordon Haskett John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystSorry  afternoon  everybody  Afternoon Dave David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  Mr  Inch John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGood David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAre you done  Florida  Are you are you hard work up New York John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystI m hard working in New York  although it s almost warm enough to be Florida David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerDon t worry about the cold weather is coming  We re about to get three or four inches  So we had 17 degree weather  It s now raining and snows coming tonight  So he s coming your way I m we re going to put it a little Federal Express pack incentive John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystI like those inches  Okay  so   Michael Train    President of Emerson and Chairman of Emerson Automation SolutionsWe pay for that John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystWe haven t paid yet  Okay  So the    I just want to be clear  So the  215 million of restructuring  the  95 million that we did last year  Dave  you talked about reviewing this with the Board  Does this mean on the 13th when you talk about the Board s review or you present it  that there is no new restructuring on top of that  The restructuring basically is now confined to what you ve articulated  Or is there more still potential David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  What I just laid out for this year is locked and    OK  is it going to  210 million  Is it going to be  220 million  Yes  that s what we re talking about right there at this point in time  We are and    but we re going to show you  21 and what we re going for  as you well know  we wanted to try to get everything done within a 24 month time period best we could  So we re going to    we did a little bit last quarter  I mean  in the fourth fiscal quarter last year  We re doing a lot right now in this period right here in  20  We re going to be doing a pretty busy  21  But when we get out of  21  I want to move back toward our stability run rate of restructuring  which typically is around  50 million  So you re going to see how we go up to over  400 million total in the cycle and how we re focusing that  But what we told you this year  that number ain t changing unless I have    OK  I shouldn t say ain t because it could change  But if we had something happen to the world relative to a major change  and we have to refocus  something happens in China  something happens with the business  but right now  that s what we locked and loaded  And I would say that s going to keep our hands full for the year John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystSo what we re going to hear then on the 13th other than the traditional analyst review  the Board    you guys have McKinsey in there  You ve done this  obviously  top to bottom look through  You re going to be talking about the strategy or the payback  Or    so if there s no more new restructuring  what should we expect  Like   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe re going to talk about macro restructuring  We re going to talk about outcome is on the review of our businesses  We re going to talk about the cash flow generation and how we re going to allocate that cash flow generation for the next couple of years  and some fundamental strategies  You re going to see a presentation on digital transformation coming out from one of Lal s key new platform leaders  which we built  Or yes  not platform  but business level units presence  And then we ll also    we re going to give you an update on what    on the Final Control work that Ram s doing  Ram s going to give a presentation on where he s taking this to the next level  So there s a lot    there s going to be a lot of strategy  the company insights  what we re doing and how we re going to drive  But fundamentally  I want you to walk away with the strategies in place  and we re driving cost  and we re going to drive around that business  We re also going to give you an update after 18 months of owning the Textron Tools business  We re going to give you an update around the professional tools and how that program is going  Both B C and the professional tool ones are going very well  and they re a key part of our repositioning effort to drive value  And Tim s down here in the room  down here he s real happy because he s going to be part of that  maybe  And we re thinking about    there s a couple of positions open like HR and maybe plant management and we re going to put him in there and see if he s going to do anything different John Inch    Gordon Haskett    Analyst Technical Issues  Vacancies in Canada open but anyway   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Technical Issues  Mike doesn t like cold   John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystBuy one of your heat pumps  Okay  thanks David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  you got you got a new book handle laughter or something like that joke John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystI m working on it David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSee you late John  See you next week John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystWe ll see you then Bye bye OperatorThe next question is from Deepa Raghavan at Wells Securities Deepa Raghavan    Wells Securities    AnalystOkay  good afternoon  Dave David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Deepa Raghavan    Wells Securities    AnalystJust a quick question on the    clarification on the EPS range that you are maintaining  We understand the coronavirus impacts are not easy to assess  But how does the  3 67 guidance at midpoint feel given what we know now  It looks like there s a virus impact  your North American region is trending below your expectations  Just curious  do these newer headwinds just put the upper part of the sales range  but keep the midpoint    sorry  upper part of the EPS guide range intact    but sorry  risk is to the upper part of the EPS range  but keeps the midpoint impact  Or is there any risk to the midpoint also at this point in time David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I    we wouldn t put a guidance out there  I didn t think    I mean  we can believe we can hit both ends of this  both the top and the bottom  the middle  But our feeling right now  based on the trend lines is that the midpoint is the most likely  The upper point even with the coronavirus because we re assuming that they ll get    it will come back  and production will start coming back up  And we ll start calling back some of that    the  50 million to  100 million of sales  So we fundamentally believe that  that range is still viable  even with everything we face around the world at this point in time  The cost actions are happening  We get a little bit more cost out  From the timing issue  it s always a lot of timing in there  It can help our margins  and obviously  help the EPS  So at this point in time  that range is very    we re very comfortable in that range  And we feel    I mean  my highest probability  clearly  is at that 0  but I also see    I still see some potential on the positive side  too Deepa Raghavan    Wells Securities    AnalystAll right  Another clarification question is on China  again  Can you ring fence what percent of your China sales or profits are in the affected areas versus your overall China exposure  I know you gave us a supply chain number  and the impact is   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I think we can t do that  That China sales are    we saw across all of the markets depending on where the    which customer is going on right now  the customers are going to be further west  east north  Now we    there s no way we can break that down at this point in time  I mean  it s going to be a    this one is going to be kind of fluid as we see things moving back up  And I know our sales force are going to try to figure out how they can claw some of those back  So these    they re going to be pretty energized to figure out how to get that business back  It may come in a different location  So I    it s    there s nothing says at this point in time Deepa Raghavan    Wells Securities    AnalystAll right  Okay  thank you  See you next week OperatorYour next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  good afternoon David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystMaybe a first question on slide 13  the restructuring costs and earnings tailwinds  So you have the restructuring costs of  0 26  the benefit this year of  0 07  So that balance is sort of  0 19  Do we assume that  that s a mix of what s recognized in 2021  And also  what s kind of reinvested in 2020 and things like the service network  Just wondered how we thought about that drop through David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo now we will share with you how the savings are going to flow up in  21 and  22  and I m not sharing that with you yet  But we ll share that out with you  So you re trying to see  I mean  say that again  Julian  Say that one more time Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystSure  So it s just that on that slide 13  you re spending about  0 26 worth of restructuring this year  and you re recognizing  0 07 as the benefit  So I just wondered that balance of  0 19  is it all coming next year  Or a portion of that  0 19 is just    is reinvested into the business David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  No  No  So a big chunk of our savings will come next year of the delta  the spend from the standpoint  The area that we ll still have some delay out is going to be around the facility restructuring in the facilities because that may not start falling until early  22 or late  21  But what we see there is there s    the reinvestments built into our core plan  we took the cost out  And we ve netted that out already  There s nothing else going on here from that standpoint  Those savings will flow  and there ll be a    there should be a significant increase in savings as we move into  21  and you ll see that and as Lal talks about his repositioning effort  And as you know  there s very little cash being impacted here because we re pretty    we ve been pretty good about managing that cash flow and trying to keep it cash neutral  So that s    those savings and multiple  I would say  90  of those savings will flow back into  21  and we ll still have a little tail hanging over us in  22 from this restructuring right there you re talking about Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThat helps  And then my second question  just on the top line outlook in Automation Solutions  Maybe just focused on the sort of chemicals and petrochem piece of Automation Solutions  Some companies last week like AspenTech sounded pretty negative on chemical spending  Some of the customers in petrochem like Chevron or ExxonMobil are under some pressure  So I know you had good orders growth in your chemicals and petrochem piece in calendar Q4  Do you think that can continue through this year  Or it s more likely to get sort of lumpier David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight now  we still feel pretty good about it  Now I don t think    I think the first quarter number was a little bit stronger than I thought it would be  We had some project business come in there  But Julian  I don t    we re not too worried about that at this point in time  Now I d like to see another quarter of what s going on there  But that business  that petrochemical  the chemical businesses  and as we know  we serve a lot broader group of that customer base than an AspenTech will serve Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd our KOB three  first of all David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And we ve got strong KOB three going on right there  So I don t feel concerned about that  I m more worried about the upstream side and the new oil and gas investments  I think what I see coming down the downstream right now  I feel better about it  And that s a very high KOB three marketplace  And as I said earlier  when some of the guys asked me  I firmly believe we ll continue to see some improvement in KOB one  So I m more optimistic about that Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThank you  See you next week David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSee you next week Julian  Thank you OperatorThe next question is from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystGood afternoon everyone David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Jeff   Technical Issues  Connecticut  or were you paying taxes  They say in Connecticut earlier Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystOh  yeah  Yeah  I m getting creamed by the salt deduction issue every day up here in Connecticut Michael Train    President of Emerson and Chairman of Emerson Automation SolutionsLough  because we carry you for so long  It s about time you paid your fair share David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou want to talk about paying taxes  Talk to me Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    Analyst Technical Issues  I guess this kind of dovetails off an earlier question  but just kind of thinking about incrementals  So obviously  if we re in a no growth environment  incrementals is kind of a non constant  I guess  right  But are you suggesting to us though that we should assume you do some kind of normal 30  or so incremental on growth  and we can drop at the end of this 2  or 3 year period of time   425 million of savings on top of that David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  That s what we re talking about doing here  I mean  if we    we re going to have the incremental growth in sales  We ll show that to you as we lay out our plan  and then obviously  the restructuring that we re going to flow through  And as someone    I think Julian has asked me about the reinvestments  So we ll lay that detail  We went through that with the Board because they want    the Board is very  very interested in making sure we don t cut key programs long term  But we re trying to structurally make some changes here so that    that it does flow through  The key thing right now is we re banking on very little growth here for the next 12 to 18 months  That s the key issue Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystYes  And that 30  to 35   is that kind of the ZIP code you re comfortable with for incremental David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think we re building on 30  from that standpoint  That s what we re building it on  Jeff Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAnd then on the LNG stuff  so it was good to see some of the orders come through  Just wondering two things  Was the stuff that was released and hit your order book deliverable from a revenue standpoint for 2020 as it currently stood  And   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don t think we ll see any deliveries on that  I think you could have some progress payments and some of the stuff   Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Stuff that went to orders  and we ll start working on it  And what we ve   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And so what we    we probably    we will probably have some progress payments in the latter part of 2020  It ll be more falling into  21  As you well know that where these bookings will go  you ll see more coming  It goes    obviously  the compressors and the big LNG projects  our systems  then the control valves  then instrumentation  So we are in the early stages of this four way right now  So we should    we re anticipating here in the next two  three  four months a continuation of booking some stuff  And I wouldn t see that we ll book money sales this year to be more than 2021  but I guarantee we ll have some progress payments probably in the Systems in late this year Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystSo if you thought of your total scope on these projects  kind of total Emerson scope like what have you booked so far  We re talking like only 10  or 20  of the project value so far Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe expect are very small David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerVery small  Very small  Very small  And that s one of the concerns  I think  I can t remember which of you guys mentioned this  my concern is this whole book  Coronavirus  could that slow down the process here a little bit again  as we ve got it going again with trade deal that Mike mentioned  There was the trade    first  Phase 1  and now the coronavirus  will that slow things down again  That s always a concern of mine  That s why we need to get through this  and so we can get a little bit more visibility on what everyone s going to do  But right now  we should have a lot more bookings around those major projects Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAll right  great  Thanks for the Color David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Take care  Jeff OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Tusa  JPMorgan Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  good afternoon  This is actually Pat Baumann on for Steve Tusa David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Pat  How are you doing Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystGood  How are you doing David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNot too bad here Are you in training today  Is that what s going on here and you     Technical Issues  Is that why  I was wondering why you sent me that text  Make sure you really harass them Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystNo  they know Steve  you know  Steve s with the second month  You know  he s he s working on the internet stuff today David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  good  Okay  let s goPat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystSo yes  so he gave me an opportunity to harass you  Hey  on the restructuring  can you explain why you re seeing minimal net cash impacts from the actions you re taking  And then what was the comment on the cash flow based taxes you made about healthy results David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So go ahead Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThis is Frank  There s a lag on the spend versus when we book the expense that s pretty significant as we get out of the gate here  And then a not insignificant portion of the restructuring is noncash  It s facilities  it s asset writedowns and things of that nature  So when we wash it all through  we think the net impact in 2020 will probably be not terribly significant  less than  50 million David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean  a lot of times  and the people  which was our front load late last year  early this year  there s cash upfront  but you get    eventually you get some of that cash back because you re not paying  So it washes out and right now    and cash generation is pretty good  So I mean net s going to be pretty neutral  The taxes  just basically some work that Frank s been doing relative to some are international subs as we go through this process   Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  It s just ongoing reorganizations that we ve been doing  We ve had several discrete tax benefits last year  I don t expect them to be the same magnitude this year  but we will have a little bit here and there  and we had a    we get to know the cash tax savings that actually went through into the cash flow in the first quarter Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystWhat will be the net cash out for the  425 million you mentioned David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOh  I don t have the number off the top of my head  It s    Frank  do you have a number  a rough number Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI have  I would say  in the end  80   85  of it is probably going to be cash   David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOver time  Yes Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt s lumpy  I mean  the timing is the key David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd the key issue there is that the sooner you get some of the cash impact once done  the faster you get the cash payback  because it takes off quickly  The facility one s are the hardest part because they    the cash goes out  and then you don t get the savings for a long time Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  Maybe switching gears  just    can you give us an update on what you re seeing in resi  a few markets in North America  What did the business do for sales in the quarter  And kind of what s your outlook there for this year David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  North America is still in a tough zone right now  We re in sort of the middle of winter here  flat to slightly down  Don t    I mean  it s hard to say how fast  I mean  the one thing I d like is a residential marketplace truck  Construction s doing good  That s a good sign  Typically  we start seeing some payback and some improvement here as we get into that March time period  So that s not going to be    it s not going to be much of a change until we get into a little bit warm weather  We had a good quarter in Asia and China  That was before everything happened there that bothers me  And so I m a little bit concerned about that now as we come out of it  We hear from President Xi  he s going to try and pump up the financing and try to get some spending going to get the economy going  a strong stimulus  which could    typically  that goes after the market  the commercial residential guys go after versus the auto solution guys done  But right now  our HVAC business in North America is weak  And we re forecasting probably our sixth down quarter in total for commercial residence  globally  And then the question is  can we see some improvement as we move into the second half of the year Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystDid you see anything in the orders in January out of China that made you    makes you concerned at all about the business there  Or is there more just like    what do you expect David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThey were    they were pretty much what we expected  It s slightly negative  It was not that good  Again  it s a short month because it s the Chinese New Year  And so from that perspective  it s a pretty small month  But I m really worried about what we    we re trying to take orders over the phone right now  We re still alive  but there s not much business going on  So I m really worried about as we get into this post February 10 as we start seeing what people do  what happens in that  And that    so it s certainly live here after that February 10 time period comes in for the next two or three weeks to see if there s any slowdown or pick back up  we ll see Pat Baumann    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks for taking my question  I appreciate them OperatorThe next question is from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you  afternoon everyone David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Joe Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  Dave  So just focused on Automation Solutions for a second  and really first  And really just trying to think about the margin step up expected in your fiscal second quarter  So clearly  there s definitely some headwinds out there  We talked about coronavirus  I m just curious  like  are things expected to get better  much better  in fiscal 2Q versus fiscal 1Q from a mix standpoint  And then  secondly  clearly  you guys took a lot of restructuring actions here in the first quarter  And so do we start seeing a pretty sizable benefit from those actions in fiscal 2Q David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Okay  So did you back into Auto Sol s margins in the second quarter  Is that what you did Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYes  I backed in as well    I mean  you have margins up David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  you could back into them  Yes  So there s two things  One  auto sales  if you think about progression  our second quarter sales typically are seasonally higher and that  obviously  in the second quarter  And we are expecting some stability around the mix of business around that flow in the discrete business  So that is not    that s normal for us  So    and then we ve obviously started to get some savings  some of the  35 million that we spend aggressively in the fourth quarter  Most of that was around Auto Sol  And obviously  a lot of the  97 million over    almost  I think   85 million of it was around Auto Sol in the first quarter  And so you re seeing    those guys are going to start seeing that benefit more and more about that as they go into that second quarter and clearly ramps up into the third and fourth quarters  But that s how we see it right now  and the savings are happening because these are really near term cost actions that are taken Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  All right  That s helpful  And then  I guess  just my one follow up  I saw that there s no change to the buyback portion of the bridge  I guess the question I have is  like  look  your balance sheet is in great shape  You guys have the opportunity to toggle it up if you want to and be a little bit more aggressive with the buyback  I guess at this juncture  like  what s holding you back from potentially doing a little bit more David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  first of all  I think if you look at our history  we buy back substantially more stock than most people  And secondly  we also continue to want to work on the acquisition front  an investment company  If we feel that we don t have the opportunities  we ll continue to take that buyback up  But right now  if I look at what we ve bought back the last several years  there s been a pretty high pace  and I don t see any reason to take it any higher at this point in time  Now the Board always reviews that if we see the acquisition front state is very moderate  then we re going to have the situation coming forth that we re going to have to increase the leverage and the balance sheet  But keep in mind  I ve said it again  we re already paying back shareholders 85  of our cash flow in 2020  85   That is a good number Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAll right Appreciate it  Thanks Dave OperatorOur last question comes from Robert McCarthy at Stephens Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystGood afternoon  everyone David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon Rob Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystI guess the first question  have you had any contact with the Chinese authorities about the nature of the response  what they need to do  any kind of comfort around that  Because  obviously  it seems to be there s definitely a credibility gap that seems to be emerging over the last couple of days  And any thoughts around that just given the fact that you have substantial tendrils in China David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOur organization  we have a leadership there  The team s in constant contact with the Chinese government  and we get a    Mike and I and the top OC get a daily report back out from what they re being told by the government  both at the national level and the local level  I mean  I disagree that the Chinese government are misleading people  I feel they ve been very open to us  Now everyone wants a hard answer  but you can t get a hard answer in something that s moving like this  But as I look at the consistent information I m getting from the government and to the regional governments to my people and my leadership team that reports into Mike  I feel very good about it  So my comfort level right now is pretty high  But key issue for me is can they get the plant there    a lot of the people go back to work if nothing else major happens here  And then can the supply chain start mobilizing  because logistics could be a problem as things start flowing around  But it s just a matter of getting planning  And I know Mike and all the guys and gals across China are working this pretty hard right now  So I feel    my comfort level is pretty good  assuming they can hold that tent  Or if it goes to 11  to 12   that does a big deal  Within that  a couple of days  that s    Rob  So I feel    I think we re ready at this point in time  But again  it goes back to the Apollo moon shots when it comes back in the United States  we re in that blackout period right now  the reentry blackout period for about the next five or six days Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystYes  I mean  to that point  it s almost    it seems like your guidance outlook could have two very almost binary outcomes or trajectories because  one  you could see global synchronous downturn  real problems with supply chain  demand destruction in oil impacting your projects to a material degree  But then  obviously  high visibility on you in terms of your cost actions  Conversely  if we do have a quicker than expected resolution to this  you could see a pronounced rebound in oil  which would probably be broadly stimulative of upstream projects  You could see the    an upside to growth  overall  which    and obviously  maybe attentively  M A  but that obviously puts a lot more pressure on you to deliver the restructuring in what would be fundamentally a different demand environment  How do you square the circle in terms of where we could be David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I don t    first of all  I m not in the Pandora s box  which is your first thing  where you might as well throw in a couple of locus to tax and maybe some ships going down and claims going down at the same time there  And I m not in that side of the equation  I think that    and I    there are    I could say that there could be some positives as this thing recovers pretty quickly  I feel that  But I m more in the status right now that this thing slowly recovers and regrowth comes back  We probably lose a couple of points of the high single digit growth that we were talking about for China  which takes a little bit away from us a little bit  So I m more the glass half full than the glass empty or glass awful  we see this one Frank Dellaquila    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerEven if they re doing stimulus  it s going to really be more than that  make it to next year  even David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think we get    let s    I know everyone s trying to guess  second guess this  I think you ve got to wait    those dates  the 10th  and they ve been holding here pretty consistent  If those things hold in let s say  the 10th or 11th  going back to work and we start seeing the plants up and running  then I feel good about that  Now If the plants start starting up and they start failing  and that could be a good thing for us because it s obviously business  But I think we ve got to watch that  So you ve got to listen to all your    all the people you follow and listen to them and see how things are starting  And I think that will be the key indication  Are they starting up or not starting up  Where they getting the supplies  I think you re going to hear people communicate that pretty loud and clear Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystThank you for answering my questions  We ll see you next week David N  Farr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI want to thank everybody  Again  I want to thank the global organization  I want to thank the investors and the shareholders for supporting us as we go through this process  Thank you very much now  Bye Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  68 minutesCall participants Pete Lilly    Director of Investor RelationsTimothy Reeves    Director of Investor

173730,395246,EMR,Trump immigration plan may increase visas for highly skilled workers  sources,news,"By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON  Reuters    A merit based immigration proposal being put together by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner could lead to an increase in U S  visas for highly skilled workers  sources familiar with the effort said on Wednesday  Kushner is expected to present the comprehensive plan next week to President Donald Trump  who will decide whether to adopt it as his official position or send it back for changes  the sources said  The plan does not propose ways to address young people who came to the United States illegally as children who were protected by former President Barack Obama in the 2014 program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA   or those people who have Temporary Protected Status  the sources said  Democrats  whose support the White House would need to advance any kind of immigration legislation through Congress  have insisted that the DACA recipients be protected  Kushner has held about 50 listening sessions with conservative groups on immigration  a senior administration official said  He has been working with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and policy adviser Stephen Miller on the plan and the sources said there has been some intense behind the scenes jockeying about the plan  At a Time magazine forum in New York on Tuesday  Kushner said he was working well with Miller  an immigration hawk  on the topic  The two men are both long time Trump advisers   Stephen and I haven t had any fights   he said with a smile  That drew skepticism from immigration advocate Marshall Fitz of the Emerson  NYSE EMR  Collective  who gave Kushner credit for advancing criminal justice reform but said immigration was a dramatically different issue that Miller was dominating at the White House   It s impossible to see how Kushner could navigate an issue this freighted with history and central to the president s re election strategy in a way that would actually move the ball forward   Fitz said  As a White House candidate in 2016 and throughout his presidency  Trump has advocated a hard line policy on immigration  pushing for a wall to be built on the U S  Mexico border and using bruising rhetoric to describe people who have fled Central American countries to enter the United States  Republicans have largely supported his immigration proposals  but the latest White House plan aims to bring them together on a broader basis  Some in the U S  business community have asked that the number of highly skilled visas be raised to attract more employees from abroad for specialized jobs amid a booming U S  economy  Trump himself has talked of the need to bring in more skilled workers  The immigration plan would either leave the number of highly skilled visas each year at the same level or raise it slightly  the sources said  The overall goal is to reshape the visa program into a more merit based system  a key Trump goal  Officials working on the plan have been reviewing the systems used by Canada and Australia as possible models for the Trump effort  The group has been working on a guest worker program as part of the proposal to address the U S  agriculture community s need for seasonal labor while not hurting American workers  but nothing has been finalized  the sources said  Trump has sought to court farmers in key battleground states to boost his chances of re election in 2020  The proposal will include recommendations for modernizing ports of entry along the U S  border to ensure safe trade while preventing illegal activity  It also aims to decrease the number of immigrants able to enter the United States based on their family ties  the sources said  Trump has already taken steps to address those immigrants who overstay their visas  Kushner  who is Trump s son in law  is also a main architect of a Middle East peace proposal that the president is expected to unveil this summer

173731,395247,EMR,Advisers Lighthizer  Mnuchin opposed Trump s tariffs over immigration  sources,news,"By Steve Holland WASHINGTON  Reuters    Frustrated at an unending flow of migrants across the southern border  President Donald Trump overruled the advice of his two top trade advisers in abruptly imposing tariffs on Mexico  sources familiar with the situation said on Friday  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were both  blindsided  when Trump made the decision  said one of the sources  Lighthizer had expressed fears that slapping the tariffs on Mexico could complicate efforts to get Congress to approve a recently agreed trade pact between the United States  Mexico and Canada  said the sources  who asked not to be identified   Trump announced on Thursday that as of June 10 he would impose a 5  tariff on all goods coming from Mexico and would continue to ratchet it higher until Mexico takes action to stop an increase in mostly Central American migrants crossing the U S  southern border with Mexico  Jeff Emerson  NYSE EMR   a spokesman for the U S  Trade Representative s office  said on Friday that Lighthizer  supports the president and supports what the president is doing   But the sources said Lighthizer had disagreed with Trump on the tariffs  Emerson said the USTR will not be administering the Mexico tariffs  as it has done for duties levied on some  250 billion of Chinese goods in Trump s trade war with Beijing  Instead  he referred questions about the tariffs on Mexico to the Department of Homeland Security  which will be the lead agency in the effort  Spokespersons for the U S  Treasury and DHS could not immediately be reached for comment  Trump had grown increasingly agitated in recent days about the situation along the border  frustrated that nothing his administration had tried was stopping the surge in migrant arrivals  two administration officials said  In April  U S  border officers apprehended nearly 99 000 people crossing the U S  southern border  the highest monthly figure since 2007  Trump has diverted money from government agencies to pay for a border wall  an effort that has been tied up in courts  and his administration has separated some migrants from their children  but the policies have not had a significant effect on reducing the number of people crossing illegally  He is eager to use immigration as an issue for his 2020 re election campaign  but is under pressure to show results that he promised during his 2016 presidential run  Trump had in the past talked about getting tougher on Mexico with tariffs but advisers had talked him out of it  This time  however  he decided to go ahead  two sources close to him said   He s putting his foot down   one said  Trump felt that tariffs had forced Mexico to respond to U S  concerns over trade relations in the past and wanted to try the tactic again  The decision was supported by Stephen Miller  his hawkish immigration adviser  the administration officials said  CNBC  which initially reported the opposition by Mnuchin and Lighthizer  quoted a source as saying Trump made the decision on immigration after becoming  riled up  by conservative radio commentary about the surge in border crossings  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier on CNBC that he believed Mexico will respond  very favorably and very quickly  to Trump s tariff action  In Mexico  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador predicted that Trump would ease up on his demands and Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said he had begun negotiating with officials in Washington

173733,395249,EMR,Supreme Court allows foul language trademarks in F word case,news," Editor s note  contains language that some readers may find offensive  By Andrew Chung WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a longstanding U S  ban on trademarks on  immoral  or  scandalous  words and symbols  ruling in a case involving a clothing brand with an indelicate name that the law violates constitutional free speech rights  The justices ruled against President Donald Trump s administration  which defended the law that had been in place since 1905  and in favor of Los Angeles streetwear designer Erik Brunetti  who was turned down by U S  Patent and Trademark Office when he sought to trademark his brand name FUCT  All nine justices agreed in the decision written by liberal Justice Elena Kagan that the prohibition on  immoral  trademarks ran afoul of the U S  Constitution s First Amendment right to free expression  However  three justices wrote dissents to say the bar on  scandalous  trademarks should have been upheld  The Supreme Court followed a course it took in 2017 when it struck down a similar law forbidding the registration of  disparaging  trademarks in a case involving an Asian American dance rock band called The Slants  a name federal trademark officials had deemed offensive to Asians   When the 2011 trademark application for FUCT was rejected  the Patent and Trademark Office noted that brand name sounds like a profanity   sometimes politely called the  F word    though is spelled differently  and concluded that Brunetti s products contained sexual imagery  misogyny and violence    There are a great many immoral and scandalous ideas in the world  even more than there are swear words    Kagan wrote in Monday s decision  adding that the trademark law covers them all   It therefore violates the First Amendment    Today is a good day for Americans   Brunetti s lawyer John Sommer said   The U S  Supreme Court has taken the government out of the business of deciding questions of morality   The Patent and Trademark Office said it was reviewing the decision  The Justice Department declined to comment  The justices  who are due to wrap up their current term in the coming days with a handful of other major rulings on tap  upheld a 2017 lower court ruling striking down the law  The decision removes the authority of government officials to bar federal trademark registration for profane language or sexually graphic images  The Trump administration had warned that invalidating the law would unleash a torrent of extreme words and sexually graphic images on the marketplace  Brunetti s brand includes products such as a pullover sweatshirt saying  The world is fuct   sweatpants saying  We are fuct   and a T shirt saying  Fuct is free speech  free speech is fuct    ODIOUS RACIAL EPITHET  Justices Sonia Sotomayor  Stephen Breyer and John Roberts were the three justices who partly dissented  Sotomayor said the government will now have no choice but to register  the most vulgar  profane or obscene words and images imaginable   Breyer said such words could even lead to physical altercations   Just think about how you might react if you saw someone wearing a t shirt or using a product emblazoned with an odious racial epithet   Breyer said   Brunetti sought a trademark because it would make it easier

victory for the First Amendment   Government bureaucrats should not be deciding what speech is or is not deserving of trademark protection based on what they consider to be too  scandalous  and  immoral    ACLU attorney Emerson  NYSE EMR  Sykes said  The Trump administration had argued that banning vulgar terms and sexually indecent images did not discriminate against anyone s viewpoint  and that the government should not be forced through the trademark system to promote words and images that would be shocking or profane to the public  On Monday  Kagan offered examples of the law s bias toward certain views  highlighting the government s approval of anti drug or pro religious messages but rejection of a trademark for  Bong Hits 4 Jesus    The dissenting justices suggested the  scandalous  provision of the law could be salvaged to forbid obscenity or profanity because it does not attack ideas  but only the way in which ideas are expressed   Justice Samuel Alito  who agreed to strike down the law  said Congress could come up with a narrower statute banning vulgarity that conveys only emotion   The registration of such marks  trademarks  serves only to further coarsen our popular culture   Alito said  The case marked the latest important free speech decision by the justices  In another free speech case decided last year  the court struck down a Minnesota law prohibiting apparel bearing political messages in polling sites  Also last year  the court blocked a California law requiring clinics that counsel women against abortion to notify clients of the availability of abortions paid for by the state  finding that it violated the free speech rights of the Christian based facilities

President Donald Trump is struggling in states that matter most to his re election chances  according to a new tracking poll by the Morning Consult 
The president has sustained double digit declines in net approval rate in nearly every state that could be considered a tossup  and more voters disapprove than approve of him in states like Wisconsin  Michigan  Iowa  Pennsylvania and Ohio that Trump won in 2016  Some of the biggest swings are in the southwestern U S   where the president s focus on hardening immigration policy may be hurting him  According to the poll  Trump saw a 30 point swing toward disapproval in New Mexico and a 26 point negative swing in Arizona

A rally for Warren in Seattle over the weekend drew a crowd that her campaign estimated at 15 000 people and described as the largest of her presidential bid 
Trump has frequently accused the media of downplaying the attendance at his rallies since the beginning of his administration  On his first full day in office he complained that the size of the crowd at his inauguration had been deliberately understated by reporters  His press secretary  Sean Spicer  later said the event featured  the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration  period  both in person and around the globe

complicated fellow liberal Elizabeth Warren s bid for the Democratic nomination  a path that runs straight through New Hampshire  Sanders  a U S  senator from neighboring Vermont  retains a strong following in the state where he trounced Hillary Clinton by more than 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential contest   An Emerson  NYSE EMR  College opinion poll of New Hampshire voters released on Saturday showed Sanders to be the top choice of respondents with 27 percent of the vote  Warren  a senator from neighboring Massachusetts  was far behind at 9 percent   a worrisome number given many New Hampshire voters are familiar with her   But as Warren  69  returned to the early voting state over the weekend for the second time this month  there were signs she could be chipping away at Sanders  support a year before the New Hampshire primary election  Some New Hampshire residents who voted for Sanders last time told Reuters they now were leaning toward Warren  Some said the 77 year old Sanders  political window had closed  Others said they wanted to see a female nominee   Bernie lost his shine   said Candace Moulton  36  who attended Warren s campaign event in Manchester  New Hampshire   I think we re really ready to have a woman president  to be frank   New Hampshire often has been where presidential aspirations are solidified  While the Iowa caucuses serve as the first test of a candidate s strength  New Hampshire holds the first party primary  and has been a state where a contender can build momentum  salvage a campaign or reach the end of the road   Ten Democrats have already declared their candidacy for the party s nomination  and more are expected to join the contest  The winner will likely face Republican President Donald Trump in the general election in November 2020   nL1N20E0EH  New Hampshire s primary traditionally has favored candidates with ties to the region  making it important for Sanders and Warren to target  Both are progressives with similar policy platforms that include providing universal health care coverage and raising the minimum wage  Dante Scala  a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire  said he expects the presidential field to narrow significantly by the time the primary comes    There s a good likelihood that New Hampshire will be framed as a Sanders Warren competition with one ticket out   he said   Should Warren fail to win Iowa  New Hampshire becomes a  must win   Scala said   It s hard to see her lasting if she can t win here   Former Vice President Joe Biden could muddy things further if he mounts a bid  Biden placed second in the Emerson poll  and his high name recognition with voters could give him a boost  FRIENDLY TERRITORY Warren campaigned in New Hampshire as if she were a local   You guys know me   she told a gathering of 1 000 state party leaders and activists in Manchester on Friday  She followed up by speaking to a full hall in Plymouth on Saturday  On this swing  Warren played up her personal story over policy  talking about her family s struggles growing up in Oklahoma and the challenges she faced as a young mother  After the Plymouth event  Nancy Chandler  84  said Warren won her support with a fiery speech where she talked about wanting  big  systemic change  and fighting for the middle class    I think the bus has passed   Chandler of Warren  New Hampshire  said of Sanders   Liz Alcauskas  74  of Manchester  said many of Sanders  ideas were important  but she planned to vote for a different Democrat in next year s election   I would like to not have an old  white man be president   she said   It s someone else s turn now   Even some of Sanders  most loyal supporters are unsure of him this time  Andru Volinsky  a member of Sanders  2016 steering committee in the state  said  my first inclination is towards Bernie  but I haven t ruled out a handful of others    The home field advantage enjoyed by Sanders and Warren has sparked speculation that other candidates may compete less intensely in New Hampshire  focusing instead on other early states  Senator Kamala Harris of California made her first campaign

173768,395284,EMR,As trade wars rage  Emerson plots new U S  expansion,news,"By Timothy Aeppel Ferguson  Mo   Reuters    In 2009  the chief executive of Emerson  NYSE EMR  Electric Co  bluntly told investors at a Chicago conference what many of his counterparts at other manufacturing firms would only say privately   I m not going to hire anybody in the United States  I m moving   David Farr said as he blasted U S  taxes and regulations and called it an easy decision to expand in India and China   Farr s flash of candor was emblematic of an era of free trade  globalization and offshoring of U S  jobs   one that has now come under attack in the trade wars launched by U S  President Donald Trump  A decade later  Farr has made a stunning reversal  Emerson now plans to build at least three new U S  plants and is already expanding existing domestic operations  Farr saw a new era of U S  protectionism coming before Trump s election   and started planning accordingly  he said in an interview with Reuters at the company s sprawling headquarters near St  Louis  Missouri   For the first time now  I m looking for best cost U S  locations  to build factories  he said  Trump s election  Farr said  accelerated a political shift against free trade policy that is now transforming many U S  firms  domestic investment strategy  Protectionist policies   especially toward China   are now a rare point on which many Democrats and Trump agree  relegating formerly bold Republican free traders to the sidelines  Emerson has committed  250 million for new U S  facilities through 2021  part of a larger domestic investment in existing operations  including a new headquarters and a factory renovation at its Wisconsin garbage disposal business  Emerson spent  407 million on U S  capital projects last year  a 38 percent jump from the year before  and plans to spend  425 million this year  Those investments have added 2 500 employees  Farr said  Emerson declined to say how many jobs the new factories would create  Emerson  a diversified manufacturer with  17 4 billion in sales last year  provides dozens of industries with thousands of products  from tools and large industrial valves to refrigeration  lighting and climate control systems  Its best known consumer brand may be the InSinkErator garbage disposal  Farr s new take on U S  investment reflects a broader questioning of overseas expansions  especially in China  for both political and operational reasons  A survey of top managers at 500 U S  companies conducted in December by investment bank UBS AG found that 31 percent have moved or are moving production facilities to avoid tariffs  Fifty eight percent said they expect tariffs to  have a positive impact on domestic investment   It remains unclear  however  whether and how much the trade policy upheaval will benefit U S  workers  Many firms fleeing China to avoid U S  tariffs are not moving to the United States  often choosing locations in Southeast Asia  Those that are expanding U S  operations are trying to maximize automation to minimize labor costs  and some U S  industries   such as consumers of steel   have said they plan to cut jobs because tariffs have raised their costs  The renewed domestic focus by Emerson  a major employer of high skilled workers  nonetheless stands out as a victory for Trump s protectionism  Emerson has been a poster child for globalization  and its CEO is among the nation s most influential manufacturing executives  Farr just completed a two year term as chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers  the sector s main lobbying organization  Emerson once had an overwhelming U S  and European focus  But that changed as it joined the stampede of manufacturers moving to emerging markets  When Farr became CEO in 2000  8 percent of Emerson s sales were in Asia  Last year  that hit 22 percent  and Emerson now has 26 000 employees in the region  slightly more than in the U S  and Canada  Most of the company s 215 factories sprinkled around the globe are now outside the U S   But one of Farr s first moves after Trump s election was to assign a task force of top managers to adapt the firm s investment plans to a less certain trade environment  The group has produced a top ten list of potential U S  locations for new plants  TURNING AGAINST TRADE  Free trade deals once had almost universal support among Republicans and broad support among Democrats  Farr noted that it was Democratic President Barack Obama who negotiated the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP   which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton once called the  gold standard  of trade agreements  But Clinton turned against the deal during the campaign as Trump s attacks on trade deals drew applause across the industrial Midwest  Trump withdrew the United States from the sweeping Pacific accord immediately after his election  and many Republican free traders have since gone silent on the issue or adopted variations of the president s rhetoric   You have a growing number in the Republican party aligned with what the President calls  America first    what others call isolationism   said Andrew Downs  director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Purdue University Fort Wayne  The tax reform passed by Republicans has also made the U S  a better place to invest by slashing taxes on businesses  Farr said  saving Emerson  189 million last year  The tax cuts enabled Emerson to grant a 2 9 percent general wage increase worth  42 million and better benefits  Some decisions remain in flux as trade disputes simmer  Emerson had long planned a new factory in Mexico to serve North America  but broke construction into two phases pending the outcome of a revised U S  trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that awaits congressional approval  The first phase is underway  but the second will only be built if the trade deal goes forward  Forces beyond politics are pushing manufacturers like Emerson to reconsider investments in China  including rising labor and logistics costs there  worries about transferring intellectual property to state run Chinese firms  and emerging technology to automate factories in high wage countries  Farr said his meetings with candidate Trump during the campaign convinced him he was serious about overhauling U S  trade relationships  But Emerson s renewed commitment to U S  manufacturing is also part of a larger move by global manufacturers to produce more goods in the regions where they are consumed to save on transportation costs   Foreign companies are also recalibrating  including Dutch multinational Koninklijke Philips NV  one of the world s largest electronics companies  which last year relied on the United States for 35 percent of its sales  CEO Frans van Houten told investors on a call in January that he is stepping up efforts   like Emerson   to produce more goods where they sell them  moving away from a model of factories specializing in products that are then shipped globally   The push is visible in trade data  said Susan Lund  a partner at McKinsey   Company who studies trade flows  In 2007  28 percent of global production of goods was traded   moving from one country to another  That share has dropped to 22 5 percent  Emerson s industrial valve and controls business is one area where Farr plans to move factory capacity to the United States to serve customers there  Emerson produces valves used in everything from fracking to oil refineries and has sprawling research and production facilities in Marshalltown  Iowa  which this fiscal year will receive a  22 million capital investment and three dozen new jobs  U S  valve factories produced only about half the goods it sold domestically in 2017  Emerson plans to push that to 90 percent by 2021  
 We re looking at two new facilities in Texas   Farr said   That will mean taking capacity  and jobs   out of Europe and some out of China   and bringing it to Texas  ",2019-03-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/as-trade-wars-rage-emerson-plots-new-us-expansion-1801646,1801646

173777,395293,EMR,F words and T shirts  U S  Supreme Court weighs foul language trademarks,news," Editor s note  contains language that some readers may find offensive  paragraphs 2  13  14  16  19  22 and 23  By Andrew Chung WASHINGTON  Reuters    In the staid world of the U S  Supreme Court  where decorum and etiquette are prized and silence is enforced by court police  the F word could create quite a stir   Yet that expletive and others will be the focus on Monday when the nine justices hear arguments in a free speech case brought by Los Angeles based clothing designer Erik Brunetti  His streetwear brand  FUCT    which sounds like  but is spelled differently than  a profanity   was denied a trademark by the U S  Patent and Trademark Office   Brunetti has tried to calm concern about the potential for foul language during arguments in the ornate courtroom  In a written brief  his lawyer told the justices  the discussion will be purely clinical  analogous to when medical terms are discussed   At issue is a provision of U S  trademark law that lets the trademark office deny requests for trademarks on  immoral  and  scandalous  words and symbols  Brunetti  50  is challenging the law as an infringement of his right to freedom of expression  protected by the U S  Constitution s First Amendment  In 2017  a Washington based federal appeals court ruled in his favor  President Donald Trump s administration has appealed that ruling to the conservative majority Supreme Court  The provision at issue has been on the books for more than a century  Uttering profanities inside the walls of the Supreme Court is one thing  The main concern  the administration said  is all the expletives and sexually graphic imagery that would flow into the marketplace if the law were to be struck down  For Brunetti  the government s fears are hypothetical   There are always going to be people who are offended  but you can t control how everybody thinks   Brunetti said in an interview   When it has to do with the First Amendment  it s a slippery slope   The justices struck down a similar law forbidding the registration of  disparaging  trademarks in a 2017 case involving an Asian American dance rock band called The Slants  a name that trademark officials deemed offensive to Asians  Speech may not be banned even if it expresses ideas that offend  the court ruled   Banning vulgar terms and sexually indecent images is different because it does not discriminate against anyone s viewpoint  U S  Solicitor General Noel Francisco  the administration s top Supreme Court lawyer  said in a written brief  Instead  it  advances the government s interest in encouraging the use of marks that are appropriate for all audiences  including children   The federal government  Francisco added  should not be forced through the trademark system to actively promote words and images the public would find shocking or profane   GRAPHIC  Major Supreme Court cases of 2018 2019 term     FRIENDS U CAN T TRUST  Brunetti  who grew up skateboarding  saw a market for edgy streetwear and founded FUCT in 1990  with a focus on questioning authority   That was the cleverness of it  that a majority of people think it s pronounced  fucked    he said  The acronym  he added  also means  Friends U Can t Trust   A trademark would make it easier to protect his brand against counterfeiters  But the FUCT trademark application  filed in 2011  was denied  The trademark office said the brand would be perceived as the phonetic equivalent of the profanity  observing that Brunetti s products contained sexual imagery  misogyny and violence   That sounds to me like every movie that has come out over the last 40 years   Brunetti said  adding that his products are actually quite tame   Should we start regulating the entertainment industry then   The American Civil Liberties Union  backing Brunetti in the case  noted that the Supreme Court in 1971 upheld the free speech rights of a Vietnam War opponent convicted of  offensive conduct  for wearing a  Fuck the Draft  jacket   We don t want the government picking and choosing the messages it approves and disapproves of   ACLU attorney Emerson  NYSE EMR  Sykes said   The court has decided other cases featuring profanities more recently  In 2009  it upheld a federal crackdown on  fleeting expletives  uttered on network television  including actress singer Cher s use of the F word at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards  Brunetti used to sell his wares in some retail stores  but has moved exclusively online  where his monthly lines sell out within hours  Among his recent products  A hoodie that reads   We are Fuct   In its 2017 ruling in Brunetti s favor  the U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit   a court that specializes in intellectual property   noted the ubiquitous nature of vulgar content  with or without trademarks  and skewered the government s attempts to police it   In this electronic Internet age  to the extent that the government seeks to protect the general population from scandalous material  with all due respect  it has completely failed   the court said   And it said the trademark office applies the law

173872,395388,EMR,Analysts Estimate Emerson Electric  EMR  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of process controls systems  valves and analytical instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 17 billion  up 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 6  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Emerson Electric 
For Emerson Electric  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Emerson Electric will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Emerson Electric would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 07  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Emerson Electric doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-emerson-electric-emr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200502328,200502328

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Emerson Electric shares have lost about 4 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Emerson Electric 
While Emerson Electric has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Emerson Electric was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

five consecutive months of contraction  In addition  the phase one trade deal between the United States and China is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will boost demand for U S  manufacturing products  We believe the impetus provided by President Trump s business friendly policies  including corporate tax overhaul  streamline of business regulations and higher government spending will continue to aid the electronic product manufacturing companies  Innovation remains one of the major priorities for industry participants as it helps in creating more demand from customers and fend off competition  However  these investments often weaken profitability of the participants and make them more leveraged  Also  uncertain demand environment for manufacturing electronic products caused by increasing geopolitical tensions  Brexit  inflationary pressure and unfavorable movement in foreign currencies are adding to the concerns  In addition  a stronger U S  dollar is weighing on the overseas trading arms of these companies  Electronic manufacturing companies require skilled labor for adopting innovative technologies to boost operational efficacy  However  the businesses are facing continued skilled labor shortage and high wage costs  In addition  shortage of truck drivers is affecting U S  manufacturing companies  On account of this  the firms are now

near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the

What s Next for Emerson Electric 
While Emerson Electric has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Emerson Electric was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

173931,395447,EMR,Emerson Electric  EMR  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of process controls systems  valves and analytical instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 83 billion  up 8 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Emerson Electric 
For Emerson Electric  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Emerson Electric will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Emerson Electric would post earnings of  0 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Emerson Electric doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerson-electric-emr-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200447188,200447188

173976,395492,EMR,What s In Store For Fortune Brands  FBHS  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Fortune Brands Home   Security  Inc    NYSE FBHS   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Jan 31  after market close 
The company has a dismal earnings surprise history  In the trailing four quarters  its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate once and missed thrice  the average negative earnings surprise being 4 54   Notably  in the last reported quarter  the company posted earnings of 93 cents  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 by 11 43  
Over the past six months  the company s shares have lost 25 8   wider than 11 5  decline recorded by the  it belongs to 

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Rising cost of sales and operating expenses are a major cause of concern for the company  In the first nine months of 2018  the Fortune Brands  cost of sales jumped 5 6  year over year  Material price inflation  on account of tariffs  and higher freight charges has been escalating Fortune Brands  aggregate costs  of late  The company expects tariffs to adversely impact its business by nearly  2  3 million in the fourth quarter 
Fortune Brands expects higher costs  impact of bond financing and inefficiencies existing within Security operations to weigh over its near term profitability  Notably  due to these issues  the company has lowered its earnings view for 2018 from  3 62  3 72 per share to  3 41  3 49 
Amid this backdrop  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the company s Cabinets segment is pegged at  624 million  The company generated  626 million in revenues a year ago  On the other hand  the consensus estimate for revenues from Plumbing segment in the to be reported quarter is currently pegged at  505 million  reflecting 7 7  growth year over year 
However  Fortune Brands remains focused on strengthening its competency on the back of meaningful business acquisitions  In September 2018  the company successfully completed the acquisition of Fiberon  LLC  As a matter of fact  this  470 million buyout complements Fortune Brands  existing door brand   Therma Tru   as well as enhances its growth opportunities in the outdoor living space 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Fortune Brands in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Fortune Brands has an Earnings ESP of  1 68  as the Most Accurate Estimate of 92 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Fortune Brands Home   Security  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

173977,395493,EMR,Emerson Electric  EMR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of process controls systems  valves and analytical instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 23 billion  up 10 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 49  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Emerson Electric 
For Emerson Electric  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 84  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Emerson Electric will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Emerson Electric would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 89  delivering a surprise of  3 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Emerson Electric appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerson-electric-emr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200380617,200380617

174102,395618,EMR,Should You Buy Emerson  EMR  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Emerson is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EMR in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 70 cents per share for EMR  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EMR  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  2 94  heading into earnings season Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that EMR has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Emerson  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaries   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2017-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-buy-emerson-(emr)-ahead-of-earnings-200204230,200204230
174103,395619,EMR,Emerson To Divest ClosetMaid  Enhance Focus On Core Business,opinion,As the ultimate step in its strategic portfolio restructuring  Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   inked a definitive agreement to divest its ClosetMaid business to Griffon Corporation for  260 million ClosetMaid  a leader in home organization and storage systems  currently comes under Emerson s Commercial   Residential Solutions business  and has been a strong revenue driver for the company in the last few years Emerson anticipates the deal to conclude within 30 days  with minimal impact on net earnings and earnings per share  Roughly  180 million will be generated in after tax cash proceeds from the divestment Portfolio Repositioning Over the last two years  Emerson has been executing restructuring activities to reposition its portfolio  and fuel efficiency and growth  The company is following a strategic plan to transform itself into a leaner and more focused organization by offloading certain segments of the business In fiscal 2016  the company sold three of its businesses   Network Power  Leroy Somer and Control Techniques   and generated  5 2 billion in proceeds  Notably  Network Power was sold to Platinum Equity for  4 billion  Post this transaction  Emerson retained a subordinated interest in Network Power  Similarly  Japan based Nidec took over Leroy Somer and Control Techniques businesses to Nidec Corporation for a purchase price of  1 2 billion These restructuring actions will enable Emerson to capitalize on its growth platforms  The company s actions seem to have been received well by investors  as its shares have appreciated 13 4  in a year s time  outperforming the  average of 7 2  Acquisitions GaloreEmerson has been also active in the acquisition space  in order to expand its core business  In April  the company completed the acquisition of Pentair Valves   Controls   a business unit of Pentair plc   for  3 15 billion Integrating Pentair s Valves   Controls business will enable Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio and help it offer complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network  thereby elevating the company s brand value The company is now aggressively working on integrating the Valves   Controls business  It expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive in fiscal 2018 and contribute meaningfully to operating cash flow Further  the company entered into an agreement to buy leading non intrusive corrosion monitoring technologies provider   Permasense Limited  The Permasense buyout will fortify Emerson s footprint in the integrity and corrosion management solutions business  It also expanded its global capabilities in fresh food monitoring  on the back of the Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts  These two companies will assist Emerson in facilitating steady and safe control of food  and other temperature sensitive goods During first quarter fiscal 2017  the company acquired Blending   Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI    a leading provider of systems for lubricant  grease  fuel and chemical blending applications   to fortify its presence in advanced flow measurement and control technologies  We believe these buyouts will help the company create a solid core business model and drive profitable growth  going forward Industry Trends   Impact on EmersonEmerson s process automation business has finally got over its recession  with orders turning positive in late 2016 and organic revenues growing  After the sale of a major chunk of this segment to Nidec Corporation  Emerson now generates more than 60  of its revenues from this segment  Improving industry trends bode well for this segment s growth in the quarters to come  In fact  Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 12  year over year growth in net sales in third quarter fiscal 2017 Going forward  ongoing recovery in oil and gas is likely to be the most significant profit driver for Emerson The company is enjoying broad based growth  driven by favorable trends in energy related  hybrid and general industrial markets  as well as strong demand in HVAC and refrigeration markets  Emerson expects increasingly favorable global market conditions and positive trends in capital spending  which will likely drive underlying sales growth across both platforms in the coming quarters Emerson Electric Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Summing UpIn light of the recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets  Emerson recently raised its outlook for fiscal 2017 for the third consecutive time  It now expects net sales for the year to grow about 5  with underlying sales to be up about 1   Further  backed by a strong operational performance  the company now projects earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of  2 58  2 62  earlier guidance   2 50  2 60  Emerson expects Automation Solutions net sales to be up 4 5   earlier projection  down 3 4    while Commercial   Residential Solutions net sales are anticipated to be up 5 6   in line with earlier projections  Solid order trends  successful multi year restructuring initiatives  and momentum in both its platforms will likely prove accretive for the company s sales  However  a strong U S  dollar  volatile industrial spending  and uncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc    NYSE B    IDEX Corporation   NYSE

174154,395670,EMR,Emerson  EMR  Q4 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results before the opening bell on Nov 1 
Last quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 4 8   Also  Emerson has beaten earnings estimates twice in the trailing four quarters for as many misses  resulting in an average positive surprise of 1 4  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
We believe that volatility in the oil and gas market  which has impacted Emerson s business throughout fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2016 so far  will likely prove to be a drag on fiscal fourth quarter s profits  Meanwhile  an oversupplied market has been hampering prices and spending levels of customers  thereby marring Emerson s prospects 
Further  activity in the upstream oil and gas space is affecting the company s orders  In September  Emerson revealed its orders for the trailing three months  which depicted a gloomy picture for the company  Order rates continued to plunge in all its key segments  excluding Network  Power and Climate Technologies 
In addition  constrained capital spending in North America and sluggishness in China continue to be an overhang  Also  Emerson believes that global economic conditions may take a turn for the worse on account of political uncertainty which will keep spending levels considerably low for the rest of fiscal 2016  Due to such tough economic conditions and dwindling order numbers  the company forecasts underlying sales to be down 5 6  in fiscal 2016 
We perceive that adverse market conditions and currency headwinds will prove to be major dampeners for the upcoming quarterly results 
Despite these negatives  a competent management team  along with high profile franchisees  remains major positives for Emerson  Of late  an uptick in manufacturing demand in the U S  and enhanced housing activity are proving conducive to growth  Further  crude oil has witnessed an uptick in recent times and this should bode well for Emerson s results 
Also  over the past few quarters  Emerson has been methodically divesting underperforming assets to invest in core business and achieve a leaner and more flexible organizational structure  It has prioritized cost structure alignment and strategic portfolio repositioning  and we believe that the cost savings will also boost the company s bottom line 
As part of the portfolio repositioning efforts  Emerson recently inked an agreement to purchase Pentair Valves   Controls  a business unit of Pentair plc   NYSE PNR    in a bid to strengthen its automation portfolio  This  3 15 billion buyout came close on the heels of the company s announcement that it will divest its Network Power  Leroy Somer and Control Techniques businesses  The sale of these three will generate  5 2 billion in proceeds  Such strategic initiatives will bolster the company s core operations and improve efficiency  thus driving future growth 
Emerson has also won numerous contracts in the quarter under review  It has secured an automation maintenance and reliability services contract for Shell s Prelude Floating Liquefied Natural Gas facility  Emerson has been acting as Main Automation Contractor on the Prelude project for half a decade 
Per the new multi year support contract  Emerson professionals will work onshore and offshore and offer reliability and maintenance services for a wide range of equipment  Emerson was also chosen by French oil firm   Total Exploration and Production Services   for its control and safety system maintenance services  In addition  Nexen Petroleum U K  selected Emerson for a five year contract to provide metering management services  Such wins will definitely improve the company s operations EMERSON ELEC CO Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Emerson will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 89 cents 
Zacks Rank  Emerson s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP as well to be confident about an earnings beat 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Ashford Hospitality Prime  Inc    NYSE AHP    scheduled to release results on Nov 2  has an Earnings ESP of  9 76  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG    slated to release earnings results on Nov 1  has an Earnings ESP of  1 25  and a Zacks Rank  2

174155,395671,EMR,Emerson s  EMR  Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  View Bleak,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   reported fourth quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents by 7 9   and reflecting a 3  increase from the year ago tally 

For fiscal 2016  Emerson s adjusted earnings slid down 6  year over year to  2 98 per share  Weakness in top line  high restructuring expenses and challenging demand conditions in key markets constrained profits 
Inside the Headlines
Net sales continued to show significant weakness  as they decreased 6  year over year to  5 5 billion  Underlying sales growth for the quarter was negative globally  except the U S  and China  which were flat  In aggregate  underlying sales were down 5   Sustained challenging macroeconomic conditions and significant decline in spending by global customers in the oil   gas and industrial markets were the primary causes of the dismal top line performance 
For fiscal 2016  Emerson s sales were down 9  to  20 2 billion  as the company grappled with persistent difficult conditions in key served markets 
Segment wise  Process Management s net sales fell about 11  in the quarter to  2 046million  with underlying sales also slipping 11   which was attributable to low order rates stemming from weak global spending in the oil and gas industry  The segment recorded weakness across North America  Asia  Middle East and Latin America  with a flat Europe 
Industrial Automation reported a 7  decline in year over year net sales to  543 million  with an underlying sales decrease of 11  due to persistent softness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas markets  Geographically  this segment also witnessed an all round weakness 
Network Power s net sales fell 2  year over year  with underlying sales declining by a similar percentage  Strong performance in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending drove growth and North America charted robust growth  However  this was more than offset by declines in other businesses 
Last quarter  Emerson had announced that the Network Power is being sold to Platinum Equity for  4 billion  as a part of its portfolio streamlining initiatives  Post this transaction  Emerson will retain a subordinated interest in Network Power  Emerson is now reporting the entire Network Power segment as discontinued operations  pending its divestiture 
Climate Technologies stood out as the only one with positive year over year sales growth as its net sales were up 6  year over year to  1 1065 million  with a 6  increase in underlying sales  The segment benefited from robust demand in the U S  air conditioning and commercial refrigeration market  particularly in China  
Commercial   Residential Solutions  net sales fell 15  year over year to  425 million  driven largely by the divestiture of the commercial storage business  Good performance in food waste disposers and wet dry vacuums business were more than offset by declines in the professional tools and residential storage business 
Underlying sales were relatively flat year over year  after taking into account the previous year divestiture of the commercial storage business  Improving trends in the U S  construction market bode well for the segment s outlook in the coming quarters 
EMERSON ELEC CO Price and EPS Surprise
 
   Other Developments
Last quarter  Emerson announced agreements to sell its Network Power  Leroy Somer and Control Techniques businesses for an aggregate value of  5 2 billion  The deals are part of the company s portfolio repositioning strategy  as it seeks to enhance focus on its core Automation Solutions and Commercial   Residential Solutions businesses  The restructuring will help Emerson leverage on its growth platforms and drive profitable growth 
The company also inked an agreement to purchase Pentair Valves   Controls  a business unit of Pentair plc  for  3 15 billion  in order to drive efficiency and growth Integrating Pentair s Valves   Controls business will allow Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio and help it in offering complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network  thereby elevating its brand value 
During the quarter  Emerson also expanded its global capabilities in fresh food monitoring  with the Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts  The two companies will assist Emerson in facilitating steady and safe control of food and other temperature sensitive goods 
Liquidity   Cash Flow
Exiting the quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  3 2 billion with long term debt of  4 1 billion  Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter surged 34 7  from the prior year quarter to  2 499 million  driven by superior working capital management 
Outlook
Emerson expects the unfavorable operating environment to continue  with oil and gas markets showing significantly depressed spending levels  In particular  the company anticipates the automation business to suffer  as difficult economic conditions and political uncertainty hurt both operational and capital spending across multiple end markets 
Thus  the company estimates net and underlying sales for fiscal 2017 to decline 1 3   down from previous projections of 5 8    Further  Emerson projects reported earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of  2 35  2 50  compared with fiscal 2016 earnings of  2 45 per share  
To Conclude
Emerson s persistent problems continue to hurt its operations  The company expects the global market environment to remain challenging  with a strong U S  dollar  low industrial spending and weakness in emerging and mature economies among the major concerns  Further  Emerson foresees a decrease in profitability in the near term owing to the volume deleverage stemming from weakness in underlying sales and impact of restructuring initiatives 
However  Emerson s cost cutting and restructuring initiatives are likely to benefit the company  going forward  Moreover  strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets will likely support sales in the coming quarters 
Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the broader sector include AO Smith Corp    NYSE AOS    II VI Inc    NASDAQ IIVI   and Applied Industrial Technologies Inc    NYSE AIT

174183,395699,EMR,EMR  Hi Yield  Sound Value  59 Consecutive Years Of Dividend Increases,opinion,"Introduction
When I m looking for a stock to add to my portfolio  there s nothing more frustrating than spending a significant amount of time and effort on research   only to discover that the company in question is significantly overvalued  Consequently  my first step always starts out with an assessment of the relative valuation of the company I am considering  No matter how much I admire the company  its management team and its financial health and strength  I simply refuse to pay more for a stock than I believe it is worth  The most commonly accepted investing principle is to buy low and sell high 
In Part 1 of this two part series found here I ran the blue chip Dividend Aristocrat and Champion Emerson Electric Company  NYSE EMR  through many variations of time honored fair valuation measurements  My general conclusion was that Emerson Electric was reasonably valued  and therefore  worthy of conducting a more comprehensive research effort on 
Since the time that Part 1 was written  Emerson Electric s stock price has increased approximately a couple of dollars per share  Nevertheless  I still consider it comfortably within a fair value range  but obviously not as attractive as it was last week  As a result  investors might want to wait for a better entry point  However  there s no guarantee that that would happen 
Sidebar on Emerson Electric s Valuation Calculations
After posting part 1 of this 2 part series  I received several questions regarding how I calculated the fair value multiple that I applied to the earnings and cash flow metrics that I presented  Here is what I wrote in part 1 

 With these 10 year average calculations in hand  I can run what I consider conservative fair valuation levels for each of these metrics measured against Emerson Electric s current market price of approximately  50 75 
For cash flow  I apply a historical normal cash flow value multiple of 9 5 which gives me a fair value price of  49 00  This is approximately  2 below Emerson Electric s current price  This valuation method suggests that Emerson Electric is mildly overvalued based on cash flows  which is important from a dividend perspective 
For operating cash flow  I apply a normal price to operating cash flow multiple of 12 4  which gives me a fair value price of  50 22  This valuation method indicates that Emerson Electric is fully valued based on the market s historical operating cash flow multiple 
For operating earnings I apply Emerson Electric s normal P E ratio for this timeframe of 16 9  which gives the fair value price of  50 70  This valuation method indicates that Emerson Electric is fairly valued based on the market s historical operating earnings multiple 
For free cash flow I apply Emerson Electric s 10 year historical normal price to free cash flow multiple of 15  which gives me the fair value price of  50 10  This valuation method indicates that Emerson Electric is fairly valued based on a reasonable price to free cash flow  

In order to come up with these calculations  I utilized  which automatically ran these calculations for me  For example  the following 10 year operating cash flow and price correlated graph on Emerson Electric reflects the normal 12 4 multiple I referenced  I offer this example to provide an opportunity to elaborate on statistical references such as a historical normal valuation metric 
The blue line on the following graph represents a normal price to cash flow multiple of 12 4  Therefore  anywhere the price of the stock  the black line  touches the blue line it is trading at a price to cash flow multiple of 12 4  Obviously  when the price is above that line the multiple is higher  and when the price is below that line the multiple is lower  Consequently  the blue line serves as a valuation reference that can be analyzed over this entire timeframe  In other words  it is a valuation that the market has most commonly applied to Emerson Electric based on cash flows over the time period being measured 
On the other hand  it is not perfectly precise across the whole time period  There are times when the market valued Emerson Electric higher  and times when it valued Emerson Electric lower  Nevertheless  it clearly represents a reasonable valuation reference within a reasonable range of accuracy  Currently  Emerson Electric is trading at a price to cash flow multiple of 13 4 which is modestly above the 12 4 average  Therefore  I believe it is logical to state that Emerson Electric might be fully valued based on this metric today  but not significantly overvalued  Stated differently  Emerson Electric appears prudent based on its operating cash flow valuation  but not necessarily cheap 

Emerson Electric  Researching the Business behind the Stock
My approach is to position myself as a long term shareholder of the business rather than speculating in the stock  Consequently  once I have determined that fair valuation is present  my next step is to dig deeper into the business that I am considering investing in  Therefore  I like to remove the distraction of stock price from my analysis at this stage in the process and focus solely on how the business has historically performed 
Additionally  my focus is also placed upon how the company satisfies the primary investment objective that I am seeking by investing in the business  In the case of Emerson Electric  my primary investment objective is for achieving an above average and growing current dividend yield  Therefore  the dividend line  the honeydew green or white colored line  represents my primary focal point  Emerson Electric is a Dividend Aristocrat and Champion that has increased its dividend for 59 consecutive years  My graph only goes back to 1997  however  it is clear that Emerson Electric has steadily increased its dividend each and every year 
On the other hand  as indicated in part 1 of this series  a review of Emerson Electric s historical operating earnings  the orange line on the graph  clearly indicates periods of cyclicality  This simply means that Emerson Electric has not historically grown their earnings each and every single year  This is simply what is meant by referring to Emerson Electric as a cyclical stock 
Nevertheless  this does not mean that the company produces losses from time to time  A review of the operating earnings below illustrates that Emerson Electric has been a profitable enterprise even during cycles when earnings were falling from the previous year  More simply stated  Emerson Electric is a profitable business even during down cycles which partially explains why they have been able to continue to grow their dividend over so many decades 

When I am initially examining a business for prospective investment  I start out by reviewing its long term earnings performance as I did with Emerson Electric above  Next  I like to also look at its historical cash flow generating performance  Examining cash flows is even more relevant when I am evaluating a dividend paying stock  Clearly  Emerson Electric is more than adequately covering its current dividends with strong cash flows  even during down cycles 

In spite of Emerson Electric s moderate level of cyclicality  the company s dividend record has been impressive and I really like its current yield considering today s low interest rate environment  Therefore  I am motivated to take a deeper look at the financial health and vigor of this cyclical business  Of course  this implies diving into the company s financial statements 
The first metric I like to examine in the financial statements is revenues  Bottom line results like earnings must start and come from the top line  Additionally  accounting conventions coupled with financial engineering could possibly paint a rosier earnings picture than is deserved  whereas top line results clearly illustrate whether a business is truly solid or not  I like to look at revenues from two perspectives  First  I examine gross revenues in dollars  Emerson Electric s long term revenue growth has been generally strong with only moderate periods of cyclicality as depicted below 

However  since I am also a passive shareholder  I also like to look at revenues per share  Revenues per share can be impacted by what some call financial engineering in the form of share buybacks  On the other hand  as I will later illustrate  share buybacks can be a positive or a negative depending on the company s stock valuation at the time and or whether or not the company has a good use or need of its cash to fund future growth  Emerson Electric s revenue per share record is consistent with its gross revenues 

After reviewing a company s top line  I like to turn my attention to profitability  At this point  I am interested in determining how much profitability the company generates per dollar of sales  To evaluate this  I look at gross profit margins compared to net profit margins  Emerson Electric generates very high gross profit margins  which I consider a plus 
My personal benchmark for net profit margin on a growth stock is 15  or better  However  that is too high a standard to apply to cyclical stocks with significant manufacturing components  Therefore  I prefer to measure cyclical stocks net profit margins relative to its sector norms  The NYU Stern School of Business produced a review as of  that shows net margins for Emerson Electric s subsectors average between 6  to 8   Emerson Electric s net margins have typically been above that range  and have been increasing over the last few years  Therefore  relative to many of its peers  Emerson Electric generates strong net profit margins 

After I have reviewed profit margins  I typically turn to analyzing return on equity  As a shareholder  I consider this metric important because it essentially measures the return the company is earning on shareholder money  I am quite comfortable when I see a return on equity of 10  or better  Emerson Electric earns returns on equity significantly above this threshold  One caveat regarding return on equity is that companies can boost it by taking on more debt  Consequently  I put more weight on this metric when debt levels are reasonable   as is the case with Emerson Electric 

Thus far  I ve illustrated some of the go to metrics that I like to look at when evaluating the strength and health of a business I might be interested in investing in  However  I don t stop here  Additionally  I thoroughly examine the company s balance sheet  cash flow statement and income statement  These financial items are available from numerous sources  Personally  I utilize F A S T  Graphs  and FUN Graphs  fundamental underlying numbers  to facilitate a deeper look into the company s financials 
I typically start out by examining all of the metrics together on the company s balance sheet  cash flow statement and income statement  Here is a sample of Emerson Electric s balance sheet  which includes assets per share  atps   cash per share  cashps   common equity per share  ceps    also known as book value  debt long term per share  dltps   debt to total per share  dtps  and invested capital per share  icaptps  

Additionally  I will look at each metric on the balance sheet one at a time in order to focus more clearly on each metric  Here s an example of Emerson Electric s cash  Clearly  Emerson Electric possesses significant financial resources and flexibility 

Learning About The Business
Once I have thoroughly examined a company s financial results  health and strength  I typically turn my attention to learning as much as I can about what the company does and how it makes its money  The easiest way to do that is to simply follow the link on my F A S T  Graphs to the company s website 
Although I recognize that much of what I will find will be company propaganda spun as positively as they can  I can also learn a lot about the company s products and various business enterprises  Here is a snapshot from Emerson Electric s website illustrating key product areas with specific links to each  If I m seriously interested in investing in the company  I will peruse each of those links  Emerson Electric could currently be described as a conglomerate operating in several diverse industry segments 

However  Emerson Electric has a legacy of transforming and evolving their business to stay current  The following slide from their 2016 Investor Conference reveals their transformation from 1990 to 2000 

These next slides reveal that Emerson Electric s management expects to be very active in transforming the company for 2016 and beyond 

Emerson Electric s strategic transformation is designed to create a more focused Emerson Electric  Their ultimate goal is focused on increased profitability and strong cash flow generation 

An integral aspect of their strategic transformation includes both divestitures and strategic acquisitions  Management is contemplating either spinoffs or direct sales of certain business segments  Although the exact form that these divestitures will take is still under consideration  I believe either strategy will directly benefit existing shareholders  However  the precise benefit is only conjecture at this point 

Emerson Electric s endgame is to create a better balanced and more focused business model designed to enhance profitability and future growth  Although Emerson s transformation is an ambitious undertaking  the company has a long history of evolving and adapting 
Nevertheless  in addition to the historical cyclical nature of their operating history  this transition does create a level of uncertainty  On the other hand  as indicated above  Emerson Electric has the financial health and strength to execute  and a management team that has the experience to get the job done 

ZACKS Research Reasons to Buy Emerson Electric
In addition to learning as much as I can about a company via its website  I also like to check other resources to see what they have to say  This would include searching for articles on financial blogs such as Seeking Alpha or Gurufocus  prominent financial newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal as well as research services that I subscribe to  My objective is to learn as much about the business and its future potential as I can 
For example  ZACKS Research will typically provide reasons to buy a company and reasons to sell  I like this balanced approach because it provides both the positives and the negatives regarding the company I am researching 
Currently ZACKS presents several positives on Emerson Electric  They site improving trends in US construction and Emerson s historical approach to mergers and acquisitions  They also favor Emerson s cost cutting and restructuring initiatives  And they feel confident regarding Emerson s transformation and streamlining efforts 
On the negative side  they reference the current turmoil and volatility in the oil and gas market and weak economic conditions in the industrial markets  They also point out headwinds in China and other markets potentially weighing on underlying future sales growth 
The ZACKS Research is only available to subscribers  However  there are numerous other sources that prospective investors can examine that are not subscription based 
Emerson Electric  Investment Thesis
From the perspective of capital appreciation  I believe the best time to consider investing in a cyclical stock is during a down cycle  However  that does not mean having the insight to purchase at the absolute bottom  This is impossible  but identifying a down cycle is certainly possible  I believe Emerson Electric is currently in a down cycle  and I believe the company is taking the necessary steps to propel the business to their next up cycle  On the other hand  cyclical stocks are not typically your best choice for maximum capital gain 
Even so  my interest in Emerson Electric is not maximum total return  Instead  I am looking for a predictable long term dividend income stream and growth thereof  Emerson Electric is not only a Dividend Aristocrat and Champion  it is also a member of a more elite list known as Dividend Kings that only contains 18 companies that consecutively increased their dividend for 50 years or more  I m not absolutely certain who created this list  but I came across it from the website Sure Dividend  
What I found most interesting about this list is that many of the companies on this list are cyclical stocks  As a result  they don t have the highest long term growth rates  however  their historical records of increasing their dividends each year are virtually second to none  Although this is pure speculation on my part  it might suggest that the management teams of these Dividend Kings recognize that in order to attract and retain shareholders  they need to compensate with an impeccable dividend policy 
Summary and Conclusions
I offer Emerson Electric as an attractive high quality dividend growth stock currently available at attractive valuation  The company offers a high current yield  has an A S P credit rating  and a debt to capital ratio of only 27   The company is currently in transition  but this is nothing new for this company that has been in business since 1890  If high current income with the opportunity to see that income grow is your objective  then I suggest taking a close look at Emerson Electric

When it comes time to put it all together  pundits will be asking 
What is the risk reward tradeoff for stocks  
Last Week
The news was very good  and the market responded 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted that the pundits would be focused on the oil price rally and what it meant for investors in stocks  That was a good call  with the theme continuing through week s end  Several sources  both the recent strength and the apparent ceiling at  50 barrel  As a bonus  the strong housing data revived the  springtime for housing  theme from two weeks ago  Despite the competition from election news  these were important stories  If you prepared in advance  you were better able to handle the news 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart from Doug Short  He has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information about the S P 500  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis and several other charts providing long term perspective 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The most important economic and market news was quite good 
The Good 
Q1 GDP was revised higher  up 0 8  instead of 0 5  This is old news  but it does provide a slightly stronger base for the year  More importantly  the current data suggests that Q2 will be much stronger   some estimates now reaching 3   
Jobless claims declined again  to 268K  People are not losing jobs  especially when considering the higher working population  We also need job creation   has the story  and a great chart 

Industrial production jumped 5 8   the most in eighteen months  Utilities were  
The Michigan sentiment index showed a surprising increase of 5 7 points  for the highest reading in nearly a year   provides a complete analysis and Doug Short s chart  You can readily see that the index is back at healthy levels  topped only by the Y2K era 

Housing data showed real strength 
Pending home sales popped 5 1     
New homes sales had the best showing since 2008  Inventory is now down to 4 7 months    


The Bad 
April durable goods fell 0 8   worse than expectations of a 0 3  decline     
Transportation  stunk in April  according to   It has certainly been the worst part of the economic story  Check out the full post for details  Steven Hansen at GEI has a  suggesting that this was a  huge recession which never came   Think about coal 
Puerto Rico debt measure is  after progress in the House  This represents more than the specific issue  It is something of a litmus test for Speaker Ryan s ability to negotiate  That is the real market significance 
The Ugly 
The vulnerability of government technology  The multi year pressure on government spending has had a definite effect on equipment  Upgrades that would be routine in business simply do not happen in government  It is a vicious cycle  The older the equipment and software get  the higher the maintenance costs   has a good analysis of the problem  including this chart 

This problem is deeper than general obsolescence  The determined hackers are looking for vulnerable systems  There is a likely collision course  already seen in prior attacks 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger 
This week s award goes to Narayana Kocherlakota  former President of the Minneapolis Fed  Many of those who have moved on from a roles as official participants in Fed meetings are speaking out  This valuable information gives us an inside look  Sometimes the message is that we are making too many unjustified inferences  Kocherlakota writes 

Timing alone  though  hardly merits so much attention  To understand why  consider two possible scenarios  In one  the Fed starts raising rates in June and then adds another quarter percentage point at every second policy making meeting  once every three months  for the next three years  In the other  the Fed waits until the second half of 2017 and then adds a quarter percentage point at each of the next 12 meetings  The second path represents slightly easier monetary policy  but most economic models would suggest that there would be almost no difference in the effect on employment or inflation 

It is possible that no information will be more important for investors over the next two years or so 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a very big four day week for economic data   Dare I say HUGE   I highlight the most important items  helping us all to focus 
The  A  List 
The employment report  F   Remains the biggest news of all 
ISM index  W   Great read on an important sector  Concurrent with some leading qualities 
Personal Income and spending  T   April data  but a continuing rebound here is important for economic expansion to continue 
Auto sales  W   A strong indicator of economic growth  F150 sales  Many believe this is linked to construction and small business 
Consumer confidence  T   This is the Conference Board version  It provides information on job creation and spending plans that you will not get elsewhere 
ADP private employment  Th   This independent read on private employment growth  using contemporaneous data  deserves more attention 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Fed Beige Book  W   The anecdotal report that will inform participants at the upcoming Fed meeting will not tell us much  but pundits will find something 
PCE prices  T   The Fed s favorite inflation measure  Not much change expected 
Construction spending  T   Volatile April data is still relevant because of the importance of this sector 
ISM services  F   Not quite as important as manufacturing  but only because the data series is shorter  Will recent strength continue 
Trade balance  F   April data relevant for Q2 GDP calculation 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
Not much will be happening at the start of the week  with many slow to return from a long weekend  Expect volume to pick up 
There is also a full slate of Fed speakers  including Chair Yellen 
This Week s Theme 
It is a big economic calendar and a holiday shortened week  There will be a trifecta of questions 
Economics  Will the recent data rebound continue 
The Fed  Will strong data increase the pace and timing of rate increases 
Stocks  How will stocks react  Will good news be good 
The pundits will circle around these topics  Even the pundit in chief seems to be shifting with the winds  They will analyze the data  emphasize how important Friday will be for the Fed  and wind up asking 
What is the risk reward tradeoff for stocks

Best Advice for the Week Ahead 
The right move often depends on your time horizon  Are you a trader or an investor 
Insight for Traders 
We consider both our models and also the best advice from sources we follow 
Felix and Holmes 
We continue our neutral market forecast  Felix is fully invested  and with more aggressive sectors  Most sectors remain in the penalty box  The  usually  more cautious Holmes is once again fully invested  Holmes uses a universe of nearly 1000 stocks  selected mostly by liquidity  Even when the overall market is neutral  there will often be some strong candidates  That is what we see now 
Top Trading Advice 
Dr  Brett Steenbarger   He writes 

The emotionally intelligent trader can prepare for frustration  fear  greed  and other seemingly disruptive states  By anticipating them  rehearsing our response to them  and channeling their energy constructively  we turn our experience into a powerful trading asset 

Holmes is barking enthusiastic agreement  and Felix is nodding wisely 
12 good points from Paul Tudor Jones     They are all worth considering  but my favorite is  9 

 Always think of your entry point as last night s close  

Insight for Investors 
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read  it would be the overall market outlook from David Templeton at HORAN Capital Advisors  He covers many of the themes I regard as most important  but readers will enjoy getting the message from different sources 
In particular  he deals with the common argument about good news  The Fed will raise rates  He writes as follows 

Historically though  the initial moves in rate increases by the Fed is pursued to get rates back to a more normal level  As a result  when interest rates are increased from a level below 5  stocks tend to rise  In short  below the 5  level there is a positive correlation between interest rates and stocks 


Stock Ideas 
 has a terrific follow up to his prior article on Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR   Individual investors who do their own stock picking should read this carefully  Not only does he provide great analysis and advice about entry points  it illustrates what your research should cover 
Time to buy Europe  Jason Zweig    recounts all of the bad news  as well as the depressed stock levels  Is it time to  buy low  
And for income investors   always consider the dividend kings  Here are eighteen companies that have increased dividends for at least 50 years  If that level of income is enough  this kind of stock may be the answer  Philip Van Doorn   
Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his   There are always several great choices worth reading  but my favorite this week is from Ben Carlson for his discussion of Social Security Benefits  Here are but two points from a great post  You should read it all 
Social Security is a more important part of retirement than many realize  covering more than half of the needs for most people 

Waiting longer for benefits generally helps  if you are able to do it 

The article also has some links to good sources  Your financial advisor should be considering the Social Security contribution when figuring out your retirement needs and asset allocation 
Older investors    not starting early enough in saving for retirement 
Value Stocks 
How about AbbVie  NYSE ABBV    Looking at the numbers shows value  but perhaps no immediate catalyst  Where others see  value trap  I see an opportunity for enhancing good dividend yield by selling near term calls  Take what the market is giving you 
Energy Stocks 
There is not a specific recommendation here  but the information is important  I am watching it  and so should you  What companies begin to profit at various levels of oil prices    

Watch out for   
Safety stocks  Seth Masters asks   Many of the relevant sectors have been part of the recent quest for yield  With investors fearful about a weak economy   or even recession   something with a dividend yield looks great  If the economy improves  it is a different story  as this chart shows 

Bonds  In the  man bites dog  department  even   Mr  Dow 5000 is still not recommending stocks 
Final Thoughts 
The risk reward debate includes many viewpoints  but the worries usually dominate 
These stories are more newsworthy  so they get higher ratings   has a good article on  click bait   One of his examples is the repeated story about George Soros buying puts  I have two different posts  here and   showing the error of this approach  but the scary stories get the readership 

The negative predictions call for extreme outcomes  market 50  over valued   various sources  we are already in a recession   Peter Schiff s claim this week  Europe and the rest of the world will crumble  or maybe it will be China  There is just enough plausibility in the arguments that many people are  scared witless   TM OldProf euphemism  If you think the downside is 50  and the upside only 2   what would you do 
The positive arguments are generally modest and restrained    who also accurate downplayed the recession worries in January  sees a 10  upside for stocks in the next year  The Fast Money gang acted like he was crazy   What needs to happen for that   was the question  Not much  he explained  A little earnings growth  no recession  and a little inflation  It was a modest claim 
Politicians of all stripes find it useful to highlight dissatisfaction  This political approach is effective when running for election  but it is dangerous for investors  It is easy to think about societal ills rather than improving your investments  You cannot improve public policy by making poor investment decisions and losing your money  
For a change  why don t we ask what could go right   The  this week is on the right track  repeating some of our main themes   but perhaps not analyzed as thoroughly  It is always helpful to have more voices helping investors  
The economy is not headed for recession  and actually shows promise on the big purchase items like autos and homes 
Employment is good and improving 
Earnings may have troughed with the energy crash  apparently  behind us  Meanwhile  energy prices remain relatively low 
Interest rates remain low   this makes companies more profitable and stocks more attractive 
The dollar strength seems to have leveled off  helping the earnings of multi national companies 
Economic and market cycles do not die of old age  A  mature  cycle has the same survival potential as a new one  despite the appealing metaphor of the doddering old person 
The market could easily gain 10  next year  and the year after that  Picking value stocks could increase your potential  since the economic skepticism has created recession pricing 
Most do not understand this key point  We could be having the same debate two years from now  Or even three  
And stocks could be 50  higher ",2016-05-30,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-what-is-the-risk-reward-for-stocks-200132801,200132801

In my last WTWA I predicted that the slow news and trading environment would lead to a pundit parade  with plenty of forecasts for the new year  This was pretty accurate  including some carry over from our prior week s question about Santa  Things were looking up until the last two days of the year disappointed  You can see this clearly from Doug Short s S P 500   His full post also includes analysis for the full year   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his  for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
There are plenty of important data releases this week  including the most important  At most other times this would stimulate spirited discussion about the economy  At the start of the year there is a very different dynamic  Perhaps because it is simpler to think about  everyone loves the focus on the start of the new year  I expect most observers to be asking  
Will we see a January effect 
I did not say  the  January effect  since the calendar based prognoses have broadened to include the following 
The original January effect saw losers sold near the end of the year to harvest the tax losses  After 30 days  many repurchase  causing a January rebound 
Some investors wait until January to sell winners  delaying the tax effect  Reportedly  Art Cashin  others sell winning names short during the last two days of the trading year  anticipating the tax trade 
Many believe that as goes January  so goes the year 
Some believe that as goes the first trading day  so goes January and the year 
Some will focus on the Presidential election year 
And a few will stick to the data 
As always  I have my own opinion in the conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
Despite the negative result for stocks  there was some good news last week 
Hotel occupancy is the best on record  
 monitored by New Deal Democrat  They are all good  but many might be surprised by this chart 

Consumer confidence from the Conference Board registered 96 5  beating expectations by a few points  Doug Short has the story  including data showing the historical significance of the indicator 

The Bad
Some of the economic data was disappointing 
Initial jobless claims increased to 287K  See  for analysis and a helpful chart 
Rail traffic weakness continues  
The Chicago PMI was only 42 9  missing expectations by seven points and signaling continuing contraction in Midwest manufacturing   from Steven Hansen of GEI  who was definitely working last week  
Pending home sales declined by 0 9   Too little inventory once again gets the blame  Hmm 
The Ugly
My intention was to skip this topic over the holidays  despite the many candidates  Then I saw a famous bear s list of  possible  predictions for 2016  The list was heavy on terrorism ideas and even included a possible injury to Warren Buffett  To me  this went beyond the bounds of good fun  It also serves to keep investors scared witless  TM OldProf Euphemism   The question of how terrorism affects investing is difficult  and not a subject for light hearted speculation   especially when it includes specific ideas of what attacks might be the worst 
Mrs  OldProf advises me that I should not name and link to this source   who is notoriously thin skinned  You can find it easily if you really want  but I am not recommending it  The post just hit me the wrong way  I suppose that others might like it 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to Matt Busigin  who explains that   Here is his lead paragraph  worth keeping in mind on Monday when the ISM data come out 

Through a combination of quackery  charlatanism  and inadequate utilisation of mathematics  callers for US recession in 2016 are embarrassing themselves  Again 


The most prominent reason for recession calling may well be the Institute of Supply Management s Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index  The problem with this recession forecasting methodology is that it doesn t work 

Please also see our review of last year s winners  You will find the summary fun to read  featuring advice which remains timely 
A Well Deserved Remembrance
If we had been doing the Silver Bullet in those days  we certainly would have recognized  Tanta  who wrote anonymously for Calculated Risk before her death in 2008  Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway have a  with Bill McBride

Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  Beginning last week I made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the 10 Year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of Brian Gilmartin  whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am using our  new  Oscar model  I put  new  in quotes because Oscar is in the same tradition as Felix and the product of extensive testing  We have found that the overall market indication is more helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
Oscar improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  since it is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short  Instead  Oscar identifies and limits risk   More to come about Oscar  
I considered continuing to report the Felix updates  but I already have a distinction between long and short term methods  I want to minimize confusion  Those who want this information can subscribe to our weekly Felix updates 
In my continuing effort to provide an effective investor summary of the most important economic data I have added Georg Vrba s Business Cycle Index  which we have frequently cited in this space  In contrast to the ECRI  black box  approach  Georg provides a  and the components

The Week Ahead
This is a big week for economic data  including several of the most important reports  as well as some catching up from the holidays  While I highlight the most important items  you can get an excellent comprehensive listing at Investing com  You can filter for country  type of report  and other factors 
The  A List  includes the following 
Employment report  F   Still viewed as the single most important data point 
ADP private employment  W   A strong alternative to the official report  using a different method 
ISM Index  M   Of special interest given the recent softness in manufacturing and the Chicago PMI 
Auto sales  T   Continuing strength in this important non government read 
Initial claims  Th   Fastest and most accurate update on job losses 
FOMC minutes  W   Even with a unanimous vote and a press conference  we can expect careful scrutiny in the search for added information 
The  B List  includes the following 
ISM services index  W   Less widely followed than manufacturing because it is newer   actually covers more of the economy 
Construction spending  M   November data  but still interesting 
Factory orders  W   Also November data  with weaker results expected 
Trade balance  W   November data with significance for Q4 GDP 
Wholesale inventories  F   Also November data with implications for GDP 
Crude oil inventories  W   Continued focus on oil prices keeps this report in the spotlight 
It will be a light week for speechifying  but there will be some action at the American Economic Association s annual meeting  held in SF this year  Regional Fed President John Williams will be on a panel 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage

Other Advice
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important source  it would be it would be the annual economic summary from Calculated Risk  Most investors find it challenging to link news about the economy to their own portfolios  Chuck Carnevale has provided great evidence that  earnings determine market price   I have repeatedly shown that economic growth is strongly linked to earnings  with recessions the biggest risk  Bill McBride tells you    a very helpful list  A recent  underscores this point  His advice has been widely summarized as investing in what you know  He notes that this is not enough 
What s wrong with the popular wisdom version of his ideology  which is usually cited as  invest in what you know   It leaves out the role of serious fundamental stock research   People buy a stock and they know nothing about it   he says   That s gambling and it s not good

Good investing starts with a long term businesslike mindset  so to really invest badly  it s vital you start rotting your thinking without delay 


Where better to begin than by overdosing on some of the doom and gloom newsletters that have been predicting Financial Armageddon since  well  the start of the last bull market 


They ll have you swapping your carefully chosen funds and shares for baked beans and survival kits in no time 


Ideally find one that offers occasional tips on Russian gold miners  Panamanian oil explorers and the like 


That way you ll get twice the bang for your buck 

Final Thoughts
If we are to believe in a calendar effect  we need to see two things 
Some logical reason behind the action  Deadlines for tax effects qualify  so it is something to think about 
A reason that the effect has not been fully anticipated   already  discounted  by the market  In general  this sort of regular opportunity lasts only until it is widely known 
Count me in with the final group  de emphasizing January and following the data  The calendar data are weak  and  
This illustrates our most persistent theme from last year 
If you want to be a trader  you need to outguess what everyone else is thinking about  We do some of that 
If you are an investor you can rely upon your own assessment  taking what the market is giving you 
Eventually stock prices depend upon earnings which depend upon economic growth  Leading economist  why growth continues  but has been sluggish

174221,395737,EMR,Emerson To Use 3D Printing For Manufacturing Process Valves,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co  s   NYSE EMR   Process Management unit has entered into a Research Collaboration Agreement with Singapore based Nanyang Technological University   NTU    The two entities will pool their resources to manufacture industrial control valves using 3D printing methods 
Emerson and NTU will create a new R D centre which will build high value technology and personnel talent to improve security and spur innovation in the control valve industry  They aim to accelerate the design and manufacture of control valves for process industries in a more economical fashion and with improved mechanical properties 
The collaboration will provide a synergistic research environment and will help accelerate the transition of the research programs into final commercial products  It will also aid in commercializing the 3D printed components in the industrial market 
In fact  Emerson believes that a lot of the technology they are developing will have manufacturing relevance in several other industries as well 
Emerson s Fisher control valve solutions have catered to the power generation  refining  oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical industries for well over a century now  delivering solutions that deal with general service and critical flow control applications  Now  additive manufacturing technologies will enable Emerson to create control valve solutions that can address the most challenging flow control problems 
The joint laboratory  which will be equipped with a range of state of the art additive manufacturing technologies  is scheduled to be set up at Emerson s Singapore facility at Number 1 Pandan Crescent 
Emerson sProcess Management segment has been grappling with contracted demand and adverse macroeconomic factors in recent times  specifically from low order rates stemming from weak global spending in the oil and gas industry  However  opportunities in power sector in most geographical regions  as well as strong chemical markets  suggest improving conditions 
The segment s disappointing order trend has likely bottomed out  and looks set to build momentum on the back of growth conditions in global markets  The company s initiatives in additive manufacturing technology will broaden the company s offerings and enable it to strengthen its foothold in the market 
Emerson currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the broader industrial products sector include ESCO Technologies Inc    NYSE ESE    Franklin Electric Co   Inc    NASDAQ FELE   and Pioneer Power Solutions  Inc    NASDAQ PPSI    each holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2016-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerson-to-use-3d-printing-for-manufacturing-process-valves-200130532,200130532
