stretch the useful life of their autos further  making repairs and living with older models instead of committing a big portion of already stretched budgets to vehicle upgrades In general  when economic conditions improve  new and used vehicle sales increase at about the same rate  Over the past 6 years however  that hasn t been the case  Used car sales have been outpacing new  especially as the price difference between the categories grows In 2013  the average price difference between new and 3 tear old vehicles was 56   That number swelled to 62    or about  14 000   by 2018  That difference helped fuel record used car sales of 40 2 million vehicles last year  That number is expected to top 41 million in 2019 America s Car Mart operates 145 dealerships in 11 states  primarily in smaller cities through the Midwest and Southeast  Their direct competition tends to be independent  mom and pop  used car lots that struggle to match the variety of inventory and range of services made possible by greater scale CRMT is the big fish in the small pond That local presence  high levels of customer service and an increasingly loyal customer base has led to significant increases in top line sales   averaging more than 10  year Selling cars is only part of the picture however  as America s Car Mart specializes in offering customer financing  often offering low down payments and payment plans with bi weekly options In the most recent quarter  the average customer bought a car worth  11 589  made a  700 down payment and financed the balance for 32 months at an annual interest rate of 16 4  In a low interest rate environment in which US Treasury Bonds with 10 years or less to maturity yield lower than 2  year  16 4  is a truly outstanding figure for loans with less than 3 years remaining You might surmise that many customers must have less than perfect credit   and you d be correct   but the high interest rates don t translate into high losses in the finance division  In fact  America s Car Mart has been significantly shrinking charge offs lately  thanks to the rapid new car depreciation figures discussed before The difference is in the value of the collateral for those auto loans The company is selling vehicles that already depreciated significantly over the first few years in service  That translates into a shallower depreciation curve later in the autos  usable life and an increased chance that in the event America s Car Mart will recover most or all of their investment in the event that they are forced to repossess a vehicle for non payment America s Car Mart has been consistently beating analyst estimates over the past several years and the shares have been rallying  yet remain a very reasonable value on a Price to Earnings basis With a 12 month forward P E Ratio  of just 13 5X  CRMT is significantly cheaper than the S P 500  at 18X  and basically in line with the industry Several recent upwards earnings revisions earn the company a Zacks rank  1  Strong Buy  With a competitive advantage in the markets in which it participates and a unique niche in the finance business  America s Car Mart represents one stop shopping for its customers as well as investors in the auto sales industry  Why would anyone want to buy an entire company that was locked in an earnings tailspin That s what investors were left wondering Thursday after it was reported that hedge fund Engaged Capital was looking for financing to take the weight loss multi level marketing company Medifast private  Shares of the Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Medifast rallied more than 8  in a single session  a modest reversal of a steep downward trend that has been in place for over a year Publicly traded MLMs are often volatile investments  Relying on turning customers into the next crop of salespeople can be beneficial during boomtimes as the essentially free labor makes for excellent operating margins When the supply of new recruits dries up and discouraged members quit  revenues can dry up in a hurry  Though in principle MLMs are perfectly legal  they are also exposed to litigation from dissatisfied members who generally play up the  pyramid scheme  angle while seeking damages in a legal forum The volatility of MLM results tends to attract activist investors on both the long and short sides and vast fortunes are won and lost  It s also a reason individual investors should generally tread lightly or stay on the sidelines altogether In the case of Medifast  the big rumor driven rally makes for an excellent opportunity to sell out a long position  but even experienced traders should think very carefully about initiating a short position because the volatility is likely to be very high Medifast bears have seen the share price decline from near  250 in 2018 to below  75 after the most recent quarterly report   which was a major disappointment  Though it has recovered somewhat since then   getting back above  103 after Thursday s rally   Medifast has significantly lagged the broad markets in 2019  In a year when the S P 500 is up nearly 30   Medifast is still down more than 18  Since the last report in which Medifast missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenues and net earnings  analyst forecasts have been falling like a rock  Expectations for the next two quarters and the next two full years are all significantly lower than 60 days ago Of course  there s some chance that Engaged is successful in obtaining financing and takes Medifast private at a premium to the current stock price  though in a way  that possibility puts a lid on appreciation potential  The fund has never taken control of an entire company before If Engaged is not successful  it would seem that Thursday s big gains are in immediate jeopardy and it wouldn t be surprising to see the shares test the November lows If you re holding shares of Medifast  now would be a good time to consider taking the recent profits and running for the exit while recent events get sorted out Additional content Buy Microsoft  MSFT  for 2020  The  Whys  and  Why Nots Microsoft shares have surged over 50  in 2019 on the back of its continued cloud computing expansion and stable growth from its legacy businesses  MSFT stock sits right near its highs and Microsoft remains one of only two public companies in the U S  with a  1 trillion market cap alongside Apple With this in mind  should investors consider buying Microsoft stock for 2020 MSFT s Pitch Microsoft is Amazon s largest competitor in the cloud space  Last quarter  Q1 fiscal 2020   its Intelligent Cloud revenue surged 27   driven by 59  expansion in the key Azure division  This cloud growth easily topped the fourth quarter s 19  jump and fiscal 2019 s 21  cloud growth Cloud computing helps drive MSFT stock and remains a focus for Wall Street  But the Redmond  Washington based firm s other businesses  from Office and Windows to gaming and devices have evolved and expanded  Microsoft has also diversified through a ton of acquisitions  which includes big purchases such as LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   Looking ahead  Microsoft plans to expand its reach in everything from artificial intelligence to IoT Microsoft has also remained mostly out of the recent government spotlight that others have found themselves in clearly MSFT already had its big day in antitrust court years ago On a macroeconomic level  the historic bull market could keep on rolling in 2020  as U S  unemployment rests at 50 year lows  The Fed is also poised to keep interest rates low and the U S  economy is expected to expand around 2 2  in 2020  also read    Other Fundamentals Along with the economic picture appearing strong  which would likely benefit MSFT as its business reaches enterprises and consumers  its other fundamentals remain solid  Investors can see that Microsoft stock surged over the last two years to easily outpace Amazon  MSFT closed regular trading Wednesday just off its 52 week high at  154 37 a share MSFT currently trades at 27 3X forward 12 month Zacks earnings estimates  This represents a discount compared to its industry s 29 2X average and its own two year high of 29 9X  Its price to sales ratio is more stretched  But Microsoft returns value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends  of which it consistently raises The firm lifted its quarterly dividend by 11  for fiscal 2020 and its board announced in September that it approved a new share repurchase program of up  40 billion  MSFT s annualized dividend currently yields 1 32   which rests below the 10 year U S  Treasury Note s 1 92  but comes in above Apple s 1 10  On top of that  Microsoft has paid down its current debt load over the last several years  Plus  the firm has started to reduce its longer term debt  which climbed somewhat heavily after its  26 2 billion LinkedIn purchase in 2016  MSFT s debt to equity ratio came in at 0 69 at the end of last quarter  down from 0 71   which comes in below Apple s 1 01 Bottom LineOur current Zacks estimates call for Microsoft s fiscal 2020 revenue to pop 11 3   with fiscal 2021 expected to jump another 11  higher to  155 51 billion  These estimates come in below the firm s 14  growth in both 2019 and 2018 but look strong compared to 2017 s 6  climb and mark impressive top line expansion for a company of its size and age Perhaps more importantly  the company s cloud computing revenues are projected to surge another 21  in 2020 to match last year s growth At the bottom end of the income statement  MSFT s adjusted full year earnings are expected to climb 12 6  this year and another 12 3  in 2021  On top of that  Microsoft s longer term earnings revision activity has trended completely upward since its last quarterly report   Overall  Microsoft is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment and is part of an industry that rests in the top 20  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  Therefore  MSFT stock appears to be worth buying for 2020 even near its highs Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3 2019  while the S P

2537,224052,CRMT,Is America s Car Mart  CRMT  Stock A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put America s Car Mart  Inc    NASDAQ CRMT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  America s Car Mart has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 96  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 23  If we focus on the long term PE trend  America s Car Mart s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 86  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that America s Car Mart has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 59  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for America s Car Mart stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  America s Car Mart has a P S ratio of about 1 08  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 50 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years CRMT is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  America s Car Mart currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes America s Car Mart a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though America s Car Mart might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives CRMT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current fiscal quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen three upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 1  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below America s Car Mart  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerica s Car Mart is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a strong industry rank  among the top 1   and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you

2538,224053,CRMT,Tesla Feels The Heat As Walmart Sues,opinion,"Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   investors are screwed 
It isn t as if the company s core electric car business is without issue  But in 2016  it went and bailed out the debt laden SolarCity  which was owned by Elon Musk s cousins and in which he himself was an early investor  The result  Tesla s own balance sheet got hugely levered 
And there was a reason why SolarCity was going downhill  as Walmart s   NYSE WMT   lawsuit has brought to light  Not only was the company incompetent  but it was also grossly negligent in the carrying out of its obligations under the contract 
Tesla s market share further dwindled following the acquisition and it s now a distant third with 29 MW of new installations since the acquisition  Market leaders SunRun and Vivint Solar installed 103 MW and 56 MW  respectively 
In Walmart s case  it resulted in seven rooftop fires  the first few of which the company dismissed as stray incidents  But in 2018  there were three fires  the first in Beavercreek  Ohio  March 2018   followed by two in Denton  Maryland and Indio  California 
The fires didn t result in loss of human life  but millions of dollars  worth merchandise was lost  according to the company  That s when Walmart asked Tesla to deactivate the panels on all 240 Walmart roofs  This is a costly affair for Tesla and outside the contract requirements  but given the risk  especially considering the number of people routinely frequenting the stores  it may not have been unreasonable 
Unfortunately  even after Tesla complied  there was another fire in a Yuba City  California store in November 2018 
Specific Complaints
The lawsuit claims among other things that the solar panels were defective in terms of design  were improperly installed  and safety measures for their maintenance and operation were below industry standards 
Moreover  Tesla s own inspections had revealed 157 items requiring attention with 48 serious enough to render the sites unsafe  Walmart s subsequent inspections exposed even more problems 
It also said that Tesla failed to identify defects  such as the hotspots appearing on many panels  which crack the back sheets and damage the electrical insulation  Moreover  Tesla was pasting red tape over the spots where it identified the problem  which blocked sunlight in those areas and created even more hotspots 
The failure to tighten field made connectors facilitated moisture and water intrusion 
The maze of wires was often under pressure from sharp objects like concrete or metal edges  or were in expansion or contraction mode depending on the weather 
The inspection staff was found to be deficient in knowledge and training and was inadequately equipped to do the job 
The lawsuit was filed after Tesla s inadequate responses to Walmart s concerns  Walmart is claiming millions of dollars in damages and the right to uninstall the panels in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York state court 
So it s no wonder the Zacks Rank  4  Sell rated  company s shares are swooning  For safer growth stocks  consider America s Car Mart   NASDAQ CRMT    Consolidated Communications Holdings   NASDAQ CNSL    Ferrellgas Partners   NYSE FGP    or Intrepid Potash   NYSE IPI    since all of them have a Zacks Rank  1 rating and VGM score A  Or head over to the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

2539,224054,CRMT,4 Top Stocks To Buy For Stellar Earnings Growth,opinion,Irrespective of whether it is a start up or an established company  earnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization  This is because if the company doesn t make money  it won t stand the test of time  Consider a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you have earnings This metric is also considered the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price  But  expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinion on factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates The Winning Strategy In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we have added the

2541,224056,CRMT,5 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio To Scoop Up,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest coverage ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening Skechers U S A   Inc    NYSE SKX    which designs  develops  markets  and distributes footwear  has a VGM Score of A  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 15  for 3 5 years  You can see  America s Car Mart  Inc    NASDAQ CRMT    an automotive retailer  has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 19 6  for 3 5 years  The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank  1 The Ensign Group  Inc    NASDAQ ENSG    which provides health care services  has a VGM Score of A  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 15  for 3 5 years Rush Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ RUSHA    which operates as an integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services  has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS

2543,224058,CRMT,American Shoppers Splurge  Keep Economy From Tanking,opinion,Among the U S  economy s two major pillars  consumers stood resilient throughout the summer season despite fragile global

article are Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU    Insperity  Inc    NYSE NSP    America s Car Mart  Inc    NASDAQ CRMT    The Est e Lauder Companies Inc    NYSE EL   and Tiffany   Co    NYSE TIF   Add These 5 Stocks with Remarkable Interest Coverage RatiosYou can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks

week s article are Air Transport Services Group  Inc    NASDAQ ATSG    Digi International Inc    NASDAQ DGII    America s Car Mart  Inc    NASDAQ CRMT   and Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ   Explore These 4 Momentum Stocks Using Driehaus StrategyInvestors who have the propensity to take higher risk can think of investing in momentum stocks to boost their gains  In this respect  the Driehaus strategy can be used to choose the best momentum stocks using the  buy high and sell higher  theory  Eventually  Richard Herman Driehaus earned his place in Barron s All Century Team following the success of this investment strategy The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer higher than market returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed based on the Driehaus strategy  has returned more than 300  since the end of the last bear market compared with 85 5  gains registered by the S P 500 A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit

Acacia Communications  NASDAQ ACIA  jumped 2 57  or 4 64   to 57 92  on 1 8 million shares  This stock had a big downtrend from April May 2017 until April 2018  it reversed and has been in a beautiful uptrend ever since  Although there has been periods of consolidations  pullbacks  and retesting  it finally broke out in February  It s accelerating in a rising kind of channel  I think it s going to extend to 65 70  eventually 
ChemoCentryx  NASDAQ CCXI  bounced 34 cents  or 2 62   to 13 31  on 635 415 shares traded on Thursday  I put a swing on it because I think it s forthtelling of a much bigger move  After a long  one year consolidation may be getting ready to ramp up  My targets are 15  17  and eventually mid 20 s 
Americas Car Mart  NASDAQ CRMT  had a big pop of 7 38  or 8 7   to 92 18 with a high of 93 23  on 132 446 shares traded on Thursday  and exploded out of a wedge pattern  This was thinly traded on Thursday  but it looks like it s headed up toward the 115 range 
Jounce Therapeutics  NASDAQ JNCE  a swing trade of ours  has been in a beautiful flag over the last two weeks after the breakout of the inverse head and shoulders  It popped 31 cents  or 5 3   to 6 16  on 163 625 shares traded on Thursday  I think Thursday s reversal was engulfing  so this might be a signal that it s about to take off  Look for a test of 7  and then 8 3 4 9 
SurveyMonkey  NASDAQ SVMK   a software company  based  popped  coiled  broke out four days in a row and is ramping  On Thursday  it was up 80 cents  or 4 71   to 17 80  on 2 million shares  My target of 18 may be hit as early as Friday morning  Then I m looking for 20  or better  and beyond 
Telaria  NYSE TLRA   after popping and pulling back  did very well  and now it looks like it s consolidating  It was up 35 cents  or 5 99   to 6 19  on 763 651 shares traded and appears to be headed to 71 2  That s the next target

2574,224089,CRMT,Car Mart  L Brands  Alibaba And Amazon Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   April 9  2019    Car Mart  Inc    NASDAQ CRMT   as the Bull of the Day  L Brands   NYSE LB   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alibaba   NYSE BABA   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   
Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 
 
Shares of America s Car Mart  Inc  have skyrocketed 83  over the last 12 months to crush the S P 500 s 10  climb and 2019 has seen the stock hit multiple new 52 week highs  The company operates 144 automotive dealerships in the U S  and is expected to see strong top and bottom line expansion in fiscal 2019 and 2020 
Overview   Growth 
America s Car Mart is a used vehicle dealer that specializes in what it calls  Buy Here Pay Here  and is an attractive place for people with less than stellar credit to purchase a car  As we touched on already  America s Car Mart operates 144 automotive dealerships across 11 states  The firm operates mostly in small cities in the South Central U S   including Alabama  Georgia  Indiana  Iowa  Mississippi  and Texas 
CRMT allows its customers to purchase  finance  and make payments all in one place  The business might not be attractive to some people as there can be a stigma surrounding the used car industry in general  But people who might not qualify for traditional loans because of bad credit or no credit need a place to buy a vehicle  especially in spread out areas with few public transportation options 
Investors should note that the company s 72 hour 100  satisfaction return policy has helped it stand out in the industry  The company also offers low down payments  flexible payment and financing offerings  as well as a wide range of trade in options  America s Car Mart has seen its revenues climb by a roughly 11  CAGR  compound annual growth rate  from 2002 through fiscal 2018  CRMT has also grown its active customers base by 7 5  during this same period as it continues to stand out in terms of service and quality compared to smaller  mom and pop used car dealerships in many of its markets 
 
L Brands  Bath   Body Works has performed well recently  but its Victoria s Secret brands have dragged the company down  Shares of LB have fallen 28  in the last 12 months as part of a much larger three year decline as shopping habits and consumer sentiment evolve 
Overview   Problems
As we mentioned at the top  L Brands owns Victoria s Secret  Victoria s Secret PINK  and Bath   Body Works  The company s operations include nearly 3 000 company owned stores throughout the U S   Canada  the U K   China  and more  L Brands also operates roughly 650 franchised locations and  like every other retailer  has tried to expand its e commerce business 
Overall  L Brands  revenue has continued to climb in the midst of the rough stretch  But the disappointment at Victoria s Secret has led to increased worries that include CEO turnover and calls to break up the business  The lingerie unit s former CEO Jan Singer resigned last fall after just two years with the company  Since then  New York based hedge fund Barington Capital Group LP has urged the company to split its growing Bath   Body Works business from the faltering Victoria s Secret 
The former president of luxury label Tory Burch  John Mehas  did take over as chief executive at Victoria s Secret shortly after Singer stepped down on the back of continued comparable sales declines  Nonetheless  Barington thinks the company needs to expand beyond its current focus on racy push up bras   Victoria s Secret s brand image is starting to appear to many as being outdated and even a bit  tone deaf  by failing to be aligned with women s evolving attitudes towards beauty  diversity and inclusion    in a March 2019 letter 
Outlook   Earnings Trends
LB shares are up 7  in 2019  which still falls well below the S P 500 s 15  climb and its industry s 9  growth  Despite the recent positivity  L Brands stock has tumbled 28  during the last year and 65  over the past three years  And the chart helps investors see just how quickly things turned negative for the once high flying retailer 
Looking ahead  the company s Q1 fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to dip 2 6  to touch  2 56 billion  On top of that  LB s second quarter sales are expected to dip 1 8   with full year 2019 revenues projected to slip 0 70   Peeking a bit further ahead  L Brands  fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to climb 1 2  above our current year estimate 
At the bottom end of the income statement  the company s adjusted first quarter earnings are projected to tumble 100  from  0 17 per share in the year ago period to break even earnings  or  0 00 per share  For the full year 2019  L Brands  adjusted EPS figure is expected to sink 16 3   On top of that  the company s 2020 earnings are projected to come in far below 2018  And L Brands  earnings estimate revisions have turned far more negative recently  especially for 2019

Alibaba vs  Amazon  Who Will Take Over the World First 
Alibaba initially made a name for itself in the US as the go to place to buy cheap knock offs of NBA jerseys and designer shoes  Alibaba is now the principal e commerce retailer in China on a scale with Amazon  dominating 58  of the total e commerce market in China  according to eMarketer  With a total addressable market  TAM  coming close  5 trillion  which makes up China s overall retail industry  BABA captured 636 million annual customers in 2018  up a whole 23  from the previous year  This company is growing at an exponential rate and is striving to continue until their TAM is reached 
Alibaba vs  Amazon
Alibaba is often considered the Amazon of China  they both control the e commerce space in their geographic regions and are both quickly becoming the largest corporations in the world  Despite their seemingly identical product service proposition  these companies have very different approaches 
The biggest difference is the way in which they sell their online products 
Amazon sells most of its products to customers directly through its extensive warehouse network where the goods are housed  Alibaba  on the other hand  acts like a middleman between merchants and consumers  Amazon makes most of its money from product margins while Alibaba s collects revenue through something called a merchant fee which places sellers  products higher up on Alibaba s search lists 
Financial Comparison 
Amazon posted 2018 revenue of  232 billion  more than 4 times the  53 billion in revenue that BABA achieved in 2018  The fascinating part is that AMZN and BABA had bottom lines that were less than  1 billion apart   10 1 billion and  9 2 billion respectively  Giving Amazon a 4 3  net margin and Alibaba a 17  net margin  This enormous margin difference for comparable businesses would be a red flag under most circumstances but what you need to consider are the costs associated with of the different business models as well as the geographical location that these companies operate  Alibaba operated a business with much less overhead than Amazon considering that their main functions is just connect buyers and sellers  they don t need the extensive warehouse network along with the storage costs of carrying as much inventory as Amazon does  The cost of operating a business in China is much less than operating one in the US considering that the cost of living is substantially lower  Amazon also makes it their priority to provide the consumer with the lowest prices so a lot of their economies to scale are being passed along to the consumer  These factors aside  seeing Alibaba s margins being 4x that of Amazon is quite an attractive figure especially considering it s trading at much cheaper multiples 
Alibaba has seen 44  annualized top line growth over the past 5 years while Amazon only saw 27  annualized growth over the same period  86  of Alibaba s revenue is being driven by its core e commerce business with other revenue streams like cloud computing and subscription entertainment services are growing  e commerce is still what this firm primarily relies on  Amazon s revenue streams are a little more diversified  only 71  of revenue is from online sales  brick and mortar operations making up a growing 7  of sales  driven by their Whole Foods acquisition   web services  AWS  make up 11  of their income and the fasted growing segment is AMZN s advertising revenues  The diversification of Amazon s revenue drivers makes it a safer bet than a less diverse Alibaba  though BABA is growing its noncore businesses at an expanding rate  Below is a 2 year return chart comparing BABA  blue  and AMZN  red  performance 
Valuations
Amazon s continuing success story in the United States has been an inspiration for small businesses across the world  From Jeff Bezo s garage to being in the top 5 biggest tech companies in the world  People love the company and the stock  and this is likely part of the reason AMZN is trading at 68x forward earnings  This P E might have been a reasonable valuation if the company had just turned a profit but they have been profitable for 5 years  It s P E growth  PEG  ratio is 1 95 which is a much more reasonable valuation considering the industry average is 1 79  The growth priced in to Amazon is colossal  with EPS growth expected to be 32 37  and 49 52  for 2019 and 2020 respectively  There is too much uncertainty with these priced in growth numbers for my liking  At this moment I wouldn t be comfortable jumping into a tech company with a 1 63 beta and a 68x P E in such uncertain economic conditions  I would wait for a dip before putting on a position  Watch for earnings on the 25th of this month for more clues into the future of this firm  If they can continue to grow margins I would feel more comfortable going long in AMZN   1 600 has been my price point to consider buying since the end of last year and I stick by that  AMZN   Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Alibaba is trading at much more competitive multiples  with a price of 36x forward earnings and a P E to growth  PEG  ratio of 1 29  This firm doesn t have nearly as much EPS growth priced into the stock because of economic instability brought by both the trade war and poor economic numbers coming out of China 
The beta for this stock exceeds 2  which is a small red flag when economic stability is questionable  but I see a larger upside to BABA especially considering the unprecedented 332  top line growth in the last 5 years  I also understand their growing revenue diversity as a huge opportunity for this business to take market share in different categories that they don t already dominate  I would look to buy this stock sub  170 with a price target north of  200  BABA   Zacks Rank  3  Hold

2575,224090,CRMT,5 Top Ranked Stocks To Survive The Retail Apocalypse ,opinion,There seems to be no end in sight to the retail apocalypse  Industry watchers had thought that the phenomenon had peaked last year  with stores closing left  right and center  But several more stores are likely to down shutters over the next few years  giving in to the uninterrupted march of online retailers A new report from investment firm UBS   NYSE UBS   reveals that by 2026  nearly 75 000 stores will shut down  At that point  online sales are expected to account for 25  of all retail sales  per UBS  Currently  they make up around 16  of total sales So does the rise of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and its ilk spell the end for the traditional brick and mortar retailers  Several major brands may be feeling the pinch  but many others are coping with innovation and a wider online presence  This is why it makes sense to pick up select retail stocks which are poised to flourish even in the middle of a retail apocalypse Online Shift Spells Doom for Brick and MortarSeveral retailers have already announced that they will shutter thousands of stores this year in order to keep pace with changing buyer behavior  For instance  Payless ShoeSource is shutting all of its 2 100 stores in the United States while Gymboree is closing 800 stores Additionally  Sears is shuttering 80 locations after closing nearly 1 300 Sears and Kmart stores since 2013  The likes of Gap   NYSE GPS   have also stated that several stores are likely to close in the near future And the primarily reason for these closures is the increasing shift to online shopping  The average U S  household s online spend clocking in at  5 200 last year  This is a near 50  jump compared with the figure recorded five years earlier Store Closures Likely to ContinueAt least 15 000 stores had closed since 2017  per data from UBS  The major sufferers of this trend include Radio Shack  Toys R Us and Mattress Firm and GNC  which have shuttered 1 470  735 and 700 stores  respectively Happily enough  in store sales rose in 2018  primarily fueled by tax cuts  But UBS thinks those gains will probably be reversed in 2019  With the pace of store productivity improvement likely to fall  store closures may accelerate in the current year  according to UBS analysts Flexibility  Innovation Key to SurvivalDespite the spate of store closures  some online companies like Casper and Wayfair are opting to open at physical locations  However  these stores will likely function more as showrooms rather than stores with significant inventories And this is likely to be the trend for most retailers  Streamlined stores  with lower inventory levels  seem to be the new watchword for the industry  In case buyers want more variety  they ll have to shop online The likes of Target   NYSE TGT   and Ikea are reducing stores sizes in order to attract urban shoppers for whom time is at a premium  Early in April  Sears said it will launch a few Sears Home and Life stores  which are only 10  the size of their traditional retail formats  Our ChoicesSmaller store size and lower inventory levels are just some of the strategies being adopted by embattled brick and mortar retailers  Some are choosing to reposition themselves in buyers  minds  others are changing store formats to appeal to new shoppers And many traditional retailers are looking for a sweet spot between online and offline models  choosing even to tie up with behemoths like Amazon  This is why it makes sense to invest in retail stocks that have what it takes to survive a trying time for the industry  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and VGM Score of A  You can see  Boot Barn Holdings  Inc    NYSE BOOT   has tremendous focus on innovation which enhances its competitive moat in a hostile business environment  Its endless aisle concept  which allows customers to select boots more easily through in store touchscreens  is one example of its endeavors Bucking the trend of store closings  Boot Barn actually opened two new stores in the last quarter  taking its store

2579,224094,CRMT,Add These 5 Stocks With Remarkable Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest coverage ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU    which provides financial management and compliance products and services  has a VGM Score of B  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 16 2  for 3 5 years  You can see  Insperity  Inc    NYSE NSP    which provides human resources and business solutions  has a VGM Score of A  This Zacks Rank  2 company

2587,224102,CRMT,Where To Find Classic Value Stocks In 2019,opinion," 1 00    Hard To Find Value Stocks 5 30    Tracey s Top Stock Picks 14 15    Episode Roundup  CMRT  GM  JBLU  PVH  JILL Welcome to Episode  132 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
It s over 2 months into the new year but trends are already developing 
Stocks have staged a big rally off their December 2018 lows  and while growth stocks mostly led the rally  the value stocks have followed along and are now no longer cheap 
Even Warren Buffett admits there aren t many deals to be had right now 
Investors might be able to find a company with a cheap PEG or PE  but it s harder than ever to find one with both 
Screening for Classic Value
A classic value stock is one that has all four of the value fundamentals  a low Price to sales ratio  a low price to book ratio  a low PEG and a low forward P E 
The initial screen looked for a P S ratio under 1 0  a P B ratio under 3  a PEG under 1 and a P E under 15 
There was no Zacks Rank included initially 
That screen returned 144 stocks 
But  of course  you want to add the Zacks Rank so that you get rising earnings estimates 
With a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  added  the screen returned 24 stocks 
Here are 5 classic value stocks with great Zacks Ranks to include on your short list 
5 Classic Value Stocks for the 2019 Market
1        America s Car Mart   NASDAQ CRMT   is a small cap auto retailer which posted strong fiscal third quarter results  Earnings are expected to rise 73  for fiscal 2019  It is both cheap and has growth as it has a PEG ratio of just 0 7 
2        General Motors   NYSE GM   is still expected to see falling earnings into 2020 but it s dirt cheap with a forward P E of just 6  Investors also get a nice dividend  currently yielding 3 9   for their patience 
3        JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   is a mid cap with strong earnings growth  This US airlines is expected to grow earnings by 32  in 2019 and 17 7  in 2020  It has a forward P E of just 8 
4        PVH   NYSE PVH   hasn t reported earnings yet  This global retailer  which owns the brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein remains cheap even though it s expected to grow earnings in fiscal 2019 by 19 7   It has a P S ratio of just 0 9 
5        J  Jill   NYSE JILL   is a woman s specialty retailer of apparel and accessories  It just reported fourth quarter results and saw cleaner and leaner inventories  Gross margins also rose to 63 1  from 62 2   Wall Street is doubtful  however  as it trades with a forward P E of just 7 8 
Why are these stocks so cheap   
Remember  stocks become values because Wall Street is running away or ignoring them for some reason  Investors should drill down into the story 
What else should value investors be looking for with classic value stocks in 2019

2590,224105,CRMT,5 Stocks With Relative Price Strength To Bet On Right Now,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0Relative   Price change   1 week greater than 0 We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S P 500 over the last 12 weeks  four weeks and one week    Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0 Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the

can get through  You can see  Current Price greater than or equal to  5 and Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000 A minimum price of  5 is a good standard to screen low priced stocks  while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity  less than or equal to B Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Here are the five stocks that made it through the screen Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF    Abercrombie   Fitch  headquartered in New Albany  OH  is a specialty retailer of

2592,224107,CRMT,Is US Economy Headed For Recession  5 Low Beta Picks ,opinion,On Mar 22  Wall Street routed on yield curve inversion between the 3 month US Treasury Note and 10 year US Treasury Note  The yield inversion was primarily owing to apprehensions of a global economic slowdown  which will certainly affect the U S  economy  especially exports Although a recession is not in sight for now  volatility in the stock market will persist in the near term  Notably  US   China trade related problem is yet to be resolved and first quarter 2019 earnings expectations are negative at present   Yield Curve Inversion  Signaling RecessionOn Mar 20  the Fed decided not to hike interest rate in 2019  It also decided to end its balance sheet reduction program in September  The central bank adopted this overtly cautious approach after lowering U S  GDP growth rate to 2 1  in 2019 from 2 3  projected in December Following extra dovish stance of the Fed  yield on benchmark 10 year US Treasury Note declined to 2 437   its lowest since January 2018  Yield on 5 year US Treasury Note and 2 year US Treasury Note declined to 2 42 and 2 32   respectively  However  yield on short term 3 month U S  Treasury Note stood at 2 459  The yields declined as investors transfer their money from risky assets like equities to safe haven government bonds  The yield curve  which measures interest at any given point of time for bonds of same quality but different maturity dates  of government bonds are generally upward sloping  implying a higher rate of interest is needed for individuals to hold longer maturity bonds On Mar 22  yield on 3 month US Treasury Note surged ahead of 2 year  5 year ad 10 year US Treasury Notes  Yield curve inversion is generally characterized as market s diminishing expectations about future economic growth  In fact  several financial experts consider inversion between the 3 month and 10 year bond yields as a clear indication of an upcoming recession  This happens for the first time since 2007 Concerns About Global Economic GrowthAlthough the Fed is relatively bullish on the fundamentals of the U S  economy  the central bank is concerned about economic downturn in China and Eurozone   two of the largest trading blocks of the United States  This might cool down the country s economic fortunes   On Mar 22  IHS Markit reported that manufacturing PMI of Germany fell to 51 9 in March  its 69 month low  The manufacturing PMI of France also contracted in March to 48 7  The composite manufacturing PMI for the Eurozone fell to 51 3 in March from 51 9 in February   On Mar 4  the Chinese authority pegged the country s growth rate in the range of 6   6 5  in 2019  Notably  China s growth rate in 2018 was 6 6   its lowest growth rate since 1990 Trade Problems Unresolved  Bleak Earnings Expectations  The year long tariff related issues between the United States and China is yet to be completely resolved  The IMF cautioned that prolonged trade conflict between the United States and China could result in global economic slowdown in 2019 First quarter 2019 consolidated earnings is expected to decline  At present  total earnings for the broad market S P 500 index are expected to be down by 3 3  from the same period last year on 5  higher revenues  If actual first quarter earnings growth turns out to be negative  it will be the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016   Read More  Soft Start to Q1 Earnings Season Our Top PicksAt this juncture  it will be prudent to invest in in low beta stocks with favorable Zacks Rank to keep one s portfolio safe from day to day market fluctuations  The beta is equal to 1 which means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more

2642,224157,CRMT,Is America s Car Mart  CRMT  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put America s Car Mart  Inc    NASDAQ CRMT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  America s Car Mart has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 86  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 32  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts America s Car Mart s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Nofood Retail  Wholesale industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 32 51  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that America s Car Mart has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 85  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for America s Car Mart stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  America s Car Mart has a P S ratio of about 0 51  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CRMT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  America s Car Mart currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes America s Car Mart a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though America s Car Mart might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives CRMT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has also seen one upward and no downward movement in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 4  in the past two months and the full year estimate has inched up by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineAmerica s Car Mart is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 35  out of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2017-06-11,Zacks Investment

2645,224160,CRMT,5 Top Stocks To Buy As Americans Go On A Spending Spree,opinion,Americans have started to splurge on discretionary items after a ho hum winter season  This is well reflected in the pickup in retailers  March sales  putting an end to three straight months of a decline  Consumer outlays rose on the back of a strong jobs market  rise in income  tax cuts and refunds  Consumer optimism  by the way  continues to remain at a high level This calls for investing in consumer discretionary companies that are poised to grow on the signs of renewed consumer spending strength Sales at Retailers PopAccording to the Commerce Department  U S  retail sales rose a solid 0 6  in March for the first time in four months  The so called core retail sales that exclude food services  auto dealers  building materials stores and gasoline stations  also climbed 0 4  Sales rose at eight of 13 major retail categories  Auto dealers notched their best month since last November  up 2   A recent report has shown pickup in purchases of cars and light trucks to a 17 4 million annualized rate in March  the fastest this year  read more    Sales at health and personal care stores went up 1 4   the highest in two years  Internet retailers  food services and drinking places  and stores that sell home furnishing goods were some of the other big gainers  A rise in sales at U S  clothing retailers also contributed significantly Eastern holiday in the last weekend of March drove more traffic in stores  Thus  consumers ended a shopping hiatus and spent more money after lying low for a few months due to harsh winter weather conditions What Does the Retail Sales Uptick Indicate Such a pickup underlined the improved financial conditions of American households and also the resilience of the U S  economic expansion that will turn nine years old at the end of June This increase in spending may not necessarily save the U S  economy from a downshift in the first quarter  but  definitely indicates that the recent drop in consumer outlays is about to end Chief economist of Amherst Pierpont Securities  Stephen Stanley also added that  the somewhat improved performance in March was too late to help the first quarter  but it does set the stage for a marked pickup in real consumer spending in the second quarter  What Boosted Consumer Spending Steady job gains and rise in income levels fueled consumer spending  The United States added an average of 202 000 jobs a month in the first quarter  higher than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016  The unemployment rate remained at a 17 year low of 4 1  in March  while workers  hourly wages rose 8 cents  or 0 3   to  26 82 in the month The recent tax cut has also put a lot of money in consumer s pocket  After tax wages increased 7 5  year over year in March  up from 5 2  in February  per data accumulated from Bank of America Corporation s   NYSE BAC   credit cards  debit cards and customer accounts The tax bill trimmed the ultra rich individual tax bracket from 39 6  to 37   while the middle class has also been spared from paying hefty taxes  Also  income tax refunds are giving consumers extra cash to spend and their sentiments continue to remain relatively high 5 Solid PicksCourtesy of a rise in household spending  consumer discretionary companies are poised to benefit the most as outlays plays a major role in determining their revenues  We have  thus  selected five consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  America s Car Mart  Inc

decline  Consumer outlays rose on the back of a strong jobs market  rise in income  tax cuts and refunds  Consumer optimism  by the way  continues to remain at a high level This calls for investing in consumer discretionary companies that are poised to grow on the signs of renewed consumer spending strength Sales at Retailers PopAccording to the Commerce Department  U S  retail sales rose a solid 0 6  in March for the first time in four months  The so called core retail sales that exclude food services  auto dealers  building materials stores and gasoline stations  also climbed 0 4  Sales rose at eight of 13 major retail categories  Auto dealers notched their best month since last November  up 2   A recent report has shown pickup in purchases of cars and light trucks to a 17 4 million annualized rate in March  the fastest this year  read more    Sales at health and personal care stores went up 1 4   the highest in two years  Internet retailers  food services and drinking places  and stores that sell home furnishing goods were some of the other big gainers  A rise in sales at U S  clothing retailers also contributed significantly Eastern holiday in the last weekend of March drove more traffic in stores  Thus  consumers ended a shopping hiatus and spent more money after lying low for a few months due to harsh winter weather conditions What Does the Retail Sales Uptick Indicate Such a pickup underlined the improved financial conditions of American households and also the resilience of the U S  economic expansion that will turn nine years old at the end of June This increase in spending may not necessarily save the U S  economy from a downshift in the first quarter  but  definitely indicates that the recent drop in consumer outlays is about to end Chief economist of Amherst Pierpont Securities  Stephen Stanley also added that  the somewhat improved performance in March was too late to help the first quarter  but it does set the stage for a marked pickup in real consumer spending in the second quarter  What Boosted Consumer Spending Steady job gains and rise in income levels fueled consumer spending  The United States added an average of 202 000 jobs a month in the first quarter  higher than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016  The unemployment rate remained at a 17 year low of 4 1  in March  while workers  hourly wages rose 8 cents  or 0 3   to  26 82 in the month The recent tax cut has also put a lot of money in consumer s pocket  After tax wages increased 7 5  year over year in March  up from 5 2  in February  per data accumulated from Bank of America s cards  debit cards and customer accounts The tax bill trimmed the ultra rich individual tax bracket from 39 6  to 37   while the middle class has also been spared from paying hefty taxes  Also  income tax refunds are giving consumers extra cash to spend and their sentiments continue to remain relatively high 5 Solid PicksCourtesy of a rise in household spending  consumer discretionary companies are poised to benefit the most as outlays plays a major role in determining their revenues  We have  thus  selected five consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a

2689,224204,CRMT,Earnings Digest  2 20 15,opinion,"Each week I read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of my investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts 
The Macro Outlook 
From the FOMC minutes  it sounds like the Fed is right in line with the market consensus
Economic growth has remained solid
 meeting participants regarded the information received over the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity had been expanding at a solid pace  
Oil prices should boost consumer spending
 Recent declines in oil prices  which had boosted household purchasing power  were among the factors likely to underpin consumer spending in coming months 
The foreign economic situation could pose a risk  but accommodative actions probably helped
 Accommodative policy actions announced by a number of foreign central banks had likely strengthened the outlook abroad  
Even the Fed seems perplexed as to why longer term interest rates are falling
 Participants also discussed the substantial decline in nominal longer term interest rates The fall had occurred despite the strengthening U S  economic outlook and market expectations that policy normalization could begin later this year  Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U S  Treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums 
Lower rates could be a function of deflation expectations
 a few participants argued that policymakers might still want to take that decline into account because it could reflect increased concern on the part of investors about adverse outcomes in which low inflation was accompanied by weak economic activity  
But in general  the FOMC believes that inflation is still on track
 Participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward the Committee s 2 percent objective as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipated 
A rising dollar could be a headwind to exports
 However  the increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was expected to be a persistent source of restraint on U S  net exports  and a few participants pointed to the risk that the dollar could appreciate further 
Many are concerned about what happens when  patient  goes away
 Many participants regarded dropping the  patient  language in the statement  whenever that might occur  as risking a shift in market expectations 
A few say that Fed Funds has been at zero for long enough though
 Some observed that  even with these risks taken into consideration  the federal funds rate may have already been kept at its lower bound for a sufficient length of time  and that it might be appropriate to begin policy firming in the near term   
Are WalMart s actions a sign that wages are finally on the increase 
Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  is giving its employees a pay increase
 Approximately 500 000 full time and part time associates at Walmart U S  stores and Sam s Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of the current fiscal year  This may be good for the long term health of the company
 As a result  we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience  which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over time  
But it will impact this year s earnings
 These strategic investments  which will cost approximately  1 billion this year The full year earnings per share impact is expected to be approximately  0 20  We expect full year earnings per share to range between  4 70 and  5 05  This compares to reported earnings per share of  4 99 in fiscal 2015 
Although there are reports to the contrary  Jack In The Box  NASDAQ JACK  isn t seeing an increased competition for employees
 we have been reading some of the articles out there that are pointing towards this competition for talent and that there s this war being waste for talent across competitor brands  We re not seeing that  we re not seeing it in our turnover numbers and we re just not experiencing that behaviorally in the restaurants  Jim McNerney wins for my favorite exchange of the week
Analyst Q   And how do you feel about the valuation we see out there because it   
A   It s ridiculously high with the possible exception of my share price  The numbers are hard to make work without significant bolt on kinds of synergies   Bank of America  NYSE BAC  Corporation  NYSE BAC 
Financials 
Competition in sub prime auto lending has gotten a little less silly
 when you talk to folks in the field  we are just seeing a little less pressure and a little less silliness than we saw 12 months ago  It s   but the competition is still out there  the securitization market is still very strong  Americas Car Mart Inc  NASDAQ CRMT 
The reinsurance market is over capitalized and highly competitive
 The reinsurance market remain challenging during 2014  in general the market remains over capitalize in this highly competitive especially for new business  Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd  NASDAQ GLRE 
The catastrophe business is the most competitive because of few catastrophes and influx of capital
 Our property catastrophe retro accounts continue to benefit from the light year from catastrophe  However  this was the most competitive area in the market due to influx of alternative capital and the recent history of years without a major loss  
Consumer 
Promotional activity in retail may have abated in the fourth quarter
We actually think in the fourth quarter last year there was actually less promotional activity than it was in the prior year  So we are pleased with that trend   Fossil Group Inc  NASDAQ FOSL 
Technology 
What will happen with the Telecom industry in 2015 
John Legere says it s obviously competitive  Sprint has come out swinging and AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon have gotten burned
 The competitive environment into  15  obviously  is intense  Sprint is  swinging the bat pretty hard  trying to get some activity flow  I think AT T and Verizon played really hard  and they felt the pain really badly  In Q4  I think the hand on the hot stove by the young child didn t feel pretty good  and they re taking the hand off the stove   T Mobile US Inc  NYSE TMUS 
T Mobile is rooting for Sprint
 we re rooting for Sprint  We need Sprint to help us give   take a few shots at the big guys and cause a little churn in the industry  And churn is good for us    TMUS 
Is there something brewing between T Mobile and Dish 
 I think DISH is a great opportunity  both for the country and for possibly T Mobile    TMUS 
Rackspace is seeing customers gravitate towards a hybrid public private cloud
 More of our customers are consuming multi tenant and single tenant product together in hybrid solutions  where the solution itself will dictate the best infrastructure form factor for that particular application   Rackspace Hosting Inc  NYSE RAX 
The marketplace is understanding the cloud now
 The market  as you ve heard me say  is moving from hype to wisdom   RAX 
Quality of wireless spectrum is more important than quantity
 much is made of the quantity of spectrum that each carrier holds  but spectrum strategy is much more than simply acquiring megahertz  Equally  if not more important  is what bands we have  are they fairly ubiquitous across the footprint  are they mainstream industry bids  and are they free from encumbrances   Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ 
Healthcare 
Healthcare expenses were a headwind for WalMart last year  although not as bad as anticipated
 Although not as high as we anticipated  healthcare expenses were a headwind for Walmart U S  during the year    NYSE T 
Materials  Industrials  Energy 
Oil and Gas CEOs don t seem to believe that oil prices will stay where they are
 our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery  It is clear that current prices are too low to meet the world s supply needs and the market will rebalance The current supply demand imbalance is not very large   EOG Resources Inc  NYSE EOG 
They still are ready to move forward with capital projects  but they need to please their investor base
 I ve been in front of a lot of customers over the last couple of week  particularly in the Oil   Gas business  And for the types of things that we re chasing  they feel pretty bullish about them going forward  It s just a matter of when  I think they ve got their challenges with their investor base that they are dealing with and they are taking one more look in a deep breath before they start pulling the trigger on some of these programs  Fluor Corporation  NYSE FLR 
The pipeline of oil and gas projects has not diminished for Fluor  it s just been extended
 The pipeline of projects is not diminished  some of it has been pushed to the right the gestation period is longer But as we go over the next 12 quarters  I feel pretty good about solid growth in that market place over that longer period of time  And that s Oil   Gas    NYSE FLR 
EOG is cutting capex by 40  this year though
 2015 CapEx represents a 40  decrease from 2014  As Bill mentioned earlier  we re not interested in growing oil production in a low price environment    NYSE EOG 
Greenlight  along with a lot of other hedge funds  exited its energy investments in Q4
 In the fourth quarter we exited our energy positions in Anadarko BP  Mcdermott and National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV   We hedged our underlying exposure to oil mid year by shorting crude oil futures  This protected us from the sharp falloff in oil prices   Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd  NASDAQ GLRE 
US production growth should turn flat to negative by the end of the year
 our view now is that we really believe with the consensus opinion that as we go forward due to the response of the industry that we could have flat to maybe even negative U S  production growth on a month over month basis by the end of this year  and that certainly going to slowdown U S  production growth this year    NYSE EOG 
Boeing feels like the value proposition for the 787 is pretty strong even at  40 Crude Oil
 You remember the 787 program was approved at  40 oil  people forget that  So our view then remains today is that this asset which has 20 plus percent better fuel  30 plus percent operating economics  which is an amazing step function change pace back at virtually any expected oil price that an airline executive has that s what they re saying    BA 
It wasn t that long ago that companies were making plans based on  50 price assumptions
 I d remind the audience here that it was only four five years ago that our oil company customers are making the same capital decisions on  50 oil  So that s not that long ago   NYSE FLR

Keep your powder dry to take advantage of a downturn
 we want to keep our balance sheet clean and low and we want to keep our powder dry so that we will be able to take some advantage of what could be some unique opportunities in this downturn    NYSE EOG 
When potential returns get compressed  it makes economic sense to pull back on investment and wait for markets to correct
 As we compare today s oil prices to our expectations for a more balanced market  it makes economic sense to slow production until an industry wide supply response is realized and prices respond accordingly  This strategy maximizes the value of our assets and it s the right strategy to create long term shareholder value    NYSE EOG

of the domestic economy  May s discouraging jobs report  a low level of business investment and lower than expected inflation did little to help the Fed take a rate hike call Other economic data was mostly encouraging in nature  Further  global crude production disruptions  a slump in U S  crude output and decline in the domestic commercial crude oil inventories had a positive impact on oil prices   Read   July s PerformanceBenchmarks registered a considerably stronger performance in July  Over last month  the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq gained 3 6   2 8  and 6 6   respectively  Markets rebounded from the steep losses it suffered on Brexit woes  with U S  stocks climbing to record highs Corporate results came in better than expected  while reassuring domestic economic data raised confidence in the strength of the economy  Several major companies posted upbeat earnings results during the second quarter earnings season  with banks leading the pack Stocks also surged on stimulus hopes from central banks around the world to counter economic gloom  The Bank of England said that most of its members are expecting a loosening of policy in August  This reassured investors who were expecting further stimulus measures to stem the rot of an already reeling economy   Read   Oil Price Gains ContinueIn August  oil prices continued to move northward  During the first week  oil prices gained following a surprisingly large draw on gasoline stockpiles  However  some of these gains were curtailed on oversupply concerns  subdued demand and increased crude inventories Rise in oil prices helped benchmarks finish in the green for the second week  Saudi Arabia s Energy Minister Kahlid al Falih showed willingness to talk with major crude oil producers to limit oil production  which eventually boosted oil prices  WTI crude posted its largest weekly gain in about four months During the third week  crude hit a one month high  However  during the fourth week  analysts at Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   said that any agreement between major oil producing nations to freeze crude production is  highly unlikely   leading to a decline in crude prices  Disappointing inventories data also weighed on crude prices Mixed Economic DataEconomic data released this month was largely mixed in nature  Personal consumption expenditure increased in June  Meanwhile  ISM Manufacturing and Services Indexes declined in July and factory orders declined for the second straight month in June Also  construction spending was down for third consecutive month and initial claims increased to its highest level since end June  However  rise in industrial output and home building was encouraging The biggest economic release for the month  second quarter GDP data  was a disappointment  The  second  estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that GDP grew at 1 1  in the second quarter  lower than the initial estimate of 1 2  Rate Hike on the Anvil Fed s July meeting minutes showed that some policymakers argued that a rate hike should take place soon as the labor market was nearing full employment  However  the majority agreed that more positive data is required to initiate such a move   Additionally  comments from some Fed officials raised speculation of a rate hike in the near term  Kansas City Fed President Esther George said that after observing the job market  inflation and Fed s forecast for the same  she considers  that it would be appropriate  to raise rates gradually Further  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said that levels of inflation and employment are improving and  GDP growth in the second half of the year will be strong   He added that following  very good  healthy financial conditions   it would be appropriate to raise rates Speaking at the Jackson Hole economic symposium  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the case for hiking federal funds rate has gained in strength in  recent months   Yellen asserted that the case for a rate increase is gathering steam  thanks to a solid labor market and positive outlook on economic activity and inflation  Fed Vice chairman Stanley Fisher also advocated a rate hike in the near term  Financial stocks have gained recently due to these developments

Will Fall Be Kind to Stocks 
All three benchmarks gained in excess of 4  during the last three months  Apart from the lean period in June  stocks have largely refuted the old adage of staying away from the bourses from May  A better than expected earnings season and a resurgence in oil prices is largely responsible for the gains during this period  Meanwhile  markets have largely come to terms with the prospect of a rate hike  With the economy expected to bounce back during the current quarter  stocks are likely to move higher in the months ahead

2695,224210,CRMT,General Motors  GM  Permitted To Delay Takata Airbag Recalls,opinion,"General Motors Company   NYSE GM   has been permitted by U S  auto safety regulators to delay the recall of a large number of trucks related to the Takata airbag explosion issue  to Aug 31  2017  The recall of these vehicles was initially slated to begin on Dec 31  2016 
The company has been allowed more time to prove that these vehicles are safe  which would also help it from taking a large financial hit  This decision  which is unusual for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  allows General Motors to carry out long term tests on the vehicles with the Takata airbag inflators  including trucks as well as SUVs 
These inflators have caused 11 reported deaths in the U S  and 16 globally  General Motors recalled 2 5 million vehicles in May but stated that its inflators were different from the ones used in vehicles that were involved in the deaths  Per the tests carried out  the Takata airbags contain a chemical that can deteriorate when continuously exposed to high temperatures and airborne moisture  which can make it burn quickly  blowing apart a metal canister and throwing shrapnel at drivers and passengers 
General Motors claims that its inflator s vents are bigger and have stronger steel caps than that of the inflators that have been linked to the deaths  Moreover  its trucks have solar absorbing glass which allows the cabin temperatures to remain low  keeping the inflators cooler 
The automaker filed a petition to delay the recall and carry out tests last week  The petition received approval on Nov 21  The testing could help the company prevent the recall of 6 8 million vehicles  which would cost about  870 million  Moreover  the delay pushes the timing of the recall into the administration of President elect  Donald Trump  who has expressed his desire to remove unnecessary government regulations 
While the costs of recalls are initially borne by automakers  the parts manufacturers compensate them eventually  However  Takata is currently under financial distress  The company is looking for a buyer  while it is plausible that its North American division will file for bankruptcy  This lowers the probability of reimbursing automakers including General Motors for the recalls 
Safety advocates have called the decision a backroom deal that keeps the public in the dark  It has also been said that in the past  while some automakers  vehicles were not recalled initially as they did not cause any problems  eventually they were recalled 
Senator Bill Nelson also stated that when Ford   NYSE F   carried out tests on 1 900 Ranger inflators  no abnormality was detected  However  post the tests  a Ford Ranger pickup s Takata inflator led to a death  He also said that a delay was a mistake  which would further encourage other automakers to ask for the same  putting car owners and drivers at risk  GENERAL MOTORS Price
