1339,222854,CB,Insurers look to curb ransomware exposure as U S  cyber rates rise,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn  Reuters    U S  insurers are ramping up cyber insurance rates by as much as 25  and trying to curb exposure to vulnerable customers after a surge of costly claims  industry sources said  The changes follow a challenging year of hackers using malicious programs  known as ransomware  to take down systems that control everything from hospital billing to manufacturing  They stop only after receiving increasingly hefty payments  The attacks happened less frequently in 2019  but the problem remains significant  cybersecurity experts said   Ransomware is more sophisticated and dangerous than we saw in the past   said Adam Kujawa  director of Malwarebytes Labs  There were 6  fewer ransomware incidents in 2019 versus the prior year  according to Malwarebytes  However  attacks are now designed to spur deeper and more lasting technological problems  with hackers demanding bigger sums  The average ransom of  41 198 during the 2019 third quarter more than tripled from the first quarter  according to Coveware  which helps negotiate and facilitate the payments  Ransoms are becoming disproportionate to the size of targets  said Kelly Castriotta  Allianz SE  DE ALVG  North American head of product development for financial lines  Hackers frequently pursue mid size companies and other organizations that are less technologically adept  but also have less revenue to cover big ransoms   You d expect a ransomware demand that you can pay   Castriotta said  The U S  rate increases underscore broader global ransomware problems from which no company is immune  Ransomware recently crippled foreign exchange firm Travelex Ltd s  TRVLXP UL  systems for weeks  leaving staff to serve customers with pens and paper  Hackers demanded  6 million  the BBC reported  Travelex declined to comment  Another attack in December paralyzed the Albany County Airport Authority s administrative computers  It had to pay  98 705 96 in Bitcoin to get the system unlocked  a spokesman told Reuters  Its insurer  Chubb Ltd  BN CB   covered the ransom  he said  Chubb declined to comment  Cyber insurance premiums started rising 5  to 25  late last year  said Robert Parisi  U S  cyber product leader at Marsh   McLennan Companies Inc  N MMC   He called the increases  dramatic  but said insurers have not scaled back coverage  Cyber policies often cover not just ransom  but data recovery  legal liabilities and negotiators fluent in hackers  native languages  Some insurers are considering changes  given the rising costs  Allianz is looking into price adjustments and whether ransomware should be a separate product from general cyber coverage  Castriotta said  Zurich Insurance Group AG  S ZURN  is more likely to underwrite firms that have added network features to prevent attacks from spreading through systems  said its chief risk officer  Peter Giger  Sompo International  T 8630  is reviewing criteria for businesses that have been most vulnerable to ransomware  said Brad Gow  global cyber product leader  Insurers including Sompo may also lower amounts they pay for ransomware attacks against higher risk companies or shift to coinsurance  in which policyholders would pay 20  to 30  of ransomware claims  Gow said  They might also require those policyholders to have data backup procedures  Gow compared potential changes to requiring airbags or sprinkler systems   We can drive a win win by helping our clients become better protected   he said

1340,222855,CB,Take 5  Browns  missing piece  Cowboys Patriots clash,news,"Heavyweight clashes in Foxborough  Mass   and Santa Clara  Calif   headline a juicy Week 12 slate  but we re going to start first with the Cleveland Browns 
At 4 6  the Browns remain playoff long shots  but they ve unveiled perhaps the league s most important schematic wrinkle in the past two weeks 
1  Hunt   Pony  package salvaging Kitchens  offense
Since Kareem Hunt returned from suspension  the Browns have totaled only 40 points and averaged 4 93 yards per play  below their season average  5 55  
And yet  Hunt s return has revolutionized the offense  inspiring Freddie Kitchens   Pony  package  two running backs   which has been the offense s lifeblood in consecutive wins 
Against the Bills  the Browns ran a whopping 31 plays with both Nick Chubb  NYSE CB  and Hunt on the field  gaining 219 yards  7 06 average  despite a few execution errors  That included 126 rushing yards on 13 carries  seven of which gained 8 plus yards 
Five days later  Cleveland ran 18 plays in  Pony  personnel against Pittsburgh  gaining 132 yards  7 33 average   Baker Mayfield was 6 of 9 for 91 yards on such plays  including a 41 yard strike to KhaDarel Hodge after leveraging both backs for misdirection 
Hunt is a fascinating player  He s extremely physical but also an outstanding receiver with great lateral agility  suddenness and acceleration  He already has 13 receptions for 90 yards  even beating Steelers cornerback Cameron Sutton at times  a rarity for a back 
Hunt has done everything in these packages  playing wide  in the slot  fullback and even tight end  He s lead blocking  with great effort   jet sweeping  often as a decoy   catching a screen  or running a route on any given play  His presence  often with motion  helps define the defense and reveal coverages 
Kitchens has clearly invested in this package  running it in 20  3WRs   21  two WRs   22  one WR  and even 30  three RBs  two WRs  personnel  He s already used eight o 10 different run designs  several variations of jet and star motion  a handful of RPOs and many of the Browns  base concepts    all tweaked to incorporate both Chubb and Hunt 
Altogether  the Browns have gained 7 16 yards per play on 49  Pony  snaps  compared to 3 65 on 85 others  That volume is unheard of for two RB sets  but the efficiency demands more 
Perhaps these ideas will run out  or their effectiveness will wane  More likely though  this package is just getting started  It sprung several leaks in the stout Bills and Steelers defenses  Imagine what it might do against the Dolphins  Bengals and Cardinals down the stretch 
2  Another litmus test for Patriots  D
Despite the New England Patriots  defensive dominance  cries about the team s weak schedule grew louder when they allowed 37 points at Baltimore in Week 9  Now the Dallas Cowboys  top ranked offense comes to town  the first of three consecutive major tests  Houston  Kansas City  
Can Dallas revive its run game at New England  There hasn t been a smoking gun for the struggles the past two weeks  125 yards on 46 carries  2 7 yard average   but the Cowboys have been particularly poor running from heavy personnel  20 carries for 34 yards  1 7 yard average  
The answer could be to spread out in 11 personnel  producing space for Ezekiel Elliott rather than relying on tight ends and fullbacks to win blocks  Coordinator Kellen Moore has a host of RPOs in his bag that can leverage numbers in the offense s favor  with Dak Prescott s ability to run being another key factor 
In protection  the Cowboys  linemen should be able to handle the Patriots  rushers individually  but that s only part of the battle against Bill Belichick  The group also must be sharp mentally against the Patriots  litany of stunts and blitzes 
If Prescott has protection    as he has most of the year    the downfield duels should be fascinating  Amari Cooper might be Stephon Gilmore s toughest test yet  while Michael Gallup and Randall Cobb are tougher covers than most teams  second and third receivers 
3  Shanahan Pettine chess rematch
In Week 6 last year  Kyle Shanahan s San Francisco 49ers scored 30 points at Green Bay  with a late Aaron Rodgers rally thwarting the upset bid 
Shanahan and Packers defensive coordinator Mike Pettine threw schematic haymakers at each other  with the Niners winning more battles despite a spotty night from quarterback C J  Beathard  Shanahan now has a sharper triggerman in Jimmy Garoppolo  whose snappy release has been critical for late in the down playmaking 
Pettine s personnel decisions will be tested again Sunday night  He largely prefers nickel  dime and even dollar  seven DBs  packages  but the 49ers live primarily in base personnel 
Last year  Pettine gave then rookie linebacker Oren Burks 28 snaps alongside every down man Blake Martinez  but Burks bombed both physically and mentally  He played just 41 defensive snaps the rest of the season and remains mostly a bit player 
B J  Goodson has been Martinez s partner in base personnel this season  impressing as a thumper  Pettine has also worked safety Ibraheim Campbell in as a linebacker in  big  nickel or dime packages  Both will be critical in slowing the 49ers  expansive run game  Pettine may also lean on  Bear  fronts  three D linemen covering guards and center   as he did late in last year s meeting 
The aerial battle should look different  Pettine paired a slew of funky blitzes with Cover 2 looks last year  but he s toned down the exotic calls this season  That s likely because Preston Smith and especially Za Darius Smith have been so disruptive  requiring fewer blitzes to get pressure 
4  Seahawks perfectly suited to attack Eagles deep
The Philadelphia Eagles  defense has stiffened with a healthy secondary  but its style is inherently susceptible to the Seattle Seahawks  favorite downfield concepts 
Eagles coordinator Jim Schwartz s Cover 3 is a far more aggressive than most  Rather than playing  deeper than the deepest  like a typical center fielder  free safety Rodney McLeod plays flat footed and aggressive  reading the QB and jumping crossers  Philadelphia counts on its outside cornerbacks to  replace  McLeod in center field when they aren t occupied by a route 
Even if Tyler Lockett  shin  cannot play  Seahawks coordinator Brian Schottenheimer will test the scheme s soundness  He has repeatedly used two man route concepts off play action to spring big plays  leveraging the speed of Lockett and rookie DK Metcalf 
Schottenheimer will also stress the secondary s discipline with moving pockets  More than any other team  the Seahawks love to roll Russell Wilson in one direction only to have him throw a route to the opposite side of the field  This ploy is often paired with a corner post route  inviting the free safety to bite in the wrong direction 
5  Young stars battle in L A 
The Los Angeles Rams  defense has been quietly excellent since the arrival of Jalen Ramsey  with coordinator Wade Phillips favoring more man coverage of late 
One reason Phillips can play more man is because he has a top cover linebacker in Cory Littleton  A lanky speedster  Littleton is tied for second among all linebackers with eight pass breakups this season  and he s proven equally adept covering running backs or tight ends 
On Sunday  Littleton will see Baltimore Ravens sophomore sensation Mark Andrews  who has an excellent combination of movement skills and nuanced route running  Andrews also shines on contested catches  making Littleton s length critical

1341,222856,CB,Startup helps Scottish farmers grow gourmet plants with sea water,news,"By Stuart McDill
TURNBERRY  Scotland  Reuters    A British startup is teaching farmers how to grow crops using water from a source which won t run out   the sea 
Seawater Solutions is helping farmers on Scotland s west coast adapt to the reality of less rain by choosing salt resistant plants and developing saltmarshes   land flooded by tidal waters   for them to grow in 
 These plants can create eco systems and promote wildlife  but they can also feed us in a sustainable way and return health to the soil   said Seawater Solutions founder Yanik Nyberg  as he planted sea aster   a flavorsome  wild plant 
The company is working with Jay Crawford  a potato and carrot farmer  to farm an acre of his land previously underused because of its exposure to the sea wind and salt spray 
 We ve taken a piece of land here that was maybe only going to yield a couple of hundred pounds per year into something that could maybe yield a couple of thousand pounds per year   he said 
Pipelines running from the sea bring water that recreates the tide and irrigates crops of bright green samphire stalks and sea blite  a herb like plant that looks like rosemary  as well as aster 
Typically used as gourmet garnishes  the plants are becoming more mainstream and demand is growing by 10  per year  according to Seawater Solutions 
George Chubb  NYSE CB  of Glasgow greengrocer Roots and Fruits said the plants were really popular because of their  extreme taste  and  eco credentials

131897,353412,CB,Browns part ways with general manager Dorsey,news,"The Cleveland Browns parted ways with general manager John Dorsey on Tuesday after failing to come to an agreement on a restructuring of the front office 
The decision to move on from Dorsey after two years comes two days after the Browns fired first year head coach Freddie Kitchens 
Dorsey  59  had a meeting with co owner Jimmy Haslam earlier on Tuesday  Multiple media outlets reported that Haslam was considering structural changes and wanted Dorsey to take a backseat in the organization to the new head of football operations 
 We have a great appreciation for John and all he has done with the Cleveland Browns   owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam said in a joint statement 
 He has helped create a foundation that we need to continue to develop and build upon  While John helped greatly improve our team s talent and we are excited about the core players on our roster  we fully recognized that our team did not meet its potential on or off the field and additional changes in leadership give us the best opportunity for success in the future 
 As the role of the general manager continues to evolve in this league we felt there were areas that needed to be reassessed  Over the last 48 hours  we ve had discussion with John about his role but could not come to an agreement on a position that would enable him to remain with the organization  
The Haslams stressed that the head coach general manager relationship is vital 
 As we conveyed on Sunday and our players reiterated yesterday  bringing in a strong leader with our head coach is our priority   the Haslams said 
 Our process to improve upon the leadership will allow the flexibility to ensure we create the best partnership between our future head coach and general manager  We know the road of our tenure as stewards of this franchise has been a test of patience as we all want the success that our fans so deserve and we are relentlessly committed to and working towards  We fully appreciate  understand and empathize with our fans as we work towards our ultimate goal of building a championship level football team  
Dorsey did not dispute the importance of the general manager coach relationship in a statement released by the team 
 When I took this job  the history of this storied franchise and the passion of our fans was an integral part of my decision   he said   It s that same understanding and desire to see these fans enjoy the success they re so deserving of that helped me conclude  along with Jimmy and Dee  that it was best to part ways as they embark on the search for a new head coach 
 I know how critical the relationship is between a general manager and head coach and I also know how critical it is that the Browns have a strong leader in their next coach  I have a great appreciation for the men and women I have worked with since being in Cleveland and my family has the same love and appreciation for this community and are thankful for the opportunity to be a part of this journey  
Dorsey arrived in Cleveland in December 2017 as the team was in the midst of an 0 16 season  He took advantage of a number of assets accumulated by former general manager Sashi Brown and acquired wide receiver Jarvis Landry and safety Damarious Randall before selecting Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield with the top overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft 
Nick Chubb  NYSE CB   who was selected with the 35th pick in that draft  went on to finish second to Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry for the rushing title in 2019 
Dorsey would also acquire wideout Odell Beckham Jr   running back Kareem Hunt and defensive end Olivier Vernon  but the high profile moves resulted in a 6 10 season  The Browns capped the disappointing campaign on Sunday with a 33 23 setback to the Cincinnati Bengals  who finished with a 2 14 record

What s Next for Chubb 
While Chubb has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

131938,353453,CB,Global insurers face quiet strain from hacker ransom demands,news,By Suzanne Barlyn NEW YORK  Reuters    Global insurers that cover cyberattacks are facing more claims related to ransom demanding hackers who cripple businesses  technology systems  and only stop after receiving substantial payments   These hackers use malicious programs known as ransomware to take down systems controlling everything from supply chains to payments to manufacturing  The hackers have grown more sophisticated during the past year  cybersecurity experts say  shifting from individuals and mom and pop operations to larger companies that can afford bigger ransoms   The effort  known in the cybersecurity industry as  big game hunting   has been paying off for hackers  It has also been hurting insurers that provide cyber coverage for victims  which are often mid sized companies desperate to get their systems restored and running quickly    They re large enough to be worth extorting but not large enough to have sufficient network protections to defeat the ransomware   said Brad Gow  global cyber product leader for insurer Sompo International  T 8630    Sompo has been fielding a spate of claims related to a ransomware strain known as  Ryuk   Gow said  He described the victims as companies with annual revenue between  500 million and  1 billion   The number of attacks and size of ransom demands have been soaring   Businesses detected 365  more ransomware attacks in the second quarter than they did a year earlier  according to Malwarebytes  which sells cybersecurity software  The average ransom nearly tripled  to  36 295  from  12 762 between the first and second quarters of this year  according to Coveware  a firm that helps negotiate and facilitate cyber ransom payments   Criminals who dispatched the Ryuk strain have demanded as much as  5 million in bitcoin  the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in May   We ve seen an unprecedented amount of ransomware attacks in 2019   said Eireann Leverett  a senior risk researcher at the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies  The size of losses for those attacks poses a serious risk to the business  Leverett said   Companies that have cyber insurance are often covered for a variety of expenses  They include  data recovery  legal liabilities for exposing sensitive customer information  negotiators fluent in hackers  native languages and the ultimate ransom payments   Cyber experts say the criminals launching ransomware against companies are organized gangs in Russia and eastern Europe  or hackers sponsored by foreign governments  Insurers sometimes have restrictions in their policies to avoid covering attacks by nations  but it can be difficult to know for sure what type of criminal is launching an attack   Insurers interviewed by Reuters said ransomware attacks are accelerating but declined to say how much they have paid in total claims   Lloyd s of London insurer Beazley  L BEZG  expects to handle double to triple the number of ransomware incidents in 2019 as it did last year  including at least another 800 claims by year end  according to Katherine Keefe  Beazley s global head of breach response services  Ransomware incidents during the third quarter increased 37  over the prior year quarter  Beazley said   Similarly  Chubb Ltd  BN CB  had already responded to the same number of ransomware events by June of this year as it did for all of 2018  said Michael Tanenbaum  its head of cyber for North America   The average Ryuk ransomware attack claim from large companies is roughly  2 million  said Wade Chmielinski  a cyber consultant for commercial property insurer FM Global  Claims from smaller companies are typically between  150 000 and  250 000  FM Global does not pay for ransoms  he said   One prominent attack in March against Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro  OL NHY  turned out to be a lot more expensive  Norsk Hydro is among the few public examples available of ransomware striking a business  because publicizing such events can invite more attacks  experts said   After its systems were paralyzed by the LockerGoga strain of ransomware  Hydro experienced  60 1 million to  71 1 million  550 million to 650 million Norwegian crowns  in related losses during the first half of 2019  the company said in a filing on Wednesday  In March  Norsk Hydro identified American International Group Inc  N AIG  as its lead cyber insurer  An AIG spokesman declined comment  Norsk received a  3 6 million  33 million Norwegian crowns  insurance payout during the quarter and will report additional payouts when  deemed virtually certain   the company said on Wednesday  Global insurers collected  7 billion to  8 billion in cyber insurance premiums during 2018  up about 13  from 2017  according to ratings agency AM Best   But insurers are grappling with pricing as ransomware attacks become more common  Many of those attacks occur in the dark  making their frequency hard to know or how severe losses are  Although a simple ransom payment is often the cheapest  easiest solution  it also emboldens hackers  said Robert Hudock  a lawyer in Washington who advises clients on dealing with cyber attacks    It s going to be a hard problem to solve   he said   if people keep paying the ransoms and the systems keep getting compromised

131941,353456,CB,QB Allen set for NFL debut as Broncos host Browns,news,"The Cleveland Browns believe they have their franchise quarterback in Baker Mayfield  Their opponent on Sunday will debut its sixth starter at that position since future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning retired after the 2015 season 
Brandon Allen will take his first regular season NFL snap when the Broncos host the Browns this week  after Denver announced Joe Flacco will miss time with a herniated disc in his neck  Allen  who was drafted by Jacksonville in 2016 and also spent time on the Los Angeles Rams  roster  got the nod to lead the 2 6 Broncos 
Allen will try to jump start an offense that has struggled at times and had players grumbling about the play calling  Wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders hinted at his frustration after a loss to Kansas City on Oct  17  less than a week later  he was traded to San Francisco 
Flacco said he thought the play calling was too conservative after last Sunday s loss to Indianapolis  Head coach Vic Fangio said Flacco wasn t being benched for his comments    the change is due to his injury 
Now Allen is in the spotlight  at least until the Broncos decide if they want to give rookie second rounder Drew Lock a chance after the Week 10 bye 
Allen s teammates are confident in his abilities 
 First of all  Brandon is a very intelligent dude   running back Phillip Lindsay said   I was very shocked and surprised when he first got here how well he got the terminology so fast and how confident and calm he is  I m excited to see what he has to offer  I think he s going to move around a lot  and I think he s going to take shots and stuff  
Denver will face a Cleveland team dealing with its own adversity  The Browns  2 5  have lost three straight and are facing an uphill climb to reach the postseason  They re coming off a 27 13 loss in New England in Week 8 and look to start a playoff push against a struggling Broncos team 
Despite Denver s losing record  its defense has been solid for most of the year and presents a challenge  Chris Harris Jr  is still the top cornerback and will likely draw the assignment of shadowing Odell Beckham Jr   and Cleveland s banged up offensive line will try to stop defensive lineman Derek Wolfe and linebacker Von Miller from getting to Mayfield 
 Von Miller speaks for himself  He is one of the best in the league   Browns head coach Freddie Kitchens said Wednesday   The secondary is good  When they have given up 40 yards or less rushing  they have created six turnovers and they have won the game  When they did not  they lost the game  and even those games came down to a last second field goal  This is a very  very good football team we are playing  
Mayfield drew attention Wednesday when he abruptly left a media session after a testy exchange with a reporter 
He then posted on Twitter in response  saying   My sense of urgency is at an all time high  And if I offend anybody along the way    that s too bad  
The Browns beat the Broncos 17 16 in Denver last year  with Mayfield throwing for 188 yards  two touchdowns and an interception  Nick Chubb  NYSE CB  added 100 rushing yards on 20 carries

131944,353459,CB,Should Value Investors Pick Chubb Limited  CB  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Chubb Limited has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 39  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Chubb Limited s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 13 37 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 37  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Chubb Limited has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 50  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Chubb Limited s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value  focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Chubb Limited has a P S ratio of about 2 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 37 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Chubb Limited currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Chubb Limited a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Chubb Limited is just 1 45  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 84  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 95  which is better than the industry average of 14 1  Clearly  CB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Chubb Limited might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B andMomentum Score of D  This gives CB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year consensus estimate declined 0 6  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Chubb Limited Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineChubb Limited is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 42  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

131965,353480,CB,Leave room for the firetruck  Insurers help design mansions to tame disaster losses,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK  Reuters    Bruce Gendelman wanted a mountainside retreat when he bought 12 acres in Aspen  Colorado  But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned 
So Gendelman  who runs an insurance brokerage  tapped into a program that American International Group Inc  N AIG  offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk  A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning repellant system  cisterns to hold water run off and ceramic shingles that look like wood  Just in case a blaze does break out  his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck s maneuvers 
 It s a very high end home and we re dealing with very good contractors   Gendelman said   But  the AIG program  brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of  
Fires  floods  hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost  U S  insurers more than  170 billion in property losses since 2016  according to Property Claim Services  PCS   part of  Verisk Analytics Inc   O VRSK   and the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis 
Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates  and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties 
Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service  which is still a tiny part of the property casualty insurance industry  But executives  real estate developers and brokers  builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand 
 People don t naturally think of insurance as the first place to go   said Jennifer Naughton  head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd  BN CB    But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future  
Chubb s risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department s resources  and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates  among other measures 
The trend is not entirely new  PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007  and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service  But it is now picking up steam as a stand alone business at some major property casualty insurers  as more clients worry about extreme weather 
AIG started marketing its service as  Smart Build  in 2015  Initially  only residential construction projects that cost more than  5 million were eligible  but AIG lowered the threshold to  1 million two years later 
AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total  but a spokesman said there were 20  more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior year period 
Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently  as did Vault  a high net worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives  W R  Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele

FINE ART PROTECTION
The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers  For instance  if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water  they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding 
Ken Vona  who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE  recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet  5 5 m off the ground to guard against flood risk 
 A perfect example of  bad piece of property  nice view    he said 
Once a site is selected  specialists review architectural plans  making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage  among other risks  They scrutinize plumbing layouts  help design hurricane proof storage rooms to protect valuables  vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems  measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby 
Cameron Strothman  a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group  said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant  He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30 000 gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead  It cost  35 000 
Risk specialists  suggestions generally represent 10 to 15  of total building costs  insurance experts said 
Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway  like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system  or measures required by building codes  Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage  For instance  there is a  100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak 
Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built  risk experts said  A protective storage room for fine art may run less than  100 000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later  said Steve Bitterman  Vault s chief risk services officer 
Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home  but said AIG did not charge him for the advice 
 Providing this service free is smart for everyone   he said   They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client  ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/leave-room-for-the-firetruck-insurers-help-design-mansions-to-tame-disaster-losses-1967217,1967217

131971,353486,CB,Why Chubb  CB  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Chubb  NYSE CB   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1 39  
For the most recent quarter  Chubb was expected to post earnings of  2 58 per share  but it reported  2 60 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 78   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 49 per share  while it actually produced  2 54 per share  a surprise of 2 01  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Chubb lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Chubb currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 44   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 29  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-chubb-cb-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200476930,200476930

132009,353524,CB,Chubb  CB  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Chubb  NYSE CB  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Chubb is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Chubb  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Chubb
This insurer is expected to earn  10 46 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 10 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Chubb  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 8  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

132032,353547,CB,Film Study  Colts QB Luck better than ever,news,"For much of the past year  many wondered if we d already seen the best of Andrew Luck  Even three weeks into this season  some questioned the health of Luck s surgically repaired right shoulder  citing a wealth of dink and dunk throws  5 3 yards per attempt in Weeks 1 3 despite a 68 6 percent completion rate  and Jacoby Brissett s cameo on a Hail Mary against the Eagles  Two months later  Luck might be better than ever  He posted his eighth straight game with three plus passing touchdowns    the second longest streak ever  behind only Tom Brady s 10 game run in 2007    on Sunday against the Dolphins  earning the Colts their fifth straight win with a rally reminiscent of Indy s 2012 and 2013 teams  Back in those days  Luck played like Superman because he had to  He extended plays and exposed his body to dozens of hits while willing his team to victories  including seven fourth quarter comebacks and 10 game winning drives those two years alone  But that style of play proved unsustainable  and new head coach Frank Reich arrived with a clear focus on protecting Luck s health through scheme  A shrewd play designer    as we explored two weeks ago with his use of tight ends    Reich structured his offense to make Luck play on schedule and deliver quickly on almost every play  To his credit  Luck embraced the approach  breaking defenses down presnap with mental acuity and mitigating the pass rush  The efficiency was meager at first  but it limited pressure  which disappeared almost entirely when left tackle Anthony Castonzo returned to the lineup in Week 6  That began a five game sackless streak    Cameron Wake finally got one to end it Sunday    and a stretch of six games with just 11 QB hits  including a goose egg in Week 11 against the Titans  Meanwhile  with more time to build chemistry  Reich and Luck have found a groove  torching defenses quick throws that often turn into big plays through design  But Luck s cape isn t gone  The beauty of Reich s approach is that it keeps Luck safe and on schedule while allowing him to unearth his improvisational genius when needed  The first play after the two minute warning on Sunday was one of those moments  as the Colts faced third and 9 and the possibility of punting to the Dolphins with the game tied at 24  Like a 2013 nightmare  Luck s protection broke down  but he eschewed a checkdown to Nyheim Hines  Instead  with defensive end Andre Branch lurking behind for a strip sack and defensive tackle Akeem Spence barreling up the middle  Luck pumped to get Spence off his feet and ducked forward and left  leaving Spence grasping at air  After starting to run  he might have converted   Luck spied Carlos Rogers    who found a void downfield after the Dolphins  zone had collapsed    and hit him for 34 yards to set up the game winning field goal  Spence s exasperation told the whole story  Watching the throw travel downfield  the helpless big man and fell to the ground in anguish and pounded the turf  Though committed to Reich s designs  Luck is steadily becoming more comfortable again holding the ball late in the down  an awfully ominous sign for defenses  He extended plays a few other times Sunday    including a 17 yard gain to Jordan Wilkins and a scramble on third and 4    a week after creating a pair of off schedule touchdowns against the Titans  14 yards to T Y  Hilton and 7 yards to Dontrelle Inman   That willingness speaks to Indy s fabulous protection as well as Luck s confidence in his own health  After attempting a diving catch in Week 11  Luck skied to snag a Brissett hospital pass on another trick play Sunday  taking a huge hit to convert fourth and 1  Reich might want to tone back those risks  but Luck told reporters he didn t think at all about his shoulder on the hit  another indication that he feels 100 percent again  With a thriving O line and a sharply designed scheme built on quick timing throws  Luck has the support system to keep it that way  as he makes a transition much like Ben Roethlisberger did midway through his career  The priority is to carve up opponents with ruthless  quick strike efficiency  but Luck reserves the right to scramble for game changing plays when needed   Appreciating Xavien Howard s brilliance Luck s masterful comeback obscured one of the day s best performances  as Howard forced the QB into his first multi interception game since Week 6  Interceptions can be wildly random  but much like Jalen Ramsey s pair that we broke down last week  Howard engineered two masterpieces on Sunday  First  with 60 seconds left before halftime  the Colts dialed up a sail route  deep corner route  for Hilton off of play action  Playing press man coverage  Howard didn t get much on the shifty receiver off the line  but he mirrored him closely while patiently maintaining outside leverage  Knowing Hilton s inside release ruled out a go route  which almost always release outside   Howard waited for the wideout to break left or right  With safety help in the middle of the field  Howard didn t bite on Hilton s head fake inside  allowing him to turn smoothly underneath the receiver when Hilton broke to the corner  Many cornerbacks would have face guarded Hilton and or drawn a pass interference flag on a slightly underthrown ball  but Howard turned to locate the pass immediately  The vast majority of corners would have reached with just one hand to knock the throw away  but Howard went up with two  outleaping Hilton and snaring the ball at full extension over his back shoulder for the highlight reel pick  Miami s offense promptly wasted the turnover with one of its own on the next play  sending Howard right back on the field  On his next snap  he not only nabbed a takeaway  but also saved a touchdown  Howard was assigned to play any vertical route by the single receiver  Inman  on the backside of a 3x1 formation  with a safety dropping down to handle any inside route  When Inman ran inside instead of vertical  Howard became a free defender and went looking for work  Tight end Eric Ebron  the inside trips receiver  ran a deep over route from the opposite side and was 2 yards clear of his man  linebacker Kiko Alonso  Luck saw it and let fly  never reading Howard because a backside cornerback almost never factors into this sort of route  But Howard sunk under the throw and closed from several yards outside to pluck the ball  retaking possession for Miami and likely preventing a 55 yard touchdown  Howard now has nine interceptions in his last 15 games      and shockingly few have come from good fortune  Only one was tipped  while several came via tight man coverage  including a near mirror image of Sunday s first pick against Tom Brady  while covering Brandin Cooks  last year  Not just a splash player  Howard is also a spectacular down to down cover artist  Big  6 foot 0  201 pounds  31 1 4 inch arms   fast  4 41 40 yard dash  and agile  6 94 3 cone drill   he has curbed the grabbiness that plagued him at Baylor and is wielding his tools very effectively in his third NFL season  Luck threw at Howard just four times Sunday  Two were complete underneath for 23 combined yards  one was broken up on a deep curl and the other was Howard s first interception  Howard s second pick wasn t even thrown at him  one of two plays he made outside his coverage Sunday  On the other  he came off his man to slam Inman a yard short of the sticks as he caught a pass on third and 8  Howard rarely shadows receivers in the slot  and he shows immaturity at times  see Sunday s 15 yard penalty for a late hit   but he s quietly become one of the league s top cornerbacks  With one year left on his rookie deal  he should be due for a monster extension this offseason   The Broncos  unheralded hero The Raiders cut Shelby Harris  a 2014 seventh round pick  four times in two years  the last in May of 2016  The Jets kept Harris just three months  and he spent most of 2016 without a team after being cut in August  The Cowboys added Harris to their practice squad in late December and cut him 19 days later  In January of 2017  Harris joined the Broncos on a reserve future contract  On Sunday  the backup nose tackle might have saved Denver s season with the game of his life    two days after the birth of his daughter    and it was no fluke  For whatever reason  Harris was passed over by three teams and nearly out of the league  But he forced the Broncos to keep him in 2017 by dominating in the preseason  three sacks  four tackles for loss  four QB hits   and then steadily earned regular season reps  He blocked a would be game tying field goal at the buzzer in Week 1  then added sacks in Weeks 3 and 4  He finished 2017 with 5 5  second on the team behind Von Miller  The production  no sacks  three QB hits entering Sunday  didn t pop early this season  but Harris has still impressed on tape  Built wide and squatty  6 foot 2  290 pounds   Harris is listed as a nose tackle but plays just as often at end in Denver s 3 4 scheme  He s a load in the run game  using heavy hands to shock linemen on impact and lower body strength to press them into the backfield  He leans on his bull rush as a pass rusher    often collapsing pockets for Miller and Bradley Chubb  NYSE CB  rather than getting there himself    but also flashes quick swim and rip moves  and even the occasional spin  Everyone saw Sunday s game sealing interception  but Harris hounded Ben Roethlisberger all day  JuJu Smith Schuster s 97 yard touchdown was nearly a safety  as Harris planted six time Pro Bowl center Maurkice Pouncey on his back with a bull rush and hit Roethlisberger as he released  Undeterred by the near miss  Harris did end Pittsburgh s next possession  this time bulling through left guard Ramon Foster and barreling into Roethlisberger s chest to force an errant throw that Chris Harris intercepted  Later in the third  Shelby Harris closed Roethlisberger s escape lane on Shaquil Barrett s sack  He opened Pittsburgh s final drive with a half sack of his own by walking Pouncey into the QB as Miller ripped through a double team on the edge  Then came the heroic pick  which might have been divined a play earlier  As the Steelers ran left on second and goal from the 3  Harris    who got in on that tackle    glanced out wide mid play and saw receivers running slants  indicating it was a run pass option  When Pittsburgh ran another RPO on third and goal from the 2  Harris was ready  He wasn t supposed to drop  but after an initial push  Harris saw Roethlisberger pull the ball and sank backward into the throwing lane  using soft hands to nab the pass and clinch the game  Despite his effectiveness  Harris has played just 34 4 percent of the defensive snaps this season  barely ranking fourth among Denver D linemen  but that could be changing  His 36 snaps Sunday marked a season high  behind only end Derek Wolfe and outpacing starters Adam Gotsis  end  and Domata Peko  nose   The big performance could earn Harris a larger role  especially with Wolfe and Gotsis struggling to generate pressure  and Peko    who turns 34 on Tuesday    taking a clear step back in his 13th season  
Of course  Harris is used to uphill battles  and there should be a big reward coming down the line  The 27 year old will hit restricted free agency in March and    assuming he doesn t sign an extension    unrestricted free agency in 2020  nearly six full years after he was drafted  Whenever he finally gets paid  he ll have earned every penny    David DeChant  Field Level Media",2018-11-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/film-study-colts-qb-luck-better-than-ever-1700661,1700661

132035,353550,CB,Big claims strain senior living market for U S  insurers,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn  Reuters    Last March  a 103 year old resident of a Sunrise Senior Living facility in Willowbrook  Illinois  went on a field trip to the movies   Ruth Smith  who used a walker  fell down two concrete steps in the theater and died about six weeks later  Now Smith s estate is suing Sunrise  saying that aides did not properly watch her  As the U S  society ages  senior living communities are on the rise  So are claims and lawsuits against them  And when they lose  it is usually down to insurers to pay up   It s a tremendous opportunity that has pretty specific challenges   said Brendan Gallagher  who heads the senior care business at insurance broker Arthur J  Gallagher   Co   N AJG  Some senior living facilities could see insurance rate hikes in 2019 as high as 30 percent  according to insurance broker Willis Towers Watson   O WLTW  Fewer insurers are offering coverage today than they were five years ago and some Lloyd s of London members stopped writing the coverage during the past year  said John Atkinson  managing partner at Willis   Some insurers are dropping coverage of those communities entirely while others are avoiding litigious locations such as Kentucky  Illinois and Florida  said insurers and brokers  While the pullback threatens to raise costs for families  other insurers are expanding  betting on the industry s strong growth prospects   The number of people living in U S  residential care facilities has grown by over 10 percent to 812 000 between 2010 and 2016  according to the most recent data from the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   As the industry gears up for the arrival of the greying 74 million baby boom generation  senior living facilities have grown even faster  The number of rooms in those centers has risen up by a fifth since 2013  according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing   Care  NIC   which collects data for the 99 largest U S  metro areas   While aging is a global phenomenon and the U S  society is relatively younger than those in Europe and north Asia  its greater dependence on senior centers confronts it with challenges other nations may yet have to grapple with  More so than previous U S  generations  today s elderly often live far away from their children  In Europe  seniors tend to live much closer to their relatives or in communities that provide generous government services for the elderly  In many Asian and African communities  multiple generations commonly live together  Not only do more people move into retirement communities  but they tend to do it later than they used to  resulting in more frequent and severe injuries  insurance professionals say    People are living longer and they are more frail   said Gloria Holland  vice president of finance at  Capital Senior Living Corp   N CSU   a Dallas based company that runs 129 communities across the country  A spokeswoman for Sunrise Assisted Living  where Smith lived  said the company had policies and procedures in place to help promote resident safety   Anytime we lose a member of our community we are deeply saddened   she said   Falls are the biggest risk  Allegations of falls account for nearly half of all assisted living claims that insurer CNA Financial Group  N CNA  closed in 2016 and 2017  the company said   Graphic     Another source of insurance claims are  memory care  centers  which cater to people with Alzheimer s disease and other types of memory problems   The nascent sector has grown 52 percent since 2013  according to NIC  A big issue there  residents who wander away  Last year  the body of 77 year old Audrey Penn was found in a ditch after she left a senior living community in Allentown  Pennsylvania   A lawsuit filed by her family settled for an undisclosed amount   A CHANGING AMERICA Capital Senior Living s Holland said the average age of residents who moved to its facilities was between 78 and 80 when she joined the company in 2004 and has risen to between 82 to 84 by now  That makes individual claims more expensive to settle  The company anticipates a 5 percent rate increase when it renews its insurance in 2019  Holland said  Higher rates and deductibles are more likely to affect smaller facilities  which may lack robust compliance programs for preventing accidents and other problems  insurers and brokers say  Smaller centers often  struggle to keep up with changing regulations   said Caroline Clouser  who heads the healthcare industry practice at insurer Chubb Ltd   N CB  Insurance premiums for senior facilities vary by state  Premiums for each assisted living apartment range from  150 to  600 annually  insurers and brokers say  Insurance for those facilities makes up less than 1 percent of the  558 billion property and casualty insurers collected in net written premiums in 2017  Yet it is likely to grow as aging boomers fill up senior communities  industry insiders say  Nationwide is among the companies that have been growing their senior living insurance business while being selective  said Jeremy Moore  senior living underwriting manager   You have to understand what the exposures are and the controls in place   he said  Nationwide has a team of former senior living executives and administrators who visit communities and look at everything from building maintenance to evacuation procedures  Moore said  Wisconsin based Church Mutual Insurance Company  which writes coverage for the industry in 49 states  is planning to expand into Florida  the remaining state  in 2019  according to Jim Ketterson  who heads the insurer s senior living practice   Brokers are also working to help senior living communities better manage their risk  Willis recently launched a program to help facilities learn how to more safely lift residents   Willis also runs a webinar on active shooter events  including tips such using beds to block doors that do not lock  a common feature in memory care facilities  
Senior living companies also keep reviewing their facilities and procedures  they say  For example  Capital Senior Living is gradually replacing carpet flooring with laminate  which is less of a trip hazard  Holland said  It is also considering a technology that can help track residents  movements to determine if they are at risk of a fall ",2019-01-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-claims-strain-senior-living-market-for-us-insurers-1734694,1734694

132063,353578,CB, Crypto Insurance Business Heating Up As Hackers Get Savvier ,news,"One of the main things that keeps potential crypto investors at bay is the threat that they could lose their tokens to theft  fraud or hacks 
A solution that is picking up steam in the crypto world is crypto insurance  While the idea is not exactly new  recent dubious actions have put this type of protection squarely back in the news 
Let s discuss 
Hackers seem to be the main reason among the ways that investors have been losing money in the crypto sector  As the industry has grown  individuals seem to have become savvier in their abilities to tap into exchanges 
Just think Mt  Gox 
And then there are the recent hacks we reported involving  that happened within weeks of each other  Also  there was Bitfinex 
Reports say that in 2017  cyber insurance became the fastest growing type of insurance in the U S   becoming a multi billion market  Bloomberg  that 2018 is on track to be the busiest year for hacking activity 
It ll cost you
Insurance companies may be stepping in to provide protection for crypto investors  but you should be on notice that it s going to cost you   considerably 
Bloomberg reports that premiums can reach 5  of the annual coverage limits 
Who s willing to take on the risk 
Companies in the insurance sector have recognized that these hacking events offer opportunities to provide their services  Furthermore  there s considerable money to be made in insuring these new fangled cryptos 
Allianz  DE ALVG  is one such insurer that is recognizing the monetary benefits of entering the space  despite the risks  It began offering individual coverage for digital coin theft this year 
To Bloomberg  Allianz spokesperson Christian Weishuber said insurance for cryptocurrency storage will continue to provide big opportunities 
He added 

 Digital assets are becoming more relevant  important and prevalent on the real economy and we are exploring product and coverage options in this area  

In addition to Allianz  there are some larger players that have entered the game  They include AIG  Chubb  NYSE CB   Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and XL Group 
Even the world s oldest insurer  Lloyd s of London  could be getting ready to embrace the business  It reportedly put out a notice for its agents to be on guard when it comes to cryptos 
In a bulletin  its agents have been asked to  proceed with a level of caution that recognizes the risks   Bloomberg reported 
Observers of insurers willing to take on this high risk world note that some of their willingness stems from cryptos being more accepted by the mainstream  As their anxieties wan  clearly it could do the sector some good  as far as helping people become even more accepting of it 
Lastly  it could be just one more thing to help settle some of the space s volatility ",2018-07-20,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/crypto-insurance-business-heating-up-as-hackers-get-savvier-1538002,1538002

17 point underdog  But there was no chest thumping from Allen after the game  He was 15 of 22 passing for 196 yards and a touchdown  but was far from content   There s still a lot of plays I d like to have back from that game  a lot to learn from  a lot to improve on   Allen said  And he refused to call a much discussed leap over linebacker Anthony Barr anything special   There was a guy  Barr  maybe 3 yards in front of the sticks and I knew we needed a first down there and I think we went on to score on that drive  Obviously it was a big play  but it was just another first down   Miami Dolphins  It will be a case of role reversal when the Dolphins meet the Patriots on Sunday in Foxborough  Who would have thought the Patriots would be struggling with a 1 2 record and the Dolphins would be undefeated  Miami coach Adam Gase said it means nothing   I don t look at records right now  It s too early  Nobody cares  I mean  at the end of the day  nobody will give a s    unless you win the last one  You ve got to focus on one week  and that s what we need to do  When we get to that  when we get to Wednesday  we ll worry about them  Right now  our guys are going to get their things corrected from this game  and then  we ll move on to New England when it s time to move on   New England Patriots  Coach Bill Belichick discussed his team s startling loss to Detroit and said New England s rough start correlates to a lack of execution and not effort   We re just not having a lot of success in any area and I think as soon as we start having some you ll see a difference  but it s hard to have it when you re not making enough plays   he said   We re not making enough plays in any phase of the game  so we ve just got to perform better  I think the energy and the effort and all of that    we re trying  Everybody s trying hard  We re just not getting it done  which is all that matters   New York Jets  Could the Jets surround rookie quarterback Sam Darnold with one of the league s brightest talents  According to the New York Daily News  the team has contacted the Steelers to kick the tires about a trade for holdout All Pro Le Veon Bell  The running back has refused to sign his  14 54 million franchise tag tender  and he won t be on the sidelines when the Steelers face the Buccaneers on Monday night  The NFL trade deadline is Oct  30  and the Jets have the cap space of about  17 million now and  90 million plus next season to pay Bell  according to the Daily News  Bilal Powell and Isaiah Crowell currently are manning the position for the Jets  but they re no Bell  In five seasons in Pittsburgh  he has rushed for 5 336 yards and 35 touchdowns  AFC North Baltimore Ravens  Red zone opportunities have become points   specifically  touchdowns   for the Ravens this

defense with the guys that we have out there   Flacco said   I think  Buck  Allen has become one of the real legitimate players in this league   kind of quietly  He s become a top level player   Cincinnati Bengals  There was no update Monday on wide receiver A J  Green s groin injury from head coach Marvin Lewis  Green said Sunday afternoon he did not hear a pop but significant discomfort

Burfict  Burfict returns from a suspension on Oct  1   No panic  No panic   Kirkpatrick said   I haven t seen a team go undefeated since  72  So  I m not panicked   Cleveland Browns  Speculation that teams hit by injury might reach out to the Browns to acquire Tyrod Taylor was shot down by Hue Jackson on Monday  Jackson said the Browns are hopeful Taylor  concussion  is healthy enough to be the No  2 quarterback at Oakland as Baker Mayfield makes his first NFL start  As for Taylor s forgettable performance against the Jets  Jackson said there is plenty of blame to go around   We put him in a tough spot   it wasn t just Tyrod   Worth noting  general manager John Dorsey traded the entire quarterback depth chart he inherited in the off season and continues to seek draft compensation for veteran talent  Most recently  the Browns dealt wide receiver Josh Gordon  a starter in Week 1  to the New England Patriots  AFC South Houston Texans  The club is one of three 0 3 teams in the NFL  and the players feel their poor starts are a big reason   Every game this year we ve started slow and we ve lost three games by 15 points   safety Tyrann Mathieu said   It s not like guys are just blowing us out  We re really beating ourselves   Mathieu said the leadership  passion and intensity must improve  Defensive end J J  Watt sees a lot of inconsistency   We need to start fast  and we need to finish stronger   Watt said   We figure it out for a little while in the middle  and we need to come up with a solution as to why and how we can get it going early and finish stronger at the end   Indianapolis Colts  Rumblings that quarterback Andrew Luck s passing shoulder is still not at full strength picked up Sunday as he averaged 4 1 yards per attempt in the loss to the Philadelphia Eagles  Backup Jacoby Brissett was called on to throw a last second Hail Mary pass    a decision Luck said was proper    as coach Frank Reich wanted to make sure the ball reached the end zone  Reich said he is pleased with Luck s arm strength   What I ve seen is he makes all the throws   Reich said   There s been plenty of throws down the field  in my mind     I ve seen a guy who is extremely accurate  I have no concerns about velocity   Jacksonville Jaguars  Defensive tackle Malik Jackson is ready to contest a lowering of the head penalty he received in Sunday s loss to the Tennessee Titans  The call negated a Jacksonville fumble recovery as the officials determined Jackson used the crown of his helmet to hit Titans quarterback Blaine Gabbert  who sustained a concussion  in the head   I hope once I kind of talk to them about it  they see what I see   Jackson said   If they can t tell me what to do better or different  then I don t think I should be fined      Nobody s dirty on this team  Nobody s going out to try to hurt people or get people out of the game   Tennessee Titans  Marcus Mariota is still experiencing elbow issues  but he will be back in the starting lineup for Sunday s game against the Philadelphia Eagles  Blaine Gabbert is in concussion protocol after being knocked out of last Sunday s game by the Jaguars  and his availability won t be firmed up until later in the week  Mariota is bothered by numbness and tingling in his fingers that is affecting his throwing   It s what he feels like he can handle physically with his recovery  and what the trainers feel like is best for him   Titans coach Mike Vrabel said of Mariota   We ll do what s best for Marcus as he continues to come back  But we ll give him everything he can handle  and he ll tell us what he can handle and what he can t physically   AFC West Denver Broncos  Last week  head coach Vance Joseph said he was disappointed with the Broncos  cornerbacks lack of aggressiveness by allowing easy completions  After Joe Flacco threw for 277 yards on 40 attempts Sunday  Joseph said Monday teams are following the same approach to beat Denver s secondary   It s a blueprint on tape right now the last three weeks    throw it quick   Joseph said   Challenge the DBs and throw it quick and keep Von Miller and Chubb  NYSE CB  and those guys at bay by throwing the football quick   Cornerback Chris Harris Jr  told reporters after the game Sunday that the defense is  making it too easy  on opposing QBs   We gotta move and disguise better   he said   We re not tricking anybody right now  They know exactly what s coming   Kansas City Chiefs  With the offense soaring in a 3 0 start to the season  could the Chiefs look outside the organization to shore up a shaky defense  Reports emerged Sunday about possible interest in trading for Seahawks safety Earl Thomas  while NFL com reported Monday the Chiefs continue to ask Seattle about Thomas   Right now we don t have anything and that s not where we re at   head coach Andy Reid told reporters Monday   I know the rumor is out there  but that s not where we re at   Per NFL com  the Chiefs  interest in Thomas is not related to any concerns over Eric Berry s health  though Berry has yet to play this season while battling a heel injury  Los Angeles Chargers  The team s loss in the  Battle for L A   was discouraging  but one positive was the two touchdown performance from wideout Mike Williams  who beat Marcus Peters for a 42 yard touchdown and added a 20 yarder after halftime  Head coach Anthony Lynn told reporters Monday that he s seen major strides from the 2017 first round pick  who was slow to get going last year due to injury   Last year he wasn t healthy   Lynn said   He didn t practice a lot  he was kinda learning on the run  This year he s more comfortable  he hasn t missed many practices  So he s just been really consistent  I think his confidence right now is at an all time high   Williams leads the team in TD receptions  three  and is second in yards  189  through three weeks  Oakland Raiders  Despite outgaining the Dolphins 434 to 373 and holding the ball for 38 31  the Raiders wound up down 11 points in the fourth quarter before a late field goal narrowed the defeat to 28 20  A major culprit for the defeat was field position  as the Raiders took four special teams penalties and started their average drive at their own 20  including four possessions that began at the Raiders  10 or worse   It s been horrible   head coach Jon Gruden said Monday of the team s field position  It s been the worst in football      It s a credit to our offense  really  for moving the ball out of negative territory  But we have to get more out of our return game and we have to minimize penalties   The Dolphins started their average drive at their own 31  NFC East Dallas Cowboys  Running back Ezekiel Elliott said he is to blame for Sunday s loss to Seattle  He carried the ball 16 times for 127 yards  but he said his errors    a dropped wide open pass  a penalty the nullified a 31 yard touchdown and a fourth quarter fumble    outweighed the good   That loss is on me   he said  via the team s official website   I had a poor performance today  Did well in the run game  But overall  I dropped the ball   Of the fumble  he said   When you ve got that ball in your hand  that s the team in your hand  Me being a leader on the team  me being a better player on this team  I ve got to do a better job taking care of the ball  That cost us the game   New York Giants  It s amazing the difference a win can make  The Giants had love and smiles all around in the locker room after their 27 22 win over Houston on Sunday    their first victory of the season  Head coach Pat Shurmur started off the postgame celebration by praising his team   I ve always known you re tough  I ve always known you re gritty   Shurmur said   And now we made enough plays through the course of the game to beat a pretty good football team  And this feeling that we have  it s got to be this weird drug you can t get enough of    because that s why we do this thing   Shurmur followed by presenting the first game ball to general manager Dave Gettleman  captain Eli Manning presented Shurmur with one of his own  Philadelphia Eagles  Coach Doug Pederson finally got his starting quarterback  Carson Wentz  back from injury  Now  Pederson said Wentz s top target could be back soon  The coach said Monday afternoon that wide receiver Alshon Jeffery hasn t been cleared for contact but that his shoulder injury is improving and he is getting closer to a return  He added that running backs Jay Ajayi  back  and Darren Sproles  hamstring  are day to day and should practice this week  Pederson said the offense isn t operating at full speed yet   But it s OK because defense and special teams kind of carry the load early in the season  and our offense kind of plays catch up just a little bit   he said   And when the offense catches its stride  then you ve got a good thing going   Washington Redskins  Members of the Redskins  defense felt good about their effort in their 31 17 victory over Green Bay on Sunday   We re not here to play games  man   safety D J  Swearinger Sr  said   This is not your old Redskins that  you know  is something to laugh at   The Redskins held the Packers to 100 yards rushing and 340 yards on 66 plays  Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers  who has a lingering knee injury  completed 27 of 44 passes   Yeah  he s not  100 percent   But  he s still Aaron Rodgers   cornerback Josh Norman said   His 60 or whatever percent he is  65 percent  is still better than  out of the quarterbacks there s 32 in the league  I d say 30   NFC North Chicago Bears  Down 14 0 at Arizona  Bears head coach Matt Nagy said there was no finger pointing on offense or defense  which was his highlight takeaway from the 16 14 win  Upon review of the game film  Nagy said quarterback Mitchell Trubisky was more willing to attack deep  But when the field shrinks in the red zone  Nagy came away frustrated   Red zone wise wasn t good enough  We need to be better in the red zone   Nagy said   We need to get to the point we re putting touchdowns up and not field goals   Nagy said when Trubisky threw the ball on time  the Bears were  unstoppable   Detroit Lions  Quarterback Matthew Stafford bumped head coach Matt Patricia from the podium in the postgame locker room and awarded the first year Lions coach with the game ball after beating the New England Patriots  Patricia deflected the emotional gravity of the win and of receiving the game ball  His players did not   It was great   receiver Marvin Jones said   We were jumping up and down  It was just a great moment because we know how hard him and all the coaches worked to prepare the game plan and  us to just go out and execute it  It was big for him  And you could see it in his face   Green Bay Packers  While the NFL is using the Clay Matthews Kirk Cousins hit to educate referees  the Packers are asking the league for language to instruct the players on what constitutes a legal hit on quarterbacks  Matthews has been flagged for roughing the passer in each of the first three games   You ve got to make sure you look at all the variables when you are applying definition to an emphasis   McCarthy said Monday   For the officials to apply it to the play in the game  they have to have indicators   McCarthy  who came unhinged when Matthews was flagged at Washington on Sunday  said his animated explosion on the sideline was a direct correlation to a conversation he had with his own quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  Minnesota Vikings  As Buffalo left town having controlled the Vikings with its front seven  attention shifts to the star studded Rams and a matchup on Thursday night   Moving forward  definitely we have a lot to prove   center Brett Jones said   This Thursday night game is a good chance for us to prove that   Jones said the time change playing in Los Angeles and on a Thursday night is a double whammy   Everything is just crammed in there   Jones said  NFC South Atlanta Falcons  Safety Ricardo Allen suffered a season ending torn Achilles tendon during Sunday s loss to New Orleans  joining safety Keanu Neal  season ending ACL tear  and middle linebacker Deion Jones  foot surgery  as key defenders hurt through the first three games  Atlanta coach Dan Quinn said the team will look for a backup safety but strongly believes in Damontae Kazee as a starter with Jordan Richards possibly lining alongside him  The Falcons also are hoping for progress from injured defensive ends Takkarist McKinley  groin  and Derrick Shelby  groin  as well as running back Devonta Freeman  knee    I would say probably Takk is the closest   Quinn said   And then with Devonta and Derrick  we ll get them better steps through the week   Carolina Panthers  Quarterback Cam Newton has thrown five touchdown passes over the past two games and is completing 67 4 percent of his passes on the season  He also has been intercepted just once  and Panthers coach Ron Rivera likes what he is seeing   Very consistent is a good word for it   Rivera said   His play has truly matured  and by that I mean he s learning to take what s being given  In the past he may have tried to force some things downfield  He was a little high early in the game  Sunday   and once he kind of got the ball down and went through his reads quickly  he was getting the ball where it needed to be  He was very efficient that way   New Orleans Saints  Quarterback Drew Brees is the new record holder with 6 326 completions    he passed Brett Favre  6 300  during Sunday s game against Atlanta    and also is just 417 yards shy of matching Peyton Manning s all time yardage mark of 71 940 passing yards   I hope there s a lot more coming  but I just think about all of the people that had a hand in that   Brees said of the completions mark   A lot of hands have caught those passes  and a lot of guys have blocked to make those happen  They all are a part of this  absolutely   Brees has a league most 104 completions this season with receiver Michael Thomas making an NFL leading 38 catches and running back Alvin Kamara ranking third with 30  NFC West Arizona Cardinals  It might have seemed odd that the Cardinals had rookie quarterback Josh Rosen make his debut late in the fourth quarter while needing a game winning field goal drive  but that s not how coach Steve Wilks saw it   It looked like Josh was thrown in the end  but he wasn t   Wilks said  adding that he would have put Rosen in sooner if the Bears  previous drive hadn t taken nearly seven minutes   He can handle those types of situations  I think he handled it well  He went in  commanded the huddle  did a great job of moving the ball  We just  as an offense in the end  didn t work well together   Wilks named Rosen his Week 4 starter on Monday  while lauding the youngster s approach   His demeanor is what you want at that position   Wilks said   I don t think it s too big for him  Los Angeles Rams  The Rams  specialists are well known  as kicker Greg Zuerlein  punter Johnny Hekker and returner Pharoh Cooper  currently on injured reserve  each were first team All Pro last year  But don t forget about linebacker Cory Littleton  who might be the NFL s best punt blocking specialist  After stuffing Chargers punter Drew Kaser in the end zone Sunday    which Blake Countess recovered for a touchdown    Littleton has three blocked punts since the start of 2017   Basically  with any blocked punt  you just have to believe in the plan and hope everything works   Littleton said   Trust in it  I believe in it and launched out and got the block   San Francisco 49ers  With Jimmy Garoppolo lost for the season with a torn ACL  the 49ers will turn to C J  Beathard  who coach Kyle Shanahan has plenty of confidence in   C J  is a gamer   Shanahan said after Sunday s game   Everyone in here has a ton of respect for C J  and how he handles himself  He is a man out there and he is a very good quarterback  We are fortunate to have him   As important as Beathard s play will be  Shanahan expects him to play a big role as a leader  too   Keep these guys together  keep leading them   Shanahan said      It is just a matter of our psyche and keeping everyone in it on the next week and staying positive   
Seattle Seahawks  After running the ball a total of 38 times through two weeks  the Seahawks pounded the ball repeatedly on Sunday against the Cowboys  racking up 39 carries  Coach Pete Carroll indicated afterward that he wants that approach to define Seattle s offense moving forward   We talked about it all week  we ve been talking about it for some time   Carroll said   I was really disappointed that we didn t come into the season in that mode     This is where we want to be  so we ve righted it hopefully  It won t mean anything unless we come back and do it next week   The Seahawks  efficiency on the ground  however  could use some work  as they averaged just 2 9 yards per carry  including 3 2 for starter Chris Carson    Field Level Media",2018-09-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/flm-all-32-teambyteam-nfl-notes-1622054,1622054

in a wide ranging ESPN interview last week  Beckham s critique drew the ire of ownership  and John Mara said publicly he needs  less talk  more play  from the newly minted Beckham  On Friday  Beckham said he has not yet talked to Mara and did not confirm he was fined by the team as ESPN reported this week    The Arizona Cardinals fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and promoted quarterbacks coach Byron Leftwich to the play caller position  The move comes hours after a 45 10 loss to the Denver Broncos on Thursday night  which dropped the Cardinals to 1 6 on the season  The Cardinals are

Friday  One sign of the Chargers  confidence that Gordon will play  He wasn t given a status designation  such as questionable  Lynn said Gordon s shortened practice was more likely due to symptoms of dehydration rather than the hamstring    The Washington Redskins listed running back Adrian Peterson as questionable with a shoulder injury  but he is expected to play against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday  Peterson said he feels much better than he did last week  when he labored through pregame preparations and rushed for 97 yards on 17 carries against the Carolina Panthers  Peterson  who has

commercial insurance lines should witness rate increase   This should help them sustain underwriting profitability despite claims stemming from catastrophes  Also  occurrence of natural disasters might lead to an accelerated rate of policy renewals and more new policy writings driving premiums higher Though the Fed had announced its intention of not raising interest rate in 2019 citing economic slowdown  a better rate environment than before should support investment results  The interest rate currently stands at 2 50   up from the near zero level at the time of the financial crisis in 2008 A sturdy capital level widens scope for more capital deployment to pursue growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders via dividend hikes  special dividends and share buybacks Increasing

132071,353586,CB,Allstate  ALL  Expects To Incur Catastrophe Loss In May,opinion,"The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   expects to incur  473 million pre tax   374 million after tax  catastrophe loss for May 2019  The same can be attributed to seven weather related events at an estimated cost of  504 million  pre tax  which is partially offset by favorable reserve re estimates of prior reported catastrophe losses 
For the month of April  the company expects  290 million  pre tax   229 million after tax   bringing estimated catastrophe losses for the second quarter months of April and May 2019 to  763 million  pre tax   603 million after tax  
Being a relatively large property insurance business  Allstate is significantly exposed to catastrophic events  Natural calamity oriented losses for the past many years have weighed on the company s claims and benefits plus expenses and cash flow  thereby draining its underwriting profitability 
In 2016 and 2017  the company s catastrophe loss increased 51  and 26   respectively  year over year  The company  however  further incurred catastrophe loss of  2 6 billion in 2018 which was down 11 7  year over year 
Other companies in the property and casualty space  such as W R  Berkley Corp    NYSE WRB    Chubb Ltd    NYSE CB   and Everest Re Group  Ltd    NYSE RE   also remain exposed to catastrophe losses  owing to their property and casualty businesses 
Allstate s weather related losses have caused historically induced volatility to its results  To address the same  the company is focused on reducing losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs along with limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets via premium hikes  This  in turn  might cause a decline in the number of policies in force  However  we cannot rule out the possibility of massive losses suffered due to cat events and inclement weather incidents 
Despite the cat loss  our confidence in the company s ability to deliver impressive result remains intact  Increasing premiums in property and casualty businesses  an improving auto business  growing net investment income  a low tax rate and a strong balance sheet should act as key catalysts for earnings growth 
Year to date  shares of the company have gained 25   wider than the  s rally of 5

132072,353587,CB,Why Chubb  CB  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Chubb  NYSE CB   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 34  
For the most recent quarter  Chubb was expected to post earnings of  2 49 per share  but it reported  2 54 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 01   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 93 per share  while it actually produced  2 02 per share  a surprise of 4 66  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Chubb  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Chubb currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 67   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 23  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-chubb-cb-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200438481,200438481

132074,353589,CB,Chubb  CB  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Chubb  NYSE CB  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 7  
Revenues are expected to be  8 01 billion  down 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 01  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chubb 
For Chubb  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Chubb will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Chubb would post earnings of  2 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 54  delivering a surprise of  2 01  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Chubb appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chubb-cb-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200440213,200440213

132109,353624,CB,Crypto Heist Insurance Is the Hot New Play in Bitcoin Wild West,news," Bloomberg     In the staid and buttoned up world of insurance underwriting  few want to talk about it  You won t find many ads promoting it or details on company websites offering it 
But according to industry insiders  there s a hot new business that more and more firms are looking to get into  crypto insurance 
It s understandable why big names like AIG  Chubb  NYSE CB  and XL Group haven t provided too many specifics  On its face  providing coverage to crypto startups might seem borderline absurd  It s an industry with a well deserved reputation for being like the Wild West    an unregulated digital frontier where frauds and heists are rife  recall the hacks of Mt  Gox  and more recently  Bitfinex and Coincheck  and get rich quick schemes abound  The collapse in the price of Bitcoin this year hasn t helped matters either 
But as cryptocurrencies  and their underlying blockchain technology  slowly gain broader acceptance  some insurers are betting they can avoid the pitfalls  The premiums from insuring such risk can be substantial  By some accounts  underwriters can charge a crypto related company upwards of five times or more than your average business for coverage against loss or theft 
 Big Opportunity 
 Insurance for cryptocurrency storage will be a big opportunity   said Christian Weishuber  a spokesman for Allianz  DE ALVG   which began offering individual coverage for digital coin theft in the past year and is one of the few insurers that agreed to talk about the issue   Digital assets are becoming more relevant  important and prevalent on the real economy and we are exploring product and coverage options in this area  
While the cost is still beyond reach for many fledgling companies  Marsh   McLennan and Aon  the two leading insurance brokers that help companies shop for crypto policies  say business has been brisk this year  For the first time  Marsh formed a team of 10 dedicated to servicing blockchain startups 
Aon  which claims to have over 50 percent of the market for crypto insurance  recently streamlined its standard policy form to speed up the underwriting process  It has also seen some insurers tweak general company policies to include crypto specific protections 
Marsh and Aon declined to identify their partners  but people familiar with the matter say over a dozen underwriters  including Chubb and XL  currently provide coverage to crypto related businesses  American International Group  NYSE AIG   which has also been adding crypto coverage into standard policy forms  said it s met with cryptocurrency custodians and trading platforms about coverage  The firm declined to say how much in crypto related premiums it s taken in 
Few Details
XL said it is  being careful when looking at those risks and analyzing them on a case by case basis   without getting into specifics  Chubb said in a statement that it doesn t pursue the underwriting of insurance for  cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets   but declined to provide details on whether it offers coverage for other types of crypto ventures 
So far  Marsh and Aon say they aren t aware of any insurer that s had to pay out crypto policy claims    in spite of the spate of headlines about hacks and thefts in recent months 
With 2018 on track to be the busiest year for hacks on record  the potential for a reputational black eye is perhaps one reason many insurers have declined to speak publicly about crypto  Lloyd s of London  the world s oldest insurance market  published a bulletin this month with guidance on crypto coverage and asked its agents to  proceed with a level of caution that recognizes the risks  
Big Shift
What s more  there s also the worry some startups will overstate the amount of crypto insurance they have 
 Quite honestly  it s something insurers are aware of and cautious about too   said Jackie Quintal  Aon s practice leader for financial institutions   They don t want an advertisement to say   We are insured with ABC insurance company  and for it to be inaccurate or misleading  It s definitely a concern  
Privately though  potential clients have noticed a shift 
BitGo  a cryptocurrency services provider  met with roughly 75 insurers during a May trip that included stopovers in New York  London and Bermuda  Back in 2015  the company became one of the first to get crypto insurance  only to drop coverage a year later because of the expense  says Chief Executive Officer Mike Belshe 
 They aren t just kicking the tires   he said   They are asking very specific questions so they can assess the risks  
Inevitable Haircut
A growing number of crypto startups see insurance as a must have 
Based on conversations with several brokers and industry experts  crypto companies typically seek out crime and cyber coverage  as well as policies known as directors and officers insurance  which covers losses the arise from legal actions against executives or board members  They can end up paying up premiums as high as 5 percent of their coverage limits each year 
Those looking for larger amounts of coverage often need as many as a dozen underwriters  with each offering  5 million to  15 million of insurance  according to a person familiar with the matter  The practice ensures no single insurer is ever on the hook for too much when disaster strikes 
 To somebody that has just raised a meaningful amount for a project of their dreams  taking a haircut to avoid a disaster is only natural   said Lex Sokolin  global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research 
Techno Utopian Dreams
It s no small irony that the crypto industry  which originally sprung out of a techno utopian desire to liberate its users from the traditional financial system  is embracing insurance as a way to go mainstream 
 I see it is a required step   said Lucas Nuzzi  director of technology research at Digital Asset Research  Coverage can reduce investor concerns and make it easier to work with banks   It definitely helps legitimize the industry  
For example  Trustology  a London based startup focused on crypto custody services  is in talks to obtain coverage that would insure its customer accounts up to 85 000 pounds    the same standard as a U K  bank account    to help attract more clients  It s also looking at self insuring client funds 
Still  nothing is perfect  Many young startups still can t afford the costly premiums  Policies can still take months to get approved  And exclusions can add up fast  For example  while losses from an interruption of service may be covered  the theft of cryptocurrency that caused it might not 
 Close to Useless 
The number of exclusions  can make the whole policy close to useless   said Hillik Nissani  chief operating officer of Cryptalgo  a startup that helps institutional traders execute orders  Nissani said his company is currently looking to buy insurance or potentially self insuring 
Another sticking point is that coverage amounts often fall short of the sums that could potentially be lost 
Coinbase  one of the most widely used crypto exchanges  buys insurance for a fraction of the digital coins it holds  Funds stored in so called hot wallets  which may contain up to 2 percent of client assets and are used in active trading  are covered  Coinbase s disclosures don t provide details on how much coverage is provided for its remaining coin deposits  which are stored offline as a security measure 
And as the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly and trading becomes more widespread  insurance that once fully covered a company s assets can come up short as they balloon  That s what happened to crypto finance firm Circle Internet Financial  which holds billions of dollars of assets for its customers  according to CEO Jeremy Allaire 
True Believer
Marsh s Greg Spore says the insurance industry is simply trying to be prudent when it comes to crypto 
 It s a new technology  it s evolving quickly   said Spore  the U S  financial products placement leader   There are security risks  That s a big concern  
But Spore himself  who s been with Marsh for two decades  is also a crypto believer  which doesn t hurt when you re in the crypto insurance business

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Notably  Chubb has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-03-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-chubb-cb-up-26-since-last-earnings-report-200395509,200395509
132112,353627,CB,Chubb  CB  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Chubb  NYSE CB  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 8  
Revenues are expected to be  7 60 billion  down 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chubb 
For Chubb  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 40  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chubb will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Chubb would post earnings of  1 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 02  delivering a surprise of  4 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Chubb doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chubb-cb-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200409576,200409576
132113,353628,CB,Allstate  ALL  Expects To Incur Catastrophe Loss For April,opinion,"The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   expects to incur  290 million pre tax   229 million after tax  catastrophe loss for April 2019  The same can be attributed to seven weather related events at an estimated cost of  259 million  pre tax  Rest of the loss pertains to unfavorable reserve re estimates of prior reported catastrophe loss 
Being a relatively large property insurance business  Allstate is significantly exposed to catastrophic events  Natural calamity oriented losses for the past many years have weighed on the company s claims and benefits plus expenses and cash flow  thereby draining its underwriting profitability 
In 2016 and 2017  cat loss increased 51  and 26   respectively  year over year  The company  however  further incurred catastrophe loss of  2 6 billion in 2018 which was down 11 7  year over year 
Other companies in the property and casualty space such as W R  Berkley Corp    NYSE WRB    Chubb Ltd    NYSE CB   and Everest Re Group  Ltd    NYSE RE   also remain exposed to catastrophe losses 
Thus  the company is focused on reducing losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs along with limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets via premium hikes  This  in turn  might cause a decline in the number of policies in force  However  we cannot rule out the possibility of massive losses the company might face due to cat events and inclement weather incidents 
Despite the cat loss  our confidence in the company s ability to deliver impressive result remains intact  Increasing premiums in property and casualty business  an improving auto business  growing net investment income  a low tax rate and a strong balance sheet act as key catalysts for earnings growth 
Year to date  shares of the company have gained 16   wider than the  s growth of 2 7  

 
Allstate carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

132114,353629,CB,Chubb Stock Unlocking The Trend ,opinion,"For longer term stock investors  Chubb  NYSE CB  is now one stock unlocking the bullish trend and likely to develop momentum as it does so for several reasons 
First this is yet another stock which has bucked the recent move lower in the primary indices  maintaining its price around the  144 area  and as such is likely to perform well  as the primary markets recover and pick up bullish sentiment once more  In addition  the recent weekly sideways price action has also developed a strong level of potential support in the  145 area with the stock now trading at  146 39 at time of writing 
Second and equally important  we are now moving firmly away from the volume point of control as shown with the yellow dashed line  and where the heaviest concentration of volume sits  Until recently  this was the fulcrum of the market where price had been in agreement  Now bullish sentiment prevails driving the price higher  Furthermore  once we approach  148 per share and beyond  volume on the histogram falls away which should allow the stock to drive through this area and on towards  156 and higher in the longer term 
Volume remains supportive and with only minor resistance ahead at  147 20  and with the trend monitor indicator remaining firmly blue  this stock looks set to continue higher  Last time around EPS of  2 54 comfortably beat market forecasts of  2 49 helping to provide further positive momentum for the stock ",2019-05-22,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chubb-unlocking-the-trend-200423688,200423688

132180,353695,CB,Insurers gingerly test bitcoin business with heist policies,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn NEW YORK Reuters    Major global insurers are starting to offer protection against cryptocurrency theft  willing to tackle daunting challenges it brings rather than miss out on this volatile and loosely regulated  but rapidly growing business  So far only a few insurers sell such insurance  including XL Catlin  Chubb  NYSE CB   and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance   Yet several others told Reuters they are looking into theft coverage for companies that handle digital currencies like bitcoin and ether  which trade between anonymous parties  Such efforts so far have garnered little attention  but the emergence of an insurance market marks an important step for the nascent industry s mainstream recognition  The risks are clear  digital currency investors have already lost billions from dozens of cryptocurrency hacks  technical errors and fraud  Many hacked exchanges later shuttered  On Friday  Tokyo based exchange Coincheck became the latest casualty  reporting a loss of around  534 million worth of coins to hackers   For insurers the challenge is how to cover those risks for customers they know little about  who use technology few understand and represent a young industry that lacks troves of data insurers usually rely on in designing and pricing coverage  Christopher Liu  who heads American International Group  NYSE AIG  Inc s North American cyber insurance practice for financial institutions  said the answer is to find an established business with a similar risk profile and try to adapt what works there   It s sort of akin to a digital armored car service   he said about cryptocurrency firms   If there is a problem   like an accident or a robbery   that s going to be the accumulation of all these exposures   Liu says AIG began researching cryptocurrency theft coverage in 2014 and has written a few such policies  but remains in an  exploratory phase    Greg Bangs  head of XL Catlin s North America crime coverage underwriting recounts how the firm had to become its own expert on the new technology by talking to key players and potential clients before developing bitcoin theft insurance    The first challenge for us was to figure out if there was a product here   XL Catlin now offers annual crime coverage of up to  25 million per incident  Bangs said  SHADY COMPANIES Knowing the customer also takes on special importance  Jackie Quintal  who advises financial institutions for insurance broker Aon Plc  said part of her job is to tell legitimate digital currency companies from shady ones  something that often gets cleared up even before an insurer gets involved   If someone is hesitant to provide information and they don t have answers to compliance questions  they tend to disappear on their own   she said   Still  insurers spend more time than usual scrutinizing everything from security and storage procedures  the scale of their operations  to the people involved   a process that can take several months   Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets weren t anticipating the level of underwriting and due diligence that they undergo when they approach the market   said Matt Prevost  who heads Chubb s North American Cyber Product Line  Insurers like Chubb are betting that cryptocurrencies will gain wider recognition even if the new business now represents only a tiny sliver of the global  720 billion per year commercial insurance business   Digital coin sales raised more than  5 billion across nearly 800 deals in 2017  according to venture capital data provider CB Insights  There are no estimates yet how much of that has been insured or of total premiums collected  COOL ON  HOT STORAGE   Many insurers remain wary of the new business  Some  like Great American Insurance Group  an American Financial Group Inc unit  offer protection from employee theft to companies that accept bitcoin payments  but avoid outside risks  such as hacking  The company added the coverage to its standard employee theft policy in 2014  Others will avoid coverage for coins kept online  or in  hot storage   because of high risk of hacking and will only cover offline  cold storage   which is also generally preferred by cryptocurrency companies   Graphic   Coinbase  a leading cryptocurrency exchange available in 32 countries  says on its website it holds less than 2 percent of customer funds online and that those funds are insured  Lloyd s of London  the world s largest insurance marketplace  was providing insurance to the exchange  according to a person familiar with the matter  Reuters could not determine the terms or the scope of the coverage and a Lloyd s spokesman declined to discuss Coinbase   He said that member companies have written a small number of policies for cryptocurrencies in recent years and Lloyd s was requiring members to proceed with caution and use additional scrutiny of cryptocurrency companies  Some insurers are not yet convinced the cryptocurrency business is large enough for premiums to cover possible losses   We re looking at it  but does it make sense to offer a market for that   said Frank Scheckton  President of Great American s Fidelity Crime Division  Right now  costs act as a deterrent for small firms and startups  said Ty Sagalow  chief executive of Innovation Insurance Group LLC  which has been developing coverage for cryptocurrency companies since 2013   It s an expensive product that many companies can t afford   he said   Annual premiums for  10 million in theft coverage would typically run at about  200 000  or 2 percent of the limit  insurance experts say  That compares with about 1 percent or less for traditional financial clients  depending on the company  loss history and other factors  Currency volatility is another concern  While coverage limits shield insurers from wild swings  the impact for clients can be dramatic  For example  a  10 million policy signed in January 2017 would cover 10 957 bitcoins at the time  but only 923 if a hack happened a year later  Cameron Winklevoss  co founder of Gemini  a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian  argues insurance should not be an investor s primary concern  As a registered New York trust company  Gemini carries state mandated insurance against employee theft  computer fraud  and fund transfer fraud  but has no coverage for hacking  Winklevoss  who founded the firm with his twin brother Tyler  said    The key is to look for regulatory oversight that ensures that an exchange is doing what it should be doing so that it doesn t get to the point where you have to fall back on an insurance policy   he told Reuters  However  Henry Sanderson  who oversees cyber and technology coverage for Safeonline LLP  a Lloyd s broker  argues cryptocurrency insurance can help the young industry mature while creating new business for insurers  
This whole space is maturing and growing   he said   If we don t embrace it now  it s a missed opportunity for insurers  ",2018-02-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/insurers-gingerly-test-bitcoin-business-with-heist-policies-1180130,1180130

132184,353699,CB,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Chubb  CB ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Chubb  NYSE CB   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 67  
For the last reported quarter  Chubb came out with earnings of  2 41 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 33 per share  representing a surprise of 3 43   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 63 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 68 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 90  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Chubb lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Chubb has an Earnings ESP of  0 18  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 5  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-chubb-cb-200374863,200374863

132188,353703,CB,Everest Re  RE  Estimates  695M Of Catastrophe Loss In Q4,opinion,Everest Re Group  Ltd    NYSE RE   recently released catastrophe loss estimates totaling  695 million  net of reinsurance  reinstatement premiums and taxes  The loss primarily stemmed from Hurricane Michael  which affected Florida and other states in the Southeastern region of the United States as well as California wildfires  occurring in November 2018  Also  the hailstorm occurring in Australia in last December contributed to the cat loss estimate  The insurer s fourth quarter results will likely be hit by these losses It is important to note here that the property and casualty  P C  insurer s reinsurance operations are mainly responsible for the aforementioned impact  Everest Re relies on the loss reported from ceding insurers across many underlying insurance policies Everest Re s status as a P C insurer has made it fairly susceptible to losses from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other weather oriented events  This in turn render volatility to its underwriting results In the first nine months of 2018  this P C insurer suffered catastrophe losses of nearly  837 million  noticeably lower than  1 4 billion incurred in the same period of 2017  However  with the incident of Hurricane Michael  California wildfires and other weather related occurrences  the insurer s fourth quarter results might be adversely impacted Everest Re expects industry losses from the aforementioned cat events to be around  30 billion On Dec 6  2018  catastrophe risk modelling firm AIR Worldwide predicted industry insured losses from Camp Fire in Northern California along with Woolsey fire in Southern  NYSE SO  California to range between  9 billion and  13 billion  With respect to losses emerging from Hurricane Michael  last December  reinsurance giant Munich Re envisioned the same totaling  10 billion   Everest Re has an  of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which lowers the predictive power of ESP  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Everest Re is likely to beat on earnings when it releases results on Feb 11  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 is currently pegged at a loss of  1 20 per share against the year ago quarter s delivered earnings of  13 48  We expect this consensus mark to move south as analysts incorporate the cat loss impact Shares of Everest Re have lost 5 9  in a year s time  narrower than the  s decline of 8 8   Other insurers have also come up with their cat loss estimates that might impact fourth quarter underwriting profitability  Recently  Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   issued net catastrophe loss estimates of about  585 million pretax or  505 million after tax  net of reinsurance including reinstatement premiums  stemming from Hurricane Michael  California wildfires and other worldwide weather related events Earlier Arch Capital Group Ltd    NASDAQ ACGL   initiated pre tax gross catastrophe loss estimates of  110  130 million  ensued from Hurricane Michael and the California wildfire  With respect to California wildfires  Mercury General Corporation   NYSE MCY   previously gave pre tax gross catastrophe loss estimate of  253 million  originating from Camp Fire and Woolsey Fire You can see  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/everest-re-re-estimates-695m-of-catastrophe-loss-in-q4-200379491,200379491
132189,353704,CB,Analysts Estimate Chubb  CB  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Chubb  NYSE CB  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 93 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  39 1  
Revenues are expected to be  7 72 billion  down 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 49  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chubb 
For Chubb  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chubb will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Chubb would post earnings of  2 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 41  delivering a surprise of  3 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

battered capital spoke on Friday of thirsty children drinking from creeks  A woman with diabetes said a lack of refrigeration had spoiled her insulin  An insurance adjuster said roads have virtually vanished on parts of the island  In enumerable ways large and small  many of the 3 4 million inhabitants of Puerto Rico struggled through a 10th day with little or no access to basic necessities   from electricity and clean  running water to communications  food and medicine  Carmen Yulin Cruz  mayor of Puerto Rico s capital  San Juan  gave voice to rising anger on the U S  island territory as she delivered a sharp retort on Friday to comments from a top Trump administration official who said the federal relief effort was a  a good news story     Damn it  this is not a good news story   Cruz told CNN   This is a people are dying story  This is a life or death story   Acting U S  Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke  head of the parent department for the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   said on Thursday she was satisfied with the disaster response so far   I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane   Duke said  Paying a visit to Puerto Rico on Friday for an aerial tour of the island with Governor Ricardo Rossello  Duke moderated her message  telling reporters she was proud of the recovery work but adding that she and President Donald Trump would not be satisfied until the territory was fully functional   Maria  the most powerful storm to strike Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years  has killed at least 16 people on the island  according to the official death toll  More than 30 deaths have been attributed to the storm across the Caribbean  Rossello has called the widespread heavy damage to Puerto Rico s homes  roads and infrastructure unprecedented  though he has praised the U S  government s relief efforts  Cruz  appearing in a later interview  bristled at suggestions that the relief effort had been well coordinated    There is a disconnect between what the FEMA people are saying is happening and what the mayors and the people in the towns know that is happening   Cruz  who has been living in a shelter since her own home was flooded  said on CNN   Wearing a T shirt emblazoned with the words   Help us  We are dying   Cruz said she was hopeful the situation would improve  but added   People can t fathom what it is to have children drinking from creeks  to have people in nursing homes without oxygen     WE ARE ALONE  The mayor of San Germ n  a town of about 35 000 in the southwestern corner of the island  echoed Cruz s harsh words   The governor is giving a message that everything is resolved  and it is not true   Mayor Isidro Negron Irizarry said in Spanish on Twitter   There is no functional operations structure  We are alone   Trump  who was scheduled to visit next week  addressed the situation before a speech in Washington about his new tax plan    The electrical grid and other infrastructure were already in very  very poor shape   he said   And now virtually everything has been wiped out  and we will have to really start all over again  We re literally starting from scratch    Colonel James DeLapp  the Army Corps of Engineers commander for Puerto Rico  told CNN that rebuilding the island s crippled power grid was a massive undertaking   The closest thing we ve had is when the Army Corps led the effort to restore Iraq s electricity in the early stages of the Iraq war in 2003 and 2004   he said   Further complicating recovery is a financial crisis marked by Puerto Rico s record bankruptcy filing in May and the weight of  72 billion in outstanding debt   Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort  which will end up being one of the biggest ever  will be funded and organized  and what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island   Trump said    ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES  In Old San Juan  the capital s historic colonial section  customers lined up on the sidewalk outside

territory is back on its feet  the senior U S  general appointed to lead military relief operations said on Friday   We re certainly bringing in more   Lieutenant General Jeffrey Buchanan told CNN on Friday  a day after he was appointed by the Pentagon  The hardships on Puerto Rico have largely overshadowed similar struggles faced by the neighboring U S  Virgin Islands  slammed by two major hurricanes   Irma and Maria   in the span of a month  Most of St  Croix  the largest of the three major islands in that territory  remained without electricity and cellular communications nine days after Maria struck  Shelters were still packed and long lines stretched around emergency supply centers  At one such facility  anguished residents pleaded for more than the single sheets of plastic tarp that National Guard troops were handing out  Meanwhile  the insurance industry was tallying the mounting costs of Maria  with one modeling firm estimating that claims could total as much as  85 billion   Rossello told CNN on Friday the federal government has responded to his requests and that he was in regular contact with FEMA s director  though more needed to be done   We do have severe logistical limitations  It has been enhancing  but it s still nowhere near where it needs to be   Rossello said

132278,353793,CB,Insurers shun risk as oil linked quakes soar in Oklahoma ,news,"By Luc Cohen OKLAHOMA CITY  Reuters    As the number of earthquakes in Oklahoma exploded into the hundreds in the last few years  nearly a dozen insurance companies moved to limit their exposure  often at the expense of homeowners  a Reuters examination has found   Nearly 3 000 pages of documents from the Oklahoma Insurance Commission reviewed by Reuters show that insurers and the reinsurers who cover them grew increasingly concerned about exposure to earthquake risks because of heightened frequency of seismic activity  which scientists link to disposal of saltwater that is a byproduct of oil and gas production  Even as they insured more and more properties against earthquakes in the past two years  six insurers hiked premiums by as much as 260 percent and three increased deductibles  Three companies stopped writing new earthquake insurance altogether  state regulatory filings obtained by Reuters show  Several insurers took more than one of those steps   In addition  the insurers would consider suing oil and gas companies for reimbursement in instances where they would have to pay damages to homeowners  according to several sources  including two insurance company officials  So far Oklahoma s biggest earthquake was a 5 6 magnitude temblor in Prague in 2011 that buckled road pavement and damaged dozens of homes   However  the push to limit earthquake exposure reflects insurers  fear that the surge in small quakes is a portent of a  big one  in coming years  given the relationship between the magnitude and a total number of earthquakes in a certain area  The filings show many insurers explicitly stated they were concerned about exposure to earthquake risk  In late March  the U S  Geological Survey  USGS  warned that 7 million Americans were at risk of so called induced seismicity   The warning further heightened insurers  and reinsurers  concerns  Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doak said   Because earthquakes were rare in Oklahoma before shale oil and gas production soared in the past decade  very few residents carried earthquake insurance back then  OIL  WATER AND QUAKES That has changed as the number of quakes of magnitude 3 0 and higher recorded in the state soared from a handful in 2008 to 103 in 2013 and 890 last year  according to USGS  The value of coverage  usually offered as an add on to standard homeowners  policy  also spiked to  19 million in 2015 from less than  5 million in 2009  according to the Insurance Information Institute  a trade group  Scientists link the quakes to the injection of wastewater generated from the oil and gas production process deep underground  Volumes of so called  produced water  have ballooned as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  boosted output in Oklahoma  Monthly injection volumes in Oklahoma doubled between 1997 and 2013  according to a 2015 Stanford University study   The Oklahoma Oil   Gas Association has said state regulators  efforts to work with producers to limit the amount of wastewater injected would reduce seismicity   So far  relatively few homeowners have filed claims  in part because the damages were not big enough to exceed the deductibles  Some who did say they had trouble getting compensation  Julie Allison said the cumulative effects of the 39 earthquakes of magnitude 3 0 and above that had struck within two miles of her home in Edmond  Oklahoma  had caused  70 000 80 000 in damages  but Farmers Insurance denied her claim in April    They did not deny that we had damage   Allison said  The insurance company  however  blamed it on ground erosion and settlement  she said  Farmers said it relied on outside engineering experts for the assessment and that the Allisons have accepted the company s offer to pay for a second opinion by an expert of their choice  HIGHER EXPOSURE For some insurers and reinsurers the risks have proven too big  Responding to the pull back and premium hikes Oklahoma s Insurance Commission has scheduled a  fact finding hearing  in late May  Doak said   Travelers Insurance Company  N TRV   the sixth largest provider of earthquake insurance in the state  stopped allowing existing policyholders to add earthquake coverage in November 2014  In a filing  it said it was making the change  to manage our exposure to earthquake in the state    The Hartford stopped writing earthquake insurance in Oklahoma in late 2014  Oklahoma Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company removed earthquake coverage from their existing homeowner policies in February 2011  filings show  The Oklahoma Farm Bureau said it made a  business decision  to remove coverage in 2010  Travelers declined to comment beyond its filing  Hartford declined to comment  Other companies raised deductibles or premiums  Andrew Walter  manager of underwriting research and development at Country Mutual Insurance Company  which raised its deductible last year  said the step aimed to  protect our financial strength in case of a large scale earthquake in the state   Others that hiked premiums include Chubb Ltd  N CB   which said it kept providing coverage to existing and new customers  but would not discuss premium rates  and EMCASCO Insurance Company  O EMCI   which did not respond to requests for comment   Risk modelers fear that insurers are too exposed in the event of a  big one   even though claims have been few thus far   If they do end up with substantial claims for a large quake  insurers could sue the oil companies for reimbursement  At the Oklahoma insurance regulator s request  several insurance companies clarified last fall that they did cover man made quakes  which provided an incentive to try to recoup payouts from oil and gas companies  
Two insurers   the United Servicemembers Automobile Association and Palomar Specialty   said they could consider such action ",2016-05-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/insurers-shun-risk-as-oil-linked-quakes-soar-in-oklahoma-401505,401505
132279,353794,CB,Alibaba s finance arm Ant says expansion plans to focus on Asia  for now,news,"By Sijia Jiang and Elzio Barreto
HONG KONG  Reuters    Ant Financial Services Group  the world s biggest financial technology company  plans to focus its expansion plans in Asia before looking to go more global  a senior official said on Tuesday 
Ant   Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd s online finance arm  will offer its insurance and investment management products outside of China  senior vice president Douglas Feagin said at an event to mark a tie up with Thai payment firm Ascend 
The Thailand deal marks Ant s first significant expansion effort into foreign payments in Asia since last year s partnership with India s PayTM  which raised over  500 million in a round led by Alibaba in September 
Ant s payment platform Alipay has been tussling with major local rival Tencent Holdings Ltd  whose Tenpay has also been making an overseas push by targeting thousands of retailers particularly around Asia 
Ant plans to replicate the Alipay model in Thailand  with a goal of reaching more than half of the country s internet users in five years  it said 
 We are leading first with payments and related services but we may very well offer other products and services market by market   Feagin said 
The move extends a global push that has seen the firm move into the United States and Europe  Last month Ant expanded its mobile payment app service into the U S  market in a bid to reach Chinese consumers traveling abroad 
Ant said in a statement that it has 450 million users  of which 40 million are outside China  It also has another 150 million when users of its PayTM tie up are included 
In August both Alipay and Tenpay secured licenses to operate their mobile payments services in Hong Kong 
Ascend  which allows users to deposit their cash into a digital wallet  and Ant Financial are counting on the huge number of people without bank accounts in Southeast Asia to turn to their payments  lending and other services 
The region has nearly 370 million people without bank accounts and who use cash on a day to day basis  Ascend Group CEO Punnamas Vichitkulwongsa said 
Feagin  a former Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  banker who leads Ant s international business  added there were no set plans currently for the timing or venue of a potential initial public offering  though there were benefits to going public 
Ant Financial raised  4 5 billion in a record funding round in April  valuing the company at about  60 billion  the same as  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP  or insurer Chubb  NYSE CB  Ltd and more than any other privately held fintech company ",2016-11-01,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/alibaba's-finance-arm-ant-says-expansion-plans-to-focus-on-asia,-for-now-436355",436355

combination of Ant s technological expertise and MoneyGram s large network of agents and established brand could be a game changer for the industry by leading to more consumers  including migrant

 Reuters    Ant Financial Services Group  the world s largest financial technology company  is confident of closing a deal for U S  money transfer firm MoneyGram International Inc  a top executive told Reuters  despite a higher bid from a U S  rival  The proposed  880 million deal is a first major step by Ant  the payment affiliate of Chinese e commerce giant  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding  to expand its business overseas  as the firm  valued at  60 billion  sets itself up for a public offering   MoneyGram we view as very attractive because it gives a global network of remittance capability and kind of an omnichannel approach that connects us   Douglas Feagin  head of Ant s international strategy  said in a phone interview   That s why we ve entered the transaction and look forward to completing the deal with them   But the plan faced a major hurdle this week as U S  electronic payments firm Euronet Worldwide Inc launched a higher  1 billion bid for MoneyGram on Tuesday  arguing that its all American deal would face less regulatory scrutiny than a lower bid by Ant  Ant said earlier that it was making progress and on schedule to obtain all required regulatory and shareholder approvals  while MoneyGram has yet to decide whether it will recommend Euronet s higher offer to its shareholders  Feagin  who had worked at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  for more than two decades before joining Ant in 2016  declined to say whether Ant would raise its offer for MoneyGram  but said the deal was important for the firm s global push   Today with our wallets you can transfer money in a country quite easily  and we want to enable that more broadly around the world  That s what MoneyGram would help us to do   he said   MoneyGram  which was rescued through a  1 5 billion financing deal in which Goldman participated after the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008  has long dominated the global money transfer industry with its large network of retail locations  The Dallas based firm has about 350 000 outlets in shops  post offices and banks in nearly 200 countries and territories  Its rivals include Euronet and Western Union Co  A combination of Ant s technological expertise and MoneyGram s brand could be a game changer for the global payment industry  analysts say  with scope for more consumers to use online transfer services rather than taking cash to storefronts  Feagin added Ant would look longer term to grow its business in developed markets  though it would take a cautious approach   We re going to be more careful about that in terms of designing the strategy and the kinds of customers we can access  We don t go in with a blind eye to the competitive nature of certain markets   he said  SOUTHEAST ASIA Ant  which dominates China s online payment market but has been ramping up investment overseas amid fierce rivalry at home with peers such as Tencent Holding Ltd s popular WeChat Pay  is also eying several new deals around Southeast Asia this year  Feagin said   We re focused on larger markets there in terms of the population and the opportunity set  So I would expect to see some other partnerships this year   Feagin said  Ant Financial is currently in talks with Indonesian media conglomerate Emtek to launch a payment joint venture  a source with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters  Feagin declined to comment on specific deals  The push underlines Ant s ambitions to create a network of financial assets around the region  Ant has made a series of investments in foreign payment firms in recent months as it looks to create an international network  The spate of deals since the end of last year include tie ups with Ascend Money in Thailand  Kakao Pay in South Korea and Mynt in the Philippines  following earlier investment in Indian firm PayTM    Southeast Asia  is quite attractive because it has the fundamental characteristics of high mobile phone usage and rising per capita income  but still has a large population that is not banked   said Feagin  According to analysts  the competition for payment and remittance assets in the region has spiked as firms look for deals to avoid the regulatory hurdles involved in entering the markets alone   There s pressure in these markets because there s only a limited number of quality assets   said Hong Kong based EY Fintech analyst James Lloyd   It wouldn t surprise me if other technology companies  Chinese and otherwise  are equally engaged in these markets  looking at what viable payments or remittance players they could link to a global network   he said  Ant Financial has confirmed plans for an IPO but it is not expected until 2018 at the earliest  It raised  4 5 billion in a record funding round in April  valuing the firm at around  60 billion  the same as  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP  or insurer Chubb  NYSE CB  Ltd and more than any other privately held fintech firm

132285,353800,CB,Attacks on Western cities prompt insurers to adapt,news,"By Carolyn Cohn  Suzanne Barlyn and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    The changing nature of attacks in Western cities has led insurers to offer new policies  from straightforward cover for business lost due to police cordons to more risky compensation for declines in tourism 
Terrorism insurance policies were developed after the 9 11 attacks on the United States  but until recently covered only businesses that had been physically damaged 
The deaths of two hostages taken at a cafe in Sydney in Dec 2014 and attacks in Paris in Nov 2015 that killed 130 people were catalysts for new types of cover taking into account the impact of heavy loss of life on businesses not directly hit 
Recent deadly attacks in London and Manchester underlined the need 
 The focus of terrorism has shifted to loss of life  rather than money  which can cause devastating loss of revenues to industries like hospitality   said Chris Folkman  director of product management at risk modeling firm RMS 
Some of these newer policies are difficult to price and hard to model  but insurers are developing them to meet demand and maintain market share in a highly competitive market which has suffered several years of falling premiums 
Insurance against attacks is typically offered as a standalone policy or add on to property insurance and is underwritten by specialists such as Lloyd s of London insurers Beazley  L BEZG    Hiscox   L HSX  and Talbot and U S  insurers like AIG  N AIG  
Additions to the standard policies have begun to include  denial of access  policies to compensate for loss of business as a result of a police cordon following an attack  as well as  loss of attraction  policies to cover loss of revenue due to potential customers staying away from businesses further from the attack 
A new style policy including physical damage and business interruption cover for a hotel in central Manhattan which may have suffered from or merely been close to an attack  for example  would cost around  500 for  100 000 of cover  said Steven Tebbutt  political violence underwriter at Talbot 
LONDON BRIDGE
Insurers say the global market for terrorism insurance can now cope with potential claims totaling more than  3 billion as the industry responds to growing demand 
For instance  Chubb  N CB  said this week it had increased the risk by 300 percent that it is willing to take on for each client account through terrorism and political violence insurance in the last two years  citing  growing client demand for certainty and comprehensive cover  
AIG has expanded its global capacity to cover attacks on property to  1 billion  in part by employing engineering experts to help clients make their buildings less of a target  said George Stratts  AIG s President of Property and Special Risk 
David Abrahamovitch  chief executive of a chain of coffee shops including London Grind  which is near the scene of this month s London Bridge attacks  has begun the process of claiming from his insurer 
London Grind was closed for a few days as it was inside a police cordon  The chain switched insurance companies last year which gave it suitable cover  Abrahamovitch said  adding   It will take a little while for footfall to recover  
In order for such insurance to be triggered  a government needs to declare an event an act of terrorism 
But in the United States  a strict legal definition of terrorism for insurance purposes does not apply to many acts  or threats  of violence  said Bruce Smiley Kaliff  senior underwriter for specialized programs at Kaliff Insurance and Lloyd s North American underwriter  which focuses on events coverage 
For example  the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing did not meet criteria for the U S  Treasury to determine it an act of terrorism under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act 
 The terrorism statute was a congressional kneejerk to 9 11   Smiley Kaliff said   It never entered anyone s minds that we d have to worry about the county fair  
Kaliff Insurance  based in San Antonio  Texas  is now developing coverage that would more broadly cover  violent acts  such as bombs  shootings  or multiple stabbings  at concerts and other events  such as concerts and outdoor festivals 
OPPORTUNITIES  RISKS
Insurance broker Arthur J Gallagher said it had seen growing interest in its crisis resilience policy  underwritten by AIG  which costs small businesses around 500 pounds and includes post incident trauma counseling and  24 7 access to experienced response consultants  
While insurers develop some policies with an eye to new business  other claims for compensation may be forced upon them 
In Britain  a rule change earlier this year means people injured by a vehicle  like those targeted in the Westminster and London Bridge attacks  can now seek compensation from insurers or the industry backed Motor Insurers  Bureau  Previously  the vehicle s insurer would probably not have been liable 
The policy riskiest for insurers  though of growing interest to customers  is loss of attraction  provided to a business nowhere near an attack which loses revenue as a result 
Paul Bassett  managing director of crisis management at AJ Gallagher  said its  denial of access  policies have a 2 5 mile radius  while  loss of attraction  has a 10 mile radius  Those distances vary among insurers 
Jessica Johnson  underwriting manager malicious acts at Lloyd s insurer Barbican  said a loss of attraction policy could provide cover  for example  to a hotel group with hotels in four UK cities  A physical attack on a hotel in one city could also allow the group to claim for loss of revenue in the other three 
Insurers use forensic accountants to judge whether a business has lost attraction as a result of an attack which did not affect it directly 
This type of policy could have helped hotels in Paris  for example  where revenue per available hotel room  RevPAR  plunged 14 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015  according to research firm MKG Consulting 
 It s an emerging  volatile type of coverage   said Gordon Woo  catastrophist at RMS  adding   We re thinking of modeling it  Our clients are interested in this   
But insurers are cautious about offering too much of this and other such cover to avoid breaching the levels of risk that they have calculated are safe to have on their books 
 Loss of attraction is something we re looking into   it s been asked about a lot by clients   especially in the entertainment area   said Christof Bentele  global head of crisis management  at Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Corporate   Specialty

132286,353801,CB,4 Solid Insurance Picks  Can These Continue The Bull Run ,opinion,As the year 2018 set in  the insurance industry started to witness the wheel of fortune turning in its favor with the rising interest rates  improving economy  lower than expected catastrophe loss  as compared to 2017  which emerged as the costliest year in terms of cat loss  as well as a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1  2018  Hence  the industry is anticipated to deliver better than expected results and continue the momentum in the near term as well Even though the insurers will be faced with challenges to counter in 2018  their primary focus remains on achieving two important objectives   top line sales growth while bolstering bottom line profitability Some of the concerns such as weather related events and political turmoil are beyond the insurers  control  Despite these trials  we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock Here  we will talk about a few driving factors that might help insurers perform well in the near future  allaying apprehensions among investors Rising Interest Rates  Is it a Blessing The gradually improving interest rates have been a boon for insurers  who are major beneficiaries of the rising interest rates  The FOMC meeting on Mar 21  2018  which also marked Jerome Powell s first Fed meeting as chairman  further strengthened the insurers  confidence in the regulatory body s promise to deliver three rate hikes in 2018  The first hike announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the range of 1 50 1 75   In fact  the Fed indicated that there can be a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019  one more than the previously announced two hikes   hinting at an aggressive path of rate hikes A progressive rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry with regard to insurers  investment income  forming a major portion of their revenues   thereby accelerating their overall growth in the future  For instance  life insurance companies will get a relief from the operating pressures  resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time  Rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide the required relief to insurers to maintain decent margins Better Underwriting Performance  An Ambitious Hope Although the California mudslides and the northeast winter storms are likely to impact first quarter 2018 results with Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   projecting a total catastrophe loss of  305 million after tax  the insurers are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results  Thus  the positivity surrounding a better underwriting performance remains intact  despite such massive inclement weather oriented losses being incurred In fact  per a report by Fitch Ratings  the insurance industry is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018  albeit at a slower pace  after being badly hit by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017  Moreover  combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to a break even point Capital strength displayed by the insurers will assist them to counter near term volatility and the effects of adverse events Other High Points for a Winning PerformanceThere are a few other factors poised to boost the insurance industry this year  The unemployment rate is projected at 3 8  in 2018 while the gross domestic product is likely to grow 2 7   an increase from the earlier estimate of 2 5    Both represent a bullish economic outlook  further picking pace in the recent months This apart  a recovering housing market looks set to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written Moreover  the tax cut  which reduced the tax rate to 21  from 35   is an attractive option for most corporates including insurers  as it will aid the companies  bottom line  boosting margins directly A strong liquidity profile  attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry  will not only back the insurers to counter near term volatility and impact of hostile occurrences but will also keep the industry s growth trend alive Key PicksDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year  tailwinds like rising interest rate

132289,353804,CB,Catastrophe Loss To Impact Q1  4 Insurance Outperformers ,opinion,In 2017  the insurance industry struggled to survive the wrath of an unprecedented hurricane activity which witnessed the landfall of Irma  Harvey and Maria besides the Mexico earthquakes and the California wildfires  These consecutive calamities resulted in a massive catastrophe loss  catapulting last year to one of the costliest periods ever in terms of such huge deficits  Per a report by Munich Re  overall catastrophe loss amounted to  330 billion with the insured losses coming in at  135 billion  less than half of the incurred losses  The intensity and impact of such catastrophe events shook the insurance industry big time with the losses deeply denting its underwriting results and adversely affecting the insurers  earnings The current year kick started with the early January California mudslides  causing substantial damages to homes and businesses  and the northeast winter storms  which hit the East Coast on Jan 3 and Mar 1  2018  In fact  among the property and casualty  P C  insurers  Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   has projected total catastrophe loss of  305 million  which are likely to affect the company s first quarter 2018 results  Losses from the California mudslides are anticipated at  125 million pretax while northeast winter storms will account for  195 million in loss Catastrophe Loss Impact  Still a Silver Lining in the Cloud Although the calendar year has just crossed its first quarter  we think that there is still no need for insurers to hit the panic button yet  Analysts from Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  have estimated global Q1 insured catastrophe loss to range between  5 billion and  10 billion  which is noticeably below the historical average of  14 billion Per a report by Fitch Ratings  the insurance industry is expected to regain its substantial underwriting profitability in 2018  albeit at a slow pace  Moreover  combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to break even  Thus  insurance players can expect a better year in terms of catastrophe losses compared with the tumultuous journey in 2017 Further  catastrophe and rough weather related events are a necessary evil for P C insurers to improve their pricing as they eventually reduce competition  Also  occurrence of natural disasters might lead to an accelerated rate of policy renewals Moreover  the industry has been strengthening its capital position with earnings growth and policyholders  surpluses  Such solid liquidity profile will help insurers counter near term volatility as well as the aftermath of adverse events Given the unpredictable nature of weather oriented episodes  catastrophe loss will always remain a concern for the P C insurers and we wait to see how they tackle pressure or buckle under it  as the year progresses On a positive front  better than expected underwriting results  a solid liquidity position and an evolving coverage opportunity should lend the P C insurers enough support to grow Interestingly  the  has outperformed the broader market in the first quarter  evident from a gain of 0 7  against the S P 500 s decrease of 1 2   Outperformers in Q1There is a possibility of the catastrophe loss severity negatively impacting the results of insurers from this space in the yet to be reported quarter  However  we expect some insurers to deliver favorable results on the back of a few positive factors The increase in interest rate in March  which also marks the sixth increase post recession  reflects stability in the economy  Improving rate environment will aid investment income  forming a major portion of their revenues   Fed having promised two more rate hikes in 2018 alone  raises optimism Lower tax incidence  growing GDP and an improving employment scenario have supported insurers  performance This apart  a bullish economic outlook  with the unemployment rate projected to grow at 3 8  in 2018 and the gross domestic product at 2 7   is likely to add an impetus to the industry Thus  the aforementioned positives will probably cushion the following stocks to push the envelope and yield profits via an underlying strength and business modification With the help of our   we have boiled down to four stocks poised to beat earnings estimate despite all odds  Our parameters include a positive   a

132292,353807,CB,Insure Your Portfolio With 4 Stocks Set To Beat Q1 Earnings,opinion,First quarter earnings season has already witnessed 130 elite S P 500 index members having reported quarterly results so far Let s see  how the quarter pans out for the life and non life or the property and casualty  P C  insurance space The insurance industry is likely to deliver solid earnings in the first quarter  riding on the strength of an improving rate environment  tax cuts  favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario An Improving Rate EnvironmentReflecting economic stability  the Fed has hiked interest rate for the sixth time since December 2015  the recent being in March this year  The rate environment has improved to 1 75  from the near zero level The first quarter thus continues to enjoy the positive impact of a favorable rate environment  driving the insurer s investment results and the performance of life insurers Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest sensitive product lines to weather the low rate environment  they stand to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves A Benign Catastrophe EnvironmentThough the first quarter encountered the California mudslide and the northeast winter storms  the insurers escaped a severe magnitude of catastrophe loss  A Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between  5 billion and  10 billion Insurers having already suffered the extremities of cat loss last year could manage to brave its first quarter damages as well  Nonetheless  first quarter earnings are burdened by catastrophe loss  Underwriting profitability is affected  albeit to a lesser degree  Recently  Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   reported a drag of 64 cents on its bottom line attributable to cat loss Prudent underwriting standards and cost control measures will likely support profitability Impact of Tax ReformsThe new tax rate has been implemented effective first quarter 2018  The overhaul of the tax system slashed the tax rate to 21  from 35   A lower tax incidence is expected to boost net income  the bottom line as well as the scope for more capital deployment Progressing Economy  A TailwindAlso  a progressing economy reflects a better employment scenario and the GDP translating into a more disposable income plus a better consumer sentiment Growth in job opportunities has been solid through the first three months of 2018 with an average of nearly 0 202 million  above the year ago tally of 0 182 million   This  in turn  might have supported more policy writings  thus driving the premiums higher  Premiums contribute a lion s share to an insurer s top line Other FactorsDiverse product offerings  portfolio repositioning  geographic expansion  cost curbing efforts  share repurchases and strategic integrations should have propelled better performances Ways to Pick the Perfect Insurance StocksWith tailwinds rallying

The insurer has raised insurance premiums aggressively in the last few years without any significant loss to its share of the highly competitive home and auto insurance markets 
Chief Executive Tom Wilson  however  said on Wednesday his company was seeing  less volatility  in pricing 
 Price increases are getting much smaller as most of the impact of severe weather has already been reflected in our pricing and profitability   Wilson told Reuters 
Property and casualty insurers  ability to raise rates have slowed  mainly due to a lack of major catastrophe losses in recent times

132309,353824,CB,Aetna to buy Humana for  37 billion in largest insurance deal,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    Health insurer  Aetna Inc   N AET  on Friday said it would buy smaller rival  Humana Inc   N HUM  for about  37 billion in cash and stock  in the largest ever deal in the insurance industry  The combination will push Aetna close to Anthem Inc s  N ANTM  No 2 insurer spot by membership  and would nearly triple Aetna s Medicare Advantage business  The deal will face antitrust scrutiny but if it goes through it would dwarf the previous largest insurance deal announced just this week  where Swiss property and casualty giant ACE Ltd  N ACE  announced it was buying  Chubb Corp   N CB  for  28 billion  It would also dwarf Anthem Inc s purchase of WellPoint in 2004 for  16 6 billion  Analysts have said that M A activity in the healthcare sector had been waiting for last week s Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare  which upheld key subsidies that underpin the reform and thus gave more certainty to healthcare insurers  The bigger the insurer  the more power it has negotiating prices and improving its doctor networks  Anthem has offered to buy  Cigna Corp   N CI  to create the largest insurer in the country  toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH   Media reports have also said UnitedHealth could be eyeing Cigna and Aetna  On Thursday   Centene  Corp  N CNC  said it would buy smaller rival  Health Net Inc   N HNT  for  6 3 billion  ANTITRUST ISSUES Antitrust authorities  who were aggressive in their review of the failed deal between Comcast  O CMCSA  and Time Warner Cable  N TWC   are expected to scrutinize how the combination of insurers will affect competition for each line of insurance  Medicare  Medicaid for the poor  individual insurance  commercial insurance for small and large businesses and the large employer business   Aetna and Humana are in nine of the same states in Medicare Advantage  Combined  they would have market share of 88 percent in Kansas  80 percent in West Virginia  58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri   Wall Street analysts and some antitrust experts have said they expect the combination will be approved  although regulators may ask for some divestitures   Others have said it is unclear that this group of regulators will stick to the usual review playbook for such a large deal and may add other restrictions   The Justice Department  which reviews insurance mergers  will scrutinize deals city by city to see if the combination would have a monopoly in any metropolitan area  said Andre Barlow  a veteran of the department who is now at Washington law firm Doyle  Barlow and Mazard PLLC  Aetna said the combined company is projected to have over 33 million medical members  based on memberships as of March 31  Operating revenue is expected to be about  115 billion this year  with approximately 56 percent from government sponsored programs including Medicare and Medicaid  Last week  the U S  Supreme Court upheld subsidies for individuals under President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law  keeping a large chunk of patients intact under the Medicare and Medicaid programs  Insurers have said subsidies are key to bringing in new customers and the ruling has removed uncertainty for insurers looking for acquisitions  It could also spur more deal making in the health insurance sector  which has already seen a blitz of merger activity this year  U S  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  of Kentucky  praised Humana s presence in his home state but also noted the role of the healthcare law in the merger   This morning s announcement  as I predicted during the debate five years ago  is the inevitable result of Obamacare s push toward consolidation as doctors  hospitals  and insurers merge in response to an ever growing government   the Republican said in a statement  The deal includes a  1 billion break up fee payable by Aetna to Humana  should the deal fail because of antitrust concerns  an Aetna spokeswoman confirmed  The fee was first reported by the Wall Street Journal  CASH AND SHARES Hartford  Conn  based Aetna said it would pay Humana shareholders  125 in cash and 0 8375 Aetna shares for each share held  The offer of about  230 per share is a 23 percent premium to Humana s closing price on Thursday  Following the deal  Aetna shareholders would own about 74 percent of the combined company with Humana shareholders owning the rest  Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini will serve as chairman and CEO of the combined company   The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 and add to operating earnings per share from 2017  Humana s sale has been anticipated since May when it was first reported that Cigna Corp  N CI  and Aetna were interested  and multiple sources confirmed to Reuters that the company was entertaining offers   Humana  based in Louisville  Kentucky  has been under pressure for more than a year from investors  which include activist fund Glenview Capital Management  to produce higher returns   Last year Humana hired a CFO from investment bank Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and went through a strategic review that included asset sales  But it missed several quarters of earnings targets and struggled with profits in its individual business  disappointing Wall Street  Aetna said it has received commitments from Citi and UBS Investment Bank to finance the deal

132368,353883,CB,Should Value Investors Consider Chubb  CB  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Chubb has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Chubb s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint  which is 11 6  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Chubb has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 20 5  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future     P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Chubb has a P S ratio of about 2 1  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Chubb currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CB a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Chubb is just 12 1  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 6  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 6  which is much better than the industry average of 15 2  Clearly  CB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Chubb might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F  This gives CB a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 14 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below D B A Chubb Limited New Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineChubb is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 29  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He

132463,353978,CB,Should Value Investors Consider Chubb  CB  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Chubb Limited   NYSE CB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Chubb has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 09  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 50 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Chubb s current PE among its highs over the observed period  This suggests that the stock is overvalued compared to its own historical levels Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 31  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Chubb has a P S ratio of about 2 14  This is higher than the Zacks categorized Insurance   Property and Casualty industry average  which comes in at 1 74 right now CB is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Chubb s P CF ratio of 9 70 is much lower than the Zacks classified Insurance   Property and Casualty industry average of 13 04  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Chubb s PEG ratio stands at just 1 41  compared with the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry average of 3 41  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Chubb currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Chubb an apt choice for value investors  and all of the listed metrics make it pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Chubb might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives CB a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards lately  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to two higher  while the full year estimate has seen four downward revisions and two upward revisions in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below D B A Chubb Limited New Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and why we fear that the company might disappoint in the near term Bottom LineChubb is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the Bottom 11  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  4  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-07-17,Zacks Investment

132685,354200,CB,6 Insurers Set To Counter Cat Loss With Q2 Earnings Beat,opinion,"We are in the thick of the second quarter earnings season  with 208 members of the elite S P 500 index having reported already  Let s see how the quarter is turning up for the life and non life or property and casualty  P C  insurance space 

Unfortunately  the frequency and magnitude of catastrophe activities   the key factors influencing this industry   have largely affected the underwriting results of insurers in the second quarter  Adding to the woes is the Fed s delay in hiking interest rate 
Catastrophe Events

After several quarters of benign catastrophes  the second quarter was ravaged by calamities  This quarter witnessed varied catastrophes  including a wildfire in Canada  flooding in Europe  earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador  and hailstorms in Texas  The industry is estimated to incur an expected loss of  15 billion to over  20 billion due to 25 weather events that occurred in the quarter 

AXIS Capital Holdings Limited  AXS  reported catastrophe and weather related pre tax net losses  net of reinstatement premiums  of  104 million  while The Travelers Companies  Inc   NYSE TRV  reported catastrophe loss  net of reinstatement premiums  of  333 million  Chubb Corp   NYSE CB  reported catastrophe losses of about  311 million dragging the bottom line by 66 cents  XL Group plc  NYSE XL  reported pre tax cat losses  net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums  of  240 1 million 

These have weighed on the underwriting results of insurers  hurting their underwriting income and combined ratio 
Interest Rate Environment

The interest rate environment still remains low  The Federal Reserve refrained from raising the rate due to weak employment data and Brexit induced uncertainties  The rate was last hiked in the Dec 2015 meeting to only 0 25 0 50   Since then  we have no clear direction as to when the rate might be raised again 

Therefore  investment income  which forms a major component of insurers  revenues  remains under pressure  But a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes bring some respite 

Nevertheless  this little increase was a silver lining for life insurers who suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to sustained low rate  To cope with this low rate era  life insurers have lowered their interest sensitive product lines 

However  a low rate is not all bad news for insurers  These generally hold a considerable amount in bonds  which would see a decline in value if rates rise  
Economic Recovery and Capital Deployment

With economic recovery  people with surplus money are opting for insurance coverage  Insurers are not only redesigning and re pricing their products that are driving premiums higher but are also managing underwriting costs prudently to boost profitability  Also  with expansion of the Affordable Care Act  companies that are offering health benefits should enjoy higher premiums with increased enrollment 

Emerging risks of cyber threats open avenues for additional premiums through higher premium and policy counts  Additionally  improvement in the real estate market and corporate bonds should tone down credit related investment losses 

Nonetheless  insurers in this well capitalized industry remain well poised on their expanded and diversified product and service portfolio  Effective capital deployment involving share buybacks should boost the bottom line 

With strong positives guarding the results  investors can bet on stocks that are poised to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming reports  
Way to Pick the Right Insurance Stocks

Picking the right stock for your portfolio from too many participants could be difficult  But an easy way to narrow down the list is to look at stocks with a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  

Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks with the best chance of surprising with their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP is usually an indication of an earnings beat  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  

For investors seeking to apply this strategy to their portfolio  we have highlighted four P C insurance stocks that might stand out with an earnings beat in their releases

132764,354279,CB,Aflac  A Quality Stock  Potential Catalysts Ahead,opinion,"Whenever an industry leader trades at a cheap valuation it should draw the attention of investors  and that s exactly the situation we see with Aflac  NYSE AFL    62 share   Concerns over currency weakness in Japan  where AFL derives 75  of its revenue  have kept the stock price down  However  these concerns are overstated  AFL has the cash flow to support its valuation even if the Yen weakens further while it has significant potential upside if the exchange rate improves  Changes from the Affordable Care Act in the U S  also present Aflac with significant opportunity 
The Top Name in Health   Life Insurance
I ve written bullish articles on property and casualty insurers like The Chubb Corporation  NYSE CB   and Aspen Insurance Holdings  AHL  recently  While I do have high expectations for these stocks  that sector carries more inherent risk as a massive natural disaster could hit any time and significantly increase their costs  There is a little more volatility in P C insurers  business model than that of health and life insurers 
Health and life insurers enjoy significantly more stable costs over time  AFL s history attests to the stability of its industry  Over the past 10 years  AFL has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 15  compounded annually  In only two out of those ten years did AFL s NOPAT decline  This consistent growth has helped AFL to earn a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  of 16   Figure 1 tracks AFL s NOPAT for the past 15 years 
Figure 1  Steady Growth

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

AFL s 16  ROIC is top amongst the 18 health and life insurers that we cover  while its 13  NOPAT margin ranks third  Combine that with its impressive brand recognition  the ubiquitous duck   and it s clear that AFL is one of the strongest companies in its industry 
Japanese Business Is Growing Rapidly
At first glance  the results from Aflac Japan for 2013 look bad  Revenues declined by 12  and reported operating earnings declined by 7   However  these declines were entirely due to weakness in the Japanese yen  The average yen dollar exchange rate was 22  higher in 2013 compared to 2012 
Figure 2 is a table from AFL s 2013 10 K that shows how Aflac Japan actually grew significantly in 2013 if one discounts the effect of the weak yen 
Figure 2  Yen vs  Dollar Results    Percentage Changes


Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

It s important to note that most of Aflac Japan s profits are not converted into dollars  Last year  only  771 million  8  of operating cash flow  was repatriated from Aflac Japan to Aflac U S  Most of AFL s yen holdings are reinvested back into the business  so the exchange rate fluctuation does not have that large an effect on their operations 
The right side of figure 2  which strips away the impact of exchange rates  shows that Aflac Japan is growing at a healthy rate  I m not a currency expert  and I don t pretend to know what the yen will do against the dollar in the near future  However  AFL has a strong enough business to withstand further weakening of the yen  and if the yen strengthens earnings are going to experience a major surge 
Opportunity in the U S 
Even though U S  operations only make up 25  of AFL s revenues  the company s domestic operations still have significant growth potential  Numerous reports have suggested that more businesses and individuals are buying supplemental health insurance policies AFL s core business as a result of the Affordable Care Act  Assurant Health Insurance  AIZ  CEO Rob Pollock seemed to confirm this in the company s Q1 earnings call when he referenced the strong sales of the company s supplemental health insurance products 
AIZ beat revenue and earnings estimates handily  and I would expect AFL to do the same when it reports on April 29  Especially given AFL s large share buyback authorization I would expect the company to beat on EPS 
Cheap Valuation Means Low Risk
Even if AFL doesn t beat expectations this quarter  the company remains a solid long term bet  Fears over the yen have kept the valuation down below reasonable levels  At its current valuation of   62 share  AFL has a price to economic book value of 1  which implies that the company will never grow profits again  Those are very low expectations for a company that done 15  compounded annually over the past decade 
With even modest growth  AFL has significant potential upside  If we give AFL credit for NOPAT growth of just 6  compounded annually for 10 years  the stock has a fair value of   81 share  If the yen ends up strengthening against the dollar  profits could grow much more rapidly and AFL could have an even higher potential upside 
In this high risk environment  AFL is a safe choice  Its cheap valuation and large buyback authorization should limit the downside  while solid growth gives it a large potential upside 
Blue Chip Investor Fund  BCIFX  allocates 7 3  of its assets to AFL and earns our Attractive rating  making it a solid choice for investors who want exposure to AFL without holding the stock directly

132765,354280,CB,3 Seemingly Crazy ETF Ideas,opinion,"Japan has now registered two consecutive quarters of economic contraction   a persistent absence of growth that defines most recessions  For worse or for better  the world s third largest economy will simply commit additional electronic money printing resources to acquire more Japanese stock and bond assets  This activity weakens the yen which  in turn  emboldens  to ratchet up the borrowing of the depreciating currency to invest more in the U S  stock market  As one popular financial blogger joked yesterday evening   By the laws of QE  U S  stocks will hit record highs on Monday  
Whereas the Federal Reserve may or may not have been particularly successful at helping the U S  economy  former Chairman Greenspan recently expressed that the central bank of the U S  failed in this regard   at least the U S  economy is actually expanding  In contrast  neither the Bank of Japan nor the European Central Bank  ECB  have been particularly successful at improving the gross domestic output of their respective regions  Ominous  Perhaps  Yet it s not as if investors in Japan are throwing in the towel  WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity  DXJ  is still near a 52 week peak 

The October spike that sent WisdomTree Japan Total Dividend  NYSE DXJ  surging through the roof of the chart came on the announcement that Japan would expand its asset purchasing program  That was a surprise at the time  Looking back  however  it would appear that policy makers had an idea of the recessionary data coming down the pike 
On the other hand  one may want to look around the edges for investment ideas less tethered to the next central bank announcement  For example  it is genuinely assumed that the U S  is the single bright spot in the world s weakening economy  Moreover  as other areas of the world are trending toward additional asset purchases  the U S  is maintaining an ultra accommodating zero percent rate stance  but no longer acquiring government debt  So the dollar can only get stronger  and commodities can only get weaker  right 
Maybe not  Earlier in the year   sent the price of wheat as well as oil higher  Then the conflict cooled  The stronger dollar as well as region wide deflation slammed oil and grains to multi year lows  Until now  Russia s reliance on oil revenue means that it may not have the luxury of agreeing to a resolution in the region  Wheat and other grains have already bounced off those multi year floors breaking above an intermediate term 50 day trendline for the first time since May 
How might I play Russia aggression in Ukraine  How might I hedge against conventional wisdom that ongoing deflation in food prices is a certainty  I would consider picking up shares of the iPath DJ UBS Grains Subindex TR  NYSE JJG  with its near term technical uptrend  I would also  

Investing in Japan with the country s endless loop of failure seems nuts  of course  The same holds true for buying an inflationary asset like grains in the midst of global deflation  Here  then  is a seemingly crazy idea   one based on the notion that fundamental value may once again matter The SPDR KBW Insurance  NYSE KIE  has been decidedly weak relative to the S P 500 throughout the year  Moreover  judging by the KIE S P 500 price ratio  there may be little reason to look favorably upon big insurers like Travelers   NYSE TRV   Chubb  NYSE CB  or Allstate  NYSE ALL  

Still  what if you have patience as well as a long term time horizon  Might the mouthwatering price to book of 1 0 and highly reasonable price to earnings of 11 5 give you pause  Putting these numbers into perspective  the S P 500 s trailing 12 month P E equivalent of 18 7 implies that one would be paying nearly 40  less for the privilege of owning the big insurers as opposed to the broader market  Granted  it may not be a fair comparison  since investors will always pay more for growth oriented segments like technology and industrials  Still  a 40  relative price discount

132767,354282,CB,ACE Is Acquiring Chubb What Should You Do ,opinion,"Investors love acquisitions  and for good reason 
If you own the acquired company  your holdings typically see large returns  If you own the acquirer  potential synergies promise ever higher earnings per share in future years 
Ace Limited  NYSE ACE  recently announced it will acquire Chubb Group  CB  for  28 3 billion  Chubb stock jumped from around  95 a share to around  121  a gain of around 27  
Chubb Corporation  NYSE CB  stock has long been a Sure Dividend favorite  In June of 2015  it was the 2nd highest ranked stock in the Sure Dividend newsletter  prior to the ACE acquisition announcement  
I told my readers to sell Chubb now and reinvest the proceeds into other high quality dividend growth stocks  The rationale for that decision is explored in detail below 
Chubb Overview
In 1882 a father and son team founded Chubb  Since that time  the company has grown to become a large multinational property and casualty insurer with 10 200 employees and  2 billion in annual income 
The company has grown over the last 133 years by being a conservative insurer that never risks  blowing  up by writing unprofitable policies  Chubb s slogan is  never compromise integrity  
The combined ratio in insurance is the sum of expenses and claims paid divided by premiums received  A combined ratio under 100  shows that an insurer is writing profitable policies before accounting for investment gains from invested float 
Chubb has maintained a combined ratio under 100  every year since 2002  All investment income has gone straight to the bottom line for Chubb over the last 13 years 
Chubb is able to maintain a combined ratio below 100  by focusing on niche property and casualty insurance markets  The company looks for profitable policies rather than growth at any cost 
Before the ACE acquisition  Chubb was actively buying itself through share repurchase  The company has repurchased about 6  of shares outstanding in the last 12 months  This combined with the company s dividend yield of  2  gave investors a shareholder yield of 8  
Chubb was able to return virtually all of its earnings to shareholders due to its conservative policies  The company operates a low risk business that produces substantial free cash flows 
 thanks to its 33 years of consecutive dividend increases  The company tends to perform well through all types of economic environments  Chubb was not significantly affected by the 2007 to 2009 recession  The company s book value per share through each year of the Great Recession is shown below to illustrate this point 
2007 book value per share of  38 56
2008 book value per share of  38 13
2009 book value per share of  47 09
Merger Arbitrage Details of ACE Chubb Acquisition
The terms of the pending ACE acquisition are as follows 
 62 93 in cash per Chubb share
6019 shares of ACE per Chubb share
ACE shares are currently trading at a price of  103 31  This implies a transaction price of  125 11 per Chubb share  Chubb shares are currently trading at a price of  121 23  The transaction is expected to close in during the 1st quarter of 2016 
If ACE s share price remains constant  the transaction will give investors a return of 3 2   Shareholders will also receive dividends from Chubb stock of  0 57 a share in September and December of 2015  This boosts Chubb stock s total return to 4 1  if held until closing 
If the deal does close around the midway point of the first quarter of 2016  around February 15   there are a total of 222 days between now and the close  On an annualized basis  holding Chubb stock until the acquisition closes will return around 6 8  a year 
This analysis assumes the acquisition will close without a hitch  which is not guaranteed  I am not an expert in merger arbitrage  so I don t know the odds of this acquisition closing on time  or closing at all  Either delays or a cancelation of the deal will result in investors not getting their 6 8  annualized return from holding Chubb shares  Therefore  we can now that Chubb stocks expected total return is less than 6 8  annualized 
Investors who sell Chubb stock now eliminate the risk that the acquisition will not close or will be delayed  Selling now locks in gains from the acquisition while eliminating risks  Holding Chubb to the date of acquisition reminds me of an old investing adage 
 Don t pick up pennies in front of a steamroller 
ACE Limited Business Overview
For investors who do want to roll their Chubb holdings into ACE  the company is examined here 
ACE is a  34 billion global insurance and reinsurance business  The company was founded in 1985 and has paid steady or increasing dividends for 22 consecutive years 
ACE stock currently has a dividend yield of 2 6  and has a price to book ratio of 1 15  The company has experienced rapid growth over the last decade  ACE Limited has compounded book value per share at 13 5  a year over the last decade 
The Chubb acquisition will very likely result in continued growth for ACE shareholders  Like Chubb  ACE has maintains a low combined ratio  Over the last decade  ACE s combined ratio has averaged 91 3  versus 89 8  for Chubb 
Chubb and ACE are both large insurers  The acquisition will result in significant cost savings from overhead reductions  meaning layoffs   The company expects to save  650 million a year from better efficiencies by 2018  This is no insignificant amount  The combined company will have net income of around  4 8 billion before cost savings  Cost savings could boost the company s bottom line by around 14  
Additionally  ACE  and other insurers  stand to gain from   The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates in the next year  When rates rise  insurers will be able to invest their float in securities with higher yields than are available today  This will boost the bottom line and should increase insurer share prices 
Final Thoughts
The acquisition of Chubb by ACE will likely be accretive for ACE  ACE shares appear to be fairly valued at this time  and the company has attractive total return potential given expected synergies from the pending acquisition 
The reason to sell Chubb stock now rather than hold to gain access to ACE shares is to lock in share price gains from the recently announced acquisition  There is a chance the acquisition could fall through   resulting in Chubb s share price declining significantly ",2015-07-09,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ace-is-acquiring-chubb…-what-should-you-do-257783,257783

 Baxalta s high expected total returns and competitive advantage should give the company a P E ratio above the S P 500 s  Fortunately for shareholders  Baxalta s P E ratio is still low at around 13 3  The company s P E ratio is being suppressed due to selling from the recent spin off  Now is an excellent time to buy into this high quality pharmaceutical business  while the P E ratio is still low  

Today  Baxalta stock is trading for   40 per share  Baxalta investors who purchased at the closing price on July 6th  2015 are sitting on 27  total returns  including dividends  
For comparison  the S P 500 is down  8  over the same time period 
The Shire Acquisition Drama
Repeated acquisition attempts by Shire Plc  L SHP  has repeatedly attempted to acquire Baxalta 
On August 4th  2015  for   45 per share  The announcement caused shares of Baxalta to rise from around  33 per share to around  37 per share 
Baxalta s management quickly   The company s press release said the following 

 During our meeting this week  the Board unanimously concluded that it is not prepared to engage with Shire in a discussion about a combination of our companies based on the value you indicated in your proposal 
 A transaction at the exchange ratio you proposed significantly understates Baxalta s true value  
Our board is mindful of its fiduciary obligations to Baxalta s shareholders  and we are confident in our standalone plan and our ability to generate significant shareholder value based on that plan  Baxalta s platform is well positioned to generate substantial value for our shareholders and proceeding with a transaction at this time presents a significant and real risk to that value creation  Our Board has evaluated your proposal in this context and concluded that it is not a basis for further discussions  

Clearly Baxalta s management thought the company was worth more than  45 per share  Or did they 
Baxalta Mangement Was Just Posturing
As it turns out  Baxalta s management was merely posturing  On January 11th  Baxalta s management  
The price    45 per share  when the deal was struck  
Shareholders of Baxalta will receive  18 00 in cash and 0 1482 shares of Shire Plc 
At current shire prices  this comes to a value of  44 31 per share  Baxalta stock is currently trading for around  40 per share 
Why Now Is The Time To Sell Baxalta
Investing in a security for just  7 months  from July 2015 through January 2016  is not a long term investment  short term trading profits are not the goal of the Sure Dividend approach 
Baxalta stock is no longer a dividend growth investment because of the announced Shire acquisition 
Baxalta is now a merger arbitrage play 
Investors focusing on a dividend growth strategy should stick to dividend growth stocks  Since Baxalta no longer fits that definition  it should be sold 
Final Thoughts
This is not the first Sure Dividend recommendation to be acquired in the last 12 months  Dividend Aristocrat insurer Chubb  N CB  announced it would be acquired by ACE  ACE  in July of 2015 
Chubb and now Baxalta are the only two stocks that have been recommended as sells using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing 
The sell rules in The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing are 
Sell if a stock becomes wildly overvalue  quantified as a P E ratio   40 
Sell if a stock cuts or eliminates its dividend payments
Aside from these 2 rules  sells also occur due to special situations  like acquisitions  ",2016-01-19,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-baxalta-is-a-sell-now-for-dividend-growth-investors-380570,380570
132769,354284,CB,CB  A Conservative Dividend Grower In The Insurance Industry,opinion,"Chubb  N CB  is one of the best managed insurance companies in the world  Prior to the merger of CB and ACE  these companies had raised their dividends for 33 and 22 consecutive years  respectively  With a forward looking payout ratio below 30   we expect the combined company s dividend growth to continue for many more years 
While a merger the size of ACE and CB s should naturally raise some concerns  we believe the deal is in good hands with ACE s experienced CEO and think it will make CB even more competitive and profitable once the integration is complete 
We like CB for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio and are optimistic about the company s long term future Business OverviewACE announced it was acquiring CB for  29 5 billion in July 2015  and the deal closed in January 2016  This deal created the sixth largest U S  property   casualty  P C  insurer by premiums and brought together two conservative insurers with highly complementary business lines   ACE is more international and focused on large commercial accounts  and CB is stronger with middle market companies and personal lines businesses  Insurance companies make money by writing premiums and investing proceeds for income before costs and claims need to be paid out 
By product line  the combined company generates 54  of its premiums from commercial P C  21  from personal lines  17  from global accident   health and life  5  from agriculture  and 3  from global reinsurance 
By geography  the combined company writes approximately 63  of its net premiums in the U S   14  in Europe and Africa  10  in Asia  8  in Latin America  and 5  in Bermuda and Canada Business AnalysisThe combination of ACE and CB will provide the company with several competitive advantages  beginning with the size of the business  Insurance policies generally have little differentiation  which makes price an important selling factor 
ACE and CB combined to write over  30 billion in global net premiums last year  making them one of the largest players in their markets  With its massive base of premiums  the company can spread its operating costs over wider pool of customers to lower its policy costs  diversify its risks  and offer customers packaged policies that cover a number of types of insurance  CB now has one of the largest product portfolios in the global insurance industry  
Both of these companies have done an excellent job underwriting conservative policies  From 2010 2014  ACE and CB s average combined ratio was 90   and it never ran at a loss  see below   The combined ratio measures an insurer s costs and claims as a percentage of the total premiums it has written  A ratio below 100  means that the insurance company is generating a profit from its policies and has been smart  or consistently lucky  about the risks it is willing to write policies for 
Source  Chubb Limited
As seen below  ACE s combined ratio over the past five years has averaged 6 2 percentage points lower than that of any major insurer in the world  underscoring the company s skill in understanding and appropriately pricing risk 
Source  Chubb Investor Presentation
Additionally  ACE and CB are both very conservative with their investment portfolios  Fixed income securities represent over 90  of both companies  portfolios and are less volatile than equity investments  The bonds each company is invested in have relatively short durations  making them somewhat less sensitive to interest rate movements  and high quality credit ratings 
There s also a lot to like about ACE s CEO Evan Greenberg  who orchestrated the deal  The combined company will be named Chubb  not ACE  The CEO said   I don t know any other way to show respect to somebody to begin with than to say we re going to take your name   How often does a CEO take that approach  It probably didn t hurt that CB s was founded in 1882 and has more brand recognition  too 
The merger s main benefits are the cost synergies that can be obtained  The transaction is expected to immediately add to CB s earnings per share and increase profits by over 10  beginning in the third year after the deal closes  CB expects to generate  650 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and generate strong growth from cross selling opportunities 
Besides the merger and both companies  conservatism  CB s business is advantaged due to its established distribution networks and massive number of field agents to sell its policies  CB s history dates back to the late 19th century  which has provided it with over 130 years to build its network and establish a well known brand recognized for quality service  New competitors would need years of time and millions of dollars to catch up Chubb s Key RisksWhenever a large acquisition is made  numerous risks present themselves   poor strategic fit  difficult integration work  overestimated synergies  employee turnover  cultural challenges  and more 
While ACE s acquisition of CB was a huge deal  this also isn t ACE s first rodeo  The company has successfully acquired and integrated over 15 businesses in the past  including numerous multi billion dollar deals  which hopefully helps mitigate some of the risk associated with this merger  However  we believe this is the largest risk to CB s long term earnings potential and will continue watching it closely 
Beyond the merger  the insurance industry poses several risks that can impact the company s near term results  More specifically  insurance pricing runs in cycles  As seen below  courtesy of Ernst   Young  the P C industry s combined ratio has been volatile over the past decade  ranging from a low of 92 6  in 2006 to a high of 107 7  in 2011 
When the combined ratio is low  it usually means that the industry has enjoyed a period with few catastrophe events  allowing insurers to rebuild their balance sheets and capital  With excess capital  there is more competition to write policies  which results in pricing pressure 
On the other hand  when several catastrophe events occur and or investment income is very poor  there is less capital in the industry and pricing trends can turn more favorable  The industry has seen modest claims over the past three years as evidenced by the combined ratio remaining below 100   In other words  pricing could be squeezed a bit over the coming years  Advances in data analytics could also result in more efficient pricing of policies  although we would expect CB to remain at the forefront of change in this area 
Source  Ernst   Young
In addition to industry pricing cycles  catastrophe events such as hurricanes can obviously have a severe impact on near term financial results  They are as unpleasant as they are inevitable  but CB has the financial health to weather just about any storm  It is also one of the most conservative underwriters of any insurer 
Finally  it s worth mentioning the impact that low interest rates are having on the investment income that CB can generate  Investment income is a key driver of an insurance company s profits  and over 90  of CB s investment portfolio is in fixed income securities  With interest rates appearing like they could be lower for longer  investors could be disappointed with the investment income CB can generate over the coming years Dividend Analysis  ChubbWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Note that the data below is only for legacy ACE s business  It does not include both companies  combined operations Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Prior to the merger  CB had a Dividend Safety Score of 84  suggesting that its dividend is extremely safe  Prior to the merger  both companies had earnings payout ratios close to 30   The combined company currently pays annual dividends of  2 68 per share  which results in a 27  payout ratio when using CB s 2016 consensus earnings estimate of  9 90 per share  This is a very healthy payout ratio that provides plenty of room for unexpected catastrophe events and offers nice room for dividend growth 
As seen below  legacy CB s payout ratios were always low and steady Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Another factor boosting CB s Dividend Safety Score is the non discretionary nature of most insurance policies  Regardless of how the economy is performing  buildings still need to be insured  protection is required from unexpected illnesses  and lives must be cared for  As a result  ACE and CB s sales fell by just 4  and 6   respectively  during fiscal year 2008 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Both companies continued generating excellent free cash flow during the recession  even despite the drop in value of their investment portfolios  The conservative approach CB takes to managing risk with its underwriting and investment portfolio helps the company endure tough times  While the insurance business requires a lot of financial capital to get started  it requires little in the way of tangible assets  resulting in great free cash flow generation Source  Simply Safe Dividends
CB has earned commendable returns on capital for shareholders over the last decade  generating a double digit return most years  While insurance is a commodity  CB s economies of scale and risk management skill have helped it outperform many of its competitors Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Regarding the balance sheet  ACE did take on around  5 billion in debt to finance its acquisition of CB  However  S P has issued CB an AA credit rating and the company s overall financial health continues to look very good 
All things considered  CB s dividend is extremely safe due to the company s low payout ratios  excellent free cash flow generation  non discretionary services  and healthy balance sheet Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Prior to the merger  CB had above average dividend growth potential with a Dividend Growth Score of 69  Prior to acquiring CB  ACE had increased its dividend for 22 consecutive years  and CB was already a dividend aristocrat with 33 consecutive dividend raises 
While the company will be busy with integration work over the next several years  the merger is expected to add to the company s earnings immediately  We expect another dividend increase in 2016 and believe it will be at a low  to mid single digit rate  Before the deal  ACE had been growing its dividend at a low single digit rate  choosing to invest most of its cash in acquisitions  CB had grown its dividend at a double digit clip in recent years ValuationCB trades at 11x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2 4   We believe this business can grow sales at a low single digit rate  legacy ACE compounded sales by 3 5  per year over the last five years  with earnings per share growing by 6 8  per year driven by cost synergies and operating leverage 
Under these assumptions  CB s stock appears to offer annual total return potential of 8 10  per year  We believe the company is reasonably valued  especially given its high business quality  However  a lot of the company s value admittedly rests on the long term outcome of the merger ConclusionACE s merger with CB comes with numerous integration risks  but it also creates opportunity for two blue chip dividend stocks to become an even greater force in the P C insurance market for years to come  We expect the combined company to generate consistent dividend growth for many years and are happy to bet on such a disciplined  conservative management team ",2016-02-12,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cb:-a-conservative-dividend-grower-in-the-insurance-industry-384470,384470
132783,354298,CB,Median Household Income Growth  Deflating The American Dream,opinion,What is the single best indicator of the   Many would point to household income growth  My study of the Census Bureau s data shows a 600 7  growth in median household incomes from 1967 through 2011  The ride has been bumpy  but it equates to a 4 5  annualized growth rate  Sounds impressive  but if you adjust for inflation using the Census Bureau s method  that nominal 600 7  total growth shrinks to 19 0   a  real  annualized growth rate of 0 4   But if we dig a bit deeper into the method of inflation adjustment  the American Dream looks more like an illusion  as in    My recent study of 21st Century monthly median household income was based on the excellent monthly data available from   See   The Sentier Research findings are based on Census Bureau  CB  data and adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers  CPI U   which most people  including the BLS  commonly abbreviate as  CPI   However  the CB s own annual data series for household income  which reaches back to 1967  uses a different index to  deflate  the nominal income data  The CB researchers adjust using the little known CPI U RS  RS stands for  research series   as the deflator for their annual data  The BLS website has relatively little information about this index  The main page that pops up on a Google search is   The page contains a link to a  that documents the monthly CPI U RS from December 1977 through December 2010 with annual averages for 1977 2010  Curiously enough  after a bit of digging on the BLS website  I found a  that extends the series through 2011  However  the CB has a version of the annual CPI U RS back to 1967  the starting year for their household income  I have not found the pre 1978 annual CPI U RS data at either the CB or BLS website  However  a couple of minutes work with Excel enabled me to construct the index for those earlier years from the CB s annual data  I ve posted the data  in Excel format  The Deflator Difference A price index  such as the CPI or the BEA s PCE price index  provides the data we need to  deflate  nominal dollar values to their real purchasing power over time  And even in stable economies  over long periods of time  the  money illusion  of nominal values can be substantial  as the chart above painfully illustrates  As I mentioned earlier  Sentier Research uses the more familiar CPI as the deflator for computing their real household income data series  Does the deflator choice make a significant difference  The answer is  It depends on your timeframe  If we look at a comparison of nominal and real household income growth since 1967  the difference between the two deflators is stunning  But  as the next chart shows  the gap between the two lines in the chart above is actually the result of differences between the two deflators in the earlier years of the 44 year period  Since the late 1990s  the two have been nearly identical  The reason is that the CPI U RS was developed with the goal of revising the earlier years of the CPI U to incorporate most of the improvements made to the index to increase its accuracy  For a better understanding of revisions  see the BLS article   PFD format  Here is a chart that shows the annual differences between the two  which are predominantly before 2000 What About Other Deflators  Another important price index for economic analysis is the BEA s PCE price index  It is the preferred measure of inflation for the Federal Reserve  and I analyze every month shortly after the BEA s Personal Income and Outlaysreport is released The next chart shows three versions of real household income growth  I ve added version deflated with PCE price index alongside the other two real series we ve been studying  I ve also included markers to facilitate our understanding of the annual changes through time  The PCE deflated version is the most optimistic of the three  The CPI adjusted version is by far the most pessimistic eal Household Income as a Leading Recession Indicator An interesting feature of the chart above  regardless of which deflator you prefer  is that median incomes began contracting before every recession  On an annual basis  incomes typically bottomed at some point after the recession ended and moved higher  The one conspicuous exception was the second half of the early 1980s double dip  Flash forward to the near present  2011 in our annual data   The median household income is still falling  And if you look at the   see the adjacent snapshot since 2008   the prospect that the 2012 median will be higher than it was in 2011 is dicey at this point  Real median income appeared to bottom in August 2011 and then rose to an interim high in December  But the 2012 monthly data for April and August show the median income bouncing around the midrange between the 2011 high and low Anyone who finds this analysis of interest should download the Sentier Research  report  PDF format   The underlying data is available from Sentier Research for a small fee  For Further Reading Here is a checklist of my recent commentaries on household income Footnote on the Alternate CPI  Experience has taught me that whenever I address the topic of inflation and various price indexes  I get several emails from fans of  asking why I didn t include the Shadowstats Alternate CPI  So  to avoid those emails  I ve created the chart below with one more deflated version of median household incomes  The new one uses the ShadowStats Alternate CPI  As the chart above suggests  the Alternate CPI is a rather bizarre outlier  What this deflator is telling us translates into something like this  The 1967 median household income of  7 143 chained in 2011 dollars would have had the purchasing power of  166 683 On a personal note  my first full time university faculty job in 1969 paid me  9 000   7 500 base plus  1 500 for teaching the summer session   Our household income that year was approximately  13 000  which would have been about 55  above the median  8 389  According to the Shadowstats CPI  our 1969 income had the purchasing power of  275 860 in 2011 dollars  Somehow  that does not  by any stretch of imagination  square with my memories of our 1969 financial situation ,2012-10-10,Doug

132787,354302,CB,Comparison Of Personal Income Reported By The IRS And Census Data,opinion,We have discussed many times in this blog that personal incomes are not well defined and the lack of a comprehensive definition does not allow any accurate estimate of income inequality  Here we compare two data sets for 2001  The IRS reported 128 227 145 people with the cumulative income of  6 37E 12  The Census Bureau  CB  found 221 591 000 people with the total income of  6 45E 12  with the working age population of 243 946 000  All figures published by the CB are obtained as a projection of about 200 000 people covered by the Current Population Survey to the working age population as a whole using so called population controls and thus the higher incomes with just few representatives are subject to large biases  The Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA  has estimated the personal income in 2001 as  8 89E 12  Therefore the IRS and the CB both reported only 72  of the gross personal income  GPI  as based on 53  and 87  of working age population  respectively  This BEA provides no personal income distribution  PID  and thus its data are worthless for the analysis of income inequality  The IRS and CB data sets are also not comprehensive since give two different and mainly independent slices of the personal income distribution  One might try to recover the overall PID from these data sets The IRS and CB provide PIDs in different income bins  This excludes any direct comparison of the relevant PIDs  The CB covers incomes between  0 and  250K with bins of  10K before and  50K above  100K  The IRS distribution spans the interval between  0 and  10M with the bin width varying from  1K to  5M  All incomes above  250K and  10M  respectively  are covered by open end bins for which the width cannot be determined  We have calculated two probability density functions  PDF  for the IRS and CB by dividing their PIDs by the widths of income bins and total population   We did not normalize to the total incomes because they are practically identical   Figure 1 presents both PDFs  These curves represent the portion of total population in  1 bins as a function of income  Between  15K and  40K  the PDFs practically coincide  Below  15K  the probability density reported by the CB is higher  and above  40K the IRS curve is above the CB one  Both curves reveal a power law distribution above approximate  70K  This allows an extension of the CB curve above its limit of  250K with a power law function with the index of  3 34 as shown in Figure 2  From Figure 1  one can conclude that the excess of 93 000 000 of people in the CB s PID is inherently related to low incomes  The IRS compensates the total income deficit associated with the lack of low incomers by a larger portion of people with higher incomes  In that sense  the CB better covers the sources of low incomes and the IRS includes more accurate sources of incomes above  50 000 In order to construct a comprehensive definition one should combine all sources on income over the whole income axis  The simplest way is to use the CB s PID below and the IRS  PID above some threshold  We have chosen the level of  75K because there are bins starting with this value for both the IRS and CB  The number of people reported by the IRS and CB with incomes above  75K is different  19 452 000 and 15 218 000  respectively  The former number is more accurate since the IRS includes almost all sources of high incomes and we consider the joint  merged IRS CB  distribution at high incomes to be that reported by the IRS  The extra 4 234 000 people with incomes above  75K might be counted in by the CB as having lower incomes  However  one cannot easily redistribute the CB s PID by extracting these four millions  Therefore  we just added 4 234 000 to 221 591 000 reported by the CB in order to calculate the basis for the corresponding PDF  This is a crude approximation but it should not introduce a large bias in the lower income bins since it is less than 2  is added  At lower incomes  we use the CB s PID  Figure 3 shows the new merged PID  black line  which includes 225 000 000 and  7 819B  The total income in the merged distribution is closer  895  to the GPI Figure 2  The high income PDFs for the IRS and CB  The actual CB PDF shown by red circles and is extended by a power law with the index of  3 34 as shown by yellow circles  The highest two values reported by the IRS lie above the power law distribution and are shown by blue squares with red contour  The expected values are shown by yellow squares  Figure 3  The merged personal income distribution  At lower incomes  we retained  5K bins instead of  10K in Figure 1  At higher incomes  the merged PID is parallel to that reported by IRS but is much lower because the normalization basis has been increased from 128M to 225M people ,2012-10-29,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comparison-of-personal-income-reported-by-the-irs-and-census-data-141491,141491

132789,354304,CB,Sector Detector  Bulls Start Their Move Into Cyclicals,opinion,The S P 500 is up 14 5  year to date through Wednesday  and the defensive sectors like healthcare  consumer staples  and utilities have done even better  But so far in May  the leaders have been industrials  consumer discretionary  energy  materials  financial  and technology  I said last week that new highs were on the horizon  but that a rotation into economically sensitive sectors  and from value into growth  would be needed to provide fuel for the next leg up  Such a rotation appears to have begun  and the major averages have indeed broken out to new highs To be sure  many market commentators have been screaming that a major correction is imminent  And the higher the bulls take it  the worse it will fall  they say  Also  consider that over the past 23 years  the Dow has reverted back to its January opening value at least once during each of those years  and 20 of those years saw a decline greater than 5  But this time might be different  I know  I know  those are famous last words  But stocks have consistently demonstrated the ability to simply churn in place to work off overbought conditions  Furthermore  consider that the market has been driven so far this year by a collaboration of reluctant bulls unhappy with the alternatives to stocks  bond refugees seeking higher income  a generally positive trajectory in the economic reports  and corporate stock buyback programs driven by the Fed s cheap money  So  this might be just the start of a real  risk on  allocation of new investment capital into cyclicals If so  that s a healthy sign of investor confidence in the US economy and in the stock market as a place to invest for the longer term  Even better  investors appear to be a broadening into cyclical sectors rather than rotating  The defensive sectors are holding up even with their lofty valuations  while the cyclicals are rising  Because defensive stocks generally offer a reasonable yield  we won t necessarily see money flee those sectors  It all looks bullish for stocks Looking at the chart of the SPY  it closed Wednesday at 163 34  After a couple of tries during April at breaking through psychological resistance at 160  SPY indeed broke out with gusto  The catalyst was encouraging reports on jobs and unemployment  Oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all made a sharp reversal back up after looking like they were rolling over Now SPY is definitely looking extended  It is at the top line of a bullish rising channel that has been in place since the November lows  and far above its 20 day simple moving averages  Bollinger Bands are quite wide  and RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all overbought  A mean reversion to the 20 day SMA is likely  but that s well within the rising channel  and would certainly be taken by bulls as yet another buying opportunity The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 12 66  which is quite low and confirms the bulls  conviction Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  business sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations 1  Financial  IYF  takes the top ranking this week with an Outlook score of 75  but the top three are essentially in a dead heat  Defensive sector Consumer Goods  IYK  scores a 73 and Technology  IYW  comes in at 72  IYF displays strong sentiment among Wall Street analysts and insiders  as well as a low forward P E  Stocks within IYK have enjoyed the best support from Wall Street  i e   net upgrades in forward earnings estimates  and strong return ratios  although valuations are getting high 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 4  It is weak in forward P E  long term projected growth  and trailing return ratios  although it has enjoyed a resurgence in Wall Street upgrades  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Basic Materials  IYM   which is seeing a continued acceleration in Wall Street earnings downgrades 3  Despite some shuffling  this week s fundamentals based rankings are similar to last week s in that I would call the bias slightly to the bullish side of neutral  Industrial  IYJ  fell while Energy  IYE  rose 4  Looking at the Bull scores  IYF  IYK  and IYE are tied as the leaders on particularly strong market days  scoring 53  followed closely by IYJ  while IYZ is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 46  The narrow top bottom spread is only 7 points  which continues to indicate high sector correlation on strongly bullish days 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is serving as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 64  while Materials  IYM  is the worst during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 45  The top bottom spread is 19 points  which continues to indicate lower correlations on weak market days  i e   it pays to be in the safe sectors when the market is bearish 6  Overall  Consumer Goods  IYK  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 179  Telecom  IYM  is the worst at 108  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities  IDU  shows an impressive total score of 111  Materials  IYM  displays the lowest score at 94  This indicates that Utilities stocks have performed the best in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish  while Materials stocks are avoided altogether These Outlook scores represent the view that Financial and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within IYF and IYK include Franklin Resources  BEN   The Chubb Corp  CB   Mohawk Industries  MHK   and Bunge Limited  BG  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned  About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-05-09,Scott

Most Attractive Stock Feature For April  The Chubb Corporation  NYSE CB 

The Chubb Corporation is one of the new additions to the Most Attractive list this month  CB makes the list due to the decrease in rank of some of the stocks ahead of it 
We are bullish on the insurance sector right now  PowerShares KBW Property   Casualty Insurance Portfolio  KBWP K  is the only ETF or mutual fund to earn our Very Attractive rating and a full 10 out of the 40 stocks on our Most Attractive list for April are insurance companies  While popular sectors like social media and cloud stocks have no profits and sky high valuations  we see these insurance stocks as having solid profitability to go along with cheap valuations 
CB might just be the very best stock in this attractive sector  CB grew after tax profit  NOPAT  by over 57  in 2013 and increased its ROIC from 11  to 16   This 16  is higher than the industry average of 11  and higher than all but five of the 50 property and casualty insurance companies we cover 
Even though CB s profits took a bit of a hit during the financial crisis  it has still grown NOPAT by 13  compounded annually over the past decade  Not many companies can match that track record of long term growth 
If we dig deeper into CB s numbers  we see strength in every element of its business  In 2013  net premiums increased in each of CB s three segments  Personal Insurance  Commercial Insurance  and Specialty Insurance  The biggest impact on NOPAT came from the 13  decline in losses and loss expenses  from  7 5 billion to  6 5 billion  Superstorm Sandy was primarily responsible for the high level of losses in 2012  and the  6 5 billion in 2013 is closer to CB s long term average 
Even if costs start to come back up to counteract CB s growth in revenues  this stock still has significant upside  At its current valuation of   88 share  CB has a price to economic book value ratio of just 0 7  which implies that NOPAT will permanently decline by 30   Given CB s strong long term prospects it deserves a much higher valuation 
Figure 1 shows just how rare it is to get this good company at such a cheap price  The gap between the stock price and economic book value is the largest it s been since the market bottomed in 2009 


Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings

If we assume CB is capable of just 2  NOPAT growth compounded annually for 15 years  a fairly low bar given its historical profit growth  the stock has a fair value of   135 share  That s a 50  premium to the current stock price if the company can just grow profits in the low single digits  If it can surpass those low expectations the upside is even greater  I like that risk reward profile for CB 

Most Dangerous Stock Feature For April  Inland Real Estate Corporation  IRC    10 50 share 

Inland Real Estate is one of the new additions to the Most Dangerous list this month 
On the opposite end of the spectrum from insurance stocks  REITs are one of my least favorite sectors  11 out of our 40 Most Dangerous Stocks this month are REITs  and we put REITs in the Danger Zone last year 
IRC is one of the worst stocks in this dangerous sector  In the ten years that our model covers  IRC has never earned positive economic earnings  It currently earns a bottom quintile ROIC of just 3   Since the financial crisis  IRC has only managed to grow NOPAT by 5  compounded annually 
What s worse  IRC is burning through cash  In three of the past four years IRC has earned a negative free cash flow  including 2013  where it burned through  240 million  23  of market cap   This negative cash flow has left IRC with an unhealthy balance sheet  as it has nearly  900 million in adjusted total debt with almost no excess cash 
Someone who just looked at IRC s P E of 10 might be tempted to think this was a cheap stock  but they would be sorely mistaken  IRC recorded a  95 million unusual gain due to the change in control of investment properties that massively distorted earnings  IRC s true NOPAT was just  43 million  not the  103 million in GAAP net income IRC reported 
Plus  IRC is dangerously expensive  In order to justify its current valuation of   10 50 share  the company would need to grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for 28 years  For a company with low returns on capital and meager profit growth in recent years  such a high expectation is unwarranted  We ve seen what happens to stocks with high valuations and low profitability in recent weeks  Look for IRC to follow suit
