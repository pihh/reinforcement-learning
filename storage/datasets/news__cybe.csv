CYBE Technical Analysis

CYBE opened trading yesterday at  34 45 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  34 75  Shares closed trading yesterday at  34 40 and spiked down after market to  30 15  equivalent to a 12  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time CYBE traded below these levels we have to go all the way back to January 16th  when it traded at  28 95 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down CYBE had been in an overall upward trend dating back to August 22nd  2016 when it traded at  16 67  CYBE has a float of 6 29 million shares and traded 1 59 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see CYBE open trading on Wednesday below  31 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down
