year 2019 earnings conference call  We certainly appreciate your time today To begin  I would like to thank the entire SDI team and their families for their extraordinary dedication and passion  2019 represented a period of market challenge  yet the team achieved numerous operational milestones  as well as a strong financial performance  record steel shipments  record fabrication shipments to name just two  2019 represented the third best year since our inception in 1993  the best testament to the superior performance of our teams and our differentiated business model And to impart clarity  Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance Theresa Wagler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Good morning  I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire Steel Dynamics team  It was a strong year with many operational milestones  as well as being one of the best years financially  Revenues of  10 5 billion derived from record steel and fabrication volumes represented our second highest annual performance  Operating income of  987 million and net income of  671 million or  3 04 per diluted share represented our third best annual performance  Cash flow from operations of  1 4 billion and EBITDA of  1 3 billion represented our second and third best performances respectively  And notably  the achievement of gaining an investment grade credit rating designation and recognition of our capital foundation and capital allocation philosophy Regarding our fourth quarter 2019 performance  net income was  121 million or  0 56 per diluted share  which includes financing costs related to our December 2019 refinancing activities of approximately  0 01 per diluted share and lower earnings result from our two planned annual maintenance outages at our Butler and Columbus flat roll divisions of approximately  0 05 per diluted share  The outages also impacted fourth quarter flat roll steel shipments by an estimated 70 000 tons to 80 000 tons Fourth quarter earnings were above our mid quarter guidance of  0 49 per diluted share to  0 53 per diluted share  primarily due to stronger than anticipated December steel shipments  Excluding these items  fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income would have been  0 62 per diluted share  above our adjusted guidance of  0 55 to  0 59 per diluted share Fourth quarter 2019 revenues were  2 4 billion  18  lower than fourth quarter 2018 sales and 6  lower than sequential third quarter results as average realized steel prices declined  Our fourth quarter 2019 operating income was  182 million  50  lower than prior year fourth quarter earnings and 20  lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower realized flat roll steel pricing  which more than offset the benefit of lower scrap costs As we discuss our business this morning  you will find we are constructive concerning underlying steel demand and optimistic concerning our unique earnings catalyst  Within our steel operations  fourth quarter shipments declined sequentially a modest 2  to 2 7 million tons  However  our steel volumes increased 3  compared to last year as value added shipments from our flat roll operations grew Our average quarterly realized external steel sales price decreased  45 per ton sequentially to  764 in the fourth quarter and average scrap cost only declined  32 per ton  causing lower steel metal margins  The result with fourth quarter steel operating income of  201 million  16  lower than third quarter results due to our planned flat roll outages  seasonally lower shipments and lower realized steel pricing For the full year 2019  our steel facilities achieved numerous production and shipment record  The platform s operating income was  1 billion  less than third    excuse me  less than record 2018 results of  1 9 billion due to lower flat roll steel metal margin  Annual overall metal spread declined from the historical highs experienced in 2018  Everyone should be proud as 2019 was a challenging steel environment based on significant customer destocking While we achieved record annual steel shipments of 10 8 million tons in 2019  we still have additional market opportunity with annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons  We continue to grow our internal manufacturing capability during 2019  It s a powerful strategic advantage to have internal processing capability to sustain higher steel mill utilization during weaker demand environment  to create optionality of supply for our customers and to allow for value added product upside in all market environments For our metals recycling platform  fourth quarter ferrous price indices declined approximately  35 per gross ton and volumes were seasonally lower  This challenging market resulted in a fourth quarter operating loss of  5 million compared to operating income of  3 million sequentially As ferrous scrap prices declined in 8 of 12 months during 2019  our metals recycling operations annual operating income decreased to  28 million in 2019 compared to  88 million in 2018  Approximately 65  of our metals recycling ferrous shipment serve our own steel mills  increasing scrap quality  melt efficiency and reducing companywide working capital  Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms  As a company  we reintroduced over 11 million tons of recycled ferrous materials and 1 1 billion pounds of recycled non ferrous materials into the manufacturing lifecycle in 2019 For our fabrication business  fourth quarter 2019 operating income of  33 million remained aligned with sequential results and was our third best quarter  The team also achieved record quarterly shipments in what is traditionally a seasonally slower timeframe  substantially offsetting a modest decline in prices  For full year 2019  our fabrication operations achieved record shipments of 644 000 tons and operating income of  119 million  almost double last year s earnings  Order activity was strong throughout 2019  supporting higher average sales prices as average steel input costs declined  resulting in margin expansion  We continue to see strong order inquiry and customer optimism  We re beginning the year with a strong project backlog Our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong  During the fourth quarter 2019  we generated  409 million of cash flow from operations and for the full year  1 4 billion  our second best year  2019 capital investments totaled  452 million  of which  205 million related to our new Sinton  Texas flat roll steel mill investment  We currently estimate 2020 full year capital investments to be in the range of  1 4 billion   1 2 billion allocated to the Sinton  Texas steel mill   60 million to complete Columbus  third galvanizing line  which should start operating mid 2020 and the remaining  140 million related to smaller growth projects or sustaining projects Regarding shareholder distributions  after a 28  increase in first quarter of 2019  we maintained our cash dividend for the fourth quarter at  0 24 per common share  We also repurchased  56 million of our common stock during the fourth quarter  totaling  349 million for the full year 2019 with  51 million remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the year  Since 2016  we ve invested  1 1 billion  repurchasing approximately 14  of our outstanding shares  We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure  consistent cash flow capability and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future  We achieved record liquidity of  2 8 billion at December 31  2019  representing  1 6 billion in cash and short term investments and  1 2 billion of available funding under our unsecured revolving credit facility Regarding our new Sinton  Texas flat roll steel mill  the investment is still expected to be approximately  1 9 billion  We just received the required environmental permits last week  allowing full construction efforts to begin with the current expectation of operations beginning mid year 2021  Based on this timeline  we estimate the remaining capital investment to be approximately  1 7 billion  again   1 2 billion to be funded in 2020 with the remaining  500 million to be funded in the first half of 2021  We ve also been awarded approximately  155 million in state and local incentive benefits that will be received over time Collectively  our primary strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over  425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis  The estimate includes our planned Sinton  Texas steel mill and the third galvanizing line at Columbus  as well as our two operational rebar expansions In October  we received an investment grade rating designation from three rating agencies  We filed this upgrade in December with the syndication of a new  1 2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the execution of our inaugural investment grade notes offering  We issued  400 million of 2 8  notes and  600 million of 3 45  notes  We used the proceeds to repay  700 million of existing 5 125  notes and for other general corporate purposes We re very appreciative and excited concerning the incredible receptiveness of the investment grade market  These transactions extended our debt maturity profile and will reduce annual interest cost  Receiving the designation of investment grade is a natural progression of our strategic growth and recognition of our strong balance sheet profile and sustainable through cash free    sustainable through cycle free cash flow generation capability Due to the strength and optionality within our capital structure and the free cash flow generating business model  we have the flexibility for continued growth and responsible shareholder distributions  while also being dedicated to preserving investment grade credit rating  Our capital allocation still prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program  We re squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable growth and optimized long term shareholder value creation For those of you that track more specifically our flat roll shipments  for the fourth quarter  we had hot roll and pickled and oiled shipments of 838 000 tons  cold roll shipments of 167 000 tons  and finally  coated shipments of 911 000 tons  Thank you  Mark Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Theresa  Thanks for the detail  I think it profiles an incredible job by an incredible team  As we ve always suggested and execute upon  safety is always    has been our number one value and our first priority  Nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe environment for our people Our 2019 incident rate crept up slightly and our lost time rate ticked up a little above our 2018 record low  But most importantly  our severity rate continue to improve in 2019  While our safety performance remained significantly better than our industry averages  it s not enough  We all must be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members around us  Safety must always be top of mind  And I challenge all of us to remain focused and to keep moving toward our ultimate goal of no injuries The fabrication platform delivered an outstanding performance  with the team achieving record annual earnings and shipments  Profit margins expanded as average 2019 product pricing rose and raw material steel input cost declined  Additionally  the fabrication platform provided increased utilization for our steel operations  purchasing over 138 000 tons of steel internally  The fabrication group is confident regarding 2020  Despite seasonality  they achieved record fourth quarter volumes  The order backlog is even stronger entering 2020 than it was this time last year  and the customer base is optimistic concerning non residential construction projects Our metals recycling team also supported our steel operations by supplying over one third of our steel mill s scrap requirements during the year  2019 was a particularly difficult in the metals recycling industry with ferrous scrap prices declining in each of eight months  The combination of trade and uncertainty around China s environmental policies also pressured recycled non ferrous prices in demand  This month over month price drop decreased earnings during the year  but within this backdrop  the team continue to focus on efficiency gains  which yielded sustainable positive results Prime scrap prices have normalized  increasing approximately  80 gross tons since October  Recovering from the tepid demand environment caused by lower metal utilization rates manifested by numerous maintenance outages and coupled with an uptick in export activity  A stable or rising market should return the recycling platform to more normalized earnings Longer term  with steady scrap supply from the manufacturing base and the potential for additional scrap substitute production in the United States  we believe scrap supply will outpace demand  creating a positive steel mill    steel margin environment  Steel team delivered a strong performance with record 2019 shipments and numerous production records  Our steel processing and conversion locations also supported our steel mills  Including the fabrication platform  we transferred over 1 4 million tons of steel internally or about 13  of our total 2019 steel shipments Our manufacturing businesses provide a powerful utilization level for our steel mills  increasing through cycle utilization  thereby compressing fixed costs and supporting solid cash flow generation  Even though 2019 was one of our best years  it was challenged by high customer steel inventories throughout the supply chain as many customers purchased beyond normal demand levels in 2018  Our domestic steel demand remained steady through the year  inventory destocking drove flat roll steel prices lower  As an example  average 2019 hot roll coil price indices decreased over  225 per ton  Fortunately pricing firmed in the fourth quarter as destocking subsided and inventory levels were rightsized Long product steel pricing and shipments remained pressured by excess domestic supply and continued import competition  However  we are seeing the benefits from our recent investments in product diversification and supply chain differentiation  helping to offset some of these market pressures  Underlying domestic steel demand remains intact for the primary steel consuming sectors  including automotive and construction  Additionally  steel consumed by the pipeline infrastructure for the collection and distribution of liquids and gases continues to be strong and we expect it to remain so as the U S  continues its energy independence journey We believe North American steel consumption will continue to improve with Mexican growth outpacing that of the U S  based on meaningful increases in Mexico s manufacturing base  Furthermore  we believe the U S  trade position will continue to support moderated steel imports  And then coupled with the increased domestic steel content requirements included in the recent USMCA for automotive producers  provides a positive landscape for domestic steel production We continue to competitively position Steel Dynamics for the future through optimization of our existing operations and differentiated growth investments  During 2019  we invested over  385 million in our steel platform  And specifically  in the first quarter  we completed a 240 000 ton rebar expansion at our structural and rail division  This differentiated rebar supply chain model is expected to meaningfully enhance customer optionality and flexibility  providing significant logistics  yield and working capital benefits for our customers  Included in our 2018 Roanoke Bar    rebar investment  we now have 440 000 tons of rebar capability  shipping 40  of this volume in 2019  Market dependent  we plan to increase rebar shipments to over 375 000 tons in 2020 Within the flat roll group  the 2018 acquisition of Heartland provides value added product diversification  The Heartland team achieved record annual shipments with no additional staffing in 2019  The 500 000 ton plus shipping volume represented over 60  of their expected 800 000 ton planned run rate  In 2020  we plan to hire additional team members to increase utilization to over 80   Additionally  by allocating lighter gauge flat roll production to Heartland  our Butler flat roll division has increased its value added production output  setting new volume records  I would like to applaud the Heartland team for a highly successful integration into our family We re also in the process of value added growth at our Columbus flat toll division  Columbus has transformed its product offering through the addition of the paint line and the introduction of more complex grades of flat roll steel  The diversion of product to these diversified value added outlets has reduced the volume of product available to our existing galvanized steel customers To address this    the lack of sufficient galvanizing capability  we are building a third galvanizing line at Columbus  The  140 million 400 000 ton galvanizing line will begin operations mid 2020  While satisfying our customer demand  the product realignment will decrease Columbus  hot roll coil exposure  allowing for an existing customer base in the region to provide a good baseload for our new Texas steel facility  And we continue to become even more excited about the material growth  the construction of this new next generation Sinton  Texas flat roll steel mill will deliver Our construction and start up team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction  start up and operation of large steel manufacturing assets  Collectively  we believe they have more experience than exist in any other company in the industry  The core group began site work in the second half of 2019  And we re excited to announce the recent receipt of the required environmental permitting to allow for full construction efforts to begin  The Texas mill will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steel making facilities with state of the our environmental processes  Our existing steel mills literally have a fraction of the energy intensity  about 11  and greenhouse gas emission intensity of average world steel making technology There is a tremendous amount of excitement  both internally at SDI and outside as we continue to add engineers and professionals to the onsite team  We are moving fast and building our team  The new state of the art 3 million ton steel mill will include value added coating lines comprised of a 550 000 ton galvanizing line and a 250 000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability The Texas mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers  competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model than foreign competition  The mill will have the capability to produce higher strength tougher grades of flat roll steel for the energy and automotive markets  This is due to having a thicker cast section and a more conventional two stage hot rolling process  which allows for thermal mechanical rolling  The mill will be capable of 84 inch wide  one inch thick 100 ksi hot roll coil  product that is unavailable in the United States today  Additionally  larger weight coils will provide energy pipe producers intrinsic cost and yield savings  The configuration will also allow us to ship certain plate products on a limited basis  providing further product diversification Steel mill is strategically located in Sinton  Texas  which is adjacent to Corpus Christi  The site has significant competitive advantages  including geographic market position  power accessibility  freight benefits  water availability and constructability  The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to the current supply chain Compared to the current domestic supply options  we expect the potential custom savings to be a minimum of  20 to  30 per ton and for some much higher  In addition  customers will be able to place orders with a much shorter lead time  providing significant delivery and working capital advantages  We have the opportunity to provide steel in terms of weeks versus months These benefits provide a differentiated supply chain solution  allowing us to effectively compete with imports arriving in from Houston and the West Coast  which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risks  These advantages will also give the North American pipe producers a competitive supply chain to once again compete with the foreign pipe producers that have dominated their market Customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier  And we have several customers already committed to locate onsite with us  representing over 800 000 tons    annual tons of local steel processing and consumption capability  From a raw material perspective  our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management agreements  much of which is prime scrap  We also plan to cost effectively source pig iron through the port system  so we are confident in our ability to procure high quality raw materials in the region We have three targeted regional sales markets  representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption  And we believe this will increase in the coming years as Mexico continues to grow  We have 7 million tons from the four state region of Texas  Oklahoma  Louisiana and Arkansas  which has limited domestic regional supply and relies heavily on imports  Sinton lies in close proximity for both rail and truck delivery in this region There are 4 million tons of consumption from the underserved West Coast region  which also relies heavily on imports  and approximately 16 million tons from the growing Northern and Mid Central Mexican regions  In 2018  the Mexican market imported 7 5 million tons of flat roll steel  Based on their growing manufacturing base  we believe Mexican demand growth will continue to outpace supply  making this an even more attractive underserved market in the coming years  Sinton is one of the most freight advantage shipments into this region from the U S We ve been developing our flat roll steel strategy for these regions in Mexico for several years  We ve been cultivating both customer and scrap relationships  And we are confident in the long term strategic value and investment profile this project provides  We thank the Sinton community for their continued enthusiastic support and truly look forward to growing together in the future We believe our unique operating culture coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost effective and highly profitable steel mills  positions us well to execute the strategic initiative  To be clear  we re not just adding flat roll steel production capacity  we re at    we re expanding a whole SDI business model into the Southwest and into Mexico  We will have a differentiated product portfolio  We will have a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage  We will effectively compete with steel imports  And we have targeted regional markets In conclusion  our unique culture and the execution of our long term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long term value creation  differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability  as recently recognized by our investment grade rating designation Our exceptional team provides the foundation for our success  I am proud of our recent inclusion as one of the world s most admired companies by Fortune Magazine  It is a testament to our incredible team  Each one contributes  each one has an impact  And I thank each and every one of you for your passion and commitment to excellence  Remember that we say for yourselves  your team and your families  We re committed to providing exemplary long term value to our fellow colleagues  communities  customers and shareholders and look forward to creating new opportunities for all So again  thank you for your time today  Melissa  please open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies  Please proceed with your question Martin Englert    Jefferies Equity Research Americas    AnalystHi  Good morning  everyone Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Martin Englert    Jefferies Equity Research Americas    AnalystWithin the release and prepared remarks you had noted expectations of modest demand growth in North America  What percentage growth do you think that implies  And perhaps if you can provide a little bit more detail may be on specific end markets  puts and takes whether you re expecting ongoing growth and perhaps contraction Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  certainly  I think we are incredibly constructive on the market in general going into 2020 and 2021 to be    for that matter  because again  underlying demand last year didn t dissipate  The whole price drop was sort of a drawdown  a destocking of customer inventory and that obviously is reversed here in the last couple of months of the year and going into 2020  And so it s a very positive market  You have the two principal markets  flat roll markets  automotive and construction in great  great shape  and that represents 60   70  of the market There is incredible optimism on the construction side  new millennium building systems  Our fabrication platform has incredible business going into the year and I think that bodes incredibly well for construction in general  And it also parallels with our pre paint building products on the flat roll side  So construction  we believe  is going to be very strong in the year As I mentioned earlier  we think the energy  sort of pipeline infrastructure is going to be strong for the year and for the next two or three years as we go down that path of energy independence and drawing all of those energy products down to the coast for export  Downhaul  Phonetic  energy is a little weak perhaps  But again  the improving demand environment  and if you look at our order books  generally  they ve been very  very strong  Pricing is very  very robust  Lead times have stretched out  The 232 tariffs have had their impact  but just the trade environment in general is very positive  And obviously  the passage of the USMCA is already garnering results  What we re certainly seeing    sort of auto producers that were bringing material in from Asia and from Europe looking for domestic sourcing and we ve been the beneficiary and we ve been picking up dramatic amount of markets further On the long product side  again  pretty bullish there  I think some of the cloud of uncertainty is lifting a little bit and there s general optimism  And as I ve said in the past calls  engineered bar is our sort of bellwether for the steel consuming environment  And generally  they re seeing a pretty strong uptick  A lot of that or some of that could be just that customers overshot  Phonetic  the destocking and then restocking  but we truly believe underlying demand is robust Automotive is strong there  We ve seen a very  very strong pickup in our supply to coat finishes  There s even a pickup in the seamless tube market  Trailers yield    trailer is a little flat but even goods is picking up  So we re seeing good strong benefit there  And then obviously it will benefit Pittsburgh and structural rail division as they send more blooms down to    there for conversion Roanoke business much in shapes  is OK  In structural rail division  I think we re seeing a little softness  a little softening in rail capex from the managed railroads  but we seem to be picking up market share  the team has done a phenomenal job  We produced some of the highest quality rail in the world and we re penetrating the transit and high speed rail environment  So that s a good business for us  And again  parallel plans in the structural arena  we see that being pretty solid through the year So generally  I think it s going to be a very good year  a much more positive year in 2019 Martin Englert    Jefferies Equity Research Americas    AnalystOkay  thanks  I appreciate all the color there  And congratulations on the execution in challenging environment Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate it  Thank you Theresa Wagler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Martin OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your question Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank Securities  Inc     AnalystHi  Mark  and Theresa  Thanks for taking my question  The main thing I wanted to ask you about  just in the shorter term  just trying to link together scrap imports and the recent strength in HRC  Phonetic  pricing and your comments on more normalized inventory levels  Have you seen anything just recently with talk that scrap is going to be down in February on the customer behavior side that may change where people restock destock and just the outlook maybe for the next couple of months  If you could comment on that first  Thanks Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerRuss  do you want to comment on the scrap Russ Rinn    Executive VIce President of Metals Recycling  President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSourceSure  Thanks  Chris  Again  as we look at scrap in 2019  we certainly had a very  very tough environment  I think the pricing levels overshot where they probably should have been and we ve seen some of that come back in the last part of the year  I think as we start into 2020  we re anticipating a more normalized year  some ups  some downs  but no rate    no substantial moves like we had last year  And in the short term  I think we re looking at kind of a soft side where certainly the offshore pricing has declined slightly  But part of that s going to be offset we believe with the increased steel mill utilization domestically  So we re not looking for any major changes  I think the trend would be down slightly  but not a significant push down Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think the weather in the Midwest is pretty moderate  so flows are relatively strong on the obsolete cut grades  We see very  very strong flow in prime grade steel  obviously industrial business and most importantly  automotive plants are very  very strong  So the flow of scrap is good  And then during the year  I think you re going to see some additional sort of HBI alternative  iron units come online  So we see a pretty stable raw material environment with a strong product environment and I think that bodes very  very well for spreads for the year Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank Securities  Inc     AnalystOkay  thanks  Thanks  Mark and team for the comments  Just a follow up on    maybe you could just discuss a little bit more your expectations on the imports for the year  Obviously  it came down a lot last year  Your comments that they should come down further in 2020  predicated on the parity pricing or are there other factors at play there  Thanks Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerObviously  between the Section 201 countervailing duty and I don t thing trade cases that have been with us for some time and will remain with us for a good long time as well and the 232  We saw considerable moderation in imports through the year  last year  I think that will continue  Obviously the arbitrage to European and Asian pricing is not totally attractive for folks to look offshore  So again  I think imports will be moderated Chris Terry    Deutsche Bank Securities  Inc     AnalystOkay  That s all for me  Thanks guys Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS  Please proceed with your question Andreas Bokkenheuser    UBS Securities    AnalystYes  Thank you very much  and good morning  everyone  I m kind of just staying within the same line of questions  Most of the rhetoric we re getting  especially from the service centers  downstream steel buyers seems to be somewhat cautious  So I m just  I m just wondering what you think the market is missing here because to Terry s point  scrap is probably going to come down  There s a lot of rhetoric suggesting that the steel price hike or hikes as we ve seen them over the last three months have been mostly driven by higher scrap prices  whereas apparent U S  steel demand as a whole has actually been declining  The futures price  flat steel futures prices have taken a pretty meaningful step down as well  suggesting that steel prices could drop  30   50 a ton from here  And we re going into an election year  which seems to suggest a lot of people are very cautious about how they re going to be spending capex and consumer spending as well  So I m just wondering  your rhetoric is always a little bit more constructive on how you re seeing the market  So what do you think    how do you    what do you think the market is missing at this point in time Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  all I can say is or comment on the market through our lens  And as I suggested  the    our backlogs are very  very strong right now  They re incredibly strong  our new millennium building systems  which would suggest that the construction world is going to have a very  very good year  The distribution warehouse business in that arena is incredibly strong  So construction  we do believe is going to be robust  Automotive  it has been running at a relatively record pace and the prognostication is that OK  may be off a little  but it s going to continue to be strong As we look through the lens of engineered bar  which I suggested earlier is our bellwether  that s very  very healthy business and is looking better now than it has for a couple of years  going into the year  Flat roll remains very strong  Coated products  and obviously we re the largest non automotive coater in the States  That is very  very strong for us Russ Rinn    Executive VIce President of Metals Recycling  President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSourceSo again  we can only see what we see and we can only hear what we hear from our customers and there is general optimism out there  Part of that strength could be a little restocking as people overshopped  Phonetic  last year  and that tends to happen  People buy too much then they go to short  But underlying demand in our mind is very  very solid Andreas Bokkenheuser    UBS Securities    AnalystThat s very clear  Maybe a follow up on that  Do you see that a lot of the strength in your order book may also be driven by inorganic growth  I mean  you re effectively taking market share potentially from some of your peers in the market  Is that fair to say Russ Rinn    Executive VIce President of Metals Recycling  President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSourceI think it s fair to say in the automotive arena in particular  And in the pre paint  I don t think we re taking any further market share because our lines are running flat out and we can t produce anymore  But with our Sinton plant  with added capability  we will continue to add there  But yes  on automotive  we are picking up I think market share  The rest of our business is more sort of straightforward market Andreas Bokkenheuser    UBS Securities    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much  That s very clear  I appreciate you answering my questions Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good morning Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Phil Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  Mark  If we could stick on automotive just for now  can you give us a picture in terms of how much of your business right now  particularly in the sheet and SBQ arena is going into automotive  And maybe give us a view of where you are today versus where you thought you d be when Columbus is going through their mix transition  And then also where you re trying to go Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerPhil  Barry will give you some clarity there Barry Schneider    Senior Vice President  Flat Roll Steel GroupHello  Phil  The automotive share we have is continuing to grow through the Columbus operation  There s a lot of different things we re doing with our auto team directly that is relatively in the last five years to Steel Dynamics  And a lot of those awards are as a Tier 1    to Tier 1 suppliers to directly to automotive  So those continue to grow  We do always enjoy good business out of the Butler facility with automotive and that remained strong  So not only supplying service centers  but directly  We continue to grow  as Mark indicated  getting new market shares  we are awarded new parts and our capabilities increase  So as a whole  typically  somewhere between 15  to 20  is automotive shipments coming out of our flat roll plants Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Barry Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerChris  from an SBQ standpoint Chris Graham    Senior Vice President  Downstream Manufacturing GroupYeah  Phil  this is Chris Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  Chris Chris Graham    Senior Vice President  Downstream Manufacturing GroupOn the SBQ side  we re starting to leverage our existing and new found relationships in the flat roll in the automotive group to open up opportunities for SBQ  We ve    recently  the team has recently achieved some new automotive certifications that allow us to lever our new inspection and testing equipment and our new rolling capacity there  So although it may be a relatively small number at our SBQ  the plan is to grow  and I think the team is positioned well to do so Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerTo be perhaps a little more specific  At Columbus  we    as Barry said  we re on platforms  Well  our market share has picked up already  but we re on platforms over the next 12 months to 18 months to pick up  Probably 500 000 tons will be coming out of Columbus into direct automotive  And obviously when the Sinton plant comes online  we believe about 1 million tons will be going to Mexico and predominantly into the automotive arena  And if you just step back and look at automotive for us  more generally  our traction has been incredibly quick and fast  So the automotive will be tendered in the past to react very slowly  Obviously the USMCA is driving a lot of that as folks are looking for domestic content  And they look to us  first and foremost  I think to our balance sheet  They want to partner with someone that s going to be around for the next 10 years  20 years  30 years  and our balance sheet is more solid than some folks I would say They also look at our sustainability model  Obviously there s a lot of Europeans and a lot of our traction has been with the European automakers  BMW  Mercedes  VW  And they see our sustainability story has been very  very persuasive  the fact that we will repurpose 10 million  11 million tons of scrap each year  We re repurposing about 1 billion pounds of non ferrous and that s a considerably more positive things with our ESG sustainability story  So they re attracted to that and they re also attracted to our product development  So we are gaining a lot of market share  a lot of traction with the automotive industry in general Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  Mark  And Barry  you said 15  to 20   were you talking just the overall flat roll business  Is that what you were speaking Theresa Wagler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  Barry was actually speaking to our total steel shipments  We tend to be somewhere between 14  and 15  automotive Phil Gibbs    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  I have another one  but I ll pass it on  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Cosgrove with Bloomberg  Please proceed with your question Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg LP    AnalystHi  Mark  Theresa  Thanks for taking my question  Just had a quick one on long product shipments  Obviously  they were down 10  in 2019 and construction markets  you guys see them recovering this year  So where would we see volumes pick up if that materializes Theresa Wagler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFrom a volume perspective  on the long product side  I think couple of things  One is the ramp up of the rebar projects at both Roanoke and the structural rail division should have a positive impact from gaining market share with the differentiated supply chain model that we have at those locations and the fact that we ll be the only independent rebar producer in those regions  So we should be able to get improved volumes related to that In addition  the structural rail division has additional capacity  They were only operating around 75  to 80  of their capacity last year  So when we mentioned that we have over 2 million tons of additional capability  a lot of that is in the long products region  And then additionally  Mark mentioned the SBQ  and Chris  I think you would think there was opportunity in SBQ  is that correct Chris Graham    Senior Vice President  Downstream Manufacturing GroupThat s correct Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerJust to emphasize  when you look at the structural mill  heavy mill  which is where we roll our rail that has been kind of at a 100  utilization for some time  Our medium section mill is where we ve been struggling  And that s where some of the rebar  not some  all the rebar there is produced  But we re in the good position and we haven t been there for a long  long time  The medium section mill is pretty well at full utilization  Is that right  Chris Chris Graham    Senior Vice President  Downstream Manufacturing GroupYeah Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo it is turning  it s positive Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg LP    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then just one more on Heartland  I know in the middle of 2019  I think the target utilization rate by the second half was to get to 70  being mentioned before  slightly over 60   I guess a little over 500 000 tons  Is that kind of demand oriented or was it more employee driven  As you had mentioned  you re hiring more people for next year and looking to get to 80   so just kind of gauging the impact there  I guess  how close you could get to target next year as far as Heartland is concerned Barry Schneider    Senior Vice President  Flat Roll Steel GroupYeah  We continue to develop markets for the Heartland    for the Heartland operations  And right now  internally  a lot of the growth at Heartland has been through debottlenecking our finished goods production and painted production through the Butler and Jeffersonville facilities  So a lot of the development has been internally being able to get more products or paint lines where we could bring more value So as we look to external shipments  we ve been right on the edge of where we need to add people  and really just the teams finding new ways to get higher productivity out of what they re doing  So the last thing we do is bring people in because we want to make sure it s a sustainable growth  So we continue to find those markets and particularly in the cold roll steel sales  which is something that  because of our galvanizing campaigning  we typically haven t done as much cold roll sales  So we continue to make good ground there  but really internally  it s been great to get our paint lines just fully utilized and fully develop those products and those customers Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg LP    AnalystOkay  great  That s it for me Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think you can expect that we shipped 500 000 tons a little    a little over the last year and that we ll be ramping up through the year to that 750 000 ton to 800 000 ton level  That s not going to happen this month or next month  But I think as Barry said  as we gain new markets  you re going to see that ramp up through the year Andrew Cosgrove    Bloomberg LP    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much for taking my questions and good luck throughout the rest of 2020 Mark Millett    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session  I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr  Millett for any closing comments Mark Millett

still on the line  we truly appreciate everything you do for us  I just want to emphasize that  hey  let s be safe out there and make sure that your fellow teammates are safe as well  So thank you

101626,323141,STLD,Steel Dynamics Stock Scores  Record  Q4    And Share Price Drops,news,"Thursday should have been a great day for Steel Dynamics  NASDAQ STLD  shareholders  It wasn t 
On Wednesday after close of trading  Steel Dynamics released its financial results for fiscal fourth quarter 2019 and for the full year as well  Steel shipments for the year set a new record of 10 8 million tons  and revenues reaped from those shipments     10 5 billion    were the company s second best ever performance in an earnings year  Profits on those revenues  too  were impressive     671 million on the bottom line  the company s third best performance ever  and Steel Dynamics generated positive operating cash flow of  1 4 billion  its second best performance for a full earnings year  
To top it all off  in Q4 in particular  Steel Dynamics reported sales of  2 4 billion  and adjusted profits of  0 62  both numbers ahead of analyst estimates  All of this raises the obvious question  If Steel Dynamics is doing so great  why is Steel Dynamics stock down today  by more than 2   

Good news  bad news
Let s dig a little deeper and find out  beginning with those quarterly results 
On the one hand  yes  Steel Dynamics beat earnings with a pro forma profit of  0 62 in Q4  But because of the effect of various one time items  the cost of refinancing debt  reduced flat roll steel shipments from planned maintenance outages that reduced earnings  and other factors   Steel Dynamics  actual GAAP earnings for the quarter were only  0 56 per share 
Whichever of these numbers you choose to focus on  moreover  the fact remains that Steel Dynamics earned a staggering  1 17 per share in last year s Q4    and so Steel Dynamics  Q4 2019 earnings were still down by about half from a year ago  Likewise  Steel Dynamics beat on sales in the quarter  Nonetheless  the  2 4 billion in revenue collected in Q4 2019 was down about 18  from the  2 9 billion reaped in Q4 2018 
In short  even if Steel Dynamics scored a record year in 2019  the final quarter of that year was something of a disappointment  Moreover  record year or not  2019 as a whole was a bit of a letdown after the utterly fantabulous year Steel Dynamics enjoyed in 2018  This past year saw sales slide 11  for Steel Dynamics  and profits drop 43  
What comes next
Will 2020 be better 
Adding color to the black and white numbers of its report  Steel Dynamics CEO Mark Millett highlighted a host of difficulties that may be adding to investors  nervousness about this stock in the new year  Because  many customers purchased beyond normal demand levels in 2018   contributing to that year s stunningly successful results  this left these same customers with  high customer steel inventories  in 2019  leading customers to destock inventories  dampening demand  and causing steel prices to decline throughout the year  confided the CEO 
The good news is that pricing appears to have firmed in the fourth quarter  Destocking has subsided  says management  and customer inventory levels are now right sized as we head into 2020 
Millett notes that Steel Dynamics  customers are sounding  positive concerning the business outlook for 2020   and Steel Dynamics  own backlogs are back above where they were at this point in time in 2019  Consequently  while Millett declined to give specific guidance on what Steel Dynamics is looking for in its numbers in 2020  he noted that North American steel market dynamics look positive this year  with at least modest growth likely    and potentially more than modest growth if  possible trade actions     have a positive impact in further reducing unfairly traded steel imports into the United States  
The upshot for investors
In fact  that may be the most important line in Steel Dynamics  entire report 
After all  if 2018 s results benefited largely from the Trump Administration s tariffs on steel imports competing with Steel Dynamics  and they did   and 2019 s results were hurt by the lifting of some of these tariffs  and they were   then the biggest hope for a recovery in Steel Dynamics  profits in 2020 may be     the hope for new tariffs in the New Year ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmikf,2067419

101662,323177,STLD,A Tough Year For Steel Stocks  Will 2020 Bring Good Tidings ,opinion,With 2019 nearing its end  it has been an underwhelming year for stocks in the steel space  In particular  U S  steel stocks had been out of favor for most of this year  The American steel industry reeled under the effects of weaker steel prices  demand slowdown across major markets and damaging impacts of trade war The Trump administration s imposition of 25  steel tariffs provided a shot in the arm to American steel makers last year and drove their earnings  However  after an initial tariff induced rally  U S  steel prices had been on a downswing and were down for much of this year  Lower prices have hurt the bottom lines of domestic steel companies through the first three quarters of 2019 Shares of U S  steel companies gained some ground recently on some recovery in steel prices  optimism surrounding the U S  China trade deal and the news of revival of tariffs on steel imports from Brazil and Argentina  The Trump administration had earlier exempted these two countries from the tariffs last year  The revival of tariffs is a positive development as Brazil is a major exporter of steel to the United States However  shares of major American steel makers such as United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   have underperformed the broader market thus far in 2019  Notably  U S  Steel s shares have cratered roughly 28  year to date While shares of Nucor  the biggest U S  steel maker  are in the positive territory this year  its stock performance is nothing worth writing home about  The company s shares took a beating last week after it issued downbeat earnings view for the fourth quarter  Steel Dynamics  stock performance has also been less than impressive However  AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   has bucked the trend and outperformed the S P 500 so far this year  AK Steel s shares surged earlier this month after leading iron ore miner Cleveland Cliffs Inc    NYSE CLF   announced the acquisition of the former in an all stock deal worth  1 1 billion Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel currently have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  What Hurt Steel Stocks in 2019 The slump in domestic steel prices has been the major headwind faced by U S  steel makers in 2019  The benchmark hot rolled coil steel  HRC  prices felt gravity s pull this year after rallying to multi year highs on the back of steel tariffs during 2018 U S  steel prices marched higher during the first half of 2018  courtesy of steel tariffs  However  after the initial euphoria fizzled out  prices tracked downward in the back half of the year and dropped through the first three quarters of 2019  In fact  U S  steel prices have fallen back to the pre tariff levels this year  Prices are still well below their peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  reached in July 2018 Higher domestic supply resulting from a ramp up in production has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year  Driven by the tariff impetus  U S  steel mills rushed to bring back capacity and drive production las year  leading to oversupply in the market  The global economic downturn and waning steel demand are other key factors for the decline in prices American steel producers are contending with slowing steel demand  especially in automotive  The Trump administration s protectionist policies and bitter tariff war with China have largely contributed to the slowdown in the world economy  A slowdown in global manufacturing activity  partly due to trade war  is hurting demand for steel  Softness across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy has led to demand weakness Although U S  steel makers hailed the tariffs  their imposition has dealt a sledgehammer blow to major industries including automotive that are key consumers of steel  The steel tariffs have driven up manufacturing costs across these industries  The automotive industry  which consumes a big chunk of steel  is among the industries that has been hit the hardest Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid prolonged trade tensions with the United States has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer of the commodity  Sluggish automotive and construction sectors are also hurting steel demand in Europe  while demand in the United States is mostly hit by weakness in automotive Will 2020 be Any Better After a freefall  U S  steel prices appear have bottomed out and are gaining some traction of late  Major U S  steel mills have been raising prices over the past several weeks in a bid to reverse the downswing in domestic steel prices  Moreover  some of the U S  steelmakers have recently taken steps to reduce excess capacity  partly through idling of plants  in the wake of falling prices  Capacity cuts have contributed to the recent decline in U S  steel production Driven by the consecutive price hike actions by flat rolled and plate mills and lower production  HRC prices turned upward in November from the three year low level reached in October  Prices have also gained some upward momentum this month  Tighter domestic supply coupled with steel mills  continued push for price hikes are expected to lend support to U S  steel prices going into 2020 The recent uptick in scrap prices  which had been down for much of this year  could also drive up domestic finished steel prices  Although a meaningful recovery is not expected to materialize over the near term  it is needless to say that higher prices would still provide a respite to domestic steel makers next year However  the demand side of the equation doesn t look promising going into 2020  The World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   expects global steel demand growth to slow on a year over year basis in 2020 The WSA envisions demand growth to decelerate to 1 7  in 2020 from a projected 3 9  rise this year  The projection takes into account an expected slowdown in demand in China amid a faltering domestic economy   Demand growth in China is projected to slow to 1  next year from an expected 7 8  growth in 2019  per the WSA While strength in the country s real estate sector bodes well for steel demand  a slumping manufacturing sector due to a cooling Chinese economy would be a deterrent  China s automobile sales dropped year over year in November for the 17th straight month amid a slowing economy and tariff war with the United States  Overall vehicle sales slipped 3 6  year over year for the month  per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers   CAAM    The world s largest automobile market looks to be on track for contraction for the second year The demand scenario in the United States is also uninspiring  The WSA envisions U S  steel demand growth to slow to 1  in 2019 from 2 1  last year and further decelerate to a paltry 0 4  growth in 2020  A weakening manufacturing sector is expected to limit demand growth Nevertheless  the de escalation in U S  China trade tensions  at least for now  due to the announcement of the phase one trade deal would instil confidence in the reeling U S  steel industry Although the demand environment is not expected to get better given the global slowdown  a recovery in steel prices and easing trade tensions would nevertheless bode well for American steel companies heading into the new

101664,323179,STLD,5 Solid Steel Stocks To Buy As Industry Eyes Recovery In 2020,opinion,The year 2019 had been a tough one for the steel industry  Lower steel prices and weaker demand across major steel end use markets amid a global economic slowdown and trade tensions put the industry on thin ice last year The U S  steel industry  in particular  had a rough ride in 2019 notwithstanding the Trump administration s efforts to protect it through hefty tariffs on steel imports  The American steel industry was plagued by a slump in U S  steel prices  demand slowdown and damaging impacts of the U S  China trade war  All these lured investors away from the steel space last year The sharp decline in domestic steel prices was the major headwind faced by U S  steel makers in 2019  The

2019  hurting the bottom lines of U S  steel companies U S  steel stocks also remain subdued for most of 2019 amid the headwinds  Nevertheless  prices gained some ground towards the end of the year on a recovery in steel prices  optimism surrounding the initial U S  China trade deal and the news of revival of tariffs on steel imports from Brazil and Argentina  These two South American nations were earlier exempted from steel tariffs in 2018 Most of the American steel stocks racked up decent gains in share prices last month  suggesting an improvement in underlying steel market conditions  However  most of them still underperformed the broader market in 2019 Is there a rebound in the cards after a gloomy 2019  Let s take a look Recovery in Steel Prices to Bring Better TidingsThere have been some green shoots of recovery in steel prices over the past couple of months  raising hopes for a reversal of fortunes in 2020  After a freefall  U S  steel prices appear to have bottomed out  Prices gained some traction during the fourth quarter of 2019  Major U S  steel mills raised prices during this period in a bid to reverse the downswing in domestic steel prices  Some of the U S  steelmakers have also taken steps to reduce excess capacity  partly through idling of plants Driven by the consecutive price hike actions by flat rolled and plate mills and lower production  HRC prices turned upward in November from the three year low level reached in October  Prices also gained some upward momentum in December  HRC prices hit  600 per short ton  st  during the month  Meanwhile  global steel prices are also firming up of late on U S  China trade deal prospects Tighter domestic supply coupled with steel mills  continued push for price hikes are expected to lend support to U S  steel prices over the near term  It is needless to say that higher prices would provide a respite to domestic steel makers and drive up their margins Trade Deal to Remove UncertaintiesA slowdown in global manufacturing activity  partly due to trade war  has hurt demand for steel  Softness across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy has led to demand weakness While the tariffs were lauded by U S  steel makers  they badly hit major industries including automotive that are key consumers of steel  The steel tariffs have driven up manufacturing costs across these industries  The automotive industry  which consumes a big chunk of steel  is among the industries that has been hit the hardest Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid prolonged trade tensions with the United States triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer of the commodity Washington and Beijing  last month  agreed to a phase one trade deal that averted the implementation of a new round of tariffs on each others  products which were scheduled to take effect on Dec 15  Moreover  the Trump administration would reduce the 15  tariff on about  120 billion of Chinese imports to 7 5   The countries are expected to sign the trade deal in Washington on January 15 The de escalation in U S  China trade tensions  at least for now  due to the announcement of the preliminary trade deal would remove clouds of uncertainties and concerns over trade of steel and also restore confidence in the reeling U S  steel industry  It is also expected to lead to an improved demand scenario for steel 5 Steel Stocks Worth a Bet NowA material improvement in the demand environment for steel is not expected anytime soon given the global slowdown  However  a recovery in steel prices and easing trade tensions would nevertheless bode well for steel companies in 2020  With these tailwinds in place  2020 could usher in a rebound in steel

101665,323180,STLD,U S  Steel Imports Drop 15  In 2019 Under Weight Of Tariffs ,opinion,Much to the respite of American steel makers  total U S  steel imports have dropped 15  in 2019   according to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers The decline largely reflects the impact of the 25  tariff on steel imports which the Trump administration had levied in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 According to the AISI  total and finished domestic steel imports are down 15  and 17 9  year over year  respectively  in 2019 to roughly 28 66 million net tons and 21 08 million net tons  respectively  The AISI noted that these figures are based on Commerce Department s most recent Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis   SIMA   data  The data include SIMA permits for December and final imports for November Finished steel import market share was 19  for the year  That is down from 23  clocked in 2018  For December  finished steel import market share was estimated at 15  The biggest offshore suppliers for 2019 were South Korea with 2 606 000 net tons  down 6  year over year   Japan with 1 256 000 net tons  down 9   and Germany with 1 046 000 net tons  down 22   Tariffs   A Relief for U S  Steel MillsThe Trump administration  in March 2018  imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  defying a wave of criticism and threats of counter measures from major foreign trade partners  The tariffs  which have made imports more expensive  are nearing the end of their second year The tariffs are aimed at rescuing the domestic steel and aluminum industries which had long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and has suffered significant reduction in production and employment  They are  in particular  targeted at countries with which the United States has significant trade deficits While the tariffs on steel imports badly hit certain major industries including automotive that are key consumers of steel  they provided a breather to American steel makers and have put the wind back into the sails of the long struggling U S  steel industry  The tariffs have boosted production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  They have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry Per the AISI  U S  steel mills operated at 82  of their capacity for the week ending Jan 4  Capability utilization rate for the week also rose from 79 4  a year ago U S  steel imports fell roughly 12  in 2018  Imports also declined in 2019 as a result of the tariffs despite complete exemptions of Canada and Mexico  two major sources of steel imports to the United States  The United States  in May 2019  reached a deal to lift steel and aluminum tariffs from Canada and Mexico  These major trade partners have long been pushing the Trump administration to repeal the tariffs  The deal paved the road for the ratification the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    President Trump  in early December 2019  announced that he is restoring tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina  Trump accused these countries of devaluing their currencies which hurt American farmers  The White House had exempted these two countries from the tariffs in 2018 as they continued to negotiate over trade terms  However  the Trump administration later in December backtracked on its decision to reimpose tariffs on Brazilian imports  Brazil is a major exporter of steel to the United States  Tariffs on Argentine steel also have not yet been enforced Prospects for U S  Steel Industry Appear EncouragingThe American steel industry bore the brunt of a sharp decline in domestic steel prices in 2019  hurting profits of U S  steel makers  However  there have been some recovery in steel prices over the past couple of months  raising hopes for a reversal of fortunes in 2020 After a downswing through the first three quarters of 2019  U S  steel prices appear to have bottomed out  Driven by consecutive price hike actions by major U S  steel mills and supply side actions  prices have gained some upward momentum of late  Steel mills  continued push for price hikes are expected to drive U S  steel prices further over the near term  Higher prices would lend support to margins of domestic steel producers  Easing U S  China trade tension is another tailwind for the industry  The prolonged trade conflict has taken a heavy toll on the Chinese economy  A slowdown in the Chinese economy also contributed to sluggish steel demand in China  the world s top consumer of the commodity  Nevertheless  the de escalation in trade tensions due to the recent announcement of the preliminary U S  China trade deal augurs well for the steel industry as it is expected to lead to an improved demand environment for steel this year  Steel Stocks Worth a LookA few stocks currently worth considering in the steel space are Commercial Metals Company   NYSE CMC    Steel Dynamics  Inc

101666,323181,STLD,Steel Dynamics Completes Bearish Wave Setup,opinion,"Steel Dynamics  stock climbed 40  throughout the second half of 2019  The share price rose from  25 to almost  36  but that s after a decline from  52 10 in May 2018  In other words  despite the recent recovery STLD is still down 36 7  in the past 19 months 
Can the steel manufacturer stock s revival continue or was it just a short term recovery within a larger downtrend  Putting Steel Dynamics  4 hour chart below into Elliott Wave context can help us find the answer  It is not very encouraging 






The decline from  52 10 to  25 03 can be seen as a complete impulse pattern  The five waves are labeled 1 2 3 4 5  where wave 1 seems to be an expanding leading diagonal  The recovery to  35 78 looks like a simple A B C zigzag correction with a triangle wave B 
According to the Elliott Wave theory  impulses point in the direction of the larger trend  Once the corresponding three wave retracement is over  the trend resumes  In Steel Dynamics  we have an impulse to the south followed by a correction  If this count is correct  there is a complete bearish 5 3 wave cycle 
This means that instead of joining the bulls now  investors should remain cautious  The anticipated decline has the potential to drag Steel Dynamics below  25 a share  With the stock currently at  33  this translates into a 25  slump  maybe more ",2020-01-16,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/steel-dynamics-completes-bearish-wave-setup-200499178,200499178

30 6 million tons compared with 30 8 million tons a year ago and 30 3 million tons for the second quarter of 2019   Softening Steel Prices  Demand Raise Red FlagsThe Trump administration s imposition of hefty punitive tariffs on steel imports helped U S  steel industry capacity break above 80  last year after remaining below that level for years  The tariffs drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports and also provided a boost to domestic steel production The trade actions also incentivized a number of U S  steel makers to invest heavily on ramping up production capabilities and upgrading facilities  However  higher production driven by the added capacity has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year A slowing global economy and waning steel demand are other factors for the decline in steel prices  Steel demand has softened across the United States and Europe  Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid trade tensions with the United States has led to a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer of the commodity Notably  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of broad based tariffs on imported steel  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement  The benchmark hot rolled coil steel prices went downhill through the second quarter of 2019 and continued their slide in the third quarter  partly due to demand weakness  Some of the U S  steelmakers have recently taken steps to reduce capacity in the wake of declining domestic steel prices Meanwhile  profit warnings from some key players this week amid falling steel prices and demand have raised concerns about a possible weak third quarter for the U S  steel industry Notably  shares of United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   got battered yesterday after it issued underwhelming guidance for the third quarter  The company projected wider than expected loss for the quarter as it expects its Flat Rolled

Moreover  the benefits of the tariffs on steel imports have diminished Shares of U S  steel producers got a lift earlier this month after staying down for most of this year  Hopes for a de escalation

101695,323210,STLD,Earnings Suffer As U S  Steel Companies Face Falling Steel Prices,opinion,"Earnings guidance recently released by U S  steel companies have a common denominator  the impact of falling steel prices 
Last year  upon the Trump administration s implementation of Section 232 steel tariffs  domestic steel prices surged  However  since mid 2018  steel prices have steadily declined 
As such  steel industry optimism  buoyed by rising capacity utilization rates and restarts of idled production   bringing jobs with them   has subsided in the last year 
On the one hand  steel prices seemed to find a floor earlier this year 
In mid July  the U S  HRC price dropped down to  530 st before eventually bouncing back up to  590 over the ensuing month  according to MetalMiner IndX data 
However  the price has once again declined  The U S  HRC price is down 3 39  over the last month  down to  570 st 
Meanwhile  HDG prices have followed a similar trajectory  reaching a bottom in July and steadily recovering after a shorter term downtrend that began in March  HDG prices  too  are down in the last month  having fallen 2 38  to  832 st 
CRC prices have not fallen like HDG and HRC prices have over the last month  Plate prices  however  are down 7 63  over the last month  down to  738 st 
All of this is to say that falling steel prices are impacting U S  steel firms  decisions 
Last week   Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD   its third quarter earnings were expected to be down compared with the previous quarter  The company said 
 The reduced earnings are primarily related to lower profitability from the company s sheet steel operations  as shipments and average steel pricing declined in the quarter  more than offsetting lower scrap costs  
 Underlying domestic steel demand remains principally intact for the primary steel consuming sectors  with particular strength in construction 
 Third quarter 2019 profitability for the company s metals recycling platform is also expected to decrease when compared to sequential second quarter results  as a result of declining ferrous and nonferrous commodity prices coupled with steady shipments  
Similarly  U S  Steel s  of blast furnaces was impacted by falling prices   The steelmaker said in its third quarter earnings announcement last week 

 The positive flat rolled steel market indicators experienced earlier this summer have softened after a brief recovery in steel selling prices  
 The impact of falling steel prices through the second quarter  combined with the impact of a larger than expected drop in scrap prices on market sentiment  is expected to negatively impact Flat rolled earnings in the second half of the year  
 As a result  our current assessment of the Flat rolled segment suggests two blast furnaces will remain idled through at least the end of the year  

  Nucor  Corporation  NYSE NUE  also noted falling steel prices in its guidance for the  third quarter 

 The performance of the steel mills segment in the third quarter of 2019 is expected to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019 due primarily to lower prices for sheet and plate steel   the company said   Although we still see stability in most of the end use markets that we serve  there has been some softening in automotive  agricultural products and power transmission markets  
Steel companies have also faced pressure from a raw material perspective  given this year s surge in iron ore prices  on the back of supply side disruptions in Australia and Brazil   Iron ore prices have put the squeeze on steelmakers  margins  with prices of the steelmaking material surging to around to five year highs earlier this year  above  126 mt  

On the bright side   for steelmakers  that is   iron prices have subsided of late  falling below  100 mt

101696,323211,STLD,Global Steel Output Up As China Mills Roar Back  What s Next ,opinion,Global crude steel production expanded in August as steel mills in China   the world s biggest steel producer   ramped up production following a slowdown in July due to Beijing s stringent anti smog measures The World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   reported yesterday that crude steel production for 64 reporting nations went up 3 4  year over year to 156 million tons  Mt  in August Chinese Mills Step Up OutputProduction from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  shot up 9 3  year over year to 87 3 Mt in August  Chinese steel mills beefed up production last month in anticipation of higher domestic steel consumption over the September October period   typically the peak demand season   and to boost supply ahead of the implementation of stricter anti pollution production curbs across key steel making provinces in the country The rate of growth in August is also up from a 5  rise witnessed in July  Growth slowed in July as a result of output cuts by Chinese mills across the smog hit Hebei province to curb pollution  China s top steelmaking city  Tangshan extended production cuts across its mills till the end of July to improve air quality  This intense production cut at the steelmaking hub in China s top steel province of Hebei put a lid on Chinese steel output growth in July China s production surged 10  year over year to an all time high of 89 1 Mt in May as steel mills in the country bumped up output even though higher feedstock costs due to a spike in iron ore prices as a result of mine disruptions in Brazil squeezed their profit margins China s steel overcapacity remains an overhang for the steel sector  Notwithstanding Sino U S  trade tensions  China s steel mills cranked up output last year to take advantage of strong profit margins  China s steel production climbed 6 6  year over year to reach 928 3 Mt last year According to the WSA  Chinese steel output has spiked 9 1  on a year over year comparison basis to roughly 664 9 Mt for the first eight months of 2019  A glut of Chinese steel has put downward pressure on both Chinese and global steel prices How Other Major Producers Fared in AugustAmong other major Asian producers  India   the second largest steel producer   saw a 1 5  rise in production to 9 4 Mt in August  Steel consumption in India has been hurt in the recent times by a slowdown in economic activities in the country  However  investment in infrastructure projects is expected to support steel demand growth Output in Japan dropped 7 8  to 8 1 Mt in August  The U S  China trade conflict has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in that country  Production in South Korea also fell 2 6  to 5 9 Mt  Consolidated output were up 6 2  to 115 1 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production edged up 0 3  to 7 5 Mt in the United States  Growth slowed from a 1 8  rise seen a month ago The Trump administration s imposition of hefty punitive tariffs on steel imports helped U S  steel industry capacity break above 80   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  last year after remaining below that level for years  The trade actions drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   amid lower imports and also provided a boost to domestic steel production However  higher production driven by the added capacity has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year  Some of the U S  steelmakers have recently taken steps to reduce capacity in the wake of declining domestic steel prices  This has contributed to a decline in capacity utilization rate to below the important 80  level in recent weeks Meanwhile  output in Canada fell 8  to around 1 1 Mt  Overall production in North America slipped 3 1  to roughly 10 Mt   In the Europe Union  production from Germany  the biggest producer in the region  was up 0 8  to 3 3 Mt  Output tumbled 26 7  in Italy to around 0 9 Mt  France saw a 11 2  rise to roughly 1 1 Mt while Spain witnessed a 4 6  decline to 1 1 Mt  Total output was down 2 2  in the European Union to around 11 5 Mt Output in the Middle East went up 3 9  to 3 2 Mt with Iran  the top producer in the region  seeing a 6 7  rise to 2 2 Mt  Africa recorded a 14 6  decline to around 1 Mt in the reported month Among other notable producers  production from Turkey slid 12 4  to 2 6 Mt  Output from Brazil  the largest producer in South America  dropped 13 4  to 2 5 Mt What Lies Ahead Major Chinese steel producing provinces including Hebei and Shandong have enforced stringent production cuts this week to ensure clear skies during the first week of October as China prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People s Republic Notably  Tangshan has reportedly imposed new round of stricter production cuts starting September 24  Steel mills in the city will have to restrict their sintering and blast furnace output  The restrictions will remain in place until further notice  Handan  the other major steel making city in Hebei  has also implemented similar output cuts As such  anti pollution curbs across key steel making provinces are expected to keep Chinese steel output growth under check  The supply restriction is also expected to lend some support to steel prices Meanwhile  steel demand in China is likely to pick up as Beijing steps up efforts to ramp up infrastructure investment to prop up its slowing economy that has been hurt by the trade war with the United States  The WSA earlier noted that it envisions heightened government stimulus levels to boost steel demand in China this year Steel Stocks to Watch ForA couple of stocks currently worth considering in the steel space are L B  Foster

101700,323215,STLD,What Awaits U S  Steel Stocks After An Uninspiring Q3  ,opinion,The third quarter earnings season for American steel stocks has been unimpressive as expected  U S  steel makers continued to face the heat from weaker domestic steel prices in the September quarter  Lower prices put downward pressure on selling prices of these steel producers  hurting their bottom lines  Moreover  softer demand across certain key markets including automotive weighed on their performance Are U S  steel companies bracing for more challenges ahead or is a rebound in the offing  But before we get to that  let s take a quick recap of how major U S  steel makers performed the third quarter How U S  Steel Stocks Fared in Q3 Third quarter performance of prominent domestic steel makers paints a mixed picture  Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    the biggest U S  steel maker  saw lower profits in the quarter  weighed down by lower shipments and steel prices  Its earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents  However  revenues fell roughly 19  year over year to  5 464 5 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 595 million Profitability in Nucor s steel mills segment fell sequentially in the third quarter  Per the company  plate and sheet market conditions weakened in the quarter  Also  excess inventory throughout the supply chain led to continued destocking by customers United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   delivered better than expected results both on earnings and revenue fronts  Its adjusted loss of 21 cents a share for the quarter was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents  Revenues fell roughly 18  year over year to  3 069 million on lower average realized prices  but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 025 9 million Weak market conditions have forced the company to idle two of its blast furnaces in the United States and one in Europe  The company is re scoping its asset revitalization investments and is taking actions to cut fixed costs amid a challenging market environment  The company completed three financing activities following the end of the third quarter which provided around  1 1 billion of incremental capital to support its strategy Meanwhile  Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   missed earnings and revenue expectations  Its earnings of 69 cents per share trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents  Net sales fell around 22  year over year to  2 526 8 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 618 7 million  Lower average steel pricing hurt its profits and sales  Reduced shipments and realized product prices dented results in its steel operations AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   also came up with weaker than expected results  Its earnings of a penny per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents  Net sales fell around 12  year over year to  1 535 5 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 655 1 million The company saw lower shipments to the distributors and converters market along with a sharp decline in carbon spot market prices  It trimmed its profit forecast for 2019  factoring in weaker carbon hot rolled coil  HRC  spot market pricing  Per AK Steel  average spot HRC prices tumbled around 37  year over year to  562 per ton in the third quarter  Slumping prices prompted

PlayersAfter rallying to multi year highs last year on the back of broad based tariffs on imported steel  U S  steel prices have been on a downswing this year  The benchmark HRC steel prices went downhill through the second quarter of 2019 and continued their steady decline in the third quarter amid trade tensions A concoction of factors is to blame for the downward drift in U S  steel prices this year  Higher U S  steel production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the drop in domestic steel prices A slowing global economy and waning steel demand are other factors for the decline in steel prices  A slowdown in global manufacturing activity  partly due to trade war  is hurting demand for steel  Softness across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy has led to demand weakness Sluggish automotive and construction sectors are hurting steel demand in Europe  while demand in the United States is mostly hit by weakness in automotive  Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid trade tensions with the United States has led to a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer of the commodity  ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    the biggest steel producer on the planet  has cut its global steel demand outlook for this year factoring in weaknesses across Europe and the United States Overcapacity also remains a hot button issue  While some of the U S  steel makers have taken steps to reduce excess steel capacity in the wake of declining domestic steel prices  the move has not resulted in a meaningful recovery in prices amid a weak domestic steel demand environment U S  steel stocks have also been out of favor for most of this year  Falling steel prices  softening demand across major markets and trade tensions have weighed on steel stocks this year  The underlying fundamentals of the American steel industry remain weak notwithstanding the Trump administration s measures to protect the industry through punitive tariffs  A potential U S  China trade deal would thus instil positive sentiment and provide a much needed thrust to the shares of major American steel companies Is A Rebound in the Cards The uninspiring results have raised concerns that whether the headwinds witnessed in third quarter will continue to affect steel stocks  performance in the fourth quarter  However  prospects do not seem as bad as they appear Nucor  in its third quarter call  said that it believes that U S  steel prices have bottomed out  The company s CEO John Ferriola highlighted certain factors  including improving scrap prices  that could drive up domestic finished steel prices  Ferriola expects U S  scrap prices to go up about  20  25 this month and the trend to continue throughout the remainder of the year  He also envisions scrap pricing for 2019 to be up  20  40 by the end of the year Moreover  major U S  steel mills are raising prices in a bid to reverse the downswing in domestic steel prices  This has provided support to HRC prices this month  Driven by the price hike actions by flat rolled and plate mills  HRC prices have turned upward in November from the three year low level reached last month While the demand scenario is not expected to get better anytime soon given the global slowdown and trade uncertainties  a recovery in steel prices would augur well for U S  steel stocks  earnings heading into 2020  However  amid a still weak demand environment  it remains to be seen whether the recent price gains are just a dead cat bounce or the beginning of a more sustainable recovery The

101701,323216,STLD,Global Steel Output Drops As China Loses Steam  What s Ahead ,opinion,Global crude steel production retreated in October as output in China   the world s biggest steel producer   dropped on a yearly basis for the first time in 2019  partly due to Beijing s stringent anti pollution measures The World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   reported yesterday that crude steel production for 64 reporting nations went down 2 8  year over year to 151 5 million tons  Mt  in October  Production fell across all major steel producing countries in the reported month   Chinese Steel Juggernaut SlowsProduction from China  which accounts for roughly half of the global steel output  slipped 0 6  year over year to 81 5 Mt in October  the first monthly decline of the year on a year over year comparison basis A slowing economy  implementation of strict anti smog production curbs across key steel making provinces in the country  including Hebei and Shandong  as well as weaker profit margins at steel mills contributed to the slowdown in Chinese steel production  Moreover  the week long National Day holiday in early October is another factor for the output curtailment China s production surged 10  year over year to an all time high of 89 1 Mt in May 2019 as steel mills in the country bumped up output even though higher feedstock costs due to a spike in iron ore prices as a result of mine disruptions in Brazil squeezed their profit margins Notably  Chinese production increased at a fast pace during the first eight months of 2019  before slowing down in September  High production levels for the most part of this year coupled with a sharp increase in iron ore prices squeezed margins at domestic steel mills Despite the recent slowdown in production  China s steel overcapacity remains an overhang for the steel sector  A glut of Chinese steel has put downward pressure on steel prices in China and globally Notwithstanding Sino U S  trade tensions  China s steel mills cranked up output last year to take advantage of fat profit margins  China s steel production climbed 6 6  year over year to reach 928 3 Mt last year Moreover  Chinese steel output has spiked 7 4  on a year over year comparison basis to roughly 829 2 Mt for the first ten months of 2019  according to the WSA China s crude steel production is expected to go up 7  year over year to around 994 Mt in 2019  per the China Iron and Steel Association Demand Slowdown Hits Other Major Producers Among other major Asian producers  India   the second largest steel producer   saw a 3 4  decline in production to 9 1 Mt in October  Steel consumption in India has been hurt in the recent times by a slowdown in economic activities in the country  Reduced infrastructure spending  slowdown across major sectors like automobiles and construction and slumping domestic steel prices are plaguing the Indian steel industry Output in Japan dropped 4 9  to 8 2 Mt in the reported month  The U S  China trade conflict has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in that country  Japanese steel makers are hit by weakening demand in automotive and machinery  Production in South Korea also fell 3 5  to 6 Mt  Consolidated output fell 1 3  to 108 9 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production was down 2  to 7 4 Mt in the United States  This follows a 2 5  decline seen a month ago The Trump administration s imposition of hefty punitive tariffs on steel imports helped U S  steel industry capacity break above 80   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  last year after remaining below that level for years  The trade actions drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   amid lower imports and also provided a boost to domestic steel production However  higher production driven by the added capacity has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year  Some of the U S  steelmakers have recently taken steps to reduce excess capacity in the wake of falling domestic steel prices  Notably  weak market conditions have forced U S  Steel to idle two of its blast furnaces in the United States  Capacity cuts have contributed to the recent decline in U S  steel production  However  lower production is yet to make any notable positive impact on domestic steel prices  American steel producers are also contending with slowing steel demand  especially in automotive Nucor  U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel each currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Meanwhile  output in Canada fell 2  to around 1 1 Mt and also declined 3 6  in Mexico to 1 5 Mt  Overall production in North America slipped 2 2  to roughly 10 Mt   In the Europe Union  production from Germany  the biggest producer in the region  dropped 6 8  to 3 3 Mt  Output fell 3 7  in Italy to around 2 2 Mt  France saw a 10 6  decline to roughly 1 2 Mt while output tumbled 7 6  in Spain to 1 2 Mt  Total output was down 8 7  in the European Union to around 13 3 Mt  Weakening demand in automotive and slowing construction is denting steel consumption in Europe  A soft manufacturing sector is hurting steel producers in Europe Output in the Middle East went up 2 9  to 3 Mt with Iran  the top producer in the region  seeing a 7 5  rise to 2 2 Mt  Africa recorded a 16 6  decline to around 1 1 Mt in the reported month Among other notable producers  production from Turkey slid 15  to 2 7 Mt  Output from Brazil  the largest producer in South America  tumbled 19 4  to 2 6 Mt What Lies Ahead Profit margins at Chinese steel mills are expected remain under pressure through the winter months  November to March    typically the weak demand season  Construction activities tend to taper off during winter towards the end of the year  depressing demand for steel As such  steel production in China is likely to remain under check through the remainder of this year amid weaker demand and margins  Moreover  anti pollution curbs across key steel making provinces during winter to improve air quality are expected to trigger some slowdown in steel output  The supply restriction is also expected to lend some support to both Chinese and global steel prices Meanwhile  strength in the real estate sector is expected to boost steel demand growth in China  The WSA expects real estate investments to drive a 7 8  growth in steel demand in China this year  notwithstanding a slowdown in the world s second largest economy Earlier this month  ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    the world s biggest steel producer  also revised higher its expectations for steel consumption growth in China for 2019  The steel behemoth expects real estate demand to drive the upside   According to the National Bureau of Statistics  NBS   China s property investment rose 10 3  in the first ten months of 2019  Beijing is also stepping up efforts to ramp up infrastructure investment to prop up its faltering economy that has been battered by the trade war with the United States  This bodes well for steel demand growth in China as real estate and infrastructure account for bulk of overall steel consumption in the country Looking for Stocks with

101702,323217,STLD,U S  Steel Imports Down YTD  Are Tariffs Really Helping ,opinion,U S  steel imports have dropped roughly 16  year to date   according to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers  The decline largely reflects the impact of the 25  tariff on steel imports which the Trump administration had levied last year Per the AISI  total steel imports are down 15 9  year to date  through the first ten months of 2019  on a year over year comparison basis to roughly 24 77 million net tons  Finished steel imports are also down 17  year over year to 18 34 million net tons However  total steel imports went up in October on a monthly comparison basis  Total imports rose 14 5  from September to around 2 18 million net tons  Finished steel imports were down 3 5  to 1 48 million net tons  These figures are based on preliminary U S  Census Bureau data  the AISI noted The biggest offshore suppliers for October were South Korea with 170 000 net tons  up 8  from September   Germany with 79 000 net tons  up 22    Japan with 74 000 net tons  up 4    Brazil with 59 000 net tons  up 54   and Taiwan with 39 000 net tons  down 37   Finished steel import market share was estimated at 17  in October  That is down from 20  clocked for the same month a year ago  Finished steel import market share was estimated at 20  for the first ten months of 2019  down from 21  for the same period in 2018 For 2019  annualized total and finished steel imports are expected to decline 11 9  and 14 3  year over year  respectively  per the AISI Weak Steel Prices  Waning Demand Offset Tariff BenefitsU S  steel imports dropped roughly 12  last year under the weight of steep tariffs which the Trump administration imposed on imported steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 in a big move to protect the domestic producers Steel imports have also dipped this year as a result of the tariffs despite complete exemptions of Canada and Mexico  two major sources of steel imports to the United States  The United States  in May 2019  reached a deal to lift steel and aluminum tariffs from Canada and Mexico  These major trade partners have long been pushing the Trump administration to repeal the tariffs  The deal paved the road for the ratification the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    The tariffs also drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  They helped domestic steel industry capacity break above 80   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  last year after remaining below that level for years  Improved capacity  driven by restarted steel mills  also provided a boost to U S  steel production U S  steel prices also marched higher during the first half of 2018  courtesy of steel tariffs  However  the momentum was short lived as U S  steel prices tracked downward in the back half of the year and also dropped through the first three quarters of 2019  The benchmark hot rolled coil steel  HRC  prices went downhill through the second quarter of 2019 and continued their slide in the third quarter  partly due to demand weakness  Lower prices put downward pressure on selling prices of U S  steel makers  hurting their bottom lines in the third quarter Notably  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of steel tariffs  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement  Prices are still well below their peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  reached in July 2018  Higher domestic supply resulting from increased production contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year The Trump administration s protectionist policies and bitter tariff battle with China have also largely contributed to the slowdown in the world economy  A slowdown in global manufacturing activity  partly due to trade war  is hurting demand for steel  Softness across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy has led to demand weakness While the tariffs were lauded by U S  steel makers  they hit major industries including automotive that are key consumers of steel  The tariffs have driven up manufacturing costs across these industries  The automotive industry  which consumes a big chunk of steel  is among the industries that has been hit the hardest Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid prolonged trade tensions with the United States has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer of the commodity  Sluggish automotive and construction sectors are also hurting steel demand in Europe  while demand in the United States is mostly hit by weakness in automotive  The global economic downturn and waning steel demand are other key factors for the decline in steel prices Some of the U S  steelmakers have recently taken steps to reduce excess capacity in the wake of falling domestic steel prices  Capacity cuts have contributed to the recent decline in U S  steel production Moreover  U S  steel mills are raising prices in a bid to reverse the downswing in domestic steel prices  Driven by the price hike actions by flat rolled and plate mills and lower production  HRC prices have turned upward in November from the three year low level reached in October  However  a significant recovery in prices is not expected to materialize anytime soon given the weak domestic steel demand A Tough Year for U S  Steel StocksThe imposition of trade tariffs provided a breather to American steel stocks last year and drove their earnings  However  U S  steel stocks have been out of favor for most of 2019 and most of them have underperformed the broader market  Sliding steel prices  softening demand across major markets and lingering trade tensions have weighed on steel stocks  Lower prices have hurt the bottom lines of domestic steel companies through the first three quarters of 2019  Moreover  the benefits of the Section 232 trade actions on steel imports have waned Nevertheless  shares of these companies gained some ground last month on hopes of a U S  China trade deal and some recovery in steel prices  Shares of United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   popped around 14   5   17  and 11   respectively  last month U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics  Nucor and AK Steel currently have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Moreover  shares of domestic steel companies got a lift yesterday after President Trump said that he is restoring tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina  effective immediately  Trump has accused these countries of devaluing their currencies which hurt American farmers  The Trump administration had exempted these two countries from the tariffs last year  The revival of tariffs is a positive development as Brazil is a major exporter of steel to the United States Despite the recent gains  shares of most U S  steel stocks remain subdued on a year to date basis   Notably  U S  Steel s shares are down roughly 25  year to date  Moreover  shares of Nucor  U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel are in the red over the past year  While a potential U S  China  phase one  trade deal by the year end would provide a thrust to the shares of U S  steel companies  any failure to strike an agreement could hurt these stocks 7 Best

according to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers  The decline reflects the impact of the 25  tariff on steel imports which the Trump administration had levied last year Per the AISI  total and finished domestic steel imports are down 11 7  and 18 1  year over year  respectively  year to date  through the first five months of 2019  to roughly 13 58 million net tons and 9 95 million net tons  respectively In May  total and finished steel imports dropped 38 2  and 9 3  from April to around 2 06 million net tons and 1 85 million net tons  respectively  These figures are based on final U S  Census Bureau data  the AISI noted Finished steel import market share was estimated at 19  in May  That is down from 21  clocked in April  Finished steel import market share was estimated at 21  for the first five months of 2019  That is considerably lower than the levels seen in the recent years  Finished steel import market share shot up to as high as 29  in April 2018  However  the punitive trade actions have led to a decline in market share since then For 2019  annualized total and finished steel imports are

MillsThe steep tariffs on steel imports  that were imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  have provided a much needed reprieve to American steel makers and instilled optimism in the long struggling U S  steel industry The tariffs have boosted production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  They have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry According to the AISI  U S  steel mills operated at 80 5  of their capacity for the week ending June 22  Capability utilization rate for the week increased from 77 4  a year ago   Improved capacity is also boosting U S  steel production  Per the World Steel Association   WSA    crude steel production increased 6 2  year over year to 37 2 million tons in the United States for the first five months of 2019 U S  steel companies forged solid earnings last year  thanks largely to the Trump administration s trade

import market share was estimated at 19  in July  That is down from 20  clocked in June  Finished steel import market share was estimated at 21  for the first seven months of 2019 For 2019  annualized total and finished steel imports are expected to decline 5 1  and 9 7  year over year  respectively  per the AISI Falling Steel Prices  Waning Demand Hurt U S  PlayersU S  steel imports dropped roughly 12  last year under the weight of steep tariffs which the Trump administration imposed on imported steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 The tariffs instilled optimism in the long struggling U S  steel industry and helped domestic steel industry capacity break above 80   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  last year after remaining below that level for years  The tariffs drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  Improved capacity also provided a boost to U S  steel production The Trump administration s trade actions also largely helped U S  steel companies to rack up solid earnings in 2018  The tariffs provided a boost to U S  steel prices last year  driving profits and cash flows of American steel makers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   The trade actions also incentivized a number of U S  steel makers to invest heavily on ramping up production capabilities and upgrade facilities  However  higher production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year Notably  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of Trump administration s imposition of tariffs  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement U S  steel prices tracked downward in the back half of 2018 and continued to retreat this year  The benchmark hot rolled coil steel prices went downhill through the second quarter  Prices are now well below their peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  reached in July 2018  They are down nearly 40  from the high levels reached last year Uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and concerns over a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy are other factors for the decline in steel prices Waning steel demand poses problems for steel producers  Slowdown across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy are hurting steel demand  Demand has softened across the United States and Europe Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid escalating trade tensions with the United States has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and falling car sales have clouded steel demand outlook While some of the U S  steelmakers have recently taken steps to reduce capacity in the wake of declining domestic steel prices  the move is not expected to result in a significant recovery in prices anytime soon given the oversupply in the market and weak domestic steel demand U S  steel stocks also have been out of favor this year  Shares of U S  Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   have sagged roughly 41   9   12  and 3   respectively  so far this year  Notably  shares of these companies are on a roller coaster ride in August  Sliding steel prices  softening demand across major markets and trade tensions are weighing on steel stocks  Moreover  the benefits of the Section 232 trade actions on steel imports appear to be waning U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics  Nucor and AK Steel currently have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Exemptions from tariffs is another concern  The United States  in May 2019  reached a deal to lift steel and aluminum tariffs from Canada and Mexico  These major trade partners have long been pushing the Trump administration to repeal the tariffs  The deal paved the road for the ratification the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  Canada and Mexico are two major sources of steel imports to the United States  together representing roughly a quarter of U S  steel imports  Following the imposition of tariffs in March 2018  President Trump softened his stance by excluding Canada and Mexico from the tariff orders  noting that they represent  a special case   However  the United States moved ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada and Mexico after the expiration of temporary exemptions on these countries on Jun 1  2018  Complete exemption of these two top steel exporters does not augur well for U S  steel companies The Trump administration earlier had excluded Australia from the tariffs  Moreover  the United States reached quota agreements on steel imports with Argentina  Brazil and South Korea  There is still a possibility that other countries could be exempted from the tariff orders on the basis of quotas Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit

101739,323254,STLD,Global Steel Output Growth Eases As China Production Cools,opinion,Global crude steel production rose in July on higher output in China  the world s biggest steel maker  According to the latest report from the World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   crude steel production for 64 reporting nations rose 1 7  year over year for the reported month to 156 7 million tons  Mt  However  the growth in output for the reported month slowed from a 4 6  year over year rise witnessed in June as stringent anti smog measures led to a slowdown in production growth in China   China Output Growth Slows on Production CurbsProduction from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  went up 5  year over year to 85 2 Mt in July  However  this is down from a 10  rise witnessed in both June and May  The slowdown in the rate of growth is as a result of output cuts by Chinese steel mills across the smog hit Hebei province to curb pollution amid a spike in the prices of iron ore  the key steel making raw material Tangshan   the top steelmaking city in China   extended production cuts across its mills till the end of July to improve air quality  This intense production curb at the steelmaking hub in China s top steel province of Hebei kept Chinese steel output growth under check in July China s production shot up to a record high of 89 1 Mt in May as steel mills in the country cranked up output even though higher feedstock costs due to a spike in iron ore prices squeezed their profit margins  Fears of supply shortage due to mine disruptions in Brazil triggered a spurt in iron ore prices  Iron ore prices jumped to a five year high In July The steel industry continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by sustained growth in production in China  Despite U S  China trade tensions  China s steel mills bumped up output last year to take advantage of strong profit margins  A glut of Chinese steel also put downward pressure on global steel prices  China s steel overcapacity remains an overhang for the steel sector China s steel production climbed 6 6  year over year to reach 928 3 Mt last year  The country s share of global crude steel production rose to 51 3  in 2018 from 50 3  in 2017 According to the WSA  Chinese steel output spiked 9  on a year over year comparison basis to roughly 577 1 Mt for the first seven months of 2019 How Other Key Producers Fared in JulyAmong other major Asian producers  India   the second largest steel producer   saw a 1 7  rise in production to 9 2 Mt in July  The WSA  earlier this year  said that it expects continuing infrastructure projects to support steel demand growth in India Output in Japan edged down 0 4  to 8 4 Mt in July while production in South Korea dropped 2 1  to 6 Mt  Consolidated output were up 3 9  to 113 3 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production ticked up 1 8  to 7 5 Mt in the United States  Growth slowed from a 3 1  rise seen a month ago The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied in 2018  helped domestic steel industry capacity break above 80   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  last year after remaining below that level for years  The tariffs drove up production capacity of U S  steel

East rose 3 8  to 3 1 Mt with Iran  the top producer in the region  seeing a 11 1  rise to 2 2 Mt  Africa recorded a 15 1  decline to around 1 1 Mt in the reported month Among other notable producers  production from Turkey dropped 10 6  to 2 9 Mt  Output from Brazil  the largest producer in South America  tumbled 20 7  to 2 4 Mt What Next Despite the seasonal weakness in steel demand  Chinese steel mills will likely to ramp up output as Tangshan is reportedly mulling to ease production cuts in September as well after relaxing the output curbs this month  This is expected to drive up production Moreover  steel demand in China is likely to pick up as Beijing steps up efforts to ramp up infrastructure investment to prop up its slowing economy that has been hurt by the trade war with the United States Higher investment in the construction sector is expected to support steel demand in China  The WSA envisions heightened government stimulus levels to boost steel demand in China this

101740,323255,STLD,Is Steel Dynamics  STLD  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Steel Dynamics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5 87  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 09  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Steel Dynamics s current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint  which is 15 98  over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 16  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Steel Dynamics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 56  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Steel Dynamics has a P S ratio of about 0 53  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 19 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Steel Dynamics currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes STLD a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Steel Dynamics is just 0 71  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 03  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  STLD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Steel Dynamics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F  This gives STLD a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 13 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen 4 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Steel Dynamics  Inc  Price and Consensus
    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSteel Dynamics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 30  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

101741,323256,STLD,Do Downbeat Views Point To A Tough Q3 For US Steel Stocks ,opinion,After reaping the benefits of higher domestic steel prices last year  American steel makers are bearing the brunt of weakening steel prices and demand this year  Moreover  recent profit warnings from some of the major U S  steel makers have raised concerns about a possible weak third quarter for the U S  steel industry Is a tough third quarter earnings season in store for U S  steel stocks  Let s have a look Weak Q3 Guidance from Major U S  PlayersSome of the prominent U S  steel producers came up with weaker than expected earnings guidance for the September quarter this week  U S  steel giant  Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    on Monday  issued disappointing guidance for the third quarter The steel producer expects earnings in the band of 75 80 cents per share for the third quarter  reflecting a sequential decline from  1 26 in the second quarter and a fall from  2 13 recorded in the year ago quarter Nucor expects performance in the steel mills unit to sequentially decline in the third quarter mainly due to lower prices for sheet and plate steel  The company stated that it sees stability in most of the end use markets that it serves  However  automotive  power transmission and agricultural products markets remain weak Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   also provided weak view for the third quarter as it expects lower profits in its steel operations in the quarter  The steel maker expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 66 70 cents per share  That is a decrease from 87 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter and  1 69 per share it earned a year ago The company expects earnings from its steel operations to be lower sequentially in the third quarter mainly due to reduced profitability from its sheet steel operations  The company attributed the decline in profitability to lower average steel prices and shipments that more than offset reduced scrap costs Moreover  United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   issued underwhelming guidance for the third quarter yesterday  It expects to record adjusted loss per share of roughly 35 cents for the quarter  The company expects lower steel prices and higher than expected decline in scrap prices to hurt its Flat Rolled segment through the second half of 2019  It will continue to idle its two U S  blast furnaces at least through the end of 2019  The company also noted that market conditions have continued to weaken in Europe    Downbeat third quarter guidance from these major companies reflects tepid underlying fundamentals of the American steel industry Sliding Steel Prices  Weak Demand to Dent Q3 Results The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration imposed in March 2018  largely helped U S  steel companies to rack up solid earnings last year  The tariffs provided a boost to U S  steel prices in 2018  driving profits and cash flows of American steel makers The trade actions also helped domestic steel industry capacity break above 80   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  last year after remaining below that level for years  The tariffs drove up production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  Improved capacity also provided a boost to U S  steel production The tariffs led to a spike in U S  steel prices during the first half of 2018  However  the momentum was short lived as U S  steel prices tracked downward in the back half of the year and continued to retreat this year The benchmark hot rolled coil steel prices went downhill through the second quarter of 2019 and continued their slide in the third quarter  partly due to demand weakness  Prices are now well below their peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  reached in July 2018  They are down nearly 40  from the high levels reached last year  In fact  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement Higher U S  steel production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the sharp decline in U S  steel prices this year  Uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and concerns over a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a slowing Chinese economy are other factors to blame for the decline Waning steel demand is another concern  Slowdown across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy are hurting steel demand  Demand has softened across the United States and Europe  Moreover  a cooling Chinese economy amid trade tensions with the United States has triggered a slowdown in steel demand across major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   in China As such  lower U S  steel prices will likely put downward pressure on selling prices of American steel makers and crimp their margins in the third quarter  Softening end market demand may also hurt profitability   Although some of the U S  steel makers have recently taken steps to reduce capacity in the wake of declining domestic steel prices  the move is not expected to result in a meaningful recovery in prices anytime soon given the oversupply in the market and weak domestic steel demand Meanwhile  U S  steel stocks have been out of favor for most of this year  Notably  shares of major domestic steel companies such as U S  Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   have been on a roller coaster ride in August  Falling steel prices  softening demand across major markets and heightened trade tensions weighed on steel stocks last month Nevertheless  shares of these companies gained ground this month on hopes of easing U S  China trade tensions  China  earlier this month  said that it would exempt some U S  products from a recent round of additional tariffs  The United States also agreed to delay a planned increase in tariffs on some Chinese imports  The de escalation instilled positive sentiment and provided a thrust to U S  steel stocks this month  While the countries prepare for another round of negotiations next month  a potential trade truce would augur well for U S  steel

101775,323290,STLD,Global Steel Production Up In February  China Remains A Risk ,opinion,Global crude steel production expanded in February on the back of a surge in output in China  the world s biggest steel maker  Higher output from India   the second largest steel producer   and the United States also contributed to the production growth According to the latest report from the World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   crude steel production for 64 reporting nations spiked 4 1  year over year for the reported month to 137 3 million tons  Mt  Chinese Output Jumps Y YProduction from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  shot up 9 2  year over year to 71 Mt in February  per the WSA  Chinese steel mills beefed up production during the month  driven by higher profit margins The steel industry continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by a surge in production in China  Per the WSA  China s steel production climbed 6 6  year over year in 2018 to reach 928 3 Mt  The country s share of global crude steel production rose to 51 3  in 2018 from 50 3  in 2017 Notwithstanding the trade tensions  China s steel mills bumped up output last year to take advantage of strong profit margins  A glut of cheap Chinese steel driven by the ramp up in output amid weak domestic demand has put downward pressure on global steel prices of late The four month production restriction to curb pollution during the winter months is expected to be lifted by Beijing by the end of this week  As such  a number of Chinese mills are likely to resume normal production from April following the winter output cuts that was aimed at improving air quality  This may lead to a rise in production levels How Other Key Producers Fared in FebruaryAmong other major Asian producers  India saw a 2 3  rise in production to 8 7 Mt for the reported month  Output in Japan dropped 6 6  to 7 7 Mt in February while production in South Korea rose 1 1  to 5 5 Mt  Consolidated output were up 6 8  to 96 5 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production went up 4 6  to 6 9 Mt in the United States  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied in March 2018  are boosting production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  The tariffs have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry Driven by President Trump s trade actions  a number of

101776,323291,STLD,Is Steel Dynamics  STLD  A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Steel Dynamics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 45  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 06  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Steel Dynamics  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 61 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Material sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Steel Dynamics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 74  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Steel Dynamics stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Steel Dynamics has a P S ratio of about 0 69  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  STLD is below the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Steel Dynamics currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Steel Dynamics a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Steel Dynamics is just 0 73  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 16  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  STLD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Steel Dynamics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives STLD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and five down in the same time period This has had a dismal impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 18  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 2 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Steel Dynamics  Inc  Price and Consensus    Apart from this somewhat dismal trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSteel Dynamics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 29  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Steel Producers industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See

101777,323292,STLD,U S  Raw Steel Output Jumps Y Y As Capacity Stays Above 80 ,opinion,U S  raw steel production for the week ending Mar 30 shot up year over year as steel mills in the country operated above 80  of their capacity  according to the latest weekly report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers Per data released by the AISI  domestic raw steel production was 1 913 000 net tons for the reported week  a 4 8  spike from production of 1 826 000 net tons for the same period a year ago  Reported weekly production  however  represents a 1 1  drop from production of 1 934 000 net tons logged for the week ending Mar 23 Capacity utilization  a key metric in the steel industry  for the reported week also showed gain on year over year comparison basis  U S  steel mills operated at 82 2  of their capacity last week  Capability utilization rate for the reported week increased from 78 3  a year ago  per the AISI   Capability utilization for the previous week was 83 1  By regions  production from Great Lakes  Southern  NYSE SO   North East  Midwest and Western were 715 000 net tons  725 000 net tons  210 000 net tons  187 000 net tons and 76 000 net tons for the reported week  respectively Overall raw steel production  on an adjusted basis  through Mar 30 was 24 208 000 net tons at a capability utilization rate of 81 8   up 6 7  from 22 686 000 net tons recorded in the same period a year ago at a capability utilization rate of 76 6  According to the AISI  production capability for first quarter 2019 is roughly 30 5 million tons compared with 30 million tons a year ago and 30 8 million tons for the fourth quarter of 2018   Trump Tariffs Driving Capacity   InvestmentThe 25  tariffs on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied last year  has provided a reprieve to U S  steel producers  who long struggled to cope with a tide of subsidized foreign imports  The punitive tariffs led to a decline in U S  steel imports in 2018  Per the AISI  total steel imports dropped 11 5  year over year last year The tariffs are also boosting production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  They have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  The U S  Department of Commerce earlier said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to approximately an operating rate of 80  that reflects a healthy industry Improved capacity boosted U S  steel production last year  Per the World Steel Association   WSA    crude steel production increased 6 2  to 86 7 million tons in the United States in 2018  U S  steel shipments also went up 4 8  year over year in 2018  per AISI The tariffs also provided a thrust to U S  steel prices last year  allowing American steel makers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   to deliver solid earnings in 2018  A few of them racked up record earnings for the year Leveraging strong cash flows  a number of U S  steel producers are investing heavily to beef up production capabilities and upgrade facilities  For example  Nucor is significantly investing in a host of expansion programs to beef up capacity  These include a  650 million investment for expansion of the production capability of its flat rolled sheet steel mill  Nucor Steel Gallatin  in Kentucky Nucor is also investing roughly  1 35 billion to construct a new state of the art plate mill in Kentucky that is expected to have a capacity to produce 1 2 million tons of steel plate products annually  The project  which is expected to create around 400 full time jobs  will strengthen the company s plate product portfolio and enable it to build market leadership position in the U S  plate market  The company said that trade actions and tax reform have provided it the confidence to make this investment Moreover  Steel Dynamics is currently executing a number of projects that should add to capacity  The company is investing  1 7  1 8 billion to build a new electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill in the United States that is expected to have an annual production capacity of roughly 3 million tons U S  Steel also restarted two blast furnaces last year at its integrated steelmaking plant  Granite City Works  in Illinois  which is expected to support the growing demand for steel made in the United States  The company  in February  also restarted construction of an electric arc furnace steelmaking facility  with an expected annual capacity of 1 6 million tons  at its Tubular Operations in Fairfield  The company cited

101778,323293,STLD,Are U S  Steel Producers Bracing For A Disappointing Q1 ,opinion,U S  steel companies forged solid earnings in 2018  thanks largely to the Trump administration s trade actions on imported steel  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the U S  administration levied in March 2018  provided a thrust to U S  steel prices last year  driving profits and cash flows of American steel makers However  is a tough first quarter in store for U S  steel stocks  Let s take a look Profit Warnings from Some Key PlayersLower than expected guidance from some of the major U S  steel makers has left investors  worrying about a possible weak first quarter for the U S  steel industry Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD    for example  provided underwhelming earnings guidance for the first quarter as it expects lower earnings in its steel operations in the quarter  The steel producer expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 88 92 cents per share  That is a decrease from  1 17 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 96 cents per share it earned a year ago The company expects profitability from its steel operations to be lower sequentially in the first quarter mainly due to reduced earnings from its sheet operations While Steel Dynamics expects overall steel shipments to rise in the first quarter sequentially  it envisions average steel product pricing to decline more than the cost of average scrap consumed Moreover  U S  steel giant Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    last month  said that it expects earnings per share in the band of  1 45  1 50 for the first quarter  This reflects a sequential decline from  2 07 in the fourth quarter of 2018  The company s guidance also fell short of expectations Nucor expects earnings in the steel mills unit to decline sequentially mainly due to lower average selling prices and margins in its sheet mill group  Per Nucor  the sheet pricing has reached the low point during the first quarter and the impact of recent price increases are encouraging Moreover  United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    in its fourth quarter call  provided disappointing profit guidance for the first quarter  U S  Steel expects adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter at roughly  225 million  which excludes the expected impacts of fire at its Clairton coke making plant  The guidance was lower than expected and also well below the company s fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of  535 million While AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   did not provide any specific guidance for the first quarter  its full year profit guidance was disappointing  The company  in its fourth quarter call  noted that it expects net income of  160  180 million for 2019  The guidance reflects a decline from net income of  186 million the company logged in 2018  The company cited lower steel prices and higher costs as headwinds  It expects to record charges of around  80 million for Ashland Works facility closure costs in the first quarter Earnings Estimates SouthboundEarnings estimates for major U S  steel stocks for the first quarter have gone down over the past two months  It appears that analysts are pessimistic about the earnings prospects for these stocks for the March quarter For Steel Dynamics  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings has declined around 16 4  over the past two months  The same for Nucor has gone down 6 3  over the same period  Estimates for U S  Steel has also dropped 59 5  over the same timeframe Weaker U S  Steel PricesWhile U S  steel companies reaped the benefits of higher domestic steel prices in 2018  the momentum is unlikely to sustain this year  U S  steel prices tracked downward in second half 2018 and tumbled during the fourth quarter on concerns over a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy In fact  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of Trump administration s imposition of tariffs on imported steel  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement The tariffs have boosted production capacity of American steel producers amid lower imports  They have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  Improved capacity has led to increased U S  steel production However  higher U S  steel production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the drop in domestic steel prices  Uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and concerns over a possible slowdown in the U S  economy are other factors for the decline Notably  the benchmark hot rolled coil steel prices went downhill in January 2019  While prices rebounded in February and have stabilized since then  they are well below their peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  reached in July 2018 According to S P Global  NYSE SPGI   U S  hot rolled steel coil prices fell 13 2  to  695 st in the first quarter compared with  801 st in fourth quarter 2018 As such  weaker U S  steel prices will likely put pressure on selling prices of American steel makers and weigh on their bottom lines in the first quarter Nucor  Steel Dynamics  U S  Steel and AK Steel each currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks

101781,323296,STLD,Is A Tough Q2 Earnings Season In Store For U S  Steel Stocks ,opinion,U S  steel companies reaped the benefits of higher domestic steel prices in 2018 that largely helped them to rack up solid earnings last year  However  a sharp decline in steel prices this year spells trouble for American steel makers  Moreover  recent profit warnings from some key players amid falling steel

Guidance From Major PlayersSome of the major U S  steel makers came up with lower than expected earnings guidance for the June quarter this week  U S  steel giant Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    on Monday  issued underwhelming guidance for the second quarter  It sees earnings per share in the band of  1 20  1 25 for the quarter  reflecting a decline from  1 63 in the first quarter and  2 13 in the year ago quarter    Nucor expects performance in the steel mills unit to decline sequentially in the second quarter  The company noted that service center destocking is affecting order rates  Lower scrap prices and higher supply in the domestic market have led to aggressive inventory management by the company s customers Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   also provided downbeat guidance for the second quarter as it expects lower earnings in its steel operations in the quarter  The steel producer expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 86 90 cents per share  That is a decrease from 91 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter and  1 53 per share it earned a year ago Steel Dynamics expects earnings from its steel operations to be lower sequentially in the second quarter mainly due to reduced profitability from the long product steel operations as shipments and metal spread fell in the quarter  Average product prices declined across the steel platform in the second quarter  the company noted  Steel Dynamics also said that inventory destocking and hesitancy in steel buying have resulted from a softening scrap pricing environment   Moreover  United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   on Tuesday provided disappointing second quarter profit guidance and said that it will idle three blast furnaces in response to the weakening market conditions  The company expects adjusted earnings per share to be roughly 40 cents for the quarter  The projected earnings reflect a decrease from 47 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter and  1 46 per share the company earned a year ago The company said that its Flat Rolled segment is being hurt by lower steel prices and weakening end market demand  Flooding in the southern United States also led to lower than expected shipments in the second quarter Moreover  the company sees sequentially lower adjusted EBITDA for both its U S  Steel Europe  USSE  and Tubular segments in the second quarter  Lower selling prices are putting pressure on Tubular margins while higher imports and headwinds related to raw material costs and demand continue to hurt the USSE unit Nucor currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   while both Steel Dynamics and U S  Steel carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  You can see  Falling Steel Prices  Weaker Demand Are WorriesThe 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration imposed in March 2018  provided a thrust to U S  steel prices last year  driving profits and cash flows of American steel makers including Nucor  U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   The trade actions also boosted production capacity of American steel producers amid lower imports  They have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  Improved capacity has led to increased U S  steel production  A number of U S  steel producers are investing heavily to beef up production capabilities and upgrade facilities The tariffs led to a spike in U S  steel prices during the first half of 2018  However  the momentum was short lived as U S  steel prices tracked downward in the back half of the year and dropped sharply during the fourth quarter  Prices continue to retreat so far this year A concoction of factors is to blame for the downward drift in U S  steel prices  Higher U S  steel production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the drop in domestic steel prices According to American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers  U S  raw steel production through mid June 2019 was 44 997 000 net tons at a capability utilization rate of 81 5   up 5 9  from 42 472 000 net tons a year ago at a capability utilization rate of 76 7   Rising domestic supply is hurting U S  steel prices Uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and concerns over a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy are other factors for the decline in steel prices In fact  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of Trump administration s imposition of tariffs on imported steel  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement  The benchmark hot rolled coil steel prices are now well below their peak level of roughly  920 per short ton  st  reached in July 2018  Prices are down more than 35  from the high levels reached last year Lower U S  steel prices will likely put downward pressure on selling prices of American steel makers and crimp their margins in the second quarter Waning steel demand also poses problems for steel producers  Slowdown across major end use markets such as automotive  construction and energy are hurting steel demand  Demand has softened across the United States and Europe Moreover  a slowing Chinese economy amid trade war has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and falling car sales have clouded steel demand outlook  As such  softening end market demand may also hurt profitability of U S  steel makers   Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a

101782,323297,STLD,Record China Output Drives Steel Production  What s Ahead  ,opinion,Global crude steel production spiked in May as steel mills in China   the world s biggest steel producer   ramped up production to record high  Higher output from India and the United States also supported the expansion According to the latest report from the World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   crude steel production for 64 reporting nations rose 5 4  year over year for the reported month to 162 7 million tons  Mt  China Mills Roar in MayProduction from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  shot up 10  year over year to a new record high of 89 1 Mt in May  exceeding the previous peak level of 85 Mt registered in April  Steel mills in the country beefed up output even though higher feedstock costs due to a spike in iron ore prices squeezed their profit margins  The record output highlights China s continued demand for steel consumption Fears of supply shortage due to mine disruptions in Brazil triggered a spurt in the prices of iron ore  the key steel making raw material  Chinese steel mills are looking to raise their prices in the wake of higher input costs The steel industry continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by a surge in production in China  Despite U S  China trade tensions  China s steel mills bumped up output last year to take advantage of strong profit margins  A glut of Chinese steel also put downward pressure on global steel prices  China s steel overcapacity remains an overhang for the steel sector China s steel production climbed 6 6  year over year to reach 928 3 Mt last year  The country s share of global crude steel production rose to 51 3  in 2018 from 50 3  in 2017 According to the WSA  Chinese steel output has surged 10 2  on a year over year comparison basis to roughly 404 9 Mt for the first five months of 2019 How Other Key Producers FaredAmong other major Asian producers  India   the world s second largest producer of steel   saw a 5 1  rise in production to 9 2 Mt in May  The WSA  earlier this year  said that it expects continuing infrastructure projects to support steel demand growth in India Output in Japan dropped 4 6  to 8 7 Mt in May while production in South Korea rose 2 2  to 6 4 Mt  Consolidated output were up 7 6  to 117 3 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production picked up 5 4  to 7 7 Mt in the United States  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied last year  are boosting production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  The tariffs have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry  Improved capacity is driving U S  steel production Driven by the trade actions  a number of American steel producers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   are investing to ramp up production capabilities and upgrade facilities  However  higher production  partly driven by restarted mills  has contributed to the drop in U S  steel prices Meanwhile  output in Canada went up 12 8  to around 1 2 Mt  Overall production in North America rose 4 5  to roughly 10 5 Mt   In the Europe Union  production from Germany  the biggest producer in the region  fell 6 2  to 3 5 Mt  Output increased 1 1  in Italy to around 2 2 Mt  France saw a 7 6  decline to roughly 1 2 Mt while Spain witnessed a 7 1  drop to 1 3 Mt  Total output went down 2 8  in the European Union to around 14 5 Mt Output in the Middle East rose 1 6  to 3 2 Mt with Iran  the top producer in the region  seeing a 3 8  rise to 2 2 Mt  Africa logged an 8 5  gain to around 1 3 Mt in the reported month Among other notable producers  production from Turkey dropped 8  to 3 1 Mt  Output from Brazil  the largest producer in South America  was up 2 9  to 2 8 Mt What Lies Ahead Tangshan   the top steelmaking city in China   has extended production cuts across its mills till the end of July to improve air quality  This intense production curb at the steelmaking hub in China s top steel province of Hebei may keep Chinese steel output growth under check in the coming months However  Chinese steel mills will likely continue to crank up output as domestic demand is expected to remain healthy moving forward  Steel demand in the country is expected to pick up as Beijing steps up efforts to ramp up infrastructure investment to prop up its slowing economy that has been hurt by the trade war with the United States  Higher investment in the construction sector is expected to support steel demand in the country  The WSA envisions heightened government stimulus levels to boost steel demand in China this year Steel Stocks to Watch ForA couple of stocks currently

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  
China Pushes Up November Global Steel  Output Worries Ahead
Global crude steel production expanded year over year in November on the back of a surge in output in China  the world s biggest steel maker  According to the latest report from the World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   crude steel production for 64 reporting nations spiked 5 8  year over year for the reported month to 148 6 million tons  Mt  
Chinese Output Rise Y Y
Production from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  shot up 10 8  year over year to 77 6 Mt in November  the WSA reported yesterday  However  this marks a decline from record high production of 82 6 Mt logged in October  reflecting the impact of reduced profit margins and winter output cuts that are aimed at cleaning up the environment 
Chinese crude steel output rose 6 7  year over year to 857 37 million tons for the first eleven months of 2018  according to China s National Bureau of Statistics   NBS    A surge in Chinese output amid sluggish domestic steel demand has triggered concerns that a glut of Chinese steel will put downward pressure on steel prices globally 
However  production is likely to tighten in the coming months as China started implementing a four month reduction in output in mid November aimed at curbing pollution during the winter months 
How Other Major Producers Fared
Among other major Asian producers  India saw a 1 3  drop in production to 8 5 Mt for the reported month  Output in Japan edged down 0 5  to 8 7 Mt in November while production in South Korea rose 1 1  to 5 9 Mt  Consolidated output were up 8  to 104 5 Mt in Asia 
In North America  crude steel production surged 11 8  to 7 4 Mt in the United States  Broad based tariffs on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied in March 2018  are boosting production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  The tariffs have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry 
American steel mills are also benefiting from higher domestic steel prices courtesy of the Trump administration s trade actions  Higher steel prices are driving the margins of U S  steel makers including United States Steel Corp   Nucor Corp  and Steel Dynamics  Inc 
Meanwhile  output in Canada fell 4 1  to around 1 1 Mt in November  Overall production in North America was up 6 3  to roughly 10 1 Mt   
In the Europe Union  production from Germany  the biggest producer in the region  fell 2 9  to 3 5 Mt  Output also went down 1  in Italy to 2 2 Mt while climbing 12 8  to 1 4 Mt in France  Spain saw a 0 7  decline to 1 3 Mt  Total output went up 1 2  in the European Union to 14 1 Mt 
Output in the Middle East jumped 9 1  to 2 9 Mt with Iran  the top producer in the region  seeing a 2 5  rise to 2 Mt  Africa logged a 6 1  gain to 1 3 Mt in the reported month 
Among other notable producers  production from Turkey was down 2 1  to 3 1 Mt  Output from Brazil  the largest producer in South America  dropped 6 1  to 2 8 Mt 
China is a Risk on the Horizon
A slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy is a major concern for the steel industry  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by declining car sales and a softening housing market have clouded steel demand outlook 
China s automobile sales dropped year over year in November for the fifth straight month amid a slowing economy and tariff war with the United States  Chinese automobile sales slumped 13 9  to roughly 2 55 million units in November  per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers 
China s economy grew at a slower than expected pace of 6 5  in the third quarter on a year over year basis  the weakest in nine years  amid trade frictions  International Monetary Fund   IMF    in October  cut China s GDP forecast for 2019 to 6 2  from its earlier view of 6 4  citing the ongoing trade war 
The WSA expects steel demand in China to decelerate into 2019 due to continued economic rebalancing efforts and toughening environmental regulations  Real estate stimulus and a strong world economy boosted steel demand in the country during first half 2018  Ongoing trade tensions with the United States and a slowing global economy pose as downside risks for China  per the WSA  The trade body expects Chinese steel demand to rise 6  this year and remain flat year over year in 2019 
Steel Stocks to Watch For
A couple of stocks currently worth considering in the steel space are Schnitzer Steel Industries  Inc  and POSCO  While Schnitzer Steel carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   POSCO is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

101813,323328,STLD,Tariffs Boost US Steel Stocks  FY18 Earnings  Worries Ahead  ,opinion,U S  steel makers racked up strong earnings in 2018  courtesy of the Trump administration s trade actions on imported steel  The 25  tariff on steel imports  which the U S  administration levied in March 2018  provided a thrust to U S  steel prices  as reflected by the significant run up in benchmark hot rolled coil   HRC   steel prices  The steel tariffs also provided more pricing power to American steel makers  The tariffs injected a new lease of life into U S  steel producers  who long struggled to cope with a tide of subsidized foreign imports  The punitive tariffs led to a decline in U S  steel imports in 2018  The tariffs are also boosting production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports Improved capacity drove U S  steel production in 2018  Per the World Steel Association   WSA    crude steel production increased 6 2  to 86 7 million tons  Mt  in the United States in 2018  U S  steel shipments also went up 4 8  year over year in 2018  per data from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers American Steel Makers Forge Solid Earnings in 2018Higher steel prices boosted profits of U S  steel producers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   last year with a few of them posting record earnings for the full year Steel Dynamics  the first major American steel producer to report fourth quarter results  logged record profit of  1 258 4 million or  5 35 per share in 2018  up around 55  from  812 7 million or  3 36 per share in 2017  Earnings rose on the back of higher prices and record steel shipments Nucor also delivered record setting earnings in 2018  The company s profits shot up nearly 80  year over year to  2 36 billion or  7 42 per share  The results were driven by higher sales prices and record shipments Moreover  U S  Steel s profits surged nearly three fold year over year to  1 115 million or  6 25 per share in 2018  Higher steel prices contributed to the surge in profits Meanwhile  AK Steel churned out highest net income in a decade in 2018  buoyed by higher steel selling prices and shipments  It recorded profits of  186 million or 59 cents per share  up roughly 80  year over year Both Nucor and AK Steel currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Steel Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   while U S  Steel has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   You can see  A Tough Year Ahead for U S  Steel Stocks While U S  steel stocks reaped the benefits of higher domestic steel prices in 2018  the recent weakness in prices is a worry  The price momentum witnessed in 2018 is unlikely to sustain this year U S  steel prices tracked downward in second half 2018 and tumbled during the fourth quarter on concerns over a slowdown in steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy In fact  after rallying to multi year highs on the back of Trump administration s imposition of tariffs on imported steel  U S  steel prices have now fallen back to the levels seen prior to the tariff announcement  Notably  HRC prices went downhill in January 2019  While prices rebounded in February  they are well below their peak level reached in July 2018  As such  weaker steel prices may put pressure on selling prices of American steel makers and weigh on their bottom lines in the first quarter of 2019 Moreover  a slowdown in steel demand in China amid a slowing domestic economy is a concern for the steel industry  The trade war has taken a heavy toll on the Chinese economy as reflected by China s recent tepid economic indicators Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and weak car sales have clouded steel demand outlook China s economy grew 6 6  in 2018  the weakest pace in almost three decades  China has lowered its GDP growth target for 2019 to 6 6 5  amid challenges from trade friction with the United States  rising debt level and a slowing world economy The WSA expects steel demand in China to decelerate in 2019 due to continued economic rebalancing efforts and toughening environmental regulations  Trade tensions with the United States and a slowing global economy pose as downside risks for China  The trade body expects Chinese steel demand to remain flat year over year in 2019 Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit

101815,323330,STLD,US Steel Imports Drop In 2018 As First Year Of Tariffs Nears,opinion,U S  steel imports dropped roughly 12  in 2018 under the weight of broad based tariffs which the Trump administration imposed on imported steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 a year ago According to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI     an association of North American steel makers   total and finished domestic steel imports are down 11 5  and 13 1  year over year  respectively  in 2018 to roughly 33 73 million net tons and 25 69 million net tons  respectively  Per the AISI  these figures are based on final U S  Census Bureau data  Finished steel import market share was 23  for the year  That is down from 27  clocked in 2017 The biggest offshore suppliers for 2018 were South Korea with 2 764 000 net tons  down 26  year over year   Japan with 1 383 00 net tons  down 8    Germany with 1 339 000 net tons  down 5    Turkey with 1 153 000 net tons  down 47   and Vietnam with 1 110 000 net tons  up 48   Tariffs Put U S  Steel Mills Back in BusinessPresident Donald Trump  on Mar 8  2018  signed orders imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  defying a wave of criticism and threats of counter measures from major foreign trade partners  The tariffs  which came into effect on Mar 23  are approaching the end of their first year The tariffs are aimed at rescuing the domestic steel and aluminum industries which had long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and has suffered significant reduction in production and employment  The tariffs also fulfilled one of President Trump s key election promises of bringing down America s massive trade deficit  The tariffs are  in particular  are targeted at countries with which the United States has significant trade deficits The Trump administration  in May 2018  moved ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada  Mexico and the European Union following the expiration of temporary exemptions on these major U S  allies  With this  all tariffs on steel imports went into effect from Jun 1  2018  This was a welcome move as Canada and Mexico are two major sources of steel imports to the United States  together representing roughly a quarter of U S  steel imports The 25  tariffs on steel imports have provided a breather to American steel makers and have put the wind back into the sails of the long struggling U S  steel industry  The tariffs have boosted production capacity of U S  steel producers amid lower imports  They have helped U S  steel industry capacity break above the important 80  level   the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the industry American steel mills are also benefiting from higher domestic steel prices as a result of the trade actions  Higher steel prices boosted profits of U S  steel makers in 2018  Leading U S  steel companies such as United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   gained from higher realized steel prices in the fourth quarter While U S  Steel has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Nucor  Steel Dynamics and AK Steel currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Leveraging strong cash flows  a number of American steel producers are investing to ramp up production capabilities and upgrade facilities  U S  Steel restarted two blast furnaces last year at its integrated steelmaking plant  Granite City Works  in Illinois  which is expected to support the growing demand for steel made in the United States  The company  last month  also declared the restart of construction of an electric arc furnace steelmaking facility  with an expected annual capacity of 1 6 million tons  at its Tubular Operations in Fairfield  The company cited President Trump s trade actions and improved market conditions as key drivers for the move Moreover  Steel Dynamics is currently executing a number of projects that should add to capacity  The company is investing  1 7  1 8 billion to build a new electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill in the United States that is expected to have an annual production capacity of roughly 3 million tons Nucor is also significantly investing in a host of expansion programs to beef up capacity  These include a  650 million investment for expansion of the production capability of its flat rolled sheet steel mill  Nucor Steel Gallatin  in Kentucky Nucor  earlier this year  also said that it plans to spend  1 35 billion to construct a new state of the art plate mill in the U S  Midwest that is expected to have a capacity to produce 1 2 million tons of steel plate products annually  The project  which is expected to create around 400 full time jobs  will allow Nucor to supply plate products that it does not presently offer  The company said that trade actions and tax reform have provided it the confidence to make this investment Uncertainties RemainWhile trade actions have provided a respite to U S  steel makers  there are still uncertainties surrounding the tariffs including exemptions of countries  The Trump administration has already reached quota agreements on steel imports with Argentina  Brazil and South Korea  There is still a possibility that more countries will be exempted from the tariff orders on the basis of quotas Notably  there is an increasing pressure from various industry groups on the U S  administration to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada and Mexico The U S  administration has not removed the tariffs even though leaders of the three nations  in November  signed the United States Mexico Canada Agreement   USMCA   to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement   NAFTA    Canada and Mexico have been pushing the Trump administration to repeal the tariffs  There is likelihood that Washington will eventually lift the tariffs on these countries and replace them with restrictive import quotas Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018

101839,323354,STLD,4 Top Earnings Growth Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t last over the long haul This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth

101840,323355,STLD,Weekend Report  Are We Heading Towards Inflation Or Deflation  ,opinion,"The big question I ve been grappling with recently is the inflation or deflation theme  Last Friday s price action felt like a counterpunch to the deflation scenario as the US dollar fell pretty hard and interest rate reversed  It was almost exactly a year ago around at this time that we started to take some positions related to the inflationary scenario by buying some of the different commodities stocks like BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd ADR  NYSE BHP   Global X Copper Miners  NYSE COPX   VanEck Vectors Coal  NYSE KOL   VelocityShares 3x Long Crude linked to S P GSCI Crude Oil Excess Return  NYSE UWT   Southern Copper Corporation  NYSE SCCO   Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc  NASDAQ SCHN  and Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD   Many had broken out of large trading ranges and H S bottoms  In January of this year when the US stock markets began our recent correction I went to 100  cash as I wanted to be safe than sorry  That was also about the time the US dollar began to find a possible bottom which had pretty much been in a free fall 
Lets start by looking at some US dollar charts as it will most likely be our guide in the inflation or deflation theme going forward  This first daily chart shows the US dollar initially bottoming in late January and then building out the five point rectangle reversal pattern that reversed the downtrend  After a strong impulse move up the US dollar began to correct that impulse leg by building out a rising wedge formation seven weeks ago  IMHO that seven week rising wedge is probably the most important chart pattern on the planet right now  Whichever way it breaks out will affect a lot of markets 
One of the hallmarks of a bullish rising wedge or flag is that they almost always have a negative divergence on the RSI  If you think about it a consolidation pattern that slopes up in the direction of the trend is like a running correction  Even though the price action is still going higher the RSI has a chance to correct its overbought condition  In strong moves the RSI often finds support around the 45 area before reversing back up  With the move up last week the US dollar completed its fourth reversal point which puts it into the consolidation pattern category  Since the top rail held resistance the price action is now declining in a possible fifth reversal point which won t be complete until the bottom rail is reached  Even if the bottom rail is touched we could still see a sixth reversal point back to the upside  The bottom line is  whatever direction this rising wedge breaks a pretty big move should follow 

Below is a two year daily chart which shows the year and a half downtrend channel with the rising wedge forming just above the top rail  It s easy to see how the rising wedge will most likely be a consolation pattern to the upside or a top  The thin black rectangles at the top of the chart show how the original downtrend channel doubled in size when the center dashed midline was broken to the downside  Before the break to the downside the center dashed midline was the bottom of the downtrend channel 

There was a possible bigger reversal pattern we discussed shortly after the breakout above the year and a half downtrend channel which was a possible inverse H S bottom  We were looking at the 95 area for a possible neckline and symmetry would suggest the low for the right should could come at the left shoulder low around the 91 area  The 200 day simple moving average comes in at 92 16 

This next chart is a long term monthly look which shows the US dollar s uptrend channel that actually began in 2011 at reversal point  4 in the fractal big base  2  Until the bottom rail of the nearly seven year bull market uptrend channel is broken to the downside I have to remain a bull regardless of all the reasons the US dollar should crash and burn 

Below is another monthly chart which uses candlesticks  When the US dollar is in a strong impulse move up you will see a string of white candlesticks all in a row and when the US dollar is in a strong impulse leg down you will see a string of black candlesticks all in a row  Up until last week the US dollar had made four white candlesticks all in a row  We still have seven more days of trading so it will be important to see what the monthly bar will look like  In a strong impulse leg up we may see one black candlestick that will generally show up as a small consolidation pattern between all the white candlesticks  You can see that the 2014   2105 impulse leg up didn t have one black candlestick  It s just something we can watch 

When that strong impulse move out of big base  2 broke out that impulse leg was strong enough to take out that 30 year top rail of the falling wedge  As you can see the price action initially backtested the top rail right after the breakout which is what we would expect but the markets never make it easy on you  The breakout above the top rail of the 30 year trendline took place in January of 2015  that same trendline was backtested three years later in January of 2018  which held once more so we know it s important 

Lets now look at several ratio charts to see how the US dollar is behaving vs gold  This first ratio chart compares gold to the US dollar  The last time we looked at this chart the price action was just starting to breakdown from that small blue 5 point triangle reversal pattern  When this ratio is rising that means that gold is outperforming the US dollar  As you can see the ratio has been falling since January of this year which means the US dollar has been outperforming gold 

This next ratio chart compares the US dollar to the CRB index  Since 2016 the US dollar has been under performing the CRB commodities index forming a falling channel  Since January of this year the ratio has been rising which means the US dollar has been outperforming the CRB index  Note that strong impulse move up that started in mid 2014 and how the US dollar really outperformed the CRB commodities index  It still has a way to go yet  but if the price action breaks out above the top rail that 2 1 2 falling channel will most likely be a halfway pattern to the upside with the impulse leg showing similar characteristics to the 2014   2015 impulse leg  Again we can t get too excited until the top rail is broken  but the possibility exists 

This last chart for tonight is a ratio combo chart which has the iShares TIPS Bond  NYSE TIP  TLT ratio on top with the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  overlaid in red with the CRB and GDX  NYSE GDX  on the bottom  When the ratio in black is rising it shows inflation and deflation when it s falling  This chart really sums up the debate on whether we are going to see some inflation or deflation  For three and a half years now the price action has been building out what appears to be a H S top on the TLT in red and a H S bottom on the ratio in black  The last time we looked at this chart I drew in the thin black dashed trendline which is showing a possible triangle  As you can see the TLT in red bounced off the top dashed trendline last week while the ratio in black bounced off of its bottom trendline last week as well  Even though the ratio in black rose a little bit last week the CRB and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  indexes both declined  If you like drama and suspense then this ratio combo chart is for you  All the best Rambus",2018-07-23,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weekend-reportinflation-or-deflation--drama-and-suspense--200332388,200332388

101842,323357,STLD,World Steel Output Up  China Is A Risk Looming On The Horizon,opinion,Global crude steel production expanded in October as steel mills in China  the world s biggest steel producer  churned out record monthly output   According to the latest report from the World Steel Association   WSA     the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   crude steel production for 64 reporting nations spiked 5 8  year over year for the reported month to 156 6 million tons  Mt   China Chalks Up Record ProductionProduction from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  surged 9 1  year over year to a new record high of 82 6 Mt in October  exceeding the previous peak of 81 2 Mt registered in July Notwithstanding the ongoing U S  China trade tensions  Chinese steel mills have been beefing up output to take advantage of strong profit margins  The spike in output came despite Beijing s ongoing efforts to reduce the country s massive excess steel capacity and streamline its burgeoning steel sector  Chinese crude steel output rose 6 4  year over year to 782 46 million tons the first ten months of 2018  according to China s National Bureau of Statistics   NBS   Fears of oversupply of steel in the market triggered by a surge in production in China to record highs in the recent months have gripped the steel industry lately The ramp up of output in China amid sluggish domestic steel demand has raised industry wide concerns that a glut of Chinese steel will put downward pressure on steel prices globally  Nevertheless  production is likely to tighten in the coming months as China has started implementing a four month reduction in output aimed at curbing pollution during the winter months How Other Key Producers Fared in OctoberAmong other major Asian producers  India saw a 0 4  rise in production to 8 8 Mt for the reported month  Indian steel mills have been benefiting from strong domestic demand Output in Japan slipped 4 5  to 8 6 Mt in October as production was hurt by technical issues across certain mills and lingering impacts of natural disasters  Production in South Korea went up 3 5  to 6 2 Mt  Consolidated output were up 7 6  to 110 5 Mt in Asia In North America  crude steel production shot up 10 5  to 7 6 Mt in the United States  American steel mills are benefiting from higher domestic steel prices courtesy of the Trump administration s trade actions to curb imports  Higher steel prices are driving the margins of U S  steel makers including United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   The tariffs are also boosting production capacity of U S  steel makers amid lower imports  U S  steel industry capacity utilization is currently hovering above the 80  mark  the minimum rate required for the long term viability of the industry   reflecting the impact of the tariffs   Meanwhile  output in Canada fell 14 6  to around 1 2 Mt in October  Overall production in North America was up 5 5  to roughly 10 5 Mt   In the Europe Union  production from Germany  the biggest producer in the region  edged up 1 4  to 3 6 Mt  Output rose 1 1  in Italy to 2 3 Mt while declining 3 5  to 1 3 Mt in France  Spain saw a 7 4  decline to 1 3 Mt  Total output inched down 0 8  in the European Union to 14 8 Mt Output in the Middle East shot

top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy spells problems for the steel industry  Signs of weakness across the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and declining car sales have clouded steel demand outlook China s automobile sales dropped 11 7  to 2 38 million units in October  the fourth straight month of year on year decline  per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  Moreover  China s property investment growth hit 10 month low of 7 7  in October  slowing from an 8 9  expansion in September  according to Reuters China s economy grew at a slower than expected pace of 6 5  in the third quarter on a year over year basis  the weakest in nine years  amid escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington  International Monetary Fund  IMF   last month  cut China s GDP forecast for 2019 to 6 2  from its earlier view of 6 4  citing the ongoing trade war The WSA envisions steel demand in China to decelerate towards the end of 2018 and into 2019 due to continued economic rebalancing efforts and toughening environmental regulations  Real estate stimulus and a strong world economy boosted steel demand in the country during first half 2018  Ongoing trade tensions with the United States and a slowing global economy pose as downside risks for China  per the WSA  The

101843,323358,STLD,US Steel Imports Drop YTD On Trade Actions  Worries Ahead ,opinion,U S  steel imports have dropped year to date thanks to broad based tariffs which the Trump administration imposed on imported steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 According to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI     an association of North American steel makers   total and finished domestic steel imports are down 10 6  and 13 4  year over year  respectively  year to date  through the first ten months of 2018  to roughly 29 44 million net tons and 22 08 million net tons  respectively  Per the AISI  these figures are based on preliminary U S  Census Bureau data The biggest offshore suppliers for the first 10 months were South Korea with 2 479 000 net tons  down 26  year over year   Japan with 1 169 000 net tons  down 11    Germany with 1 100 000 net tons  down 5    Turkey with 1 041 000 net tons  down 50   and Taiwan with 913 000 net tons  down 21   Finished steel import market share was estimated at 21  year to date  For 2018  annualized total and finished steel imports are expected to decline 7 4  and 10 4  year over year respectively  per the AISI Tariffs   A Respite for U S  Steel ProducersThe 25  tariffs on steel imports  which the Trump administration levied in March  have injected a new lease of life for the U S  steel industry  The tariffs have provided the much needed protection to American steel producers who have long struggled to cope with a tide of cheap foreign imports  The punitive tariffs appear to be bearing fruit as reflected by a decline in U S  steel imports year to date  through October 2018  Moreover  the tariffs have provided a thrust to U S  steel prices as reflected by the significant run up in benchmark hot rolled steel prices this year  giving American steel makers more pricing power  Higher U S  steel prices are driving the profitability of domestic steel makers  Leading U S  steel companies such as United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS   gained from higher realized steel prices in the third quarter The tariffs are also boosting production capacity of domestic steel makers amid lower imports  U S  steel industry capacity utilization is currently hovering above the 80  mark  the minimum rate required for the long term viability of the industry   reflecting the impact of the tariffs   Capacity utilization rate   a key metric in the steel industry   reached 81 3  for the week ending Nov 24  up from 73 3  a year ago  according to data released by the AISI  U S  capacity utilization rate was estimated at 72  in 2017  A flood of subsidized imports led to the tepid utilization last year Uncertainties Surrounding Tariffs PrevailWhile the trade actions have provided a breather to U S  steel makers so far this year  there are still uncertainties surrounding the tariffs including exemptions of countries Following the initial tariff announcement  President Trump softened his stance and made concessions in the tariff order by excluding a number of countries while leaving room for other nations to negotiate exclusions from the tariffs  The Trump administration has already reached quota agreements on steel imports with Argentina  Brazil and South Korea  There is a possibility that more countries will be exempted from the tariff orders on the basis of quotas  This may thwart the administration s efforts to stem the influx of cheaper imports The Trump administration  in May 2018  moved ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada  Mexico and the European Union  EU  following the expiration of temporary exemptions on these major U S  allies  With this  all tariffs on steel imports went into effect from Jun 1  2018  This marked a welcome move as Canada and Mexico are two major sources of steel imports to the United States  together representing roughly a quarter of U S  steel imports Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States  accounting for roughly 16  of total U S  steel imports in 2017  per the U S  Census Bureau data  Mexico is the fourth largest exporter of the metal with around 9  market share However  there is an increasing pressure from various industry groups on the U S  administration to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada and Mexico  All three countries are expected to officially sign the United States Mexico Canada Agreement   USMCA   to replace the existing North American Free Trade Agreement   NAFTA   at the G20 leaders  summit in Argentina that starts this Friday The tariff issue was left unresolved when the countries announced the USMCA deal

101873,323388,STLD,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Steel Dynamics  Ternium  Nucor  Aperam And Shiloh,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 8  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Steel  including Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD    Ternium S A    NYSE TX    Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    Aperam S A    OTC APEMY   and Shiloh Industries  Inc    NASDAQ SHLO   Industry  Steel  Part 1Link  The steel industry enjoyed a good run in 2017  barring a few lingering challenges  The industry will benefit from strong economic momentum being exhibited by advanced and developing economies  and sustained healthy demand in the automobile and construction sectors  Further  President Trump s plans for massive infrastructure spending   one of his key campaign promises   will be a catalyst for American steel makers given the expected increase in steel consumption  Notably  Trump s aggressive trade policies are anticipated to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry Steel Imports  Threat to National Security   Trump Slaps TariffIn March  President Trump implemented a tariff of 25  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico  to counter an  assault on the country  by foreign competitors  This is an attempt to reinforce the American steel and aluminum industries  which have long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and suffered significant reduction in production as well as employment This was the aftermath of the U S  Department of Commerce s investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at the behest of the Trump administration  In fact  in January 2018  the investigating authority submitted reports to the President stating that the quantities of steel and aluminum imports  threaten to impair the national security   Notably  U S  steel imports were nearly four times the country s exports  Six basic oxygen furnaces and four electric furnaces have been closed since 2000 and employment has slumped 35  since 1998 Tariffs a Relief for Steel IndustryThe imposition of tariff on imports would improve domestic steel production from its present capacity of 73  to approximately an operating rate of 80    the minimum rate required for the long term viability of the industry  It will also lead to lower imports into the United States  which would in turn  will boost demand for American steel  This will provide the domestic players with more pricing power and help to level the playing field According to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute   AISI    an association of North American steel makers  total and finished steel imports have dipped 3 0  and 1 7   respectively  year over year in the first quarter of 2018  For 2018  annualized total and finished steel imports is projected to decline 8 8  and 7 6  year over year  respectively This is a major improvement from the 15  rise noted in total steel imports in 2017  Despite the U S  Department of Commerce s imposition of several duties on additional steel products  imports refused to abate last year due to foreign producers  overcapacity  Moreover  a delay in Section 232 investigation on steel imports by the U S  Department of Commerce also triggered a spike in steel imports in 2017 Steel Production Expands at Solid PaceFollowing an increase of 5 3  in world crude steel output in 2017  the momentum continues in 2018  Per the World Steel Association    WSA   global steel production improved 4 1  to 426 6 metric tons  Mt  on a year over year basis in the first quarter of 2018 propelled by higher output across all regions Steel production in Asia was pegged at 294 Mt in the quarter  an increase of 4 6  year over year  North America s crude steel production registered a 1 9  rise to 29 5 Mt in the quarter while the EU produced 43 1 Mt of crude steel  rising 0 9  year over year  China  the world s largest steel maker which accounts for around half of the global production  delivered a 4 5  rise in steel production to 74 Mt during the quarter Industry Positioning  FavorableThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions

has outperformed the S P 500 s growth of 11 8  Where s the Industry Headed The WSA forecasts global steel demand to expand 1 8  in 2018 to 1 616 1 Mt as favorable global economic scenario  commodity prices and perked up investment will drive steel demand in both developed and developing economies  However  deceleration in China and weakened investment momentum due to higher interest rates has led to a weakened projection of 0 7  for 2019  As the China government continues to focus on shifting the growth driver toward consumption  investment is likely to further decelerate The outlook for steel demand in the United States is supported by strong demand and investment triggered by rising income and low interest rates  In the Eurozone  broadening recovery across countries  robust domestic demand  resumption in investment as well as pickup in non residential construction and strong manufacturing activities will lead to growth  Recovery in oil and commodity prices has improved the outlook for the Middle East  Provided geopolitical stability can be achieved  steel demand outlook for the region could further improve driven by reconstruction demand  The mild recovery in Russia and Brazil is anticipated to continue and in other Latin American countries  recovery is underway and growth will likely pick if reforms are implemented India is anticipated to act as the next growth engine  given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors along with rapid urbanization and structural reforms  The Indian economy is stabilizing from the impact of currency reform and GST implementation and steel demand is expected to accelerate gradually  mainly driven by public investment However  rising trade tensions  inflationary pressure and tightening of the United States and EU monetary policies may cause market volatilities and trouble highly indebted emerging economies  These factors are likely to dampen the steel industry s momentum  Meanwhile  the automotive and construction industries will continue to be the mainstays of the steel industry Some Stocks in FocusOverall a favorable ranking  earnings growth expectation instils optimism for the industry

it won t be able to stand the test of time This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing share price  But expectations of earnings also play a significant role here Earnings Estimates Shape Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings

101949,323464,STLD,Here s Why You Should Hold On To POSCO  PKX  ADR For Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on POSCO   NYSE PKX   on Apr 5  2018  Healthy demand for steel in domestic and international arenas  a large customer base in various end markets and strategic initiatives will support this South Korean steel producer s growth trajectory  However  high debt levels and stiff competition are major concerning factors The company  with a market capitalization of approximately  24 1 billion  carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below  we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds  Factors Favoring POSCOShare Price Performance and Healthy 2018 Projections  Last year  POSCO s American Depository Receipts  ADR  yielded 27 6  return  outperforming 16 7  gain recorded by the  Its financial performance in 2017 was impressive  with net income surging 183 8  year over year on revenue growth of 14 3   For 2018  the company anticipates consolidated revenues to be approximately KRW 61 9 trillion  higher than KRW 60 7 trillion recorded in 2017  Also  it predicts crude steel production to be roughly 37 4 million tons  higher than 37 2 million tons produced in 2017  Growth Potential Solid  POSCO operates through four business segments   Steel  Trading  Engineering   Construction and Others   largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group  Also  a vast customer base in various end markets  including economic research and consulting  architecture  electronic commerce  forest resources development  computer hardware and software distribution  crude oil   natural gas mining plus real estate development  is a boon We believe that any rise in investment for infrastructural development by the government  as well as anticipated growth in the automobile and shipbuilding industry of its home country  will work in its favor  Moreover  the World Steel Association predicts global steel consumption to grow 1 6  year over year in 2018  This forecast includes 1 1  growth in the United States  5 7  in India  1 4  in European Union  4 5  in the MENA region  6 8  in ASEAN countries and flat in China  Restructuring Initiatives  Measures undertaken to improve steel operations  as well as other prime businesses and overall profitability  will be advantageous  In this regard  completion of revamping work at Pohang Works  Blast Furnace  3  along with other maintenance projects in 2017  is worth mentioning  This move will assist in hassle free production in the future Also  the company believes in disposing of non core assets to strengthen the business portfolio  It worked on 150 restructuring cases  including 85 subsidiaries and 65 assets  during the 2014 2017 timeframe  Over time  these business restructuring activities resulted in the positive financial impact of KRW 7 trillion  including approximately KRW 5 7 trillion in proceeds and roughly KRW 1 3 trillion in debt reduction  Notably  the company worked on 26 restructuring cases in 2017  including 19 subsidiaries and seven assets  In the quarters ahead  the company intends to work on the business portfolio of its subsidiaries as well as initiate efforts to relocate growth businesses for enhancing its competitiveness  Factors Working Against POSCO Poor Valuation   Threats From International Expansion  On a P E  TTM  basis  POSCO s ADR looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 11 7x and 7 7x in the last year  This makes us cautious about the stock POSCO Price and Consensus    Also  global expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies  Also  uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact its businesses  Internationally  its products are sold in China  Japan  Europe  the Middle East and North America  Huge Debts Raise Concerns  POSCO s non current liabilities was approximately KRW 12 6 trillion  exiting the fourth quarter of 2017  We believe  if unchecked  huge debt levels will increase its financial obligations and hence  prove detrimental to its profitability  Industry Competition  POSCO faces stiff competition from companies that have huge production capacity as well as from new players in the industry  primarily those originating from China and India Some key players in the steel industry are ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    Schnitzer Steel Industries  Inc    NASDAQ SCHN   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD    All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  In the last 60 days  earnings estimates for both the stocks improved for the current year and the next year  Also  average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 39 43  for ArcelorMittal  0 81  for Schnitzer Steel Industries and 6 49  for Steel Dynamics  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to

101951,323466,STLD,4 Top Stocks To Buy With Superb Efficiency Level,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory  Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable  You can see  Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 12 Here are four stocks from the 12 that made it through the screen Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX   provides a portfolio of renal and hospital products  The company operates through two segments  Hospital Products and Renal  The company has an average four quarter

101956,323471,STLD,U S  Steel Producers On A Roll As May 1 Deadline Approaches,opinion,"The U S  steel industry is buoyant in the backdrop of a favorable regulatory environment  The goal of the government is to revive the industry  which has seen a steady decline as local production was increasingly substituted with cheaper imports 
Steel imports have jumped from  22 7 billion in 2010 to  29 1 billion last year  according to the U S  Census Bureau with the country remaining the world s largest importer of steel  Further  USGS data shows that while steel mill and semi finished product imports were 36 million metric tons  MMT  and 8 4 MMT in 2017  steel mill exports were a mere 11 MMT 
Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis  SIMA  data says that in the year ending January  35  of imported steel comprised flat products  28  pipes and tubes  19  semi finished and 18  long products  Canada  19    Brazil  13    Korea  12    Mexico  11    Turkey  5   and Japan  5   were the top exporters to the U S 
So the prospect of a 25  tariff on imported products was seen as a positive for the industry that could perhaps help it generate higher volumes and stronger pricing  A longer term benefit  because it is capital intensive  could also be the resuscitation of operations that were shut down in the last few years as a result of consistent Chinese dumping 
But there was a catch  Canada  Mexico  the European Union  Australia  Argentina  Brazil and South Korea were granted exemptions until May 1  so they could negotiate more favorable terms with the U S  as regards their steel exports to the country  something the government has flagged as a national security concern  Since the list includes all of the top steel suppliers to the U S   the May 1 deadline has assumed great importance 
Moreover  even if these deals work out  the government will introduce a quota system  so cheap Chinese products can t sneak in indirectly through dumping in any of the supplier countries 
Challenges
While the tariff will bring pricing support  it will also result in some challenges 
For one  it is practically impossible to take China out of the pricing equation because it is the world s biggest producer  exporter and consumer of steel  On the positive side  after the EU raised its antidumping duty on Chinese steel from a range of 18 1 35 9  to a range of 48 3 71 9  in March while also extending the period by another 5 years and Mexico did likewise on carbon steel pipes that were threatening its domestic producers  China said it would lower production in a phased manner over the next few years  It did however announce a retaliatory tariff of 25  on U S  seamless steel pipes in response to President Trump s actions 
Second  the U S  imports a lot of steel pipes and tubes  such as those used in the energy industry  Whether domestic operations are currently geared to making those is debatable since a facility making sheets can t easily be adapted to making pipes instead  Shutdown operations may be retooled for the purpose  but it will require significant time and investment 
Third  the U S   while still a big producer of pig iron  has gradually been moving away from ore based raw materials to scrap instead  When the price of steel goes up  so does the price of scrap  Companies currently expect to pass this on to customers if competition from cheaper imports is controlled  But whether those customers are in a position to absorb the much higher priced steel is a big question 
Which brings us to the fourth challenge  The top consumers of steel products in the U S  are currently construction  automobile  energy  machinery   equipment  container  appliances  defense   military industries  which accounted for 40   26   10   10   4   4  and 3  of U S  steel demand in 2017  statista   So if steel prices go up  so will the costs for all these industries  This will hurt their profitability  make their output less competitive  and might lead them to curtail production  If they curtail production  steel producers will be hit again 
So the big question before us now  other than price  is the level of demand that steel producers are seeing  which we can gauge from management comments  utilization rates  both current and expected  and revenue estimates  What a good thing that we are in the earnings season 
Recent Earnings Reports Paint A Rosy Picture
Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   reported revenue and earnings that were both ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenue grew 15 6  from last year while earnings grew 5 4   Average selling price  ASP  grew 9   Management said on the call that utilization at its steel mills was up   
The Zacks  2  Buy  ranked company s June quarter revenue estimate of  6 29 billion is up 2 7  from January while the September quarter revenue estimate of  6 38 billion is up 7 9   The estimates represent 21 5  and 23 4  increases from the respective quarters of 2017 

Steel Dynamics  Inc   NASDAQ STLD   reported strong revenue and earnings  both of which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimates  Revenue grew 10 0  from last year while earnings grew 17 1   ASP grew 11   We ll know about the utilization after the call 
The Zacks  1  Strong Buy  ranked stock s June quarter revenue estimate of  2 82 billion is up 7 2  from January while the September quarter revenue estimate of  2 86 billion is up 10 7   The estimates represent 18 0  and 17 1  increases from the respective quarters of 2017 

ArcelorMittal s   NYSE MT   fourth quarter earnings report was in February  so it doesn t capture the tariff drama  But the estimate revision trend may tell the story 
The Zacks  1 ranked stock s March quarter revenue estimate of  19 38 billion is up 5 0  from February while the June quarter revenue estimate of  21 15 billion is up 16 7   The estimates represent 20 5  and 22 7  increases from the respective quarters of 2017 

United States Steel Corp    NYSE X   will report results next week  The Zacks  1 ranked stock s March quarter revenue estimate of  3 10 billion is marginally down from February while the June quarter revenue estimate of  3 45 billion is up 3 3   The estimates represent 13 8  and 9 7  increases from the respective quarters of 2017

101995,323510,STLD,5 Solid Steel Stocks That Are Set To Run Higher In Q2,opinion,The steel industry has staged a comeback after being out of favor for long  taking succour from a recovery in steel demand and prices and a strengthening global economy The highly cyclical industry is gaining from a cyclical upturn in steel demand on the back of strong economic momentum across advanced and developing economies  Steel makers are also benefiting from a recovery in steel prices  In particular  steel prices are on an upswing in the United States on the back of the Trump administration s trade actions to curb imports  reflected by the recent run up in hot rolled steel prices Moreover  continued momentum in the automotive space and a recovery across housing and commercial construction markets have been key tailwinds for the steel industry  The construction and automotive industries are expected to continue to provide the backbone to the industry The steel industry has outperformed the broader market  S P 500  in a year s time  The industry has gained around 23 1  in this period  topping the S P 500 s corresponding return of around 10   While the overall demand fundamentals for steel is improving  the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity  The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity   the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability Upturn in Global Steel Demand ContinuesThe World Steel Association  WSA    the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   sees global steel demand to expand 1 6  in 2018  While the WSA envisions a slowdown in demand in China due to the government s efforts to rebalance the economy and clean up the environment  the momentum is expected to continue in the rest of the world  Global steel demand barring China is expected to rise 3  in 2018 The WSA expects the global economic momentum to support a growth in steel demand  It sees steel demand in the European Union to go up 1 4  in 2018  The Eurozone s economic recovery continues apace  The region s recovery is backed by declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence Steel demand in the United States is expected to rise 1 1  this year  per the WSA  The U S  economy is showing strong fundamentals on the back of improving business confidence and solid consumer spending Demand in emerging and developing economies  barring China  is also expected to rise 4 9  this year  Developing economies are gaining from an upturn in the world economy and economic reforms across several countries including India and Brazil Trade Tariffs   A Reprieve for U S  Steel MillsThe Trump administration has slapped a 25  tariff on steel imports aimed at protecting the U S  steel industry which had long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and has suffered significant reduction in production and employment  The tariffs would also fulfil one of President Trump s key election promises of bringing down America s massive trade deficit The tariffs  which have drawn criticism from major U S  trading partners  are the result of the U S  Department of Commerce s investigation that was carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to determine whether the imports pose a threat to national security But President Trump s softening tariff stance is a worry  The Trump administration  last month  said that it would temporarily exempt certain countries from the tariffs  The list includes the European Union  EU   Argentina  Australia  Brazil  Canada  Mexico and South Korea  many of which have been in talks with the United States to win an exemption  Moreover  the tariff orders included provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions provided their imports do not hurt the U S  economy Nevertheless  the trade tariffs have provided a much needed relief to the U S  steel makers  The tariffs are expected to lead to lower imports into the United States  which would in turn boost demand for American steel and drive profitability of U S  steel makers  The tariffs would also provide a boost to steel prices  give American steel makers more pricing power and help to level the playing field  U S  steel prices are on an uptrend following the trade tariff announcement Moreover  the tariffs are expected to boost production capacity of domestic steel makers amid lower imports  All these are likely to help in creating hundreds of new steel jobs in the country Too Much Steel Remain a ConcernThe global steel industry continued bear the brunt of a surge in production in China as steel mills in the world s biggest steel producing nation continued to take advantage of a spike in domestic steel prices that translates to higher profits for the Chinese steel industry According to a recent WSA report  global crude steel production went up 3 5  year over year to 131 8 million tons  Mt  in February 2018  Production from China  which accounts for around half of the global steel output  spiked 5 9  year over year to 64 9 Mt in February  The rise in production came amid escalating trade tensions between the United States and China Chinese steel output was expected to decline during winter months as Beijing had implemented a four month reduction in production to reduce the country s excess steel supply and clean up the environment  Production is expected to rise further moving ahead as those winter restrictions ended last month 5 Steel Stocks Worth Betting on NowAs the steel industry fundamentals are

102028,323543,STLD,3 U S  Steel Stocks To Buy On Trump Tariff ,opinion,"There is not much clarity yet surrounding President Donald Trump s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum  and Monday morning only complicated the issue after Trump took to Twitter to call out Canada and Mexico regarding NAFTA 
Last week  the president announced his intentions to impose new broad based tariffs on steel and aluminum  The plan has been met with mixed reactions since then  especially in North America where the potential implications of these tariffs could have serious  long term impacts 
Canada  as one of the top exporters of steel and aluminum to the U S   could be harmed by this proposal  and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as much recently when he called Trump s tariff proposal    
But Trump now seems set to use this steel and aluminum tariff as a tactic to help renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement  or NAFTA 
 We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada   Trump wrote in a  Monday morning    NAFTA  which is under renegotiation right now  has been a bad deal for U S A  Massive relocation of companies   jobs  Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new   fair NAFTA agreement is signed  
Even though the potential new tariffs aren t set in stone  it seems that the Trump administration is ready to roll out its plan this week  which should theoretically help U S  steel makers at least for now 
With that said  let s take a look at three U S  steel stocks that investors might want to consider amid all this tariff talk 
1       Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD  
This Indiana headquartered firm is one of the biggest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers  and stands to benefit from the planned steel tariff  Steel Dynamics is also currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is projected to see its earnings pop by nearly 22  in the first quarter of 2018  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  This bottom line growth is expected to continue  as Steel Dynamics  earnings are projected to reach  4 00 per share in fiscal 2018  which would mark 51  year over year growth 
Looking even further ahead  Steel Dynamics is projected to expand its earnings figure at an annualized rate of 12  over the next three to five years  The company has also seen analyst sentiment climb recently with a handful of upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and full fiscal year 
2        United States Steel Corporation   NYSE X  
United States Steel is expected to see its current quarter sales climb by 14   while the company s full fiscal year earnings are projected to skyrocket by nearly 94   Estimates regarding U S  Steel s substantial bottom line growth could be moved even higher once Trump s steel tariffs are enacted  In fact  the company s full year earnings estimates were already upped by  0 03 to  3 76 per share within the last seven days 
United States Steel is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports an overall  A  VGM score  Furthermore  the steel power is expected to see its earnings per share figure expand at an annualized rate of 8  over the next three to five years 
3        Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE

Severstal invested heavily in the locations in Mississippi and Michigan  which produce steel products mainly for the automotive sector  before the financial crisis and is now trying to cut costs  The company has been preparing to sell the facilities since late last year  it said  In the first quarter of this year  Severstal reported a  100 million loss on revenue of  3 billion

102052,323567,STLD,Nucor confident of favorable rulings vs steel import  tsunami ,news,"By Nicole Mordant  Reuters    Emboldened by a recent favorable ruling for U S  steelmakers in a steel pipe trade case  Nucor Corp said on Thursday it was confident the industry was poised for more success in future cases as it works to stem  a tsunami of imported steel  
Nucor Chairman and Chief Executive John Ferriola said that after spending time in Washington he is more optimistic that U S  lawmakers are finally starting to understand how damaging low priced steel imports are for the U S  economy and jobs 
In particular  he said he felt  good  about an upcoming final ruling in a case concerning imports of steel rebar from Mexico and Turkey 
 We feel confident that we ve got a good shot at a final ruling that s more favorable than the preliminary   Ferriola said on a conference call after Nucor reported better than expected quarterly earnings on higher shipments and prices 
In April  the U S  Commerce Department set preliminary duties on millions of dollars worth of rebar imports from the two countries after U S  producers complained about price undercutting 
Earlier this month  the Commerce Department set duties on South Korean steel pipe used in the oil and natural gas industry  reversing itself in one of the most contentious trade disputes in years after hefty lobbying from U S  producers and lawmakers 
Ferriola also hinted that more trade cases were in the offing but declined to be specific 
COLUMBUS
Ferriola declined to say whether Nucor had made a bid for the Columbus unit of Russia s Severstal but said that although it was a good asset Nucor could not justify the price 
Severstal said on Monday it will sell its Columbus unit in Mississippi to Steel Dynamics Inc for  1 63 billion 
 Given that it really didn t expand our geographical footprint  it didn t help us on our customer base  it didn t expand our product portfolio  we could not justify the  1 6 billion price tag   Ferriola said 
He added that he was pleased that Columbus was bought by an existing domestic competitor as that would result in further consolidation in the sheet industry 
Earlier on Thursday  Charlotte  North Carolina based Nucor said performance improved at its steel mills compared with the first quarter  especially at sheet and bar mills  It also expects an improvement in earnings in the current quarter 
Strong demand and rivals  supply problems boosted demand for sheet steel  and volume and margins rose at bar mills 
Second quarter earnings increased to  147 0 million  or 46 cents a share  from  85 1 million  or 27 cents  a year earlier  Net sales jumped 13 percent to  5 29 billion 
On average  analysts had expected earnings of 40 cents a share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Nucor s shares ended 0 2 percent firmer at  51 11

102069,323584,STLD,Steel Stocks Take Flight As DOC Proposes Tariffs On Imports ,opinion,Shares of major American steel makers got a lift last Friday after the U S  Department of Commerce  DOC  issued the long awaited reports on its probe into imports of steel and aluminum products and recommended President Donald Trump to impose tariffs or quotas on these imports The DOC s investigations  which were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  were aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security  The Trump administration ordered the investigation last year The DOC found that these imports  threaten to impair the national security  as defined by Section 232  The reports are currently under consideration by President Trump and no final decisions have been made on the recommendations provided in the reports  the DOC noted DOC Recommends Broad based ActionsThe DOC Secretary Wilbur Ross recommended several options  including tariffs and quotas  to address the problem of steel imports  Ross proposed at least 24  global tariff of on all steel imports from all countries The other proposed alternatives are at least 53  tariff on all steel imports from Brazil  China  Costa Rica  Egypt  India  Malaysia  Republic of Korea  Russia  South Africa  Thailand  Turkey and Vietnam with a quota by product on steel imports from all other countries equal to 100  of their 2017 exports to the United States and a quota on all steel products from all countries equal to 63  of their 2017 exports The DOC also stated that these alternatives are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80  operating rate from its present 73  of capacity For aluminum  Ross recommended a tariff of at least 7 7  on all exports from all countries  Another option is a 23 6  tariff of on all products from China  Hong Kong  Russia  Venezuela and Vietnam with quotas for all other countries equal to 100  of their 2017 exports to the United States  A quota on all imports from all countries equal to up to 86 7  of their 2017 exports has also been proposed Steel Stocks RallyThe DOC s recommendations provided a boost to the stocks of leading domestic steel companies  United States Steel Corporation   NYSE X   racked up the biggest gain with its shares rising 14 8  last Friday  AK Steel Holding Corporation s   NYSE AKS

Commercial Metals currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Imports Still Haunt American Steel MillsDomestic steel makers struggled to cope with a renewed tide of cheap steel imports last year  Imports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions  in the form of heavy tariffs  and threats of further future measures  These imports have hurt selling prices and margins of U S  steel makers According to the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   an association of North American steel makers  total steel imports shot up 15 4  to around 38 1 million net tons in 2017  Finished steel imports for 2017 also increased 12 2  to around 29 6 million net tons  per the AISI  For full year 2017  finished steel import market share was an estimated 27   which is higher than 26  clocked in 2016 Although positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States  imports from other countries remain at above historical levels According to AISI data  finished steel imports from China fell roughly 5 7  year over year in 2017  However  imports from other countries such as Germany  Taiwan  Brazil and Russia spiked last year U S  steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel  The President has until Apr 11  2018 to make a decision on the DOC s steel recommendations  A positive decision would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power

year  which bodes well for the steel industry  Further  President Trump s plans for colossal infrastructure spending   one of his key campaign promises   will be a catalyst for American steel makers as it is likely to have a beneficial effect on the U S  steel industry given the expected increase in steel consumption So it is safe to say a lot of hopes rest on the President  Notably  Trump s aggressive trade policies are also anticipated to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  Moreover  the industry continues to benefit from the sustained healthy demand in the automobile and construction sectors Steel Production Expands at a Solid PacePer the World Steel Association s   WSA   data available til October 2017  global steel production surged a healthy 5 6  to 1410 metric tons  Mt  on a year over year basis propelled by higher output across all regions  Steel production in Asia was at 975 Mt in 10 month period  an increase of 6 0  year over year  North America s crude steel production registered a 4 1  rise to 96 5 Mt while the EU produced 140 8 Mt of crude steel  rising 3 7  year over year Steel production in the C I S  was at 85 2 Mt  a 0 4  rise year over year  China  the world s largest steel maker which accounts for around half of the global production  delivered a 6 1  rise in steel production during the first 10 months of the year Concerns about China s slowdown had dealt a massive blow to the global steel industry over the last couple years  with overcapacity and lower steel prices denting the margins of Chinese steel producers  Efforts have been undertaken to reduce overcapacity and upgrade production in China s steel industry to negate these factors To mitigate the impact of rebalancing  the Chinese government issued a number of mini stimulus measures  This led to a short term boom in infrastructure investment and the housing market  working in favor of the steel industry  Consequently  China s steel demand grew 1 3  in 2016 and the industry continues to witness strong steel demand so far in 2017 The country s steel exports slumped 31  for the first 11 months of 2017  per data released by the General Administration of Customs  Notably  November marks the 15th consecutive month in which Chinese steel exports have registered a yearly decline  Positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China is contributing to a decline in Chinese steel exports Further  China s actions to reduce excess steel supply are also expected to lend support to steel prices in 2017  The world s largest steel producer has pledged to cut steel production capacity by around 50 million Mt in 2017 to tackle pollution and curb excess supply Cheap Imports Continue to Hinder GrowthU S  steel mills remain impacted by depressed capacity utilization and a surge of unfairly traded imports  The domestic market continues to be inundated with cheap imports from overseas producers  especially China  According to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   total and finished steel imports for the first 10 months of 2017 shot up 19 4  and 15 4  year over year  respectively  Year to date  finished steel import market share is estimated at 28  American steel makers including Nucor Corp   United States Steel Corp   AK Steel Holding Corp   Steel Dynamics Inc  and ArcelorMittal USA have been bearing the brunt of high levels of cheap imports  This has resulted in declining orders  idling of mills and layoffs across the board  Consequently  U S  steel makers continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and enforce new trade laws to rescue the crisis hit American steel industry Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and

102133,323648,STLD,21 Charts Show Commodities Are Breaking Out,opinion,"In this post  I would like to update some charts from the commodity complex since we are starting to see some action in this sector  Back in the summer when we first started to get long some of the different commodities sectors  we saw many breakouts from some very nice H S bases 
After the initial move up came the first consolidation phase which has been going on for nearly four months or so  We are now starting to see some of these consolidation patterns breaking out which should lead to the next impulse move higher in most cases 
Let s start with BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP   one of the biggest miners on the planet  Its chart provides a good example of where things stand with this stock bull market  Yesterday the price action broke out with a gap above the top rail of an almost 5 month triangle consolidation pattern  A backtest to the top rail would come in around the 43 50 area 

Now let s look at a long term weekly chart which shows some classic Chartology  We have discussed many times in the past  when you see a small consolidation pattern form just below an important trendline  in this case the neckline  and one above  that is usually a very bullish set up  something BHP is now showing 
Also keep in mind the size of that double H S bottom that took three years to build out  Big patterns lead to big moves  The minimum price objective of that double H S bottom is measured from the head straight up to the neckline   two  Add that distance to the breakout point to get your minimum price objective 

This monthly chart put the double H S bottom in perspective 

Copper is an important commodity as it can show the strength or weakness of the economy which is why it s called Dr  Copper  This weekly chart shows copper s big H S bottom with the breakout in the summer  The head formed a 7 point triangle reversal pattern which actually reversed the bear market 
Here is a case where we didn t see a backtest to the neckline when the breakout took place  The 30 week ema has done a good job of holding support so far during Copper s new bull market 

This 20 year monthly chart shows how the H S fits into the very big picture 

Below is the quarterly chart which shows some nice Chartology especially that 24 year flat top triangle s price objective 

I originally took two positions  one in July and one in August of this year for the Global X Copper Miners ETF  NYSE COPX   in anticipation of the eventual breakout above the neckline which hasn t happened just yet  It s close but no cigar 

This monthly chart shows a double H S bottom which many of the different commodities are showing  The 12 month simple moving average has done a good job of showing support during the new bull market 

Southern Copper  NYSE SCCO  is the strongest stock in this sector  The daily chart below shows it has just broken out from a rectangle consolidation pattern with a breakout gap 

If big patterns lead to big moves  then this weekly chart for SCCO says we should expect a very large impulse move higher as it s trading at a new all time high after breaking out from a six year triangle consolidation pattern 

The 25 YEAR monthly chart below shows the breakout taking place above the six year triangle consolidation pattern which is now making new all time highs  Note the blue bullish rising wedge that formed as a halfway pattern back in the early 2000 s 

Some of the steel stocks are starting to show their pent up bullishness as they are breaking out from major consolidation patterns  This monthly chart for Nucor  NYSE NUE  shows it broke out from its 9 year triangle consolidation pattern in 2016 and has been consolidating that breakout move by forming a second consolidation pattern just above the top rail which is the Red Bull flag 

This week  Schnitzer Steel  NASDAQ SCHN  is breaking out from a six year double H S bottom  You would have to go all the way back to 2011 to equal yesterday s high 

This weekly chart for Steel Dynamics  NASDAQ STLD  shows it broke out from a one year bull flag three weeks ago 

This 20 year monthly chart shows the entire history for STLD  This chart also has some nice Chartology on it  Note the 2000 H S bottom which launched STLD on its first bull market which produced several consolidation patterns along the way 
When that bull market ended in 2008 it took 9 years to build out the massive triangle consolidation pattern which is now launching STLD on its next bull market leg higher  If you stand back and look at this chart from a distance you can almost see the beginnings of a parabolic move taking place 

Before I run out of time I would like to show you one of the weakest areas in the commodities complex which is NatGas  Last week it finally broke down from a year and a half H S top  We now have a clean line in the sand  above the neckline is bullish and below is bearish 

Several weeks ago I tried to go long United States Natural Gas  NYSE UNG  as it was testing the bottom rail of an expanding triangle  After five touches of the bottom rail I thought it would hold one last time  but that wasn t the case 
After getting a decent pop off the last touch the price action reversed straight down and then gapped the bottom trendline where I exited the trade  Again UNG is bullish above the bottom rail and bearish below 

There are two patterns I m keeping a close eye on for WTI Crude Oil  This first pattern is a rising flag formation which has just completed its fourth reversal point at the top rail  I would view the rising flag as a halfway pattern if the price action can take out the top rail 

As we ve seen with some of the other commodity related stocks in this post  many have formed a double H S bottom reversal pattern  This 10 year daily chart for WTIC shows it too has a double H S pattern in play with a breakout above the neckline  The last time we looked at this chart I suggested it looked similarly inverse to that massive unbalanced H S top  only on a smaller time frame 

This 20 year monthly chart shows how the double H S bottom fits into the big picture 

This last chart is a 35 year quarterly chart which puts everything in perspective  Keep in mind the measured move for a H S pattern when you look at this chart ",2017-12-21,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodity-charts-are-breaking-out-200274931,200274931
102134,323649,STLD,U S  Steel Imports Up 18  YTD  Can Section 232 Bring Relief ,opinion,Imports of cheap steel continue to make inroads into the American market despite a raft of stringent trade actions and threats of further future measures  Steel imports have spiked roughly 18  year to date   according to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   an association of North American steel makers  Per AISI  based on preliminary U S  Census Bureau data  total U S  steel imports went up 17 5  year over year to roughly 35 6 million net tons through the first eleven months of 2017  Finished steel imports for the same period also increased 14 3  to around 27 6 million net tons  Year to date  finished steel import market share is estimated at 27   which is still higher than 26  clocked in full year 2016 Major finished steel products that have showed a significant year to date increase in imports on a year over year basis include oil country goods  up 223    line pipe  up 69    standard pipe  up 41    mechanical tubing  up 31    hot rolled bars  up 25    sheets   strip all other metallic coatings  up 21    cold rolled sheets  up 18   and sheets   strip hot dipped galvanized  up 15   The biggest offshore suppliers for the eleven month period were South Korea with 3 558 000 net tons  up 0 4  year over year   Turkey with 2 133 000 net tons  down 6    Japan with 1 422 000 net tons  down 16    Germany with 1 301 000 net tons  up 18   and Taiwan with 1 204 000 net tons  up 29   Imports Remain a Pressing ProblemThe continued surge of steel imports into the United States has hollowed out much of the domestic steel industry  U S  steel producers including Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and Commercial Metals Co    NYSE CMC   have raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year While the U S  Department of Commerce has made several ruling imposing duties on additional steel products since the start of 2017  imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers  overcapacity  These cheap imports are hurting the margins of American steel players Although positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States  imports from other countries remain at above historical levels According to AISI data  steel imports from China fell roughly 5  year over year through the first eleven months of 2017  However  imports from other countries such as Germany  Taiwan  Brazil and South Korea have spiked over this period All Eyes on Section 232U S  steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel  The Trump administration  in April 2017  ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security However  the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe  which was initially expected at the end of June 2017  The Commerce Department has until mid January 2018 to conclude the investigation  A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months Major U S  steel makers such as Nucor  U S  Steel and AK Steel remain optimistic about the Section 232 investigation  Nucor s Chief Financial Officer  Jim Frias  in the third quarter earnings call  said that he remains confident that President Trump will fulfil his commitments to the steel industry  Moreover  U S  Steel s CEO  David B  Burritt  during third quarter call  said that  We re still fairly optimistic that 232 will have a meaningful impact on the continued unfair trade practices that are harming domestic steel  Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  while U S  Steel is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  You can see  As the deadline for the probe approaches  a positive outcome will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad based trade actions  in the form of tariffs or quotas  against cheap imports  This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2

102135,323650,STLD,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Gerdau  GGB  Stock For Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Brazilian steelmaker  Gerdau S A    NYSE GGB   on Jan 15   Strengthening business opportunities from exposure in various end markets  growing steel demand and efforts to dispose non core assets and lower debt burden will prove advantageous for the company  However  headwinds related to rising costs  raw material supply and industry competition might restrict its growth momentum in the near term Gerdau currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  7 9 billion Market sentiments have been positive for Gerdau  with its American Depository Receipts yielding 30 5  return in the last three months  This gain is above 23 2  rally of the it belongs to  in the same period Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring GerdauDomestic   International Steel Demand  We believe that rise in demand for steel will create solid business opportunities for Gerdau  On the domestic front  any investment by the government in infrastructural development will work to the company s advantage Per the World Steel Association report  the global steel consumption is predicted to grow 1 6  in 2018  Excluding the demand anticipated from China  steel consumption in the world is predicted to grow 3  in 2018 Business Diversification a Boon  Gerdau is well poised to benefit from its diversified business structure that primarily includes crude steel  slabs  blooms  billets and flat steel  production and iron ore mining activities  Prime end markets served are construction  wind power  machinery and equipment  agricultural  highway  shipbuilding  and oil and gas Furthermore  international diversity has played a major role in Gerdau s profitability over time  The company operates in South America  North America  Europe and Asia  Notably  it derived nearly 32 4  of third quarter 2017 net revenues from its Brazilian operations while around 51 4  came from North and South American business operations We believe that such business diversification helps the company lower its risks by allocating investments in various financial instruments  industries and other categories Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth  Over time  Gerdau has been restructuring its business portfolio inorganically  aiming to strengthen its core and profitable businesses as well as lowering debt burdens  In this regard  the company divested its business unit   Premier Thermal Solutions  L L C    to Z Capital Partners  L L C  in the first half of 2017  It also signed an agreement to sell its 100  stake in the Chilean steel assets in October The company has continued its efforts in 2018 as well  On Jan 2  it agreed to sell some of its U S  rebar operations to Commercial Metals Company  This deal will enable the company to concentrate on its other important operations in North America and help in lowering its debt burden Factors Working Against GerdauPoor Valuation  On a P E TTM basis  Gerdau seems overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 27 4x and 10 7x  Also  the stock is trading above the average of last three months P E multiples of 20 7x  This makes us cautious on the stock Increasing Costs and Huge Debt Levels  Gerdau is suffering from the risks of escalated costs  In the third quarter of 2017  the company s cost of sales increased 11 1  year over year  Cost of sales  as a percentage of revenues  were 89 7  versus 88  in the year ago quarter  Rise in costs of sales led to year over year decline of 170 basis points in gross margin  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs can continue to hurt the company s margins in the quarters ahead Also  a high debt level can lead to heightened financial obligations  posing serious threats to the company s financial health  Exiting the third quarter  Gerdau s long term debt was approximately  14 1 billion Threats From Raw Materials Supply Disruption   Industry Competition  Major raw materials required for steel making are iron ore and coking coal  Disruption in the supply chain of these materials can jeopardize Gerdau s steel making operations  Also  raw material imports from intentional suppliers are subject to geopolitical risks and legal permits and duties In addition  Gerdau faces active competition from other players in the industry Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the same space worth considering are Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE    Schnitzer Steel Industries  Inc    NASDAQ SCHN   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD    All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Earnings estimates of Nucor and Steel Dynamics improved for 2018 while that for fiscal 2018 increased for Schnitzer Steel  in the last 60 days  Also  financial performance of these stocks has been impressive in the last four quarters  with each pulling off a positive earnings surprise Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-01-14,Zacks Investment

102168,323683,STLD,5 Steel Stocks That Thumped The Market In Q3,opinion,"The steel industry remains on a slow road to recovery  Notwithstanding a few lingering headwinds  the industry ended the third quarter on a positive note  racking up a market thumping return    The  gained around 7 5  in the September quarter  higher than the S P 500 s corresponding return of roughly 3 8  
While the overall demand fundamentals for steel remain healthy  the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity  The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity   the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability    Meanwhile  U S  steel mills remain impacted by low capacity utilization and a more pressing problem   renewed flood of cheap imports  A surge in steel imports have put downward pressure on U S  steel prices during the third quarter Steel Demand Poised for Steady RecoveryThe steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the United States and emerging markets this year  The World Steel Association  WSA    the international trade body for the iron and steel industry   expects global steel demand to expand 1 3  in 2017 following a 1  rise in 2016 
A cyclical upturn in steel demand is expected to be supported by an ongoing recovery in the developed economies along with an accelerating growth momentum in the emerging and developing economies The United States is expected to lead growth in the developed world thanks to strong fundamentals  measures related to fiscal stimuli and rising infrastructure spending  Steel demand in the United States is expected to rise 3  this year Demand in emerging and developing economies  barring China  is also expected to rise 4  this year 
Too Much Steel Poses a ConcernThe global steel industry continues bear the brunt of a surge in production in China   the world s biggest steel maker  According to WSA  global crude steel production went up 4 9  year over year during the first eight months of 2017 Output from China  which accounts for around half of the global production  climbed 5 6  year over year during the first eight months of the year  Production from the country also shot up 8 7  year over year to a monthly record of 74 6 Mt in August China s steel juggernaut continues to gather steam notwithstanding the global production glut  Steel mills in the country are ramping up production to take advantage of a spike in domestic steel prices that translates to higher profits for the industry Nevertheless  production cuts are expected later this year as Beijing pushes forward with supply side structural reform to streamline its burgeoning steel sector  China  earlier this year  announced plans to cut its steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons in 2017 in a bid to reduce overcapacity and control pollution Imports Still Haunting U S  MillsThe American market continues to be inundated with cheap steel imports from overseas producers despite a raft of punitive trade actions  According to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   total and finished steel imports for the first eight months of 2017 shot up 20 6  and 15 5  year over year  respectively  Year to date  finished steel import market share is estimated at 28   which is higher than 26  clocked in full year 2016 While positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States  imports from other countries remain at above historical levels U S  steel producers  Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   recently provided lower than expected earnings guidance for the third quarter saying that high levels of steel imports have put pressure on domestic steel prices during the quarter Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the third quarter  U S  hot rolled coil steel prices retreated in September and some analysts expect prices to weaken through the balance of the year  High import levels are likely to keep U S  steel prices in check Can Section 232 Bring Relief U S  steel makers are pinning their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel  Steel stocks got a shot in the arm in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel However  the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe  which was initially expected at the end of June 2017  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in an interview told Bloomberg last month that a decision on steel tariffs has been delayed until after the completion of the tax reform  The U S  Department of Commerce has until mid January 2018 to conclude the investigation A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months  While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due  a positive outcome from the probe will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad based trade actions against cheap imports  This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power 5 Market Beating

102169,323684,STLD,Is Steel Dynamics A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD    stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Steel Dynamics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Steel Dynamics  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Steel Dynamics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Steel Dynamics stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Steel Dynamics has a P S ratio of about 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  STLD is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Steel Dynamics currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Steel Dynamics a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio  a great indicator of value  comes in at 1 1  which is far better than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  STLD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Steel Dynamics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives STLD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher and two lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen three up and two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 6 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 4 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Steel Dynamics  Inc  Price and Consensus

apparent steel consumption to grow in the range of 2 5 3  for 2017 Steel market conditions have improved lately  driven by favorable developments on steel trade cases across the United States and Europe in the recent past  providing reprieve to steel producers including ArcelorMittal  The overall demand fundamentals for steel also remain healthy  ArcelorMittal also gained from higher steel prices in the third quarter  driven by strong pricing in Europe   the company s biggest market China s actions to reduce its excess steel supply are also expected to lend support to global steel prices moving ahead  Beijing has started implementing a four month reduction in output to streamline its burgeoning steel sector and control pollution during the winter months  China plans to cut its

automotive metals component company Gestamp have helped it to pare debt and strengthen its balance sheet  The company s net debt fell by  0 2 billion year over year in the third quarter ArcelorMittal

102172,323687,STLD,Steel Imports Still Haunt U S  Mills  All Eyes On Section 232,opinion,No reprieve for U S  steel makers yet as imports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions  in the form of heavy tariffs   Steel imports have shot up roughly 19  year to date   according to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute  AISI   an association of North American steel makers  Per AISI  based on preliminary U S  Census Bureau data  total U S  steel imports went up 19 4  year over year to roughly 32 9 million net tons through the first ten months of 2017  Finished steel imports for the same period also increased 15 4  to around 25 4 million net tons  Year to date  finished steel import market share is estimated at 28   which is higher than 26  clocked in full year 2016 Major finished steel products that have showed a significant year to date increase in imports on a year over year basis include oil country goods  up 231    line pipe  up 68    standard pipe  up 44    mechanical tubing  up 34    cold rolled  up 26    sheets   strip all other metallic coatings  up 25    hot rolled bars  up 21   and sheets   strip hot dipped galvanized  up 17   The biggest offshore suppliers for the ten month period were South Korea with 3 328 000 net tons  up 2  year over year   Turkey with 2 065 000 net tons  down 1    Japan with 1 307 000 net tons  down 17    Taiwan with 1 148 000 net tons  up 35   and Germany with 1 160 000 net tons  up 14   Imports Remain a Pressing ProblemNotwithstanding a raft of stringent trade actions and threats of further future measures  imports continue to flow into the U S  market due to foreign producers  overcapacity U S  steel producers including Nucor Corp    NYSE NUE    United States Steel Corp    NYSE X    AK Steel Holding Corp    NYSE AKS    Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   and Commercial Metals Co    NYSE CMC   have raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year  While positive rulings in trade cases  resulting in levy of heavy tariffs  against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States  imports from other countries remain at above historical levels According to AISI data  steel imports from China fell roughly 6  year over year through the first ten months of 2017  However  imports from other countries such as Russia  Taiwan  Germany  South Korea and Brazil have spiked over this period A surge in steel imports put pressure on U S  steel prices during the third quarter  Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the quarter Can Section 232 Bring Respite U S  steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel  The Trump administration  in April 2017  ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel However  the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe  which was initially expected at the end of June 2017  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in an interview told Bloomberg in September that a decision on steel tariffs has been delayed until after the completion of the tax reform The U S  Department of Commerce has until mid January 2018 to conclude the investigation  A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months Nevertheless  major U S  steel makers such as Nucor  U S  Steel and AK Steel remain optimistic about the Section 232 investigation  Nucor s Chief Financial Officer  Jim Frias  in the third quarter earnings call  said that he remains confident that President Trump will fulfil his commitments to the steel industry  Moreover  U S  Steel s CEO  David B  Burritt  during third quarter call  said that  We re still fairly optimistic that 232 will have a meaningful impact on the continued unfair trade practices that are harming domestic steel  Both Nucor and U S  Steel currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due  a positive outcome from the probe will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad based trade actions against cheap imports  This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies

Secretary Wilbur Ross to take immediate and broad action in the Section 232 investigation on steel imports and national security AK Steel also hailed the ruling and stated that  We are pleased with this decisive action by the Commerce Department against foreign producers and importers who have been and continue to attempt to circumvent our trade laws  U S  Steel  Nucor  AK Steel and Steel

Steel stocks  which were in the dumps for the most part of 2016  got a shot in the arm following Donald Trump s win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending under him  However  nothing concrete has materialized from the new administration yet on the infrastructure spending front The Trump administration s aggressive trade policies are also expected to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  Steel stocks also got a big lift in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962  The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel However  steel imports have surged since the initiation of the investigation with import market share reaching as high as 30  in June 2017  Per a Reuters report  the executives of U S  steel and steel related firms including Nucor  U S  Steel and ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    in a letter  recently urged President Trump to impose immediate restrictions on imports  The appeal comes after a delay in the release of the report on the Section 232 investigation by the U S  Department of Commerce  which was initially expected at the end of June 2017 While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due  it goes without saying that a positive outcome from the probe will provide a major thrust to American steel makers 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector  Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without

102205,323720,STLD,Here s Why Hurricane Harvey Lifted U S  Steel Stocks  X  AKS   ,opinion,"Hurricane Harvey s rainfall has wreaked havoc on Houston and the surrounding area  as floodwaters cover America s fourth largest city  The economy in the area will likely feel the effects of Harvey for years to come  but U S  steel companies might have already benefited from the storm s scope and devastation on southeastern Texas   
Houston floodwaters reached historic highs on Tuesday as rainfall surpassed 25 inches in many areas  with a least one location expected to receive over 50 inches  according to the  
President Donald Trump met with Texas Governor Greg Abbott in Corpus Christi  Texas as relief efforts ramped up  He and the first lady later traveled to Austin to tour an emergency operations center  according to an official White House statement 
New reports suggest that Hurricane Harvey could eventually make its way to Louisiana 
U S  Steel 
Oil production has been slowed  and even halted  off Texas  Gulf Coast due to Harvey  Now  another major commodity could be affected as well 
Houston receives roughly 30  to 35  of all U S  steel imports    The analyst noted that Harvey will therefore undoubtedly shake up the U S  steel industry  at least for the time being 
With steel imports likely curbed  if not stopped  in the Houston area  U S  steel companies find themselves in the position to benefit as demand for steel products did not stop when Harvey reached land 
Shares of United States Steel Corporation   NYSE X   jumped by over 2 50  on Tuesday  while Olympic Steel   NASDAQ ZEUS   climbed more than 1 50  
Nucor   NYSE NUE   and AK Steel Holding Corporation   NYSE AKS   both saw their stock prices rise by over 0 50   Shares of the SPDR S P Metals and Mining ETF   BE XME   gained 0 94  on Tuesday  Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD   stock closed up marginally 
Bottom Line 
U S  steel manufacturers have struggled in recent years as production and exports from China have risen  which means investors might seize on any possible sign of an uptick in U S  steel prices or production 
Aside from Harvey  U S  steel sector stocks might be ready to experience gains that don t coincide with a hurricane s devastation to a major U S  city 
China  despite recording  year over year jump in steel production  has seen its export rates drop dramatically  The nation exported 7 million metric tons of steel products last month  which marked a roughly 32  drop off from the year ago period  And Chinese net steel exports are down more than

construction  automotive and transportation  infrastructure  packaging and machinery  Expectations of increased infrastructure related spending in the United States have thrust steel company stocks to new highs  particularly following the November 2016 election There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short and long term  Here  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years The  Trump  CardAfter being in the dumps for a major part of 2016  steel stocks got a big boost following Donald Trump s win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending in a Trump administration  The president s call for the massive infrastructure spending is likely to have a beneficial effect on the steel industry given the expected increase in steel demand  as it is a key component in many infrastructure products  Trump s  big  spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies Construction Sector Remains a Pillar of StrengthThe homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy  along with the steel industry  The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel  accounting for almost half of the total consumption  Positives like an improving economy  healthy job growth  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to 12 month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  has been at 50 or better for major part of the last year indicating reliable  manageable and sustainable growth in architectural activity  The American Institute of Architects  AIA  anticipates spending in the non residential building sector to advance around 6  in 2017  Nucor Corporation  NYSE      and Commercial Metals Company  NYSE      are the leading steel suppliers to the non residential construction sector Over the long haul  as the urban population increases worldwide  the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure should see an uptrend as well  Emerging economies will continue to be major catalysts  owing to the huge amount of steel required for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  demand for steel is anticipated to remain strong in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel Corp   NYSE       ArcelorMittal  NYSE       Nucor Corporation and Steel Dynamics Inc   NASDAQ      would benefit from momentum in construction Steel to Ride on Demand from Automotive SectorThe automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  Besides giving a boost to the already rising U S  auto sales  cheap oil has backed a recovery in the European auto market  The rising sales trend is anticipated to persist on the back of falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  Moreover  the trend will be backed by improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers  The auto industry in Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also projected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and fly under the

102244,323759,STLD,Steel Stocks Hit Hard As DOC Ruling On Imports Disappoints,opinion,"Steel stocks took a tumble yesterday after the anti dumping duty determinations of the U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   on imports of oil country tubular goods   OCTG   from South Korea fell short of market expectations    The DOC recalculated anti dumping duties on imports of OCTG   used mainly by oil and gas industries in drilling and extraction operations   from South Korea after concluding that steel producers of that country have been unfairly dumping these products in the American market  causing harm to U S  businesses and workers  The commerce department raised duties on OCTG imports to a range of 2 76  to 24 92  from the earlier range of 4  to 6 5  determined in Oct 2016 The DOC said that it has exercised its authority for the first time under a provision of the recently enacted Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015   TPEA   to address distortions in the market and calculate dumping margins that more accurately account for the unfair pricing practices of overseas exporters  The commerce department  in the Korean import case  found that prices of the hot rolled coil used to make OCTG were distorted Per the DOC  imports of OCTG from South Korea were valued at an estimated  1 1 billion from Jul 2014 to Aug 2015  the administrative review period   representing 25  of all imports in that product category  American steelmakers have suffered heavily due to a torrent of OCTG imports  reflected by idling of mills and jobs losses   OCTG products  which play a pivotal role in building and maintaining the nation s energy infrastructure  are being illegally dumped at unfairly low prices in the American market which happens to be the most open and attractive market in the world and a hotspot for overseas steelmakers looking to capitalize on the country s booming shale oil and gas industry However  the DOC s move disappointed investors  sending stocks of major steel makers tumbling yesterday  The negative sentiment was partly evoked by the comments of Axiom Capital analyst  Gordon Johnson  who said that steel market pundits were expecting higher taxes on South Korean imports    The markets were reportedly expecting duties of 30  to 40   Last month  Peter Navarro  the director of the White House National Trade Council   NTC    also officially asked the DOC for at least 36  tariff on South Korean OCTG imports citing a  particular market situation  as the reason for the tariff adjustment  As such  the DOC s duty revision on these imports was considered inadequate by the markets and also raised doubts about White House s protectionist policies U S  Steel   NYSE X   was the worst hit yesterday with shares sagging around 10   Moreover  AK Steel s   NYSE AKS   shares tumbled roughly 7 5  while Nucor   NYSE NUE    Commercial Metals   NYSE CMC   and Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD   lost around 4 3   3 9  and 3 8   respectively  ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    which has significant operations in the U S   saw its shares tank roughly 6 8  While both U S  Steel and ArcelorMittal hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   AK Steel  Nucor  Steel Dynamics and Commercial Metals carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Steel stocks  which had been in the dumps for most part of 2016  got a big thrust following Donald Trump s election win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending in a Trump administration The steel industry is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of Trump s presidency  President Trump s call for  1 trillion of new infrastructure spending is likely to have a beneficial effect on the steel industry given the expected increase in steel consumption  Trump s  big  spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies Trump s aggressive trade policies are also expected to provide more protection to the U S  steel industry  U S  steel makers recently hailed the Trump Administration s executive actions geared at improving duty collection and further identifying and addressing root causes of unfair trade practices that have cost the U S  government billions of dollars in lost revenues  The executive order directs U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to chalk out a plan to lessen importer fraud and ensure adequate duty collection The steel industry has staged a recovery after being in a rut for long  The  industry has outperformed the broader market in the past year  The industry has gained around 20  in this period  higher than the S P 500 s corresponding return of around 12  

One of the major factors that have fueled a recovery in the steel sector is favorable developments on a number of trade cases that led to a decline in steel imports  Affirmative rulings in these cases have been be a positive catalyst for the U S  steel industry  Steel imports fell around 15  year over year in 2016 on the back of punitive trade actions that led to levy of tariffs on imports U S  regulators  in mid 2016  imposed a whopping final anti dumping duty rate of 209 97  on imports of corrosion resistant steel from China and also slapped a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on Chinese cold rolled steel  The DOC  in Sep 2016  also levied anti dumping duties on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries Moreover  the DOC  last month  issued positive final rulings in its anti dumping duty investigations on imports of carbon and alloy steel plates from eight countries  The commerce department found that these exporters are selling these products in the U S  at unfairly low prices and  therefore  are subject to anti dumping duties  The U S  International Trade Commission   ITC   is scheduled to make its final injury ruling on this case in May Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more ",2017-04-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/steel-stocks-hit-hard-as-doc-ruling-on-imports-disappoints-200182888,200182888
102245,323760,STLD,Is Steel Dynamics  STLD  Stock A Good Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Steel Dynamics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 09  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 17  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Steel Dynamics  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having falling over the past few months  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 52  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Steel Dynamics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 44  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Steel Dynamics stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Steel Dynamics has a P S ratio of about 1 02  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  As we can see in the chart below  this is only slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years STLD is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Steel Dynamics currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Steel Dynamics a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Steel Dynamics is just 0 95  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 89  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 58  which is better than the industry average of 9 09  Clearly  STLD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Steel Dynamics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives STLD a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 24 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Steel Dynamics  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSteel Dynamics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 21   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Basic Materials  Steel Producers industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share

102273,323788,STLD,5 Best PEG Stocks For A Lucrative Value Investing,opinion,Value investors with varied risk appetite are most unlikely to hit upon the price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio as an investment option among a number of other popular metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales or price book value  P B   This is because they often find this ratio complicated considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock But  in a year full of volatility  it is pointless to ponder on methods which don t consider a stock s future growth rate

multiples ensure success  What if there is a dearth of catalysts to propel growth even though the stock is at a discount right now  In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value

countervailing duty investigations on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries into the American market  Hot rolled steel is used in appliances  automotive products  heavy machinery  machine parts  commercial construction and transportation equipment The USITC found that imports of these products from Australia  Brazil  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands and the U K  as well as imports from Turkey that are sold in the U S  at less than fair value have caused material injury to the American steel industry  The regulator also affirmed most of the anti dumping and countervailing duties on imports of these products The ruling marks yet another victory for crisis hit U S  steel companies in their ongoing battle against unfairly traded  cheap imports The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   earlier determined that these products are being sold in the American market below their fair values and are subsidized by the governments of Brazil  South Korea and Turkey The nation s biggest steel producers  in Aug 2015  filed anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions with the DOC and the USITC against these seven countries  The petitions  which were filed

that significantly undercut the prices of U S  steel makers  These imports have also captured an increasing share of the U S  market  thereby hurting production  shipments  selling prices and margins of U S  steel makers As a result of the USITC s affirmative findings  the DOC will now issue countervailing duty orders on imports of hot rolled steel products from Brazil and South Korea and anti dumping duty orders on imports from Australia  Brazil  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands  Turkey and the U K The DOC  last month  slapped a final anti dumping duty rate of 29 37  on Australian exporters of these products  Brazil s Usiminas received the highest anti dumping duty rate of 34 28  while other Brazilian producers were levied final anti dumping duty of 33 14   Exporters in the U K  received anti dumping duty of 33 06   Final dumping duties for South Korea and Japan were imposed in the range of 3 89  9 49  and 4 99  to 7 51   respectively The commerce department also levied final countervailing duty rate in the band of 11 09  to 11 30  on Brazilian producers  In case of South Korea  POSCO and Daewoo International received countervailing duty of 57 04  while other producers were levied a duty of 3 89  However  the USITC concluded that imports of hot rolled steel products from Turkey  which the DOC had determined are subsidized by that country s government  are negligible   As a result  no countervailing duty order will be issued on imports of these products from Turkey The latest ruling comes after the USITC s affirmative final determination on the cold rolled steel case  announced earlier this month  The regulator found that imports of cold rolled steel flat products from Brazil  India  Korea  and the U K  have caused or threatened to cause material injury to the U S  steel industry U S  steel companies have been hammered by a tide of cheap imports over the past few years that largely contributed to a slump in steel prices  Low costs of production have allowed overseas producers to sell their products at cheaper rates  leading to an industry wide price decline Nevertheless  steel market conditions in the U S  have improved of late  driven by favorable developments on steel trade cases in the recent past  Steel prices recovered during the second quarter of 2016  helped by punitive trade actions that led to levy of tariffs on imports  U S  steel producers continue to actively press the U S  regulators to stop unfair trade practices and ensure a fairer and more competitive market for American steel makers and workers A

 What are you thinking building a steel mill right now   is a question Bula said he often fields from the media about a new steel mill in North America  He said his answer is always that BRS  investors  believe in what we re going to do and how we re going to do it  
Bula said the startup s finishing  annealing and galvanizing  operations will be online by the end of March  while the melt shop is scheduled to ramp up in November  He said the Big River s inbound scrap barge unloading dock on the Mississippi River is up and running 
EAF to Degasser
The mill s electric arc furnace will initially feed one caster  Scrap steel will be delivered to the melt shop to be melted by the EAF  The molten product will then go to a ladle metallurgy furnace  which will refine it  From there it will go to an RH degasser  The  flex mill  will be the first of its kind in North America that Bula said combines   the best of EAF and integrated mills  it s a combination of the two  We ve got a mill that s built to make grades unheard of at the mini mill level  
Speaking of those investors  Bula said the project is backed by the German government   which has supplied  very affordable  debt terms   and a variety of domestic investors that includes the Koch Minerals subsidiary of Koch Industries  the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Miami based Global Principal Partners 
The company plans to offer niche and specialty steels for electrical grid systems and other energy and construction applications  although he did add that BRS does not want to compete with Nucor Corp  NYSE NUE  or Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD  for construction projects  Bula said the products the Osceola mill will make will be non commodities that  we can compete with worldwide  
SmartMill Technology
He also said BRS signed a deal in November for SMS to provide full plant technology solutions to make the Osceola operation a  smartmill

102344,323859,STLD,U S  Slams China With Massive Final Duties On Steel Imports,opinion,The U S  Department of Commerce   DOC   made its final determinations on anti dumping investigations on imports of cold rolled steel from China and Japan yesterday and concluded that both countries are selling these products in the American market below their fair values and therefore  are subject to anti dumping duties The DOC  on Tuesday  imposed a hefty final anti dumping duty rate of 265 79  on imports of cold rolled steel from China  Chinese companies did not respond to the DOC s request for information and thus  got punished with big tariffs  Japanese exporters including JFE Steel Corporation and Nippon Steel   Sumitomo Metal Corporation received a final duty of 71 35  The commerce department  yesterday  also issued its final rulings on countervailing duty investigations on imports of cold rolled steel from China  The DOC levied a massive final countervailing duty rate of 256 44  on Chinese imports  higher than the preliminary duty rate of 227 29  imposed in Dec 2015 This will badly hit Chinese exporters such as Angang Group Hong Kong Co   Ltd   Benxi Iron and Steel  Group  Special Steel Co   Ltd  and Qian an Golden Point Trading Co   Ltd  who failed to respond to the DOC s requests for information  Beijing has reportedly criticized these punitive trade actions  calling them  excessive  Combined exports of cold rolled steel from China and Japan to the U S  market were valued at an estimated  410 9 million in 2015 Yesterday s final rulings mark another victory for crisis hit U S  steel companies in their ongoing battle against unfairly traded  cheap imports that continue to make inroads into the American market The biggest U S  steel producers   U S  Steel   NYSE X    AK Steel   NYSE AKS    Nucor   NYSE NUE    Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD   and ArcelorMittal USA  a part of ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT      filed anti dumping petitions in Jul 2015 with the U S  International Trade Commission   USITC   and the DOC against eight countries  Brazil  China  India  Japan  the Netherlands  Russia  South Korea and the UK  alleged for illegally dumping cold rolled steel that is used to make automotive products and appliances  among others The petitions charge that an influx of subsidized imports of cold rolled steel from these foreign producers is causing significant injury to the country s steel industry  These imports have captured an increasing share of the U S  market  thereby hurting production  shipments  selling prices and margins of U S  steel makers The USITC terminated the investigation on imports from the Netherlands in Sep 2015 after concluding that the quantity of imports of cold rolled steel from the country was negligible and hence did not cause or threatened to cause injury to the U S  industry The DOC will now instruct U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to start requiring cash deposits based on the final anti dumping duty rates for cold rolled steel imports from China and Japan  The commerce department will also order the CBP to require cash deposits  based on the final countervailing duty rate  should the USITC issues an affirmative injury determination The commerce department is now expected to issue its final rulings on imports of cold rolled steel from Brazil  India  Korea  Russia  and the UK on July 13  The USITC is also expected to make its final injury ruling on China and Japan on June 30  U S  steel companies have been hammered by a tide of cheap imports over the past few years that largely contributed to a slump in steel prices  These producers are struggling to cope with lower steel prices as a result of the combined impact of imports and overcapacity in the industry  Low costs of production have enabled foreign producers  especially China  to sell their products at cheaper rates  leading to an industry wide price decline China has been repeatedly slammed by the U S  and the European Union for dumping its excess steel capacity  backed by unfair government subsidies  in the overseas markets at low prices amid weakening domestic demand China  which accounts for around half of global steel output  continues to pose a threat to the global steel industry  The Chinese steel industry continues to reel under massive excess capacity and worsening gap between supply and demand with barely any signs of recovery China s total steel exports clocked 112 4 million tons in 2015  per data released by the General Administration of Customs   topping 100 million tons for the first time  Notwithstanding a recovery in domestic steel prices  the country s steel exports jumped 7 6  year over year in the first four months of 2016  per customs data   signalling continued demand weakness at home In April  U S  Steel lodged a complaint with the USITC  asking the regulator to start an investigation against biggest Chinese steel makers and their distributors  The company has accused these producers and distributors for unfair competition and is seeking the exclusion of all unfairly traded Chinese steel products from the U S  market Nevertheless  steel market conditions in the U S  have somewhat improved of late  driven by favorable rulings  that led to levy of tariffs on imports  on steel trade cases in the recent past The DOC  in Dec 2015  slapped preliminary anti dumping duties on imports of corrosion resistant steel from China  India  Italy and South Korea including a staggering anti dumping duty rate of 255 80  on imports of these products from China  Final determinations on this trade case is expected in Jul 2016 The DOC  in Mar 2016  also imposed preliminary anti dumping duties on imports of certain hot rolled steel flat products by seven countries  A final ruling by the DOC on this case is expected in August Positive final rulings in these trade cases will ensure a fairer and more competitive market for U S  steel makers and workers and also help in restoring fair trade conditions for steel products made in America Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days

corrosion resistant steel and concluded that China  India  Italy  South Korea and Taiwan are selling these products in the U S  market below their fair values and therefore  are subject to anti

zinc and aluminum to prevent corrosion  thus extending the service life of the products made from the steel  It is used in making automobiles  trucks  appliances  and industrial and agricultural equipment   The biggest U S  steel producers  in Jun 2015  filed anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions with the U S  International Trade Commission  USITC  and the DOC against five countries

prices that significantly undercut the prices of U S  steel makers The DOC  on Wednesday  imposed a whopping final anti dumping duty rate of 209 97  on imports of these products from China  This will hurt Chinese exporters including Yieh Phui  China  Technomaterial Co  Ltd and Jiangyin Zongcheng Steel Co  Ltd  India  Taiwan  South Korea  and Italy received anti dumping duties in the range of 3 05

countervailing duty rate in the band of 39 05  to 241 07  on Chinese imports  With respect to Taiwan  the DOC s final countervailing duty determinations were negative and hence  no countervailing duties were imposed on imports from that country The DOC will now instruct U S  Customs and Border Protection   CBP   to start requiring cash deposits based on the final anti dumping duty rates  The commerce department will also order the CBP to require cash deposits  based on the final countervailing duty rate  in applicable cases should the USITC issues an affirmative injury determination  The

Steelmakers including ArcelorMittal  US Steel  NYSE X   Nucor  NYSE NUE   AK Steel  NYSE AKS  and Steel Dynamics  NASDAQ STLD  continue to contend with challenging market fundamentals and weak pricing  Overcapacity in the industry and a flood of cheap imports have kept steel prices under pressure 
Factoring in the weaker than expected performance in emerging and developing economies in first half 2014  the WSA has truncated its short term outlook for global steel usage  which is now expected to rise 2  in 2014  down from 3 1  expected earlier   World steel demand has been forecast to grow at the same pace next year  A slowdown in China  which has been a major drag on the steel industry lately  was mainly instrumental in the downward revision of the outlook   The steel industry faces challenges in form of an expected deceleration in steel usage in China due to weaker infrastructure investment growth and a slowdown in the country s property market that account for a significant part of its steel consumption  After seeing high demand levels over the past few years  Steel  TW 2013  usage in China is expected to cool down and rise just 1  this year and further slip to a 0 8  gain in 2015  Moreover  reports of weakness in Germany have signaled a slowdown in the much awaited recovery in the Eurozone economy  Nevertheless  a gradually convalescing economy  strong momentum in the automotive market and a rebound in commercial construction and housing markets are expected to provide a much needed thrust to the U S  steel industry  Demand in India is also expected to pick up speed  driven by structural reforms from the new government ",2014-11-30,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-steel-output-stalls-in-october-as-china,-u.s.-slips-234072",234072
102372,323887,STLD,Steel Industry  Negative Outlook For 2015,opinion,"While the automobile and construction sectors boosted steel demand in the U S  in 2014  surging steel imports and falling oil prices played major spoilsports for the industry  Moreover  the steel industry s perennial concern    overcapacity    added fuel to the fire 
Per the World Steel Association  global steel production increased a meager 1 2  to 1 662 metric tons  Mt  in 2014  Among the top steel producing countries  China was the clear winner  churning out 50  of the total at 823 Mt  an increase of 0 9  year over year  yoy   Also sharing the podium were Japan at 111 Mt  up 0 1  yoy  and United States  with production at 88 Mt  a 1 7  rise  Economic slowdown in China  the largest steel consumer and accounting for almost half of global steel consumption  has dealt a massive blow to the global steel industry  In stark contrast to the high demand levels in China in the past years  steel usage in is expected to rise only 0 8  in 2015 as per the World Steel Association s short range outlook published in October last year  In Central and South America  falling commodity prices and delayed structural reforms will affect steel demand  In Brazil  high inflation  overvalued currency  soaring labor costs and infrastructure bottlenecks are curtailing investment activities  which in turn will negatively impact steel demand  In the Commonwealth of Independent States  CIS  also known as the Russian Commonwealth   geopolitical tensions will constrain demand  Apart from this  the European economy appears to be on a long road to recovery  as evident from the slight growth of 0 2  in Eurozone GDP in the third quarter of 2014  Germany and France  two of its largest economies  have avoided recession by a whisker 
Also  the eurozone s current growth pace is only about half the potential growth rate and the GDP is still more than 2  below its level at the start of 2008  These adverse economic factors will affect companies like ArcelorMittal  NYSE MT   which generates almost half of its revenues from the region and United States Steel  NYSE X  that has significant operations in Europe  Steel imports surged to alarmingly high levels in the back half of the year  which is a negative for steel plays like Steel Dynamics   NASDAQ STLD   ArcelorMittal  AK Steel Holding  NYSE AKS  and United States Steel  NYSE X   And to top it all  the slump in oil prices had a negative impact on steel prices given the industry s 10  exposure to the energy sector 
Steel demand of energy companies is expected to go down as exploration companies reduce their capital expenditure budgets  U S Steel  which is the biggest supplier to energy companies in North America  along with AK Steel and ArcelorMittal would be impacted by the slowdown  Iron  one of the primary raw materials for steelmakers  lost 50  of its value in 2014  Given that steel companies enter into long term supply agreements with their suppliers  they could not take full advantage of lower iron ore prices 
As these supply agreements are renegotiated this year  they are likely to be executed at lower prices and help in reducing unit production costs of the steel players  While companies like ArcelorMittal and U S  Steel that produce most of their iron ore requirements through captive mines are unlikely to benefit from this  companies like AK Steel will have a competitive edge as they are less vertically integrated  However  an improving demand scenario in the United States gives a ray of hope  The housing market is expected to continue its good run in 2015 as the Fed will maintain its patient stance on interest rates  The automobile sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  will also benefit immensely from the lower gasoline prices and strong job market  Looking at the steel companies in our coverage  Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   which is a key supplier for real estate companies  as well as ArcelorMittal and AK Steel generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies  Much hope is pinned on India  which is expected to act as the next growth driver riding on the back of its construction and manufacturing sectors  rapid urbanization and structural reforms from the new government

102375,323890,STLD,Will These Negatives Spoil Steel Stocks ,opinion,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the U S and emerging markets like India  However  concerns linger around the steel industry stock space in the near term  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Slowdown in China Demand in China  that alone accounts for almost half of the total steel consumption  has slowed down due to the country s tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment  China s economic growth slowed further to 7  in the first quarter of 2015 from 7 4  in the fourth quarter of 2014  It is the slowest pace witnessed in the last 6 years 
Monthly retail sales  industrial output and fixed asset investment data released with the GDP figures all missed analyst expectations  Industrial output grew at its weakest since the global financial crisis in 2008  Further concerns were raised by the real estate sector  where investment increased at an annual rate of 8 5   the weakest rate since 2009  Excess Capacity  Perennial Problem The biggest obstacle in the path of persistent growth and profitability of the steel industry is its excess capacity  The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel making capacity further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth 
To solve this problem  steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry s profit margin to reach a sustainable level  and to raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80  levels  The industry remains highly fragmented compared to other global businesses and the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace Falling Oil Prices The energy sector  which has been buoyant due to shale discoveries and rising production of crude oil  accounts for 10  of steel consumption in the US  Steel is necessary to make rigs and transport oil  Steel demand from the energy sector is being affected as exploration companies have reduced their capital expenditure budgets in the wake of lower oil prices  The steel products that the energy industry uses are also known as oil country tubular goods  or OCTG   United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X  is the biggest supplier of these goods in North America and is thus bearing the brunt of the the slump in oil prices Rise in Cheap Imports in the U S  Despite a slowdown in steel demand in the country  production is still increasing in China  Hence  the surplus enters the international markets  The subsidies that the Chinese government provides to its steel industry as well as the devalued Chinese currency  which makes steel imports cheaper from the country  are partly responsible for this situation  In the first quarter  U S  steel imports surged 20  year over year to 10 6 million metric tons  These cheap imports hurt the margins of U S  steel players like U S  Steel  Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD   Arcelormittal  NYSE MT   AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  and Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE   U S  Steel  in particular  swung to a loss in the first quarter of 2015  hurt by a barrage of cheap steel imports  The company  once the country s first billion dollar corporation  faced a challenging operating environment as high levels of imports led to lower volumes and lower steel pricing in the quarter  The company also faced headwinds from the drop in oil prices as mentioned earlier Low Crude Steel Capacity Utilization The crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80  in 2014 and continued to stay so in 2015  The average capacity utilization in 2015 so far is at 72 5   Even though  steel production is on the rise  the capacity utilization rate has gone downhill  Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry and steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates  To remain competitive  some major steel companies have idled their steel plants in a bid to rationalize operations 
Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto Industry Poses Threat Currently  steel is the major raw material for the auto industry  the second largest steel consumer  Major automakers like Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co   General Motors Company  NYSE GM  and others in specific and the industry as a whole is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties 
The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025  Hence  in order to remain competitive  the steel companies will have to come up with improved and lighter varieties of steel Falling Iron Ore Prices Iron ore prices continues to plummet due to continued slowdown in China  coupled with a surge in supply  In the next few years  a wave of new supply of iron ore is slated to hit the market as the major producers are going gung ho with their expansion plans to augment production capacity  Brazil and India will also step up their exports  A combination of weak demand and oversupply will continue to pressure iron prices in the near term  Companies like ArcelorMittal and U S  Steel Corp  fulfill their raw material requirements through their captive iron ore mines  While the steel operations of these two companies will reap the benefits of falling iron prices  the profitability of their iron mining operations are likely to be affected by the same Bottom Line As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about the steel industry  But what about investing in the space right now  are there opportunities for short term investors  Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now ",2015-06-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-these-negatives-spoil-steel-stocks-254178,254178
102376,323891,STLD,Should Steel Stocks Be A Part Of Your Portfolio ,opinion,In the past few years demand for steel has been on the rise  owing to the rapid growth witnessed in developing economies that helped to counter the slowdown in developed nations  Asia  particularly China  remained the principal growth driver  However  the current scenario is slightly alarming with the conventional growth engine  China  adding an element of uncertainty to the outlook  Nevertheless  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry  both in the short and the long term  Below  we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years Rebound in Construction The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel today  accounting for almost half of the steel consumption  The home construction market recovered at a steady pace in 2014  largely on the back of overall economic growth  improving job numbers  growing consumer confidence  moderating home prices  stabilizing mortgage rates and a low level of housing inventory  This momentum is likely to continue in 2015  The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to twelve month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  remained over 50 for most of the recent months  Any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings  Renewal of long stalled construction projects and much awaited access to credit from lending institutions along with an improving overall economy have helped revitalize the commercial real estate sector in recent months  Moreover  requirement for emerging projects  such as education facilities and government buildings  is creating demand in the sector  The American Institute of Architects   AIA  is projecting that spending in the non residential building sector will rise 7 7  and commercial industrial will rise 11 8  in 2015  In the long term  as urban population increases worldwide  so will the need for steel to build skyscrapers and public transport infrastructure  Emerging economies will continue to be major demand drivers due to the huge amount of steel required for urbanization and industrialization  Hence  the demand for steel is expected to remain strong in the years to come  Companies like United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   Arcelormittal  NYSE MT   Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  and Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD  will benefit from the momentum in construction  Automotive Sector at Full Throttle The automotive sector  which is the second largest steel consumer  is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials  The recent slump in global oil and gas prices has been a blessing for automakers   U S  light vehicle sales increased for the fifth consecutive year in 2014  improving on the 6 year high achieved in 2013  In fact  for the first time since the recession in 2008  U S  auto sales surpassed 16 million units in 2014  The rising trend in sales is expected to continue in 2015  driven by falling fuel prices  low interest rates  enhanced job security  rising wages and household wealth  improving consumer confidence  residual pent up demand  attractive deals and vehicle launches  Moreover  the high average age of light vehicles on U S  roads is resulting in high replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  Auto industry in the Asian countries  particularly China and India  are also expected to flourish over the next five to seven years  China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold  With the automakers riding the wave of strong demand  steel is expected to benefit from the same in the years to come  ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies Investment in Oil and Gas In spite of the current drop in oil prices  there will be significant capital investment in the oil and gas sector over the next few years  This should support demand for premium oil country tubular goods  OCTGs   Moreover  substantial investment is also expected in other parts of the oil and gas value chain  viz  distribution pipelines and refineries  Growth in the Indian Steel Sector India is currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world  The Indian steel industry is expected to register exponential growth in the future  riding on increasing urbanization  and projected growth of infrastructure  automobile and real estate sectors  India s outlook has improved following the election of the new government which is promising pro business reforms  The government of India has set a target to triple Indian steel production to 300 million tons by 2025 Imposing Anti Dumping Duty To capitalize on the growing U S  energy infrastructure demand  foreign manufacturers had flooded the U S market with cheap imports  Trade cases were filed by the U S  companies  that were affected by surge in imports  against their foreign counterparts  The U S  International Trade Commission  USITC  ruled that OCTG  oil country tubular good  imports from South Korea  India  Taiwan  Turkey  Ukraine and Vietnam will be subject to duties  South Korea was a major player considering that OCTG exports to the United States from the country were worth  818 million in 2013  more than the combined imports from the other countries  The imposition of duty was welcome news for the steel players  This will boost the margins of steel companies which were forced to cut down production and idle plants  threatened by cheap steel imports Consolidation Mergers and acquisitions  M A  have always been an important growth strategy for the steel industry  leading to additional steel capacity  production efficiency and economies of scale  However  consolidation was minimal during the 2012 2013 period  given economic uncertainties as the companies were primarily focused on conserving cash  shedding unproductive operations  cutting costs and restructuring  In 2014  some renewed activity in the space infused optimism  In Sep 2014  AK Steel acquired Dearborn  MI based Severstal North America s integrated steelmaking assets for  700 million in cash  The facilities complement AK Steel s existing carbon steel operations  while giving it access to highly modernized and upgraded steelmaking equipment and facilities  The acquisition will also enable AK Steel to increase its profitability and operational efficiency  while allowing it to attain cost synergies by saving purchase  transportation and overhead costs Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD  completed the acquisition of Severstal Columbus  LLC for  1 625 billion in cash  also in the month of September last year  This acquisition will expand the company s annual steel shipping capacity to 11 million tons  representing a roughly 40  rise  Steel Dynamics will get an exposure to the high growth oil country tubular goods and automotive markets with the addition of Columbus  Further  Columbus brings forth geographic diversification and growth opportunities for Steel Dynamics  Also  in Sep 2014  Nucor agreed to buy Gallatin Steel Company from global steel giant ArcelorMittal and Brazilian steel maker Gerdau SA  NYSE GGB  for roughly  770 million in cash  The acquisition of Gallatin Steel is in sync with Nucor s strategy of profitable growth  The buyout is expected to reinforce the company s foothold in the key Midwest region and allow it to better serve its flat rolled customers in the growing pipe and tube segment  The addition of Gallatin Steel is expected to enhance Nucor s total flat rolled product annual capacity by 16  to around 13 million tons Bottom Line As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the steel industry for the long haul  But what about investing in the space right now  Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this sector from now onwards

102406,323921,STLD,What Severstal s Sales To AK Steel  Steel Dynamics Mean For US Steel,opinion,"Oh no  Because of the continuing disasters in Ukraine   lately the tragic shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17   tough US sanctions on Russia are directly causing Russian companies  such as steel producers like OAO Severstal   ao  MCX CHMF   to get out of the US for fear of losing access to Western capital markets  Right 
Not so much 
Although the backdrop of the MH17 tragedy and strained US Russia relations doesn t help  Severstal s impending sale of its North American steel plants in Dearborn  Mich   and Columbus  Miss   to AK Steel  NYSE AKS  and Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD   respectively  has been in the works since 2013  Despite Severstal s North American operations having been touted as some of the most efficient in the world  they still can t compete with a stagnant global  especially US  steel market and low steel prices 
Hence  Severstal  like many other producers  is looking to shed costs 
But what does it mean for the US steel industry  And for steel buyers 

First  What s Happening in the Steel Markets
The answer is nothing much  which isn t a great thing for producers and sales  According to the American Iron   Steel Institute  AISI   as of July 14  21 percent of the US steel industry s capacity was unused  as cited in a  article  As MetalMiner has covered extensively  US steelmakers have also fought a succession of legal battles to curb cheap imports   Severstal is among several Russian HRC producers that could get slapped with huge anti dumping duties  
Although AISI reported this month that shipments by US steel mills were 40 5 million tons in the first five months to April this year  up 2 2 percent from 39 6 million tons in the equivalent period of 2013  according to the FT  steel prices are not shooting up just yet 
MetalMiner s lead forecasting analyst Raul de Frutos is taking a wait and see approach to his steel market outlook   A recent recovery in China  thanks to support from some stimulus measures taken by its government  might give support to steel prices this year   Raul wrote earlier this month in our Monthly MMI Report   It is hard to tell if this stimulus will be able to make the Chinese economy reach its pre crisis level  Since we don t see any particular event that could boost demand for steel this year  we would expect our steel index to move together with the base metal sector  
What AK Steel  Steel Dynamics Get in the Deal
From a production perspective  AK Steel gets to operate Severstal s Dearborn  Mich  rebuilt blast furnace  among the most efficient and productive blast furnaces in the world for its size  and which also began operating a new pickle line tandem cold mill and a new hot dip galvanizing line in 2011  according to a press release  The acquisition will eventually increase AK s total shipments to more than 7 5 million tons 
For its part  Steel Dynamics gets one of the only North American flat roll mills to have 76 inch wide hot roll  74 inch wide cold roll  and 72 inch wide galvanized sheet capabilities  SDI s shipping capacity would eventually be 11 million tons 
What This Means for Steel Buyers
In a quick electronic chat with MetalMiner Editor At Large Stuart Burns across the pond  we determined that the takeaway here is less than ideal for the buy side of the US steel market as a whole  If  as seems likely  the plants  sale to AK Steel and Steel Dynamics is finalized  Stuart said  then it s probably not a great development   we may see less competition  more market oligopoly for the big boys  and higher prices for consumers  these scenarios would certainly be worse if even bigger producers  e g  ArcelorMittal or US Steel Corp   were to buy up these plants  
With Severstal  Stuart noted  we re seeing the  classic case of buying at the top of the market  just like Rio Tinto buying Alcan prior to the crash  Paid too much  put themselves heavily into debt and got left with loss making plants in the downturn

102412,323927,STLD,Sudden Bearish Drop In Steel Stocks,opinion,"It was September 17  2014  Not even a month ago  U S  Steel  NYSE X  enjoyed another gap up just 6 weeks since it printed a 19 4  post  gain  The headline drivers for the latest pop were 
A price target  from Goldman Sachs from  47 to  58 
X s  of strategic business actions  and
An increase in earnings guidance  albeit not quantified 
Since then  it has been all downhill and fast 

A swift and abrupt change in sentiment

In the last 18 months U S  Steel has almost traversed its entire post recession range  Note that this is peanuts compared to the remarkable recovery during the last bull market 
AS of yesterday  U S  Steel has sold off straight down 11 of the last 12 trading days  It filled the September 17th gap up in 7 trading days  It has now even sliced right through potential support at the 50 day moving average  DMA   This kind of reversal and breakdown is very bearish for the stock  Yet  I cannot find any definitive news to explain the sudden reversal  From a technical perspective  a complete reversal of the post earnings gains makes sense as it would neatly coincide with a retest of the still rising 200DMA 
U S  Steel is not alone  This is NOT a company specific reversal  Several steel stocks are exhibiting similar trading patterns  a rapid rise to a September 17th peak for the year followed by an almost immediate plunge 
Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  is retesting its 200DMA and is back to negative for the year 

Nucor lost its hold on a six year high and is now trading DOWN year to date
Steel Dynamics Inc   NASDAQ STLD  has broken through 50DMA support and like U S  Steel looks ready for an eventual 200DMA retest 

Steel Dynamics is back to the top of its 2 day post earnings reaction from July
I started this year wanting to return to tracking the steel industry more closely  I never did and last month felt like I missed out on a major opportunity  There is clearly another major opportunity  but now I am a lot less sure it is to the upside in the near term

102444,323959,STLD,U S  Natural Gas  It s All About The Infrastructure,opinion,With the shale reserves often found in areas without existing pipeline infrastructure  the railways have stepped in to the breach and profited as a result   For example  one clear beneficiary already has been the rail freight business with the likes of Canadian Pacific and Union Pacific gaining from a significant increase in volumes of crude oil and petroleum products  But five or 10 years from now  once infrastructure is built along major trunk routes  liquefied natural gas could significantly reduce the cost of road haulage  driving sales for firms like Cummins  which is pouring considerable resources into natural gas powered engine development and manufacturing capability  Likewise  steel firms could benefit enormously from lower energy costs  but some could benefit more than others  Refinery ProximityThe Barnet and Eagle Ford shale gas deposits are relatively close to refining centers  making their product readily accessible to the Gulf Coast and Texas petrochemicals industry  but many deposits are not so conveniently positioned  Bakken  straddling the Canadian border  and Mancos Niobrara  straddling the Utah Colorado border  are better sited for serving local needs such as they are   Could we see the likes of Nucor  Gerdau and Steel Dynamics expand operations in such locations on the basis of long term energy deals   Producers with many production facilities in diverse locations may benefit more than those concentrated in just one or two sites  unless they are lucky enough to be close to a deposit  The size of the Marcellus and New Albany resources will certainly have an impact on energy consuming industries in the northern Midwest and Northeast  will this reverse the trend of recent decades to site new facilities in previously rapidly expanding southern states   Plants like US Steel s massive Gary Works probably already have a new lease on life accessing energy at well below the international market level  but will that mean the likes of US Steel will favor future investment in plants like this   InfrastructureEnergy can be transported  whether it is in the form of natural gas  or oil  or converted into electricity  but infrastructure is costly and is either lacking or needs upgrading  as we have seen  with renewable technologies such as wind farms  Industries that are sited close to abundant natural gas reserves or are willing to locate adjacent to them will reap the greatest rewards   Picking the winners and losers from such a fast changing situation will be challenging  but the effects are already rippling out through the metals industry and will become more profound in the years ahead   One effect that will be welcome by all is that the slow manufacturing decline relative to overall GDP    seen in the graph in the first part of this article    is already beginning to turn  and the process has only just begun  by Stuart Burns,2013-04-30,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-natural-gas:-it's-all-about-the-infrastructure-165145,165145
