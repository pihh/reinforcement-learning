137279,358794,TMO,Daimler drives European shares lower as data stirs more fears,news,"By Sruthi Shankar
 Reuters    European shares dipped on Thursday  as a warning from German carmaker  Daimler  and lackluster economic data from Asia and Europe countered a handful of positive corporate updates 
By 0929 GMT  the pan European STOXX 600 index  STOXX  slipped 0 1   with German shares  GDAXI  dropping 0 2  
Data showed Germany s economy narrowly avoided slipping into recession in the third quarter but growth remained close to zero and that in central and eastern European economies that rely heavily on its demand are crumbling 
Daimler  DE DAIGn  dropped about 3  after the carmaker said tougher emissions rules would hit earnings in 2020 and 2021  forcing it to seek more than 1 billion euros on staffing costs at Mercedes Benz by the end of 2022 
 Clearly  either side of zero is not great  It doesn t indicate a strong German economy   said Chris Bailey  European strategist at Raymond James 
 The thoughts now are to what extent will you see the German authorities stimulate their economy  
Daimler s warning spurred a 1  fall in the European auto index  SXAP   leading declines among the major sectors 
Other numbers on Thursday showed China s factory output growth slowed significantly more than expected in October and Japan s economy ground to a near standstill 
The gloom took European shares further from a four year peak hit last week driven by optimism about the chances of a  phase one  trade deal between the United States and China and some better than expected earnings 
Shares in Germany s biggest electricity producer  DE RWEG  also fell 2 5  and science and technology company Merck KGaA  DE MRCG  dropped 1 5  despite raising their 2019 forecasts 
The STOXX 600 s biggest gainer was genetic testing company  Qiagen   DE QIA   up 13 1  after Bloomberg reported scientific instruments maker Thermo Fisher Scientific  N TMO  had approached company about a potential deal

137280,358795,TMO,Here s Why Thermo Fisher Scientific Jumped 45 1  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific  NYSE TMO  lept over 45  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  The scientific research products monopoly didn t do anything impressive  but its massive market position means it didn t have to  The growth stock easily bested the roughly 29  gain of the S P 500 in 2019 
In the first nine months of 2019  the business reported revenue of  18 7 billion  marking a 4 8  increase from the year ago period  Operating income barely budged  although that was entirely due to a  442 million restructuring charge  Investors are nonetheless content with the company s moves to position itself for future growth 

So what
Thermo Fisher Scientific continued to make investments to keep up with the fast pace of innovation in biological technologies  In May  the business completed the  1 7 billion acquisition of viral vector manufacturing leader Brammer Bio  The move allows Thermo Fisher Scientific to play in the quickly growing area of clinical and commercial gene therapy manufacturing 
The scientific research products leader also acquired a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Cork  Ireland for approximately  117 million  which will bolster its production of active pharmaceutical ingredients  
And in a quiet move that may have been overlooked by investors  Thermo Fisher Scientific announced plans to invest  50 million to expand its production footprint of single use bioreactors and other equipment  The products are increasingly important in both pharmaceutical and industrial biotech applications but have been in short supply in recent years  The business has responded by investing heavily in its TruBio brand of automated bioprocess systems  
Now what
Thermo Fisher Scientific wrapped up 2019 by announcing a  2 5 billion share repurchase program  which replaced the prior buyback plan that had  500 million remaining  Considering the massive financial resources and market reach of the company s business  investors may be expecting the momentum to continue for the foreseeable future ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgkc1,2057237
137281,358796,TMO,What s Behind Thermo Fisher Scientific s Q4 Revenue and Earnings Beats,news,"Thermo Fisher Scientific  NYSE TMO  shares skyrocketed 45  in 2019  The company didn t deliver awe inspiring revenue and earnings growth  However  investors liked the steps that Thermo Fisher took to pave the way for future growth 
But were investors as thrilled after Thermo Fisher announced its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Thursday  Here are the highlights from the company s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Thermo Fisher Scientific reported fourth quarter revenue of  6 83 billion  This reflected a 5  increase from the prior year period revenue total of  6 51 billion  It also topped the consensus Wall Street Q4 revenue estimate of  6 78 billion 
The company announced net income of  1 billion  or  2 49 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This result was a significant improvement over the GAAP net income of  898 million  or  2 22 per share  posted in the same period in 2018  
Thermo Fisher s adjusted net income in the fourth quarter was  3 55 per share  compared to adjusted earnings of  3 25 per share in the prior year period  It also narrowly beat the analysts  average adjusted earnings estimate of  3 54 per share 
Behind the numbers
The company s biggest moneymaker  its laboratory products and services segment  delivered revenue of  2 83 billion in Q4  up 9  year over year  The segment s adjusted operating margin also increased to 13 8  from 13 1  in the prior year period 
Thermo Fisher s life sciences solutions segment s Q4 revenue rose 8  year over year to  1 84 billion  Its adjusted operating margin increased by 0 7  from the same quarter in 2018 to 37 5  
Analytical instruments segment revenue in the fourth quarter slipped a little  from  1 57 billion in the year ago period to  1 52 billion in the latest quarter  Its adjusted operating margin also declined to 26  from 26 6  
Thermo Fisher s smallest unit  its specialty diagnostics segment  delivered Q4 revenue of  0 94 billion  down slightly from the  0 95 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the sale of the company s anatomical pathology business  The segment s adjusted operating margin also slid to 23 7  from 24 5   
Looking ahead
The company stated in its Q4 conference call that it expects full year 2020 revenue between  26 61 billion and  27 01 billion    up 4  to 6  year over year  Thermo Fisher looks for adjusted earnings per share of  13 49 to  13 67  an increase of 9  to 11  over its 2019 result  
However  some healthcare stocks  especially those with exposure to the Chinese market like Thermo Fisher  could face headwinds this year from the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China and has spread to the U S  and other countries  Thermo Fisher said that its full year 2020 guidance doesn t include any potential impact from the viral epidemic ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp2p6,2072141

Q4 and year end call  I m pleased to report that we finished the year strong and exceeded our goals for 2019  From a financial perspective  as you saw in our press release  we delivered excellent revenue and earnings growth  From a customer lens  we launched many exciting new products and added new capabilities to strengthen our unique value proposition  And for our shareholders  we continued to be good stewards of capital  making strategic acquisitions and returning capital to create significant value  All in all  it was an excellent year where we ve positioned Thermo Fisher very well to begin this new decade as an even stronger company I ll cover some of the highlights later in my remarks  but first I ll hit the financials from the quarter and the year at a high level  Starting with the quarter  our revenue increased 5  in Q4 year over year to  6 83 billion  Organic growth was also 5  in the quarter  Adjusted operating income increased 5  to  1 70 billion  and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in Q4 to 24 9   Finally  we achieved strong adjusted EPS growth in the quarter with a 9  increase to  3 55 per share Turning to our results for the full year  We increased revenue by 5  to  25 54 billion in 2019  Organic revenue growth was 6  for the year  Adjusted operating income increased 6  to  5 97 billion  We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points to 23 4   And we delivered another excellent year of earnings performance in 2019 with an 11  increase in adjusted EPS to  12 35 per share As you know  our strong performance is fueled by the power of our PPI Business System  Our colleagues use it across the company to improve all aspects of how we work  This is not    this not only leads to strong earnings growth  but also helps us continuously make our company even better and that creates a great experience for our customers and our 75 000 colleagues around the world Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market for the quarter and the year  Starting with pharma and biotech  we had excellent performance again in this end market  delivering 10  growth during Q4  We saw a broad based strength across our businesses serving these customers  Our unique depth of capabilities gives us a clear competitive advantage  and we continue to strengthen our offering to gain share  which I ll cover later in my remarks  Our leading position in serving pharma and biotech customers led to double digit growth in this end market for the year In diagnostics and healthcare  we saw strong growth in our immunodiagnostics  clinical diagnostics and healthcare market channel businesses in Q4  and we grew in this end market in the mid single digits for both the quarter and the full year Turning to industrial and applied  growth in this end market declined in the mid single digits in Q4 compared with the double digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year  This is predominantly driven by our electron microscopy business  a dynamic consistent with what we saw in Q3  For the full year  industrial and applied grew in the low single digits  In academic and government  we grew in the low single digits during the quarter and for the full year Finally  let me comment briefly on our performance from a geographic lens  In Q4  we grew in China in the low single digits  This was driven by very strong comparisons in the year ago quarter  coupled with a slower release of funds for capital purchases by some of our customers  Our performance in North America and Europe was very strong  driving excellent revenue growth for the total company  That speaks to the strength of our portfolio and our global competitive position To sum up our performance  market conditions continue to be good overall and our team s executed well to achieve another excellent year  We continue to effectively leverage our unique customer value proposition to deliver a very strong growth  That s a good transition to our growth strategy and I ll use it as a framework to recap some of the highlights for the quarter and the year  We continued our strong momentum across all three elements of our strategy to put Thermo Fisher in the best position to win with our customers and gain market share Starting with the first pillar of our strategy  it was an exceptional year for high impact innovation  We launched exciting new products every quarter and across all of our technology focused businesses  I will highlight just a few this morning  In analytical instruments  you ll recall it was a big year for us at ASMS  with the introduction of our new generation of Thermo Scientific Orbitrap instruments  We strengthened our mass spec leadership with the new Exploris 480 and Eclipse Tribrid systems  which significantly raised the bar in protein analysis  We re pleased to see very strong customer demand for these products  In our electron microscopy business  we launched our new generation Krios G4 instrument for structural biology during the year  And in Q4  we introduced the Metrios AX for industrial applications  This new system uses machine learning to automate the collection and measurement of critical data  ensuring quality and efficiency for our customers In our specialty diagnostics segment  we added a number of new assets during the year  particularly in our immunodiagnostics business where we continued to expand our menu of ImmunoCAP allergy tests  In transplant diagnostics  we extended our family of LABScreen reagents in Q4  Our new single antigen ExPlex reagents greatly expand the number of HLA antibodies that lab directors can characterize to help identify the risk of organ rejection in transplantations Turning to our Life Sciences Solutions segment  we launched a range of the products to strengthen our bio production  biosciences and genetic sciences offering highlighted by the QuantStudio 6 and 7 Pro real time PCR systems  In Q4  we introduced the Qubit Flex Fluorometer  which is designed to measure up to eight samples simultaneously and with highly accurate and reproducible results  And to cap off an excellent year  in Q4 we launched the Genexus system  to extend our Ion Torrent next generation sequencing platform  This fully automated system is a real game changer  delivering results in a single day and requiring minimal amounts of sample for analysis  We ve continued to make great progress with our oncology focused NGS strategy and Genexus is a significant milestone in our goal to ultimately bring NGS to local hospital settings  I m proud of the passion our teams have for innovation and that makes a real difference for our customers  This has always been a key element of our culture  So clearly another fantastic year in that regard and we look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020 Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy  leveraging our scale in high growth and emerging markets we had strong performance across these key regions in 2019  And that included another great year in China with 13  growth  Looking forward  the government priorities in China are aligned with the technologies we provide  to meet customer demands for biologic drugs  a cleaner environment and safer food supplies  And we continue to build on our industry leading scale to help them solve these challenges  You will recall that we highlighted many new developments during the year  including the expansion of our clinical trials operations in China to meet growing demand During the quarter  we opened the new pharma and biotech customer solution center in Shanghai  The center showcases our expertise in critical analytical processes and specialized workflows to help our customers accelerate their development of novel therapeutics  I came away from my visit to China in Q4 with incredible excitement for how rapidly the biotechnology market is expanding there and how well positioned we are to support that growth To sum it up  Thermo Fisher has a distinct advantage in China and that we ve created by leveraging our unique industry leading scale and that allows us to deliver an exceptional experience for our customers there  This is a strategy that plays out across our high growth and emerging markets around the world  As you ve heard during the year  we also continued to build on our capabilities in South Korea  India and Singapore to help our customers advance their work in life sciences  biopharma and food safety applications The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition  and we continue to enhance it to help our customers meet their goals for innovation and productivity  We ve been talking a lot about our offering for pharma and biotech because it s a great example of how we re bringing together our existing capabilities and adding new ones to be the strongest partner for these customers We have a proven formula for serving these customers and it resonates from large pharma to smaller virgin biotech  We can support them from the discovery of a molecule all the way to making it a commercial medicine  And we do this through a combination of continuing to strengthen our product offering by introducing relevant new technologies  leveraging our scale and the extensive customer access we have to our research and safety market channel and continuing to expand our CDMO service capabilities  which also drives revenue synergies across our portfolio  This is a formula that s working very well and in the 2019 we once again delivered double digit growth with our pharma and biotech customersIt s been over two years since we acquired Patheon  and we ve successfully completed the integration  We were able to turn business that was growing in the mid single digits into a high single digit grower with a bright outlook  We ve already covered a lot of our pharma services development during the year  but at a high level  our approach has been a combination of organic investments and strategic bolt on acquisitions Organically  we ve continued to expand our global network to meet customer demand  including our capacity for biologics production and sterile fill finish services  We ve also acquired new capabilities to strengthen our position  We added the new API manufacturing facility in Ireland that we acquired from GSK  and we significantly increased our capabilities in the high growth gene therapy market with the acquisition of Brammer Bio In early December  I attended the grand opening of our new viral vector facility in Lexington  Massachusetts  Our team there is super excited about the opportunities we now have to help our customers bring innovative new therapies to patients with rare diseases  The integration of Brammer Bio has gone extremely well  Business performance is strong  and I m really excited about its potential  So excellent momentum in serving our pharma and biotech customers  It s clear that our value proposition is a key competitive advantage for us and we continue to gain share Turning now to capital deployment  As you know  we have a great track record here in creating value for our shareholders by being good stewards of capital and we continue to successfully execute our strategy in 2019  First  we deployed  1 8 billion on strategic bolt on acquisitions  Second  we continued to return capital to our shareholders for a total of  1 8 billion in share buybacks and dividends  Last  you will recall that we announced in Q3 that we refinanced  5 6 billion of our debt and that will generate  80 million of savings annually for us  So it was a great year from a capital deployment and balance sheet perspective as well Let me cover one last highlight from the year before I turn to our guidance and that relates to our commitment to environmental  social and governance priorities  We ve always been a company that s focused on doing business the right way  And that s embodied in our mission  which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier  cleaner and safer  We not only bring our mission to life every day  but we also have robust programs that connect our customers  colleagues and communities so we can make the direct impact This happens in a number of ways  including through our STEM education and environmental sustainability initiatives  Still much more to be done here  but I m proud of the work our teams are doing to raise our ESG profile and continue to make our company even better  Stephen will dwell on the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance  but let me quickly cover the highlights  In terms of our revenue guidance  we expect to deliver between  26 61 billion and  27 01 billion in 2020 which would result in reported revenue growth of 4  to 6   We re initiating adjusted EPS guidance for 2020 in the range of  13 49 to  13 67  This will lead to 9  to 11  growth year over year Before I hand the call over to Stephen  I ll leave you with my key takeaways for the year  We ve consistently achieved excellent revenue and earnings growth and extended our track record with another year of strong performance in 2019  We re delivering an exceptional experience for our customers by continuing to enhance our unique value proposition and using our PPI Business System to make our company even stronger  And we ve continued to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders  which puts us in a very strong position as we begin the decade With that  I ll now hand the call over to our CFO  Stephen Williamson  Stephen Stephen Williamson    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Marc  and good morning  everyone  I ll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results for the total company  then I ll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our initial 2020 guidance Before I get into the details of our financial performance  I thought it would be helpful to provide a high level view of how the fourth quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call  As you saw in our press release  we had a strong finish to the year and delivered results ahead of our prior guidance on both the top line and bottom line  We delivered 5  organic growth and adjusted EPS that was  0 04 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance  reflecting good volume pull through along with incremental favorable below the line FX  Our strong performance in Q4 enabled us to deliver 6  organic growth for the full year 2019 and 11  growth in adjusted earnings per share  So excellent financial results in 2019 Now let me give you some more color on our performance  Starting with the earnings results  You saw in our press release  we grew adjusted EPS in Q4 by 9  to  3 55  For the full year  adjusted EPS was  12 35  up 11  versus 2018  GAAP EPS in the quarter was  2 49  up 12  from Q4 last year and 2019 s full year GAAP EPS was  9 17  up 27  versus the prior year  On the top line  our Q4 reported revenue grew 5  year over year in Q4  The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 5  organic growth  approximately 1  growth from the net of acquisitions and divestitures and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1   For the full year 2019  reported revenue increased 5  year over year  This includes a 6  contribution from organic growth  a 1  positive impact from the net of acquisitions and divestitures and a 2  headwind from foreign exchange Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter  North America grew in the mid single digits  Europe grew in the high single digits  Asia Pacific grew in the low single digits  including China  which also grew in the low single digits and Rest of the World grew in the mid single digits  For the full year  North America grew in the mid single digits  Europe and Asia Pacific both grew in the high single digits and Rest of the World grew in the mid single digits Turning to our operational performance  Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5  and adjusted operating margin was 24 9   up 10 basis points from Q4 of last year  We saw strong productivity from our PPI Business System and good volume leverage  This was partially offset by strategic investments  business mix and the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture of our Anatomical Pathology business  Q4 margin expansion was 30 basis points lower than we had assumed in the last guidance  Half of that was driven by FX and the other half by incremental investments to fuel future growth For the full year  adjusted operating income increased 6  and adjusted operating margin was 23 4  which is 30 basis points higher than 2018  We had strong productivity and volume pull through  which was partially offset by strategic investments  business mix and the impact of acquisitions and the divestitures  For the full year  FX was a headwind of 2  on revenue  10 basis points on adjusted operating margins and 2  on adjusted earnings per share  As a reminder  our divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business at the end of Q2 was  0 09 dilutive in 2019 and a year over year headwind of approximately  120 million on revenue   50 million on adjusted operating income and 10 basis points on adjusted operating margin Moving on to the details of the P L  total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 46 3   down 60 basis points from Q4 of the prior year  50 basis points of this was the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture  For the full year  adjusted gross margin was 46 4   down 30 basis points from 2018  About the quarter and full year  strong productivity and volume pull through were more than offset by business mix  strategic investments and the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture Adjusted SG A in the quarter was 17 6  of revenue and an improvement of 70 basis points versus Q4 2018  Total R D expense came in at 3 8  of revenue  10 basis points lower than Q4 last year  For the full year  adjusted SG A was 19 1   an improvement of 60 basis points compared to the full year 2018  R D expense was 3 9  of sales  10 basis points lower than the prior year  R D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the full year was 7 1  Looking at our results below the line for the quarter  our net interest expense was  97 million  down  30 million from Q4 last year  Net interest expense for the full year was  450 million  a decrease of  80 million from 2018  The reduction in net interest expense was driven by debt reduction and our refinancing actions  Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of  16 million  higher than Q4 2018  primarily due to changes in non operating foreign exchange Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11 7   down 50 basis points versus Q4 last year  Our full year adjusted tax rate was 11   in line with previous guidance and is 90 basis points lower than the full year 2018  primarily reflecting the beneficial impact of U S  tax reform and our continued tax planning initiatives  As I mentioned on the Q3 call  we repurchased  750 million of our shares in early Q4  bringing the total repurchases for 2019 to  1 5 billion  Average diluted shares were 402 million in Q4 and 403 million for the full year  both in line with our prior guidance Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet  For the full year  cash flow from continuing operations was  5 billion and free cash flow was  4 1 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately  900 million  During 2019  we also continued to return significant capital to shareholders with  1 5 billion of share buybacks   300 million in dividends  And as Marc mentioned  we successfully deployed  1 8 billion of capital through strategic acquisitions We ended the year with approximately  2 4 billion in cash and  17 8 billion of total debt  Our total debt was up  700 million from the end of Q3  driven by the completion of our debt refinancing activities  which began in the prior quarter  Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2 7 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA  in line with our expectations  Wrapping up my comments on our total company performance  adjusted ROIC was 11 8   up 20 basis points from last quarter and up 90 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate very strong returns Now I ll provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments for the quarter and the full year  Starting with Life Science Solutions  In Q4  reported revenue in this segment increased 8  and organic revenue growth was 9   In the quarter  we continued to see strong growth in this segment led by bioproduction  biosciences and genetic sciences businesses  For the full year  reported revenue increased 9  and organic revenue growth was 10  Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 11  and adjusted operating margin was 37 5   up 70 basis points year over year  In the quarter  we drove very strong productivity and volume pull through  which was partially offset by business mix and strategic investments  For the full year 2019  adjusted operating income increased 13  and adjusted operating margin was 35 7   an increase of 130 basis points over 2018 In the Analytical Instruments segment  reported revenue decreased by 3  in Q4 and organic revenue declined 2   In this segment  all businesses had very strong year over year comps  given the 12  organic growth that we delivered in Q4 2018  particularly in our electron microscopy business  In addition  the slower release of funds for capital purchases in China impacted Q4 growth for the businesses in this segment  For the full year reported revenue in the segment increased 1  and organic growth was 3  Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 5  and adjusted operating margin was 26   down 60 basis points year over year  In the quarter  we saw a very strong productivity  which was more than offset by business mix  strategic investments and volume  For the full year  adjusted operating income was 23 1   30 basis points higher than the prior year Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment  as a reminder  this is the segment that previously included the Anatomical Pathology business which we divested at the end of Q2  In Q4  total revenue declined 1   organic revenue growth was 7   We saw strong growth in this segment led by our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses with continued strong growth in our healthcare market channel  For the full year  reported revenue was flat and organic growth was 5  Adjusted operating income decreased 5  in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 23 7   down 80 basis points from the prior year due to the impact of the divestiture  In the quarter  we saw a strong productivity and volume leverage  However  this was more than offset by strategic investments and the impact of the divestiture and business mix  For the full year 2019  adjusted operating income declined 2   adjusted operating margin was 25   contracting 60 basis points year over year with the divestiture representing 30 basis points Finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment  Q4 reported revenue increased 9   organic revenue growth was 7   In the quarter  we saw a strong growth across all of our businesses within the segment  led by the pharma services business and the research and safety market channel  For the full year  both reported and organic revenue grew 6  Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q4 increased 15  and adjusted operating margin was 13 8   which was higher than the prior year by 70 basis points  In the quarter  we saw a very strong productivity  volume leverage  contributions from acquisitions and favorable business mix  This was partially offset by strategic investments  For the full year  adjusted operating margin was 12 5   flat to 2018 With that  I d like to review the details of our initial 2020 guidance  And as Marc mentioned earlier  we re initiating a 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of  13 49 to  13 67  which would result in 9  to 11  growth over 2019  In terms of revenue  our guidance range is  26 61 billion to  27 01 billion  which would result in reported growth of 4  to 6  over 2019  Our initial guidance for 2020 assumes 5  organic revenue growth for the year With regards to FX  in 2020  we re assuming that the year over year headwind of approximately  100 million of revenue or 0 4  and  0 06 of adjusted EPS or 0 5   largely in Q1 and to a lesser extent in Q2  We expect  0 06 of dilution from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business which reflects revenue and operating income headwinds of  105 million and  30 million respectively  We re assuming that the acquisitions we completed in 2019 will contribute approximately  160 million to our reported revenue growth in 2020 Turning to adjusted operating margin  we made the decision to reinvest  40 million of last year s debt refinancing back into the business  This reinvestment impacts 2020 adjusted operating margins by 15 basis points  In addition  we expect to have about 10 basis points of margin impact in 2020 from our decision to renew key commercial contracts for our PCT test business  which is part of our Specialty Diagnostics segment In exchange for some royalty rate concessions  we successfully negotiated long term contract extension with most of our PCT commercial partners  For 2020  this creates a headwind of about  30 million of revenue and adjusted operating income  but in return  extends the revenue stream for this highly successful test franchise for many years to come  Factoring in the impact of these two divisions and the benefits of strong volume pull through on the organic growth and continued strong productivity from our PPI Business System  we expect to expand adjusted operating margins by 30 basis points in 2020  resulting in adjusted operating margins of approximately 23 7  Moving below the line  we expect net interest expense in 2020 to be approximately  340 million  This is  110 million lower than 2019 and reflects the debt refinancing activity we completed this past year and a lower average debt level  We re assuming adjusted other net income will be about  60 million  We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 10 5  in 2020  The improvement from our 11  rate in 2019 is primarily driven by the continued realization of benefits associated with U S  tax reform We re assuming net capital expenditures in the range of  1 billion to  1 1 billion  This represents an increase in investments of approximately  150 million over 2019  driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services and bioproduction businesses  Free cash flow is expected to be approximately  4 5 billion in 2020  The increase over 2019 is primarily driven by our expected strong earnings growth In terms of capital deployment  our guide    our guidance includes a total of  1 5 billion for share buybacks in 2020  which we assume will be completed throughout the year  We re also assuming that we ll return approximately  350 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends  We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be between 400 million and 401 million shares  Our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures  It s also worth noting that our guidance does not include any potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak  It is too early to gauge the impact  We are fully focused on doing everything we can to help our customers and our colleagues to address the situation And finally  I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are several factors to consider  First  know that we have one less day in Q1 and two extra days in Q4 this year  From an organic growth standpoint  we expect Q1 to be a couple of points lower than the full year  due to the days impact and the prior year comps  particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment  And we expect Q4 to be higher than the full year for the same reasons From an adjusted operating income margin standpoint  we expect Q1 to be 40 basis points lower than Q1 2019  This is driven by the phasing of organic revenue and the timing of investments in our 2019 acquisitions  Acquisitions and divestitures are approximately 60 basis points diluted in Q1 accretive for the rest of the year  so net neutral for the year as a whole  Due to the phasing of revenue and margins  in the year  we expect adjusted EPS in Q1 to be just over 21  for the full year and Q4 to be approximately 30   Q2 and Q3 are expected to be about equal So at a high level  to start the year  our guidance assumes 5  organic revenue growth and 9  to 11  adjusted EPS growth  the continuation of excellent financial performance track record  As always  we ll strive to deliver the best possible results  and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year With that  I ll give the call back over to Ken Ken Apicerno    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Stephen  Operator  we are ready to open it up for Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from J P  Morgan  Your line is open Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  good morning  Marc  I want to start with performance in the Analytical Instruments business  You had a difficult comp last quarter  but there s a notable quarter over quarter deceleration here  Is there anything you could talk to in terms of pacing  Did anything come up late in the quarter  You talked about the China slower release of funds  How much of it was that versus maybe FDI  It looks like FDI s tracking a couple of hundred million dollars below with semis and Life Sciences lagging suit  Can you maybe talk to those two dynamics and if there s anything else that weighed down AI in the quarter Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Tycho  thanks for the question  In terms of the analytical instruments  as you said we had 12  growth in the prior year  So our expectations were that we were going to have that as a headwind and our performance was a little bit below the expectations that we had  really happened late in the quarter in China with a slower release of funds from specific customers on high end capital equipment in that market  When we think about the comparisons  electron microscopy business as you said has a very strong second half in 2018 and actually very strong going into the first quarter of 2019  So we knew we have challenging comparisons there and that played out pretty much as we expected Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd then I guess for the follow up on China  Can you maybe just talk about the gives and takes  obviously you re not factoring any coronavirus impact  but are you expecting a ketchup on the release of funds  And maybe just talk about some of the other gives and takes in China for the year end  And is there an opportunity on coronavirus for you guys on the positive side  is we think about the diagnostics business Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So let me cover China  From a China perspective  I always liked to keep things in the contact  right  which is we in we had a very strong year in China and 13  growth  And when I look back on the year  we really continue to strengthen our strategic position in the country  Feedback from our customers continues to be positive  We were expecting that we would have mid single digit growth in Q4  based on comparisons  which is in the Analytical Instruments business that I    as I just highlighted and we came in with low single digit growth in China versus the mid single digit expectations for the fourth quarter And the driver that was really the slower release of capital or high end capital equipment  Interestingly enough  when you look at the remainder of the business  which is obviously the majority of the business  the various service businesses and all of our consumer businesses actually play out exactly as we saw in the previous three quarters  very strong growth across the rest of the portfolio  So it seems like the government made some decisions to    on very large capital equipment purchases to hold funds and so that s our take there and coronaviruses isn t baked into our forecast one way or the other  Thanks  Tycho Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays  Your line is open Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Good morning  I wanted to probe a little bit more on the industrial and applied end markets  so down mid single digits in the quarter  Obviously  electron microscopy weighing on that  Just    I m curious if you excluded that  what you re seeing in terms of the macro  Was that also weaker year over year  And excluding some of the capital seasonality you re talking about there  what does the guidance assume for that as an end market for 2020 Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Jack  As I look to    for the year last year  we grew low single digits in industrial and applied  And our guidance has the same low single digit assumption for the year  And you ll see the flip in terms of phasing  right  We had a very strong year up in industrial and applied at the first half of 2019  And therefore  we have more challenging comparisons as we start this year  And then the comparisons eased substantially as the year goes on  so it s a little bit softer to begin and then accelerating growth as the year plays out  And really  what s assuming is really exactly the same market conditions happening in industrial and applied  The only thing that s changing is really the    is just how challenging the comparisons are  When you look at sort of the day to day run rate business in industrial and applied  there s always some pockets of strength  We saw some strength in applied markets QA QC applications  You saw some strength  but the larger capital equipment purchases had a difficult comparison primarily in semiconductor and material science applications Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Okay  And then just as a follow up  I know Stephen mentioned  I think  all the businesses within AI had a tough comp  but was hoping you could just provide some more color on mass spec and chromatography  how you feel    did that grow  Or was that negative also in the quarter from the comp  And how do you feel about share gains versus the competitive environment Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Jack  so in terms of Analytical Instruments  as a reminder  we have three business lines within our Analytical Instruments business our materials and structural analysis was below the segment average and chroma mass spec and chemical analysis  All three businesses declined in the quarter because all three had very strong comparisons  Our chromatography and mass spectrometry business performed the strongest of the three businesses  And when you look at it for the full year  the electron microscopy or materials and structural analysis was below the segment average and chroma mass spec and chemical analysis was above the segment average for the full year  I feel good about our shared performance in terms of how we performed during the course of the year  Thank you  Jack Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America  Your line is open Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystHey  good morning Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Derik Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystHey  Marc  can you talk a little bit about sort of the margin profile  I mean  you ve done some deals recently  like the GSK deal  and the Brammer deal that have been putting some pressure on margins  And I guess  I m just trying to get a sense on the go forward basis on what the margin opportunity will be in  And I mean    and this sort of bonds into a    of further capital deployment conversation in that when you sort of look at other assets you could potentially add  is there a lot more stuff like GSK and Brammer that you re looking to add that would be dilutive on this  I m just trying to get a sense on the pacing of the margin because you re trying to balance this new growth opportunity with step of demands  higher capital investment and lower margins at this point in time Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Derik  Thanks for the question  So I will try to answer this way  When we    the first thing is about just M A generally and how we think about M A  We actually don t focus on what the starting margin is  Meaning  as you know  over the many years  we ve done M A that was accretive to margins from an operating perspective from day one  And we ve done ones that have been dilutive  right  What we look at is what are the return profiles and what can we do with the business and are we the right owner  right  So you ll have things that sometimes short term are headwinds  Sometimes  they re tailwinds  And when we give our guidance  we always try to carve that out to explain it  not just to say  here s the core  everything we have before the acquisition and then whatever the effects are of the acquisitions going forward When I look at the margin expansion  we laid out at the Analyst Day roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion in the    on average over the three year model is what was assumed in the base view  And along with that  we had assumptions on capital deployment assumptions on tax rate and so forth  And we ve made some interesting decisions  right  What we want to do is always deliver excellent adjusted EPS growth and manage the business in the best possible way When I look at the end market outlook  I feel very good about the growth prospects  And because we had very good opportunity to refinance our balance sheet during the course of Q3  and because our team was able to identify additional tax planning opportunities  we have very strong EPS growth set up for 2020  And we made a conscious decision to actually reinvest some of those savings  still deliver the same EPS growth  but come out with a basically 30 basis points of margin expansion relative to the 55 that we had explained at Analyst Day  a conscious choice  and Stephen laid out the details  Part of it was trading some short term margins in our PCT franchise for a decade long extension of the relationships  which is a great economic deal for the company  And the second was we made the decision because of the talent of our hourly workforce in the U S  to reinvest additional funds in wage increases and to mitigate the increases in healthcare cost to that part of our population  And so we re taking a slower rate of margin expansion this year  And then I would expect that margins would be right back where the model was in 2021 and beyond  EPS  no factor one way or the other  just based on the other things that I just articulated Stephen Williamson    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Derik  just one thing to clarify the comment about the divestiture    the acquisition and the divestiture impact our margins and on gross margin  That 50 basis points is much  much smaller impact than Q4 on the bottom line in terms of our adjusted operating income  It s kind of    the gross margin profile of the acquisitions and the divestitures is really what s caused the dynamic there Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystAnd so how should we think about that gross margin target for 2020 since the three seems to be all over the place on a quarterly basis Stephen Williamson    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So obviously  it will depend on the mix of actual revenues that comes in  But I think most of the margin expansion next year will be coming from leverage of SG A  and roughly flat gross margins is probably a good selling point to think about for the year  those 30 basis points Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  good  I got another follow up  So it s been a long time since we ve    I ve really thought about thinking about NGS and Thermo  I hadn t really thought about Ion Torrent  You closed the Life deal  And so you ve been investing more and doing more of that  I guess  can you sort of talk about where you re going for  And would you be interested in getting more into the research space versus the clinical space  I mean  there are some assets out there that are being kicked to the sidelines  I m just sort of curious in terms of what your general plan is in that market and sort of like how you see that competitive dynamic shaking out given your very large competitors  footprint there Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So Derik  thanks for the question  In terms of NGS  we have been very focused since 2014 on maximizing the impact of our NGS business  And we really have focused it on the oncology market  And you ve seen  over the last five years or so  a steady stream of product launches that really have a benefit for clinical researchers and ultimately patients  And our technology uses less DNA sample to get a read relative to the alternatives on the market  and the ease of use is outstanding  And the Genexus platform  which we launched at AMP in November is being very well received in the market with incredible customer interest because you can change the way you think about how you treat a patient  which is as opposed to sending out a sample and getting a result two to three weeks later with an answer  you can come into work the next day and have your sequence completed  And an oncologist then can make a decision based on the information  That s what Genexus is all about  In terms of extending to other markets  our focus right now is really on oncology and some other applications within    where our NGS platform is outstanding  and that s where we kept our focus Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystAnd you signed an agreement with LabCorp in that market  And I m just wondering  could    any idea    can you give us some idea on sort of what sort of volume LabCorp does in the sort of the NGS space Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  LabCorp obviously runs a huge number of NGS tests across their network  And I thought it was super exciting that roughly been six weeks of launch that they wanted to actually announce to the world their excitement about Genexus and using us to have that within their network  So I think that s a great opportunity  And the specifics  obviously  we re not going to get into  but it s a really nice win for both companies Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystAnd if I can squeeze in one more from a client  One investor wants to know what Thermo s exposure is in the Chinese hospital settings since obviously that s    people are not going there  Just any idea on which how your business sort of breaks down in China on that regard in diagnostics Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  If you think about the healthcare and diagnostics globally  it s 20  of our revenue  In China  it is actually less penetrated  So it s less than 20  of the Chinese revenue is going to be in the healthcare and diagnostics setting Derik de Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystThank you Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen  Your line is open Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystHey  good morning everybody  Thanks for taking the question  I d like to start by going back to the slower than expected release of budget funding for capital equipment investment in China  Could you just provide a little more detail on which end markets  Have you recaptured that revenue in Q1 already  Or do you have visibility on recapturing that revenue soon  And how are you treating this dynamic in guidance  So let me pause there  and then we can go to the second topic Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So Doug  thanks  In terms of the release of funds  100  driven in government controlled type entities  So we saw it in certain academic and government customers and in certain parts of the industrial market where they re Chinese state owned enterprises  right  So a semiconductor fab that s owned by the Chinese government would be an example of an industrial and applied tech customer  In terms of the timing or assumption is that  that will work its way through during the course of the year  but we didn t assume that it would be immediately in the first quarter is the way I would think about it  In our guidance  what we ve assumed for China is low double digit growth is what we assumed in our full year guidance for ChinaDoug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  Thank you for that  And it s a good segue to the second thing I wanted to unpack a little bit more  which is indeed guidance  So your first    your initial organic revenue growth target of 5  for the year is on the lower end of your long term 5  to 7  target that you outlined at the Analyst Day over the summer  Given seemingly strong end market conditions and a lot of the momentum you ve had for a little while now  is this just beginning of the year conservatism  Or is this just kind of what you d expect in terms of a trend toward normalizing toward the mean after a couple of really strong years  And then I guess  just to layer in one more element to the question  and I apologize if I ve missed this in your prepared remarks  but could you just share what your assumptions for growth are in terms of what you built into 2020 revenue growth guidance by end market and geography  Thank you Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo first of all  thanks for the question on guidance  I m super excited about 2020  I mean  that is if you re going to take away the takeaway  So let me put them in context  The last three years  2017  2018 and 2019  have been very strong in our end markets and very strong performance of Thermo Fisher relative to those end markets as well  2020  we expect to be exactly the same thing  another year of good end markets and share gain performance for the company  So we re expecting growth to be in line with the long term model or consistent with that 5  to 7  organic growth  We re initiating with 5  because the way we think about the world is every year  there s some level of risk and every quarter that those risks don t materialize for our industry  they get retired and it gives you the opportunity to raise guidance as you go through the year As a reminder  we started out with 5  guidance in 2019  We always were aspiring to deliver the best possible results  I feel great about the 6  that we delivered  and our posture here is the same  We re starting out within the range that we said we would do with the goal as the year unfolds to be able to continue to move higher and higher in that 5  to 7  range  So hopefully  that gives you a sense  And then a little bit of commentary on some of the details on the growth around that  You re going to have pharma and biotech with high single digit growth  You re going to see mid single digit growth in the healthcare and diagnostics  low single digit in academic  government and industrial applied end markets would    will give you the drivers of where our growth is going to come from Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystGreat  Thanks again Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI  Your line is open Vijay Kumar    Evercore    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my question  Just on the Q1 commentary on the guidance here  Think I heard you say couple of hundred basis points below the year  I m just curious on was there any days impact or I m not sure what drives that Q1 below trend Stephen Williamson    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Vijay  So the one less selling day in Q1  that s just under 1 point of headwind from that  And then it s really the comps from the Analytical Instruments business  particularly electron microscopy  Those will be the driver    yes  the piece to it Vijay Kumar    Evercore    AnalystGot you  Then Marc  one big picture question for you  Looking at the cash flow assumptions here   4 5 billion free cash  You have  2 billion plus existing  but the share repo is just  1 5 billion  That s a significant amount of cash for Thermo  It s been an unusual year for Thermo from a cap deployment perspective  Any thoughts on sort of how the M A funnel is looking    shaping up to be and thoughts on the cash burn on the balance sheet Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So Vijay  thanks for the question  So from a capital deployment perspective  looking back and then looking forward  last year played out well from my perspective  which was we set out the very beginning of the year the goal of finishing the strengthening of the balance sheet from the very active period we had before that  So we did some refinancing  We returned  1 8 billion of capital to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends  We deployed  1 8 billion in terms of M A  And as we    and we generated the cash flow  So as I look to this year  we obviously have a very strong balance sheet  We have a significant amount of capacity We continue to have a very active M A pipeline  And as you know  we operate in a very fragmented industry  So plenty of things that we look at  And we ll only pursue things that we feel are aligned with our strategy and create shareholder value  Our return assumption is basically  1 5 billion in buybacks  about  350 million in dividends  which means that what s not on our EPS numbers is just additional deployment of capital  whether it s return or buybacks    return or M A or a combination of the two beyond that  And that s the convention that we ve always used  which is as the year unfolds  we ll see what the best opportunity is for our shareholders  And we ll deploy most likely in some way and then we ll update you on the impacts to our EPS guidance based on whatever decisions we make as the year unfolds Vijay Kumar    Evercore    AnalystThanks for clarifying  Marc Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research  Your line is open Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  Good morning  and thanks for the time here  First  I wanted to drill in just a bit on broader biopharma  and maybe a two parter  I wonder if you could give us a sense for around the 4Q and year end  how you saw hardware purchasing dynamics in pharma  specifically relative to the last two  three years  And then prospectively  for pharma in 2020  how do you imagine the hardware component of the pharma growth outlook looks like  whether it s in research it s in research settings or in bioprocess  And then I have one much simpler follow up Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Steve  thanks for the question  When I think about the pharma and biotech performance  really a fantastic year for the company  continuing the trend of many fantastic years  For the year  we had double digit growth  And when I look at the performance  it was really across the entire portfolio  We saw strength in bioproduction  biosciences  pharma services  analytical instruments in the research and safety market channel  If I left something out  it s not deliberately  and it s due to the sense of broad based strength across the portfolio  We had a good quarter and a good year in capital equipment to the biotech and pharmaceutical spending So no change in trajectory there  And we re starting out with a high single digit growth guidance for pharma and biotech as the initial starting point  So we re expecting strong performance  And if you go back over the last few years  we had historically started out with mid single to high single digit growth  and we feel comfortable starting out with high single digit growth based on the momentum we have in the portfolio So that s how I would think about it  Nothing particular on capital  I don t really track year end spend by subsegment so much  I think about year end spends that are more across the portfolio  And we saw last year playing out in line with our guidance that we had all year  which was a normal year end spend with some customers having very strong year end money but others  kind of business as usual  and that kind of averages out in the long run  As a reminder  the previous two years were very strong year end spends  And from recollection  I think 2016 was a below average year in spend  And so it varies  but it took    it played out last year in line with our guidance Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  And then just a couple of fine points  Within the broader pharma outlook  it s safe to say we can hold up double digit growth in bioprocess  just as a follow up to that prior  And then I wonder if you could speak to how things played out over the course of 2019 and how you re thinking about 2020 as it relates to  at the corporate level  price increases year on year  And then going into the year  given some of the broader trade dynamics  there was an initiative to look at accelerated pricing  How did that play out  And are we back to normal in 2020  Thanks again Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So I ll take biologics and then Stephen will cover the pricing  On bioprocess  we had very strong growth  A couple of companies have reported prior to us  and we continue to perform a little north of the levels that others have performed there Stephen Williamson    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And pricing played out as we had expected in the year  so a good year for pricing  over 1  of price overall offsetting  in fact  the tariffs  So that was really the goal there  And going forward  I generally project kind of just    like between 0 5  and 1  price as we think about the company s performance in 2020 Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Steve Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  Thanks again Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerOperator  we have time for just one quick one OperatorOkay  Our final question will come from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel  Your line is open Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystGood morning  Thanks guys  Stephen  on Brammer  just to follow up on the margins there  Can you just touch on the impact of that business on overall margins over time  I think that goes from dilutive to accretive at some point  but I was just hoping you could confirm that  But then also just clarify the timing around that if that is true Stephen Williamson    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Just on the Brammer margins  we expect it to be just under the company average for the full year 2020  So we d be getting it up to the decent level at the end of the year  So think about going into 2020  that s right at that pace Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystOkay  And then  may be Marc  it s    I m sure  a little hard to do  but just given how meaningful it seems like it s been for you guys  are you able to quantify what you think share gains have meant for growth over the last year or so Marc N  Casper    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We had 6  organic growth for the year  We obviously don t have the benefit of everybody reporting  but that s a very solid performance  And when we compare the pieces relative to others  we expect that our share gain will be better than the 1  in terms of growth  And we ll have good clarity on that in the next week or two  So another strong year  So Dan  thanks for the question Let me wrap it up here  So first  thank you  We re pleased to deliver really another excellent year  But we re much more excited about what the opportunities that sit ahead of us  And we look forward to updating you on the course    over the course of 2020  So thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific  and look forward to seeing you soon Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration

137318,358833,TMO,U S  healthcare stocks shielded from political pressures prove profitable,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  healthcare investors have found success this year buying stocks of companies whose products improve eyesight  treat pets and fix crooked teeth  all viewed as unlikely to fall victim to political and regulatory issues pressuring a wide swath of the sector  The S P 500 healthcare sector overall has underperformed the broader stock market this year  But a number of companies have posted standout returns even as healthcare reform and prescription drug pricing loom as hot topics with the 2020 presidential election campaign heating up   The reason that people have been gravitating toward names like these is they feel more comfortable that they are less susceptible   said Teresa McRoberts  a portfolio manager who focuses on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York    People are trying to stay away from anything that is viewed as susceptible to headline risk   The healthcare sector  which accounts for 14  of the S P 500 benchmark stock index  is due for another test later this month  when the Democratic Party holds its first presidential debates   Healthcare is poised to be a prominent issue  with left leaning candidates embracing government run Medicare for All plans  At the same time  the high cost of medicines has drawn attention from Democrats as well as President Donald Trump and his Republican party  So far this year  the S P 500 healthcare sector has climbed 5 5   well below the roughly 15  return for the overall S P 500   Graphic  How healthcare stocks stack up in 2019 link    Shares of many health insurers  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and pharmacy services companies have lagged  But a number of large cap healthcare stocks have thrived in 2019  generally benefiting from factors specific to their businesses as well as from their place away from the political glare afflicting others in the sector  For example  shares of Mettler Toledo International and Thermo Fisher Scientific  NYSE TMO   which specialize in equipment used for drug development and research laboratories  are up 43  and 27 5   respectively  Shares of animal health company  Zoetis Inc   NYSE ZTS  have climbed 30   while contact lens company Cooper Cos Inc has seen its stock price jump 29    Graphic  Healthcare stock winners and losers in 2019 link     In general  life science tool makers  medical device companies and animal health firms are  all higher growth and they all have low healthcare reform risk   said Martin Jarzebowski  sector head of healthcare for Federated Investors   Those two things in combination mean that those best performing names are safe havens amid both economic and regulatory uncertainty   Jarzebowski said   That s the glue behind all of them   Earnings for S P 500 healthcare companies are expected to rise by 6 2  in 2019  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  more than twice the 2 7  earnings growth expected for the S P 500 overall  despite the market s strong performance this year   Graphic  Putting up profits in healthcare link     Two of the three top performing S P 500 healthcare stocks so far in 2019 are in the dental space  Shares of Dentsply Sirona Inc and Align Technology Inc have jumped 53  and 49   respectively in 2019  Shares of biotechnology company Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  are up about 51  this year because it is being acquired by drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   Bristol  by comparison  is down 9  this year  Dentsply Sirona  which makes an array of products found in the dentist s office  is a  turnaround story  after a rough 2018 for the shares  said William Blair analyst John Kreger  New products and a solid first quarter report have helped the stock  he said  Align Technology  which specializes in clear aligners that straighten teeth  saw its shares sell off late last year with tech and growth stocks as the market swooned  Along with those other stocks  shares of Align are rebounding as they also benefit from lessening concerns about competitive price pressures  Kreger said   No one is really talking about reforming dental and how dental is provided   Kreger said   The idea is you can get the growth potential without the regulatory uncertainty or the political uncertainty   Healthcare s overall sluggishness this year means the sector looks relatively cheap  It now trades at 14 8 times forward earnings estimates compared to 16 2 times for the S P 500  according to Refinitiv data  The sector and the broader market began the year with similar valuations   Graphic  Healthcare stock valuations link     Healthcare  a topic that helped Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections  is likely to come into the spotlight when a crowded field of Democratic candidates meet on June 26 and 27 for the party s first presidential debates  Former Vice President Joe Biden  who tallied the most support in a Reuters Ipsos poll released earlier this month  is seen by investors as likely to back more moderate healthcare reform efforts than left leaning candidates  such as U S  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  Should Sanders  who advocates Medicare for All  or other candidates with similar views gain more prominence  the healthcare sector could face increased pressure  
 I think there s more potential downside to the debates   McRoberts said ",2019-06-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-healthcare-stocks-shielded-from-political-pressures-prove-profitable-1897097,1897097

137409,358924,TMO,Why Thermo Fisher  TMO  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Thermo Fisher Scientific  TMO   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Instruments industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1 54  
For the most recent quarter  Thermo Fisher was expected to post earnings of  2 88 per share  but it reported  2 94 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 08   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 01 per share  while it actually produced  3 04 per share  a surprise of 1  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Thermo Fisher lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thermo Fisher has an Earnings ESP of  0 40  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 30  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-thermo-fisher-tmo-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200497696,200497696

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 6  2019  DexCom reported EPS of  0 65 versus consensus estimate of  0 18 
For the current fiscal year  DexCom is expected to post earnings of  0 94 per share on  1 37 billion in revenues  This represents a 213 33  change in EPS on a 33 02  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 41 per share on  1 62 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 50 24  and 17 75   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
DexCom may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself

137551,359066,TMO,CVS Health  CVS  Beats On Q3 Earnings  Raises  19 EPS Guidance,opinion,CVS Health Corporation s   NYSE CVS   third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 84 increased 6 4  year over year and also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 9   The quarter s adjusted EPS considered certain transaction and integration costs pertaining to the buyout of Aetna  NYSE AET  and store rationalization charges along with other adjustments On a reported basis  the company registered earnings of  1 17 per share  reflecting a 13 9  drop from the year ago period Moreover  total revenues in the third quarter surged 36 5  year over year  after adjusting the interest income on financing the Aetna acquisition  adjusted revenues increased 37 1  year over year  to  64 81 billion  The same also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 8  The year over year revenue rise was primarily driven by the acquisition of Aetna  expanded volume and the brand name drug price inflation in both the Pharmacy Services and Retail LTC segments  partially offset by a persistent reimbursement pressure in the Retail LTC  price compression in the Pharmacy Services segment and an increased generic dispensing rate Quarter in Detail     Earlier this year  CVS Health realigned the composition of its segments  As a result  the company s SilverScript Medicare Part D prescription drug plan  PDP  was shifted from the Pharmacy Services segment to Health Care Benefits  In addition  the mail order and specialty pharmacy operations of Aetna were transitioned from the Health Care Benefits segment to Pharmacy Services CVS Health Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Pharmacy Services revenues were up 6 4  to  36 billion in the reported quarter  driven by growth in total pharmacy claims volume and the brand name drug price inflation  This was  however  partially offset by a continued client price compression and an increase in generic dispensing rate Total pharmacy claims processed rose 9 3  on a 30 day equivalent basis  attributable to net new business and the steady adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC were up 2 9  year over year to  21 47 billion  Per the company  the result was based on higher prescription volume and branded drug price inflation  partially offset by a persistent reimbursement pressure and the impact of an increased generic dispensing rate  Front store revenues represented 21 5  of total Retail LTC revenues in the reported quarter  primarily banking on improved sales of health and beauty products  which benefited from consistent strength in cough and cold products Total prescription volume grew 6 4  on a 30 day equivalent basis  boosted by the steady uptake of patient care programs Within Health Care Benefits segment  the company registered revenues worth  16 5 billion in the third quarter Gross profit soared 52 6  to  11 52 billion  Accordingly  gross margin expanded 188 bps to 17 8   However  operating margin in the quarter under review contracted 90 bps to 4 5  despite a 13 7  rise in operating profit to  2 93 billion OutlookCVS Health has updated its 2019 guidance Adjusted EPS expectation is raised to the band of  6 97  7 05 from the earlier provided range of  6 89  7  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings is pegged at  6 98  within the company

reaffirmed its cash flow from operations guidance at  10 1  10 6 billion Our TakeCVS Health ended the third quarter on a promising note with both earnings and revenues trumping the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  year over year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment  which benefited from the upside in specialty services  The company s recently introduced Health Care Benefits segment following the Aetna acquisition also holds immense promise Additionally  solid year over year Retail LTC comparisons were encouraging  The upped adjusted EPS

the wait for now What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick Product Launches  The company has been progressing well in terms of new generation product development  Within mass spectrometry  it introduced new instruments  workflows and software  highlighted by two new generation Orbitrap systems   the Exploris 480 and Eclipse Tribrid  Also  a new workflow  HR Multi Attribute Method  has been introduced to make progress in biotherapeutics   In genetic analysis  Thermo Fisher recently launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 and 7 Pro Real Time PCR systems to automate qPCR workflows  The company is also in the process of expanding its bioproduction capabilities to meet customer demand for biologics Acquisitions and Partnerships to Add Value  We are looking forward to Thermo Fisher s recently formed alliance with GlaxoSmithKline in the second quarter  where Thermo Fisher stated that it will acquire a site in Cork  Ireland  from GlaxoSmithKline  This will add to the existing capacities of Thermo Fisher s Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients   API   network This apart  the Brammer Bio deal also seems to work in the company s favor as this will likely expand opportunities in gene therapy and set a revised standard for viral vector manufacturing Strong End Market Growth  Thermo Fisher is experiencing strong growth in the pharma and biotech sector  Although in the last reported quarter  growth in industrial and applied segments was in low single digits  the company performed well due to strong demand for its chemical analysis  chromatography and mass spectrometry products  It also maintained its growth momentum in clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostic businesses  and also witnessed strong demand in its health care market channel Raised Guidance Buoys OptimismThermo Fisher

completed the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for  1 14 billion in cash in the second quarter  This sector was one of the major contributors to the company s revenues  The subsequent closure of this sector is expected to put pressure on Thermo Fisher s financials Competitive Landscape   On account of its diversified portfolio  Thermo Fisher faces competition from different types of companies   including a broad range of manufacturers and third party distributors  The competitive landscape is quite tough with changing technology and customer demand  which require continuous research and development Which Way Are Estimates Heading The estimate revision trend for the current year is impressive  Over the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus

137779,359294,TMO,Not All Health Care Stocks Are Created Equal  So Play It This Way,opinion,"Monday s health care stocks traded lower  Politicians on both sides of the isle have been very critical of drug prices and health care costs  You can easily see and expect more political criticism of the health care companies as the Democratic party tries to find a 2020 nominee  President Trump has also vowed to lower drug costs  so where do you invest in this diverse industry group 
Despite Monday s declines in most of the major health care stocks  the overall chart pattern of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLV  is still looking good on the charts  This leading health care ETF holds companies such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   Merck   Company  NYSE MRK   Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   Medtronic  NYSE MDT   Thermo Fisher Scientific  NYSE TMO   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  and Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   This ETF is fairly diverse and is still showing a decent chart pattern on the bigger time frames  At this point  XLV is trading above its 50  and 200 day moving averages  As long as it remains above these key levels  this ETF continues to be in good shape  If a major decline happens in XLV  there should be major chart support around the  86 00 area  This is where the ETF was defended in mid April 2019 and would likely be support again if retested 
The bottom line is that health care stocks have become very difficult to trade and invest in on an individual basis lately  The best way to play the broad based industry group is likely through an ETF like the XLV  which gives you diversity to the sector and holds some of the best companies in the world  Should the equity trade sideways or even lower  it pays a 1 6  dividend while you wait for some appreciation to occur ",2019-07-08,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-all-health-care-stocks-are-created-equal-so-play-it-this-way-200437794,200437794
137780,359295,TMO,Thermo Fisher Scientific  TMO  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Thermo Fisher Scientific  TMO  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 5  
Revenues are expected to be  6 32 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Thermo Fisher 
For Thermo Fisher  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 54  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Thermo Fisher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Thermo Fisher would post earnings of  2 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 81  delivering a surprise of  2 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Thermo Fisher appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thermo-fisher-scientific-tmo-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440754,200440754

What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 9 estimates have gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if TMO stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development  You can see

 In this context  the S P 500 Health Care index has returned 3 8  in comparison to around 16  of the broader S P 500 index Moreover  the has returned 4 3  year to date  underperforming the S P 500 index  Let s take a closer look at the factors that have been making it a bumpy year for the healthcare sector Trade War FiascoThe healthcare market is faced with short term hurdles related to the U S  China trade tensions  According to a survey conducted by the   the tariffs will cost medical product companies nearly  138 million every year Companies will be compelled to reduce workforce and investments in R D to meet this  new and unnecessary expense   This also raises the chances of costs being passed on to end users  making healthcare more expensive Moreover  the U S  pharmaceutical industry has been hurt by rising raw material costs  Trump s levying of trade related tariffs on China has proved to be rather counterproductive for many industries which might make things worse for the healthcare industry Cyber Security RisksAs data management is an integral part of the healthcare system  protecting it is necessary  A by KPMG revealed that around 81  of health care organizations experienced data breach in two years starting 2015 end  Going by the same source  medical device threats are ranked as a top information security issue by around one third of industry executives For instance  last April  the FDA had to issue a  to inform patients about the availability of an additional firmware update to combat cybersecurity risks discovered in Abbott Laboratories  implantable cardiac product and manage rapid battery depletion Regulatory HurdlesStringent regulations have been troubling for players in the healthcare space  Government scrutiny of high drug prices  unfavorable reimbursement mix and Unique Device Identification  UDI  system by the FDA are some of the hurdles  Adding to the woes  the medical device tax repeal amendment is just temporary  The tax will be back in effect starting Jan 1  2020 Other issues like a soft global economy  unfavorable health insurance policies  pricing pressure  escalating brand competition  a slowdown in legacy products and major

For Thermo Fisher  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Thermo Fisher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Thermo Fisher would post earnings of  3 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 25  delivering a surprise of  1 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

When looking at the last two reports  this maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 2 31   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Thermo Fisher was expected to post earnings of  3 19 per share  but it reported  3 25 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 88   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 55 per share  while it actually produced  2 62 per share  a surprise of 2 75  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Thermo Fisher lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

Valuation Metrics
Thermo Fisher may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style

137883,359398,TMO,Thermo Fisher Scientific  TMO  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Thermo Fisher Scientific  TMO  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 3  
Revenues are expected to be  6 24 billion  up 3 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 35  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Thermo Fisher

On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Thermo Fisher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Thermo Fisher would post earnings of  2 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 62  delivering a surprise of  2 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line

Reported earnings for the quarter came in at 32 cents per share  as compared to the year ago loss of 24 cents per share 
Third quarter worldwide sales came in at  6 83 billion  up 28 8  year over year on a reported basis  This quarterly figure also remains slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 71 billion Abbott Laboratories Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   On a comparable operational basis  adjusting the impact of foreign exchange  certain acquisitions and divestments   sales increased 5 6  year over year in the reported quarter 
Quarter in Detail
Abbott operates through four segments   Established Pharmaceuticals Division  EPD   Medical Devices  Nutrition and Diagnostics 
EPD sales were up 15 7  on a reported basis  up 14 3  on comparable operational basis  to  1 171 billion  There was a positive impact of 1 4  on the back of currency fluctuations  Sales in key emerging markets increased 18 5   up 18    driven by double digit growth in Brazil  Russia  India and China  As expected  sales in India were positively impacted by purchasing patterns following the implementation of a new Goods and Services Tax system that lowered second quarter sales in that country 
The Medical Devices business sales spiked 98 2  on a reported basis to  2 59 billion  On a comparable operational basis  sales increased 5 6  
Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sales soared 214 1  on a reported basis  up 3 6  on comparable operational basis  on double digit growth in Electrophysiology  Structural Heart  Heart Failure and Neuromodulation 
Vascular product sales growth however  was sluggish at 0 2  on a on a comparable operational basis  Within Rhythm Management  the company registered a loss of 12 1  on a comparable operational basis as sales in the U S  were impacted by continued competitive dynamics in the magnetic resonance  MR  conditional category of products 
Diabetes Care sales improved 19 1  on a comparable operational basis  driven by double digit international sales growth  led by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre   the revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system of Abbott

Guidance
Abbott has narrowed down its full year 2017 guidance  Adjusting for certain net specified items for the full year  the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to stay within a band of  2 48  2 50  earlier guidance was  2 43  2 53   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 49  at the midpoint of the projected range 
The company has also provided its fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance  It expects to report adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of 72 cents to 74 cents for the quarter  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents falls at the midpoint of the projected range 
Our Take
One more time  Abbott has successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front  We are optimistic about the company s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance  However  these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business 
The company continues to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St  Jude Medical  which has started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular  neuromodulation  diabetes and vision care 
In 2017  the company is effectively executing its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas  Also  emerging market performance remains extremely promising on several new strategic developments 
Abbott currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

Adjusted EPS in the reported quarter excluded charges related to restructuring and integration  retirement of debt  gain on disposition of business as well as amortization expenses  The reported EPS came in at  1 15  a 14 2  slip from the year ago quarter figure 
Reported revenues in the third quarter inched up 2 4  year over year to  1 93 billion  The quarter s number however remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  According to the company  in spite of weather challenges  the year over year improvement came on the back of successful execution of its two point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

    
Volume  measured by the number of requisitions  increased 1 6  year over year in the third quarter  Also  revenue per requisition increased 1 2   Diagnostic information services revenues in the quarter rose 2 8  on a year over year basis to  1 85 billion 
Cost of services during the reported quarter was  1 19 billion  up 2 9  year over year  Gross margin came in at 38 4   reflecting a 25 basis points  bps  contraction year over year 
Among the operating expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses increased 3 4  to  423 million in the reported quarter  Accordingly  adjusted operating margin showed an contraction of 45 bps to 16 5  
Quest Diagnostics exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  350 million  which marked an 11 5  rise from the preceding quarter  Year to date net cash provided by operating activities was  852 million  compared with  765 million in the year ago period 
In the third quarter  the company repurchased 0 6 million shares for  65 million  As of Sep 30  2017  Quest Diagnostics was left with  1 billion of authorization under the previous share repurchase plan 
Outlook
Considering the impact of hurricanes in the third quarter  especially on the company s operations in Florida  Texas and Puerto Rico  as well as recently closed acquisitions  Quest Diagnostics has updated its full year 2017 guidance 
The company now expects full year reported revenues of approximately  7 71 billion  annualized growth of approximately 3   as compared to the earlier stated range of  7 69 billion to  7 74 billion  annualized growth of 2 6 3 4    The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  7 69 billion  lower than the company s projected number 
In addition  the upper end of the company s earlier provided 2017 adjusted EPS range has been reduced  Currently Quest Diagnostics expects earnings for the full year to remain in the band of  5 62  5 67 from earlier forecast of  5 62  5 72  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 63 falls within but near to the lower end of the projected band 
Operating cash flow for 2017 is expected at around  1 2 billion  unchanged from the previous guidance  The current estimates for capital expenditure are pegged at  250  300 million  unchanged  
Our Take
Quest Diagnostics  third quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while revenues remained in line with the same  On a positive note  the company is currently refocusing on its core diagnostic information services business and working on disciplined capital deployment  We are also highly optimistic about the company s focus on its two point strategy 
The company s several new collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers  We are currently looking forward to the company s recently announced strategic relationship with Cleveland Clinic which includes the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab 
On the flip side  Quest Diagnostics faced major sales disruption due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas  where the company has a significant presence  Also hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the earthquake in Mexico affected Quest Diagnostics  overall performance in the reported quarter  With this the company has to reduce the upper end of its earlier provided full year earnings guidance range  which is disappointing 
Notably  the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule  CLFS   It is currently requesting CMS to delay the implementation of PAMA  Protecting Access to Medicare Act

138092,359607,TMO,MedTech Players Eyeing Emerging Market Growth Opportunities ,opinion,"A few months down the line  the Republicans will complete a full year in power  Unfortunately  since the political power change  the healthcare community hasn t had many opportunities to rejoice 
A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that  U S  adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration  In fact  the debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare has been raging for a while now  Per the report  it peaked when it reached the Congress in August  Considering the prevailing uncertainty in the implementation of the health policy  any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely 
MedTech in the United States  A Blurred Picture
Needless to say  the current crisis  in the U S  MedTech industry  an integral part of the broader healthcare space  shows no signs of abating  A few months back  companies  in the space were hopeful about the promised cancellation of the 2 3  MedTech tax of Obamacare under the new government  Unquestionably  the latest political developments have landed the MedTech space in an uncertain territory 
Investors are mulling over whether they should retain their existing MedTech stocks or forego their holdings  in favor of companies in other industries to boost their financial resources  That said  in spite of what the future may hold  we believe investors should stick to the MedTech space as it has shown signs of prosperity in recent times globally 
Yes  you read that right  Even considering the dull performance of the U S  medical device market  that still holds the leading position with almost one third of the world market share  on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty  global growth has been quite encouraging  In 2016  this industry grew 5   a pace last seen before the financial crisis 
Emerging Markets Hold Immense Promise
The uncertainty in the United States along with the worsening economic condition in Europe automatically shifted the focus to emerging geographies like China  India  Latin America and others 
These emerging economies are seeing  a rise in the uptake of medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity  An aging population  increasing wealth  government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players  Add to it  rising healthcare spending and improving healthcare infrastructure  this growth should continue in 2017 and beyond 
Going by a recent BCG report  the share of emerging markets  which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues  is likely to increase to nearly one third of revenues by 2022  The MedTech market in China  currently the second largest in the world  is projected to grow about 13  annually from 2015 through 2022  India s Medtech market  the fifth largest in the world  is currently demonstrating 17  annual growth  If this continues  India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022 
Among other emerging geographies  Latin America  even in the face of general economic stagnation  holds enormous potential  Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence  the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare in the period between 2008 and 2014  According to World Bank data  Guatemala increased spending by 27   Brazil 31   Chile 54   Colombia 58   Uruguay 95   Paraguay 115   Bolivia 138   and Ecuador 139   Lower domestic production in Latin America has made it as an open market for U S  exporters  
Investment in Emerging Market Players Looks Sensible
In such a scenario  we believe it will be wise of investors who are keen on MedTech stocks to keep an eye on companies who have turned the emerging markets into a happy hunting ground with their expertise and network  No wonder  these stocks  cashing in on the enormous growth potential of these emerging geographies have perfectly shielded themselves from the political turmoil within the United States 
Let us look at a few MedTech players with significant emerging market presence 
Given the huge potential in these regions  long back  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   had set up manufacturing and R D centers in Brazil  China and India  The company s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets  It has been doing business in China for nearly 30 years and is expanding further here on the back of the Synthes acquisition  Johnson   Johnson Price and Consensus

    
Abbott   NYSE ABT   continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In recent quarters  sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits  driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America  including Colombia  Mexico  Peru and Argentina Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus

    
At Medtronic   NYSE MDT    in the last reported first quarter of fiscal 2017  businesses in China  Latin America  and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength  growing in double digits  Overall  Medtronic remains confident about its long term outlook for emerging markets  The company is focused on developing new public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies Medtronic PLC Price and Consensus

    
Boston Scientific s   NYSE BSX   emerging markets business registered 14  organic growth in second quarter 2017  a significant increase from 8  growth in 2013  Business in China was once again remarkable  up 20  year over year   The company is currently looking forward to much better performance ahead in China  banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY in China Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus

    
Thermo Fisher   NYSE TMO   too is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence in emerging markets  The company garnered 20  of total revenue from the high growth Asia Pacific and emerging markets in 2016 from 10  in 2006 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and Consensus

for Assured GrowthWhile rising yields have somewhat dulled the appeal for dividend investing  stocks that consistently pay higher dividends are still in vogue     Dividend Growth in FocusStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe  Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market

138122,359637,TMO,4 Momentum Stocks That May Survive The Health Policy Mess,opinion,"The future of the U S  healthcare space is mired in uncertainty with President Trump s efforts to revoke the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare falling flat  This is despite the fact that the Republicans are going all out to end the policy fiasco  The investment world is equally baffled 
Chances of Stability Anytime Soon 
The majority of the healthcare space has heaved a sigh of relief with the recent failure of the Graham Cassidy bill  thanks to the Congressional Budget Office s  CBO  latest  warning report  that anticipated health coverage loss for millions of Americans due to  1 trillion in reduction in federal spending on Medicaid through 2026 
Per the report  there will be considerable decrease in the number of people enrolling in Medicaid in this period for three primary reasons    the expansion of the program established by the ACA would be repealed starting in 2020  federal reimbursement to states for Medicaid would be capped on a per en rollee basis beginning in 2020  and the individual mandate penalty  which induces some people to enroll in Medicaid  would be repealed upon the legislation s enactment  
Although the President s latest action plan indicates that the respite from Graham Cassidy failure is short lived  one thing is pretty clear from the entire pandemonium  Any effort to bring about a major change in the existing health insurance policy may again turn out to be futile for the Republicans 
This is because  in their undying effort to fully repeal and replace Obamacare  the Republicans have never achieved a 60 40 majority  Among the related articles doing the rounds  a report by Kimberly Amadeo published in The Balance states that  Trump wanted Congress to replace the Affordable Care Act of 2010 before September 30  2017  That s the last day Senate Republicans could pass the bill with just a 51 vote majority  That includes Vice President Mike Pence casting the final vote  But they never got the votes  
While economists are once again dissecting all the facts trying to come out with probable ways in which the ruling party can turn around  it is hard for investors keen on the medical space to settle for an investment strategy that can earn them a concrete pay 
Investing Strategy to Bet On
Amid such political conundrum  while pondering on several investment mantras  the majority of investors prefer to bet on stocks  which have ability to brave the situation with their rock solid fundamentals  However  sometimes thinking out of the box can create wonders  And we find it more logical to ask investors to consider investment options that are not dependent on the political twists and turns 
We are talking about momentum investing  We believe that investors can earn handsome profits by extrapolating the current bullish trends of the market into the future  Banking on momentum investment strategy can be worthwhile at this moment 
However  picking the right momentum stocks may be a challenging task for even seasoned investors  who are planning to enter the uncharted world of jam packed trades

    On a positive note  with a strong market position in several geographies  including China  Latin America and several markets in Southeast Asia  EPD is well positioned for sustained above market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world Abbott initiated the implementation of its operational model within the EPD space in the first quarter  as planned  Per the model  the company will focus on selling its highly diversified line of products in core therapeutic areas to treat local health conditions  This in turn will allow the company to widen its customer base by creating unique relationship with physicians  retailers and pharmacies  Also  Abbott plans to strengthen its developmental capabilities by expanding its EPD innovation center in India There have been a slew of developments within medical device as well  The market is upbeat about Abbott s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System prospects post the receipt of full or partial reimbursement by the French Health Ministry in May 2017 At this platform  the company also announced Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre in Jun 2017 Notably  all these developments are expected to drive the company s traction in the Diabetes Care segment  which saw sales growth of 20 2  in the last reported quarter on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally This apart  the market is bullish on Abbott s Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor after it received CE Mark in May 2017   Post approval  the product has seen strong consumer acceptance with implants taking place in 10 countries across Europe  In May 2017  the company announced CE Mark for its Tacticath Contact Force Ablation Catheter which is another key positive Continuing with its trend of extensive research and new product developmet  the company  launched two science based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries   Ensure Surgery Immunonutrition Shake and EnsurePre  Surgery Clear Nutrition Drink   in Apr 2017 We are also bullish about the ongoing synergies from the acquisition of St  Jude Medical on Jan 4  The comprehensive combined portfolio is quite promising  Notably  Abbott projects annual pre tax synergies of  500 million by 2020  including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG A efficiencies Overall  for the second quarter of 2017  the company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 59 cents to 61 cents  Comparable operational sales growth for the quarter is projected in low to mid single digits Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Abbott is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP   Earnings ESP for Abbott is 0 00  since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 60 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Abbott has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter   Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc    NYSE TMO   has an Earnings ESP of 0 44  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Dextera Surgical Inc    NASDAQ DXTR   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  2 Telefex Incorporated   NYSE TFX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 06  and a Zacks Rank  2 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies                                                It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively        And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2017-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-abbott-laboratories-(abt)-pull-a-surprise-in-q2-earnings-200201538,200201538
138214,359729,TMO,Will Thermo Fisher s  TMO  Q2 Earnings Surpass Expectations ,opinion,"Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc    NYSE TMO    the MA based medical instruments manufacturer  is expected to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26  before the market opens Last quarter  the company posted earnings of  2 08 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3   In fact  Thermo Fisher s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 2 3   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Why a Likely Positive Surprise   Our proven model shows that Thermo Fisher is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  Zacks ESP   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 44   This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Thermo Fisher currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates  The Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement   The combination of Thermo Fisher s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat this time around  What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings  The company s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging  These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the first quarter The company has already spent  750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is expected through this year too  Some recently introduced noteworthy products include its new iCAP triple quad mass spec system for clinical research in pharma Quality Assurance  Quality Control  mass spectrometry and chromotography platforms   cloud based application that connects electronic pipettes among individual users in the laboratories  within laboratory products   CarrierScan Assay  a microarray based solution detecting over 6 000 genomic variations associated with 600 inherited diseases  within Genetic Sciences  It also introduced new targeted assays for cancer research that run on Ion Torrent Next Generation Sequencing instruments  new tests for autoimmune disease and drugs of abuse  and new Clariom Pico assays for more effective biomarker discovery  Notably last month  the US FDA had granted a premarket approval for the company s Oncomine Dx Target Test  We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company s top line in the second quarter itself The company s aim to expand capabilities in the fast growing Asia Pacific zone as well as emerging markets should also lead to impressive results  Standout contributors in recent times are China  India and South Korea  With strategic investments to support key customer applications  Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum throughout the rest of 2017 Growth is likely to be seen in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science  This apart  the company is currently betting on some key focus areas with enormous opportunities  These are advancing precision medicine from mass spectrometry to targeted gene sequencing and structural biology  The acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to the company s analytical instruments portfolio from last quarter  It is also the highlight of the quarter to be reported Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately  80 million by the end of three years following the deal closure  with about  55 million of cost synergies and roughly  25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue related synergies  This should get reflected in second quarter 2017 performance However  we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind to the tune of  250 million on 2017 revenues  an impact of 1 5   and 17 cents on adjusted EPS  around 2    Also  an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on Thermo Fisher s stock  Plus  stiff competition continues to pose a threat to the stock s value Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter Dextera Surgical Inc    NASDAQ DXTR   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see Teleflex Incorporated   NYSE TFX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 06  and a Zacks Rank  2 Stryker Corporation   NYSE SYK   has an Earnings ESP of  0 66  and a Zacks Rank  2 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-thermo-fisher's-(tmo)-q2-earnings-surpass-expectations-200201805,200201805
138215,359730,TMO,What s In Store For Athenahealth  ATHN  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"athenahealth Inc    NASDAQ ATHN   is set to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 20  Last quarter  the company posted earnings of 10 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents 
On an average  athenahealth beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 12 66  over the last four quarters 
Let s take a look at how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
We believe a strong product portfolio and expanding physician base will continue to drive athenahealth s top line  Applications like athenaClinicals  athenaClinicals Streamlined  athenaInsight  athenaCommunicator  athenaOne and athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems are fortifying its market position 
However  on the flip side  lack of enterprise sized deals  winding up of government funded stimulus and increasing competition in the Healthcare IT market are major dampeners  For fiscal 2017  the company expects revenues in the band of  1 210  1 250 million  Adjusted operating income is projected in the range of  120  140 million  Annual bookings are expected at around  350  400 million 
The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether athenahealth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is seven cents  reflecting a year over year increase of 16 7   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  298 5 million  up 14 0  from the year ago quarter athenahealth  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Earnings Whispers  
Our proven model does not conclusively show that athenahealth is likely to beat on earnings in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  athenahealth s Earnings ESP is 0 00  since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 7 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  athenahealth has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Also  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter   
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc    NYSE TMO   has an Earnings ESP of 0 44  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Dextera Surgical Inc    NASDAQ DXTR   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 
Telefex Inc    NYSE TFX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 06  and holds a Zacks Rank  2

5 GARP Stocks to Buy Now

	Growth at a reasonable price  or GARP  provides an excellent opportunity for investors who are interested in deriving healthy returns  Investors following GARP seek to acquire stocks that have solid growth prospects but are available at discounted prices  Unlike a blend strategy  a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing 

GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics

Growth Metrics

	Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  they choose stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy 

	Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flows get precedence in GARP investing 

Value Metrics

	GARP investing gives precedence to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style chooses stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  they avoid picking companies with extremely high P E ratios 

	Moreover  price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered in GARP investing 

	Using GARP principles  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer good returns in the near term 

Screening Parameters

	Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section  we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable 

  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2
	 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  

	  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20  
	 Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  

	  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average 
	 Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  

	  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average 
	 P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  

	Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only five 

	Here are the five stocks that made it through the screen 

Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc   NYSE      provides analytical instruments  equipment  reagents and consumables  software  and services for research  manufacturing  analysis  discovery  and diagnostics  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 2 1

5 GARP Stocks Well Positioned to Provide Impressive Yields

	Stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are undervalued may prove to be one of the best investment options in the equity market  The strategy of finding stocks on the basis of the above criteria is widely known as growth at a reasonable price or GARP  This strategy is particularly profitable in markets that are witnessing a strong rebound after a massive slump 

	However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy seeks to invest in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock 

Key Features of GARP

	The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing  While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio  they also use earnings per share  EPS  growth rates and return on equity  ROE  like growth investors to identify potential stocks  However  the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors 

	While value investors look for an extremely low P E ratio to choose a company  the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry average  Meanwhile  GARP investing chooses stocks with P B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors 

	Separately  investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates  Companies that qualify GARP investing are believed to have past as well as expected growth rates over the next few years between 10  and 20  

	Another metric  which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing  is return on equity  ROE   Like growth investors  the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry average 

Screening Parameters

	Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section  we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable 

  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2
	 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  

	  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20  
	 Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  

	  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average 
	 Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  

	  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average 
	 P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  

	Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only five 

	Here are the five stocks that made it through the screen 

AngioDynamics Inc    NASDAQ      is a leading provider of innovative medical devices used by interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons and other physicians  It has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 16 2  and sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

138292,359807,TMO,Thermo Fisher  TMO  Q2 Earnings  Surprise In Store ,opinion,"Massachusetts based medical instruments manufacturer  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc    NYSE TMO   is scheduled to report its second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Jul 28  Last quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 3 45   The four quarter trailing average beat is pegged at 1 96   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
After a solid start  Thermo Fisher is looking forward to continue this momentum for the rest of 2016 as well  However  while it is encouraging to note that the company still expects 4  organic growth for the full year 2016  we are apprehensive as the tough organic growth comp expected in the second quarter may drag the overall result down 
However  in bioproduction and biosciences businesses  we anticipate a strong and consistent growth even in the second quarter 2016  Strong productivity and incremental cost synergies are projected to further improve operational efficiencies down the line 
We currently await the integration and expected synergy of Affimetrix  the recently completed mega acquisition by Thermo Fisher  which is expected to enhance its offering in the fast growing flow cytometry market through an advanced antibody portfolio  This should be evident from the second quarter itself 
With respect to Life Technologies synergy  per the company  it is on track to deliver revenue and cost synergy targets  By the end of 2015  the company realized  130 million of incremental cost synergies  in line with its full year target  Revenue synergies at 2015 end were  90 million  much faster than anticipated  This puts Thermo Fisher in a comfortable position to achieve its full year 2016 targeted synergy of delivering  150 million in revenue 
Apart from the Life Technologies integration  we are also focusing on the company s growth strategies in emerging markets  The company expects to garner 25  of total revenue from the high growth Asia Pacific and emerging markets by 2016 from 19  in 2011  10  in 2006   Thermo Fisher s expanding presence in emerging markets will continue to be an key catalyst for growth in the second quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Thermo Fisher is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Thermo Fisher s Earnings ESP is 0 00   since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  2 00 
Zacks Rank  Thermo Fisher has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  a breakeven ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions
