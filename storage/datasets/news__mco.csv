14866,236381,MCO,Moody s flips positive on Delta,news,"Moody s Ratings affirms the senior unsecured rating on Delta Air Lines  DAL  0 6   of Baa3 and shifts its outlook to Positive from Stable 
 Moody s expects 2020 will be another strong year for Delta s operating performance  Steady cash generation and sustaining margins and debt related credit metrics near current levels in light of potential pressure on industry fundamentals from geo political and or global macro conditions would support a ratings upgrade  
The ratings agency says the positive outlook on Delta anticipates sustained reliability of operations  and competitive operating margin and free cash flow over the cycle 
 Moody s expects little reduction of funded debt as investment in the fleet and airport facilities increases and share repurchases remain a priority in upcoming years  The outlook reflects Moody s expectation that the US airlines will continue to emphasize earning acceptable returns on invested capital  which will lead to capacity reductions and cost management when economic growth slows  ",2020-01-15,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/pih5s,2060349

Top Stock Reports for Chevron  HSBC and Sanofi
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  HSBC Holdings and Sanofi  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Chevron s shares have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry year to date   12 1  vs   0 2    The Zacks analyst believes that Chevron s well economics in the Permian also continues to show improvement as the company has been able to achieve a 40  reduction in its development and production costs since 2015 
The company s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting volume growth of around 4 7  in 2019 thanks to planned expansion in the Permian Basin 
However  the continued drop in Chevron s downstream segment earnings  partly attributable to a fall in domestic refined products sales margins  is a concern  In particular  Chevron s high profile Gorgon LNG development in Australia is suffering from mechanical issues that may restrict its ramp up 
Shares of HSBC have lost 12 9  in the past six months against Zacks Foreign Banks industry s rise of 0 3   The Zacks analyst believes that while the company s initiatives to improve market share in the U K  and China are likely to lead to an increase in expenses and hurt bottom line growth  these efforts will support financials over the long term 
Its third quarter 2019 results reflect lower revenues and rise in credit costs  Additionally  its initiatives to strengthen digital capabilities globally and improve operating efficiency through further restructuring actions will go a long way in supporting profitability 
However  slow economic growth in Europe  uncertainty over Brexit implications and weak loan demand are likely to continue hurting revenue growth  Given the dismal revenue growth assumptions  the company no longer expects to achieve its targeted return on tangible equity ratio next year 
Sanofi s shares have gained 7 1  over the past three months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s rise of 6 3   The Zacks analyst believes that Sanofi s Specialty Care segment is on a strong footing  particularly with the regular label expansion of Dupixent  
Dupixent is now annualizing at around  2 billion in sales after just around two years in the market and could prove to be key long term driver  The performance of the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare franchises also improved of late  Sanofi s R D pipeline is strong and it delivered impressive results with several positive data read outs and the achievement of regulatory milestones this year 
However  headwinds include weak performance of the Diabetes unit  generic competition for many drugs and slower than expected uptake of core products like Praluent 
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony and Moody s

 Vulnerability to extreme events related to sea level rise can also undermine investment and heighten susceptibility to event risk  by hindering the ability of governments to borrow to rebuild  increasing financial risks  raising external pressures  and or amplifying political risk as populations come under stress and institutional capacities are tested   Moody s says

107875,329390,MCO,European watchdog warns credit rating agencies over fees,news,"By Marc Jones
LONDON  Reuters    Europe s financial markets watchdog criticized top credit rating agencies like S P Global  N SPGI   Moody s  N MCO  and Fitch on Thursday  saying they were not providing enough clarity on the fees they charge 
The European Securities and Markets Authority  ESMA  said it was sometimes unable to understand the key elements of agencies  fee  schedules  and why they sometimes deviated from them or increased or cut their prices 
 ESMA has found that there are areas for significant improvement by both credit rating agencies  CRA  and trade repositories  TR  in their current fee practices   ESMA s chairman Steven Maijoor said 
He added the Paris based watchdog would give  supervisory priority to the issues identified  
It wants them to provide clearer explanations and transparency on the fee setting process as well as how sister companies that provide supplementary ratings related services  such as bulk provision of ratings data  set their prices 
ESMA said there was no apparent link between the fees that were charged and the costs involved in actually calculating and providing the rating 
In some cases there had also been triple digit price hikes by the affiliated companies with little obvious explanation 
 The ultimate aim is to ensure that customers know exactly what they are paying for   Maijoor said 
ESMA added it could provide agencies with  further supervisory guidance to ensure compliance with the relevant requirements  
The work so far has ESMA taken just over a year but it expects firms to start taking action to address its concerns this year and for it to continue next year

The Managing Director in charge of S P s Global Collateralized Debt Obligation group slowed the rollout of a new ratings model  pending further measures to deal with such negative results   noting that one investment bank has said the model would result in S P missing  potential business opportunities   according to the statement of facts agreed to under the settlement ",2015-02-03,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/s-amp;p-reaches-$1.5-billion-deal-with-u.s.,-states-over-crisis-era-ratings-326329",326329

107898,329413,MCO,Hong Kong court hears Moody s appeal over  red flags  report,news,"HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong s Court of Appeal on Wednesday began hearing Moody s  N MCO  appeal against a tribunal decision that partly upheld regulatory action imposed on it for a report on Chinese firms  in what is considered a landmark case for the financial center 
Moody s Investors Service Hong Kong said in April it would challenge a March 2016 ruling by the Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal  SFAT  upholding the securities regulator s claim that Moody s broke rules governing how regulated firms should behave when it published the report 
On Wednesday  Moody s reprised a key argument refuted by the tribunal  that the report did not constitute a credit rating or a preparation for a credit rating  and was therefore not within the Securities and Futures Commission  SFC  jurisdiction 
The SFAT determined last year that Moody s breached the SFC code of conduct through the publication of the July 2011 report that raised corporate governance concerns over 49 Chinese firms  contributing to a fall in their Hong Kong share prices 
The tribunal found the report did constitute a preparation for a credit rating and therefore came under the SFC s jurisdiction 
But Moody s on Wednesday contested the tribunal s findings  arguing that although the report discussed some specific elements relevant to a company s creditworthiness  namely corporate governance and accounting risks  the report s  red flags  framework was not ultimately used for  nor provided the basis for  evaluating a credit rating 
Moody s barrister Adrian Huggins opened the proceedings at the Hong Kong court on Wednesday arguing there must be a bright line  between regulated and non regulated activities 
 We need certainty about what is regulated  where we are regulated and where we are not  The line has been blurred unacceptably   he said 
The case has been closely watched by the financial industry and corporate governance activists  as it is likely to redefine the limits on what can be written in research reports on public companies  potentially curtailing the activities of research firms in the financial center ",2017-01-10,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/hong-kong-court-hears-moody's-appeal-over-""red-flags""-report-452352",452352

107912,329427,MCO,Is A Surprise In Store For Moody s  MCO  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Moody s   NYSE MCO   is slated to announce second quarter 2019 results on Jul 31  before the opening bell  The company is expected to report marginal rise in revenues in its Corporate Finance line  the largest revenue contributor at the Moody s Investors Service   MIS   division Relatively higher interest rates and several geopolitical concerns adversely impacted debt issuances in the to be reported quarter  The second quarter witnessed weakness in investment grade bond and leveraged loan issuance volumes  Nevertheless  high yield bond issuance volumes were healthy Thus  Corporate Finance revenues are expected to rise modestly  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  381 million for the to be reported quarter  indicating marginal growth from the year ago quarter s reported figure While the quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage backed securities remained healthy  collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities issuance volumes were weak  Therefore  Moody s will likely witness no change in Structured Finance revenues in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  142 million  stable year over year Further  MIS division s another revenue source   Financial Institutions   is anticipated to report revenues of  126 million  up 4 1  from the prior year quarter   Also  Public  Project and Infrastructure Finance unit revenues are likely to increase  The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at  110 million  indicating 1 9  growth from the year ago reported figure Overall  the MIS division is projected to witness a year over year decline in the top line  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division s revenues is  719 million  suggesting a 4 4  decline from the year ago quarter s reported number Other Factors at PlayMoody s Analytics   MA   division to support revenues  The company continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service  Given the rise in demand for analytics  all three business units at the MA division are expected to witness rise in revenues The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Professional Services  revenues is  47 50 million  indicating 27  rise from the year ago quarter s reported number  Also  the consensus estimate for Research  Data and Analytics revenues is  300 million  indicating rise of 7 1  year over year  Further  Enterprise Risk Solutions revenues are projected to be  111 million for the second quarter  suggesting 4 7  rise from the year ago quarter s reported number Thus  driven by growth in revenues in all three business units at the MA division  overall revenues for the division are expected to rise  The consensus estimate for revenues in the MA division is pegged at  468 million  indicating 10 6  growth year over year Expenses to remain high  Given Moody s inorganic growth efforts  acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high  Hence  overall expenses for the second quarter are likely to be elevated Here is what our quantitative model predicts Chances of Moody s beating the

107970,329485,MCO,Texas Capital s Ratings Affirmed By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,"Texas Capital Bancshares    NASDAQ TCBI   ratings have been recently affirmed by Moody s Investors Service  the rating arm of Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO    Moody s affirmed the company s standalone baseline credit assessment  BCA  at baa2  while its long term issuer rating is Baa3  The company s ratings outlook remains stable 
Long  and short term deposits of Texas Capital Bank  National Association   a subsidiary of Texas Capital Bancshares   are rated A3 Prime 2 
Factors Driving the Ratings
Texas Capital Bancshares  healthy financial performance and strong asset quality are the key reasons behind the ratings affirmation  Also  Moody s believes this upbeat trend to remain stable in the upcoming days despite higher credit losses and loan loss provisions 
The ratings also consider the company s comparatively weak capitalization  deposit funding profile and good operating efficiency 
Low capitalization is a key credit challenge for Texas Capital Bancshares  Since the company is more focused on loan growth  it has low capital deployment activities which help it manage its capital position better  Moody s anticipates Texas Capital Bancshares  capitalization to improve in 2019 as it intends to grow the company s loans at a higher rate than its peers  However  the rate of loan growth might be lower than the previous years 
Although Texas capital Bancshares  strong asset quality reflects good underwriting standards and effective risk management  Moody s considers its rapid loan growth and significant exposure toward commercial real estate to be risky  Hence  Moody s considers the company s decision to significantly lower its leveraged loan portfolio to be favorable  Also  its net charge off ratio is lower than other rated U S  banks 
Texas Capital Bancshares  considerable deposit base results in its low reliance on confidence sensitive market funding  Though the funding profile might weaken if the company loses a few important deposit relationships  it remains focused on improving deposit quality  Moody s expect this improvement to take time and is not guaranteed 
Texas Capital Bancshares  low cost structure supports its profitability  Since a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is exposed to floating rates related to short term LIBOR  its profitability was further supported by higher interest rates 
Factors That Might Trigger Change in Ratings
An upward ratings change may occur if the company is able to significantly improve capitalization and increase its deposit granularity while maintaining underwriting standards and a good asset quality 
Meanwhile  downward rating pressure could emerge if Moody s assess relaxation in the company s internal control or underwriting in its loan portfolio  Ratings may also be downgraded if capitalization improvement does not materialize as projected by Moody s

107999,329514,MCO,Elliott Wave Ahead Of MCO Stock Bullish Reversal,opinion,"A month and a half ago  Moodys  NYSE MCO  was trading below  137 a share  following a decline from as high as  188 in late July  2018  MCO stock was down by 27  in just five months and investors were getting overly pessimistic about its investment merits 
But instead of simply extrapolating the recent weakness into the future  we decided to examine MCO stock through an Elliott Wave perspective  The chart below  published in an article on December 21st  summed up our findings 

Moody s  4 hour chart revealed that a perfect impulsive decline has been in progress since the high of  188  The Elliott Wave theory postulates that a three wave correction in the opposite direction follows every impulse pattern  Hence  instead of joining the bears  we though MCO stock was poised for a bullish reversal near  130 
In addition  the MACD indicator revealed a bullish divergence between waves 3 and 5 of A  The anticipated recovery was supposed to reach the resistance area of wave 4 near  160  since there were no other major obstacles prior to this level 
MCO Stock Elliott Wave Update
Last week  MCO stock closed at  161 27  so it is time to take another look at the situation on the updated chart below 

So far so good  The Wave principle successfully warned us about a price reversal  just when the situation was looking the bleakest  However  the recovery from  129 to  161 doesn t look corrective  It appears to be another five wave sequence  labeled i ii iii iv v in wave  a  
This means wave B is not over yet and wave  c  can be expected to lift MCO stock to the area between the 61 8  and 78 6  Fibonacci ratios  But first  a three wave pullback in wave  b  of B should drag the price down to roughly  145 a share

108024,329539,MCO,Will Higher Revenues Aid American Express  AXP  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,American Express Company   NYSE AXP   is expected to report first quarter results on Apr 18  The performance is likely to reflect gains from its four strategic focus areas   strengthening leadership in the premium consumer segment  extending leadership in commercial payments and in particular with small and medium sized enterprises  enhancing its digital platform  and strengthening its global integrated network to provide unique value  Results should also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate Revenues in the to be reported quarter should see an upside from accelerated growth in billings and continued strong growth in loans and fees  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues net of interest expense are expected to be  8 5 billion  up 7 8  year over year The company has suspended its share buyback program for the first half of 2018  in an effort to build up capital  The bottom line will thus be bereft of the benefit of share buyback Factors Affecting Q1 ResultsGrowth in Billed Business  The first quarter should reflect an increase in worldwide billed business across its diverse customer segments and geographies  U S  proprietary consumer and international proprietary consumer billings growth should remain strong  The company saw strong performance from middle market and small business customers  while large and global commercial customers grew at a more modest pace  in the last quarter and the same should be seen in the first quarter  Global Network Services billed business should grow at a slower rate over the year than the proprietary business as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate card billed business is expected to be  275 billion  up 9 1  year over year Increase in Loan and Recievables  Card Member loan and receivables growth should be seen as the company continues to expand its relationship with existing customers and acquire new Card Members  This should have  however  led to an increase in provisions for losses  lending delinquencies and net write off rates  The increase in delinquencies and net write off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time toward non cobrand lending products  which have higher write off rates but also drive higher net interest yields Increase in Total Cards in Force  Total cards in force  which reflects the number of cards that are issued and outstanding  will likely increase in the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 116 million up 4 5  year over year Higher Spending on Card Member Engagement  Spending on rewards  Card Member services and marketing and promotion expenses should show an uptick due to recent enhancements to rewards on the company s U S  Platinum products  continued strong growth in its Delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of its premium services  American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise    Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively show that

108193,329708,MCO,Franklin s Ratings Affirmed By Moody s  Outlook Negative,opinion,"Moody s Investors Service  a rating arm of Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO    affirmed the ratings of Franklin Resources  Inc     NYSE BEN     It revised the company s rating outlook for senior unsecured debt from stable to negative  but affirmed the current rating at A1  The short term rating remains P 1 
Looking at Franklin s price performance  the stock has gained 11 7  over the last six months  outperforming the  industry s rally of 8 2   Will the negative rating outlook impact its performance going forward 
The estimate revisions trend witnessed so far doesn t indicate any hindrance The company has witnessed 5 9  upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings  in the last 60 days  As a result  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    

Reasons Behind the Affirmation
Decline in assets under management  AUM  and revenues have weakened the company s profile  Further  Moody s believe that the competitive position of Franklin has declined to moderate due to volatility in performance of key products  the challenge of rising market share of passive products and changes to the distributors on whom the company relies to sell its funds 
Though the company has taken initiatives to improve performance  the rating outlook of the company shall remain negative until there is some confidence about Franklin s organic growth of AUM  Moreover  changes in the regulations are likely to reduce the company s ability to persuade its intermediaries to promote sales of its products 
Franklin s low leverage and high cash coverage of debt support its A1 rating  Also  per Moody s  the company s leverage of 0 7 times EBITDA and tax effected cash position of four times its debt enable it to invest in performance improvement initiatives and new products 
What Could Make Moody s Change the Ratings 
Ratings are expected to remain at the current level if the company experiences better investment performance  resumes positive net flows and revenue less distribution costs of  5 billion is achieved  Also  ratings will remain unchanged if positive trend in revenues and margins is restored 
However  ratings can be lowered if Franklin fails to improve performance or the net flows remain low  Also  if revenue less distribution costs are below  4 5 billion and the revenues and margins remain under pressure  ratings can fall 
Factors to Support the Stock s Performance
Despite all the above concerns  Franklin s involvement in strategic acquisitions has enabled it to provide world class investment solutions to its clients  Also  its cost control measures have effectively reduced operating expenses in the last few years 
Further  the company s steady capital deployment activities continue to boost shareholders  confidence

108198,329713,MCO,Eaton Vance s Ratings Affirmed By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,"Moody s Investors Service  a rating arm of Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO    affirmed the ratings of Eaton Vance Corp    NYSE EV    The outlook for the company remained stable  Its long term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings are A3 while short term issuer rating is P 2 
Looking at Eaton Vance s price performance  the stock has gained 32 0  over the last one year  outperforming the  industry s rally of 20 2  
This price performance is backed by solid estimates revisions  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has been revised 8  upward  in the last 60 days  As a result  the stock sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  

Reasons Behind the Affirmation
The ratings consider the company s stability with regards to performance  despite changes in its asset mix  Though Eaton Vance witnessed higher assets under management  AUM  on a year over year basis  revenues remain under pressure due to increasing portion of assets managed by affiliate  Parametric 
Moody s ratings reflect the company s efforts to innovate new products and diversify product offerings that have encouraging growth prospects  Further  Eaton Vance s stabilized financial position and strong retail distribution presence also support the ratings 
Per Moody s  the company is gradually developing into a solutions oriented business  Moreover  given the underperformance of active asset managers in broad market indices  Eaton Vance s exposure management  custom beta  tax managed and ESG offerings allow it to be less dependent on investment outperformance 
The stable outlook reflects the rating agency s anticipation that the company will maintain its robust organic growth with its tax managed custom beta  exposure management businesses and a financial leverage ratio under 2 0x  per Moody s calculation  
What Could Change the Ratings 
The ratings can improve if Eaton Vance experiences higher earnings that lower the financial leverage ratio to 1 0x  per Moody s calculation  and expansion in margins due to growth in higher fee active strategies  Also  growth in organic AUM because of sooner than expected profitability of its investments in NextShares and global equity initiatives can trigger upward movement in ratings 
On the other hand  the ratings can fall if the financial leverage ratio goes above 2 0x  per Moody s calculation  due to lower earnings  reduced higher fee assets that create pressure on margins and lead to average pre tax income margin below 30   Higher reputational risk due to its exposure to liquid retail products investing in illiquid underlying assets can also lower ratings

The Baltimore  MD based asset manager posted a negative earnings surprise of 21 9  in third quarter fiscal 2017  The company reported net income of 50 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents  Higher expenses mainly affected the results  However  higher assets under management  AUM  and increased revenues were the tailwinds 
The company has a decent earnings surprise history as depicted in the chart below 
Legg Mason  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   The company s stock gained 20 7  in the quarter  ended Mar 31  compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s 4 6  growth 
Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model  we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Legg Mason in the upcoming results  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better for this to happen  which is not the case here as elaborated below 
 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are 63 cents 
Zacks Rank  Legg Mason s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat 
What to Expect from Fiscal Q4 Results
The quarter recorded a strong performance of equity markets  Among others  the S P 500 Index gained 4 3   As a result  the company is likely to record a rise in AUM 
Despite the uncertainties and market volatility that prevailed in the quarter  we expect Legg Mason s diversified nature of business to benefit  These conditions led to a surge in fixed income trading activities  indicating higher revenues 
On account of an improving interest rate environment  management expects fee waivers to be around  25 million in the quarter 
Notably  management projects performance fees to be in the range of  5  10 million  Further  acquisition and transition related expenses are expected to be in the range of  3  4 million in the to be reported quarter 
Notably  this investment manager s activities during the quarter were not enough to win analysts  confidence  The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable over the last seven days

108260,329775,MCO,What To Expect From Fidelity National s  FIS  Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Fidelity National Information Services  Inc    NYSE FIS   is set to release first quarter 2017 earnings results on May 2  before the opening bell 
In the last quarter  the company reported adjusted earnings per share of  1 14  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The results were driven by higher revenues  partially offset by increase in expenses 
Notably  Fidelity delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the prior four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 4  
Fidelity National Information Services  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   In the past six months  Fidelity s shares gained 13 1   outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s 10 6  growth 
Factors to Consider
Over the years  Fidelity strengthened its dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business  primarily based on its superior product portfolio 
The company s service revenues are likely to increase because of higher U S  debit as well as credit card payment volumes 
During the quarter  Fidelity completed the sale of its SunGard Public Sector and Education businesses to Vista Equity Partners for  850 million  The sale of the units is in line with its strategy to focus more on its core operations of providing software  technology and processing services to the retail and institutional banking  payments  and asset and wealth management sectors  The company intends to utilize the cash proceeds  net of taxes and deal related expenses  of  500 million for reducing its outstanding debt 
The company s focus on introducing new and innovative products in order to meet the growing demands of customers is likely to increase expenses  as witnessed in the past 
Earnings Whispers
According to our quantitative model  it is less likely that Fidelity will be able to beat earnings this time  This is because the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   for increasing its chances of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

108391,329906,MCO,Moody s  Canadian Banks Well Placed To Bear Housing Crisis,opinion,Home prices and household debt are shooting up in Canada and the effects indicate a housing crisis in the near term  While similar conditions faced by the U S  led to the 2008 financial crisis  the situation seems to be a bit better for the major Canadian banks  according to a report by Moody s Investors Service  the rating services arm of Moody s Corporation   NYSE MCO   Moody s Stress TestingMoody s conducted a stress test to determine the impact of a severe housing downturn on major Canadian banks  The assumptions made by the rating agency as part of the test included an event of an overall home price slump of 25  Also  the analysis comprised an additional 10  house price decline in Ontario and British Columbia  the regions which have experienced significant price appreciation over the past several years In such a scenario  total direct losses to the Canadian banking system would reach almost C 18 billion  However  Moody s said that the banks would be able to generate internal capital to cover losses within a few quarters  The majority of banks would be able to absorb losses within one quarter of earnings or  assuming the current average dividend payout ratio of 45 per cent  two quarters of retained earnings   the Moody s report stated   Therefore we believe that while a U S  severity mortgage event would lead to substantial losses  it would not threaten rated bank solvency  According to the Moody s severe stress scenario results  Royal Bank of Canada   NYSE RY   would suffer the biggest loss  while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce s   TO CM   capital level will be hurt the most due to its operational focus on Canadian retail lending Why Canadian Banks Are Relatively SafeThough the major Canadian banks will be affected like their U S  counterparts from the looming housing crisis  considerable structural differences between the Canadian and US mortgage markets denote that the impact will be less severe  The leading Canadian banks are expected to withstand the direct effects of a severe housing downturn without incurring any disastrous losses Moreover  the Canadian government guarantees majority of mortgage insurance through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation  which was lacking in the U S  at that time  Further  lower rates of risky subprime lending along with stronger lending practices mean that Canadian mortgages are of much higher quality than the U S  ones Also  banks do comparatively less securitization of mortgages in Canada  Further  legally mandated minimum down payments reduce the risk of collateral value declines in Canada  We believe several structural characteristics of the Canadian mortgage market  as well as macroprudential adjustments made by Canadian regulators following the U S  sub prime crisis  would help Canadian banks to weather the effects of a major housing shock   Moody s said Concerns PersistThe Bank of Canada recently warned that markets in Vancouver and Toronto are  unlikely to be sustained   while The Bank of Nova Scotia s   TO BNS   chief executive officer described house prices in both markets as  frothy   Moreover  the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development raised similar concerns about both market areas Also  Moody s warned about other risks still threatening the Canadian banks  These risks include doubled mortgage debt raising concerns of overvaluation and over extended borrowers  In the aftermath of the U S  mortgage crisis  many banks were forced to repurchase mortgages sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp   Freddie Mac  and the Federal National Mortgage Association  Fannie Mae  owing to inadequate origination documentation   Moody s said  We do not believe Canada is immune to such risk  in a stressed mortgage environment  mortgage insurers may increase claims rejection for purposes to preserve capital  and the political environment could prompt a shift of the risk sharing burden to the banks and away from taxpayers   Moody s further stated Our TakeThough Canada is exposed to certain risks  Moody s believes that Canadian lenders are better positioned to weather the imminent housing crisis given key differences with their U S  peers While the Canadian economy is still grappling with volatility in the energy sector  the strength in exports and consumer spending should continue to lend support  Additionally  the fiscal stimulus measures unveiled earlier this year by Canada s new Liberal government should aid growth prospects of the nation ,2016-06-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moody's:-canadian-banks-well-placed-to-bear-housing-crisis-200137648,200137648

Factors at PlaySecond quarter results will see the impact of a stronger U S  dollar  We also expect to see healthy loan growth and favorable credit performance in the quarter The bottom line will  gain from a reduction in operating expenses as the estimated  1 billion gain on the Costco  NASDAQ COST  portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses Earnings will  however  suffer from a higher level of investment spending and modest restructuring charge  Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remain headwinds for both the Global Corporate segment and U S  consumer segments 
Revenues for the second quarter will expectedly grow on an increase in interest income from strong loan growth  and higher card fees from its U S  Delta  Platinum and Gold portfolios  Revenue growth  however  may see a dent from higher cash rebate rewards  and incentives that the company pays to both its co brand partners and clients The company will also incur restructuring charges to reduce costs  In the first quarter  the company incurred  84 million in restructuring charges A strong balance sheet will enable the company to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders via share buyback  which in turn will lift the bottom line  But will this translate into an earnings beat Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AmEx is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But this is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  The Most Accurate estimate of AmEX is pegged at  1 92 per share  a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The Earnings ESP is thus  0 52  Zacks Rank  AmEx carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult

108442,329957,MCO,The Spin Off Anomaly ,opinion,The straightforward strategy of buying companies that have recently been spun off from their parent has generated very good results  Here s the performance of the Bloomberg Spin Off index    since 2003  As you can see  it s pretty good  a 15  annualized return vs a 6  for the S P500 over that period  Volatility was higher but not extremely so  20  vs  15    while the beta was pretty close to 1 0 Is this a crazy recent phenomenon  No  In 2003  looked at 311 spinoffs undertaken by 267 parents between January 1965 and December 2000  On average  subsidiaries outperformed their benchmark companies by over 20  over the first three years following the spinoffs  with most of the excess returns within the first 12 months of trading  They found the parent company outperformed as well  but not by a robust amount  I don t think there s a rational explanation for this  I remember at Moody s when they just spun off from Dunn  Bradstreet  it was really liberating  For years D B had used the considerable Moody s cashflow to fund their dumb ideas to extend D B  which really ran the executive board while Moody s made all the money  It was a classic waste of shareholder money  and so when the spin off finally happened in 2000  Moody s  MCO  stopped burning its cash and investors reaped the windfall  32  return  annualized  from 2000 present   It s amazing how much money is wasted via such politics  but it s a classic case of a bad incentives and difficult monitoring  It makes one wonder about the value potential in Citi  C   If someone could force it to sell itself into pieces  I bet everyone with defensible interests would hit a home run  Letting a  120B company underperform is really painful to behold  The only people such behemoths serve now are a select bunch of executives and politicians  not shareholders  consumers  or 99 99  of Citi employees ,2013-02-26,Eric Falkenstein,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-spin-off-anomaly-156707,156707
108448,329963,MCO,Q2  2013  Earnings Growth Should Be Decent at  5    7 ,opinion,Per ThomsonReuter s   This Week in Earnings   the  forward 4 quarter estimate  for the S P 500 earnings is now  113 14  down  0 16 from last week s  113 30  The P E ratio on the forward estimate is now 14 x   The  earnings yield  remains over 7  closing at 7 04  as of Friday  June 28th   If you wonder why  earnings yield  matters  compare the 7 04  S P 500 earnings yield to the 2 5  yield on the 10 year Treasury  and think  Fed Model    The year over year growth of the forward estimate continued to tick higher at 5 21  This coming week  when we get turn the calendar into July  the  forward 4 quarter  estimate should jump to the  117    118 neighborhood  Each quarter  as we end the current quarter and lap into the next quarter  and given the upward bias to the forward estimate  we see a  3    4 increase in the forward estimate  Here is the historical pattern looking back 15 months  June 28   13  July 5   13   113 14 and   14 x  and   Mar 29  13  Apr 5   13   111 84 and  115 25  14 x  and 14 x  Dec 28  12  Jan 4  13   108 83 and  113 88  13 x  and 13 x  Sep 28  12 Oct 5  12   107 89 and  112 26  13 x

forward estimate as one quarters falls off and another is added  but also the prevailing P E ratio s for the market as we roll into each quarter  A lot of pundits have said the S P 500 s rally this year is  P E expansion  driven  which isn t entirely inaccurate  Earnings growth has been the main driver in our opinion  with modest P E expansion at critical points  With 498 of the 500 S P 500 companies having reported  actual year over year earnings growth for Q1  13 was  5 4  versus an estimate on April 1 of 1 5   Revenue growth was flat in Q1  13  and continues to be a concern  Q2  13 earnings growth is currently projected at  3   which is actually a little higher than the q3  12  q4  12 and q1  13 initially projected as those respective quarters started  the initial estimate was flat to 1 5  as each of those quarters began  Financials and Telco continue to lead the expectations for Q2  13 with  17 8  and  18 2  sector earnings growth respectively  Here is the progression for each of these sectors since Jan 1   13  Apr 1   13 and June 28  13  Financials   19 2    17 6  and  17 8   If Investment Banks and Diversified Finance are removed  then y y growth for Financials is 11 3   still much better than the Sp 500 as a whole   Telco  15 7   13 4  and 18 2  Telco sector earnings expectations have actually gained strength in the quarter  while Financial sector earnings growth has remained steady since April 1   13  Our assumption is that q2  13 S P 500 actual earnings growth will come in at  5    7  for the quarter  when the majority of earnings reports are concluded by mid August  13  Another assumption we have is that either the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2013 will see 10  year over year earnings growth for the S P 500  Our final assumption is that Financial sector earnings growth will come in quite nicely for Q2  13 and be up at least 20  to 25  for full year 2013  versus the current full year 2013 estimate of  18   Best Q2  13 sectors  Financials  Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare  as measured by the SPDR ETFs  The SPDR Gold Shares ETF  GLD  was down a whopping 22  in the 2nd quarter  and 26  YTD   No exposure in GLD  still overweight Financials   Most bond   fixed  income ETFs are down high single digits year to date  despite the screaming  Not too bad  yet   We sold a chunk of our gold at  1 650 and then near  1 600   in terms of how it was trading vis a vis other asset classes  The 60    40  balanced portfolio  Afound on Norm Conley s   Jag Norm  s Twitter feed on how the 60    40  balanced portfolio is doing of late  We had a good 2nd quarter for clients after running some numbers late Friday night  Our bond short via the ProShares Short 20  Year Treasury ETF  TBF  helped nicely in balanced accounts   Overweight equities in the 60    40  standard portfolio  which implies a 65    70  weighting  depending on the client   Credit Quality and High yield  In terms of credit quality and credit trends in the US corporate bond markets  Christina Padgett  a Moody s  MCO  Senior Vice President  published a research note this week stating that the number of B3 rated companies grew to 160 companies  but this relatively low number continues to reflect  overall stable credit conditions for US speculative grade companies   As a former credit analyst before moving over to the dark side  i e  equities   my own opinion is that the rating agencies are still in shock over the 2001   2002 Recession  where Worldcom defaulted thanks to massive fraud   and then the 2008 Financial   Mortgage Crisis  both seismic events which resulted in a massive re thinking of the credit rating methodology  As a credit analyst for both a small sell side broker dealer in Chicago and then with a larger mutual fund firm here in Chicago  I had the chance to understand the rating agency methodology and how the rating agencies arrive at the ratings they do  My own opinion is that the two credit shocks of the last 12 years   not to mention the two equity bear markets   should prolong the next credit cycle  The rating agencies are uber sensitive today and are very ready to yell  fire  in crowded theatres  Like the general lack of enthusiasm for stocks even though the indices sit at all time highs  worries grow daily over the high yield market credit conditions  To me  that is a good sign  We have always respected Moody s and John Lonski s work  If you think trading the stock markets is tough  try being a credit analyst the last 12 years  Yowser   Still overweight high yield  but have been selling funds and buying ETFs   The iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond Fund  HYG  was down 3 35  in Q2  13  Muni s and state pension deficits  Alan Schankel tweeted this week that  according to Moody s  the states with largest pension deficits as a percentage of revenues are Illinois  241   and Connecticut  190    The Illinois GO deal that came this week was 8 x  oversubscribed per one source   1 3 bl deal with  8 billion in orders  As a Chicago  Illinois resident  that could only mean that higher taxes are down the road  Alan was quoted in Barron s this weekend     Subscription required   S P 500 correction  The correction in the S P 500 is 5   6 weeks long  and the uptrend off the November  12 low is still intact  I do think today s action and where the S P 500 closes this week will be critical  The S P 500 uptrend line off the March  09 low is all the way down at 1 400   1 450  or 150 to 200 S P 500 points lower  That would be a hefty drop  but it would put a bid back under Treasuries  Inflation  for those who think we have an inflation problem is a chart found on Bob Brinker s Twitter feed that shows the year over year Core PCE and the PCE deflator  Those touting gold for the last  600    800 drop have missed the fact that inflation is still falling  This also calls into question the  tapering  message by the Fed  It looks like deflation is still an issue     Ford  F   another good  from Reuters pulled off Bob Brinker s Twitter feed  If only Europe would stabilize and I think it is  F could make another run at  18 per share  or its early 2011 high  Ford has guided to a  0 50 loss in Europe this year  which is a hefty chunk of their 2013 consensus estimate of  1 40 per share  or roughly 1 3rd of Ford s full 2013 earnings is Europe s expected loss  Even if Europe just breaks even  Ford could trade to  20 or roughly 10 x  the  2 00 per share estimate  The stock seems to be getting a lift from US truck sales and the record sales of the F 150  but I do think better news out of Europe is the next catalyst  The stock even looks a tad overvalued at current prices  so we would like to see news that boosts forward EPS and revenue estimates   Long F  may add more   Amgen  Amgen s  AMGN  acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals  ONXX  late Friday is expected to be accretive to AMGN s EPS beginning in 2014  which should be a plus for the stock  We would be a buyer of AMGN in the low  90s if for whatever reason the market treats the stock badly on Monday morning  It looks like Onyx is rejecting the bid  and putting itself up for bid  A bidding war wouldn t help AMGN   Long AMGN  IBM s technicals look shaky  Here is our  that posted over the weekend  The stock is in a technically precarious position  Accenture  ACN  and Oracle  ORCL   two companies that are thought to be good leading indicators for IBM s  IBM  software and consulting business  had shaky quarters when both companies reported in the last few weeks  I m nervous about the stock  IBM s weighting in client accounts was cut in half after the alst earnings report  Big Blue doesn t report for a few weeks  I may sell the entire position   Long IBM  International vs  Domestic Performance  Bespoke tracks an interesting dynamic within the Russell 1 000 i e  stock performance of companies with all US based revenues vs  those companies with 50  of their revenues being non US based  In late April  13  the outperformance of Domestic vs International was a whopping 600 basis points  As of last week  the outperformance  although still favoring Domestic s  had narrowed to 310 basis points  bp s   The US outperformance is the reason we chilled our outlook on the department store sector in mid May  2013  Technology is a predominantly International sector  It fits with our  return to global growth  theme  but it will require patience  as IBM proves   Long more International than Domestic  within S P 500 holdings   One final interesting point  removing Utilities after their latest crushing thanks

With this recent update  the company further intensified its commitments under its customer focused strategic framework  Following the announcement  Moodys Corporation  NYSE MCO  affirmed McDonald s A2 unsecured and P 1 commercial paper ratings  Per its cash return target  the company intends to return wealth to its shareholders in the range of  18 0 billion to  20 0 billion over a 3 year period from 2014 to 2016 via dividends and share repurchases  This represents an increase of 10 0  to 20 0  over the amount of cash returned from 2011 to 2013  McDonald s has been regularly rewarding its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  The company has a history of increasing dividend every year since the inception of its dividend payout policy in 1976 with the latest being a 5  increase in Sep 2013  Moreover  during the past five years ended 2013  it has returned about  26 0 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments  Meanwhile  the company has also decided to re franchise approximately 1 500 restaurants mainly in the Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa and Europe over the same period  This represents more than 50 0  increase over the previous 3 year period  Currently  around 81 0  of its restaurants are franchised 
We believe re franchising a large chunk of its system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion  Alongside  free cash flow continues to grow  allowing reinvestment for increasing brand recognition and shareholder return  The company intends to work on its general and administrative spending so that the resources can be reallocated to high growth areas  which also includes the development of its global digital capabilities  The digital wave has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector as more and more restaurants are deploying technology to enable a better guest experience  So the company s focus in this area would drive traffic  A few other restaurants chains that are aggressively moving on this track are Panera Bread Company  NASDAQ PNRA  and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc   NASDAQ BWLD   both of which use tablets and kiosks to drive traffic  Despite frequent menu innovations and focus on customer value  McDonald s has been struggling to increase sales amid a weak consumer spending environment and stiff competition from other leading hamburger chains  We believe that this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is trying to mitigate these effects with its strategies ",2014-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald's-‘plan-to-win’-strategy-on-track-214510,214510
