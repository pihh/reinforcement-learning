it will be the latest European digital bank to challenge incumbent U S  lending giants after forays by Monzo and N26  but the challenges it faces have not diminished   While the start ups are experiencing fast growth at home  a crowded market  complex regulatory environment and different customer needs make it hard to stand out in the United States  financial technology executives  investors and analysts say   Revolut and its rivals have amassed millions of customers and billion dollar valuations in Europe by offering cheap  user friendly alternatives to traditional banking services  Branchless  but armed with slick apps  they re particularly popular with younger customers  In theory  there should be rich pickings in the U S  where banks often have minimum deposit requirements and hefty overdraft fees  and where there are fewer free ATMs  But customers of the country s roughly 4 500 FDIC insured commercial banks are far more dependent on credit than in Europe  with a fondness for racking up credit card loyalty points and individual store cards     The newcomers   product offering and key features might not be as relevant in the U S  market   said Yann Ranchere  a partner at venture capital firm Anthemis Group   Credit cards play a stronger role and FX is of less importance   Revolut s flagship offer is a debit card connected to an app  Users can

said Ron Shevlin  who heads fintech research at Cornerstone Advisors  N26 s U S  Chief Executive Nicolas Kopp remains sanguine    There is not a lot of precedent  of successful global expansion  in

138360,359875,ACN,The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About   January 31  2020,opinion,"Is the ability to time the markets more of a data driven science or a  gut   feeling  art 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Business Services stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Alliance Data Systems Corporation  NYSE ADS   Advanced Disposal Services Inc   ADSW   AstroNova  Inc   ALOT   ABM Industries Incorporated  ABM   Accenture PLC  NYSE ACN 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

138361,359876,ACN,NVEE Or ACN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Consulting Services sector have probably already heard of NV5 Holdings  NVEE  and Accenture  NYSE ACN   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  both NV5 Holdings and Accenture are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
NVEE currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 12  while ACN has a forward P E of 27 16  We also note that NVEE has a PEG ratio of 0 71  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 63 
Another notable valuation metric for NVEE is its P B ratio of 2 34  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ACN has a P B of 8 66 
These metrics  and several others  help NVEE earn a Value grade of B  while ACN has been given a Value grade of D 
Both NVEE and ACN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that NVEE is the superior value option right now ",2020-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvee-or-acn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200504853,200504853
138370,359885,ACN,UK shoppers buy less  adding to slowdown signs for economy,news,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON  Reuters    British consumers  whose spending has helped the economy through the Brexit crisis  cut back on their shopping in October  according to official data that adds to signs the economy is losing momentum 
An unexpected fall in sales in October pushed retail growth over the last three months to its weakest since April 2018  the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday 
The downbeat news follows official figures earlier this week that showed the economy as a whole grew at its weakest annual rate since 2010 in the third quarter of this year  while the number of people in work dropped sharply 
A strong job market and solid consumer spending have helped keep Britain s economy afloat since the Brexit referendum in June 2016  as businesses have cut investment and manufacturers have suffered more recently from the U S  China trade conflict 
 These latest ONS figures are symptomatic of the challenges facing the retail sector after a year fraught with uncertainty   said Lynda Petherick  head of retail at management consultants Accenture  NYSE ACN  
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called an early election for Dec  12 in an attempt to get a large enough majority to pass Brexit legislation before a new deadline of Jan  31  something he hopes will restore business confidence 
However  many economists fear that even if he gets his way  the risk of serious disruption to Britain s trade ties with the European Union will soon be back on the agenda  due to his aim of moving to new trading arrangements by the end of 2020 
The Bank of England warned last week it may need to cut interest rates if global trade conflicts and Brexit uncertainty do not end  and two of its policymakers have already voted to loosen policy 
Thursday s data showed retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell by 0 1   and annual sales growth held at 3 1   bucking average forecasts for a pick up to 3 7  
In the three months to October sales rose just 0 2  compared with the previous three months  an 18 month low 
Measures that exclude spending on motor fuel   which some economists think give a truer picture of underlying consumer demand   were weaker still  and fell below all forecasts in Reuters  poll of economists 
The only retailers to do well in October were department stores  which the ONS said benefited from sales promotions and an earlier introduction of Christmas lines 
Supermarket group Sainsbury s  L SBRY  said last week that it expected to trade well in the run up to Christmas but feared a consumer hangover in early 2020 if Brexit was unresolved

The company s shares have gained 81  over the last three years  driven by 23  higher revenues and 30  stronger earnings per share  Alongside the first quarter report  Accenture s management explained how the company hopes to continue these healthy business trends over the next few years 

Local focus in a global business model
On the earnings call  CEO Julie Sweet noted that Accenture s eight largest single country markets currently account for nearly 80  of the company s total sales  Accenture posted double digit growth in Japan  Brazil  and Singapore in the third quarter  In that collection of recent winners  only Japan sits among the company s eight largest target markets  Accenture would love to add more billion dollar markets beyond this solid core  and management is pulling several levers to make it happen 
 Leveraging our global network of more than 100 innovation hubs that we have built over the last few years  we can bring innovation from every corner of the world to our clients   Sweet said   We see growth and significant differences by country while at the same time our global footprint gives us the opportunity to leverage our learnings and our talent from around the world to accelerate outcomes for our clients  
For example  the company is helping large utility companies in France and Italy adapt to the evolving low carbon requirements in Europe with the help of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools  Under Accenture s guidance  these utilities collect tons of operating data from connected devices in important places such as power plants  transmission hubs  and natural gas pipelines 
The incoming treasure trove of information can then be analyzed to help Accenture and its clients identify bottlenecks and problem areas that require further attention  Accenture built these projects around lessons learned in similar situations around the globe  and the Italian and French programs are sure to uncover new wrinkles and solutions that can then be applied to future contracts elsewhere 
Market beating returns
Accenture s stock climbed 49  higher in 2019  driven by a steady beat of above expectations earnings reports  That s no mean feat at a time when many technology giants are struggling due to the China U S  trade tensions  Brexit troubles  and more  This stock has been crushing the broader market from a longer term perspective as well  delivering 135  growth in five years while the S P 500 could only muster a 58  increase

138407,359922,ACN,Altcoins  Ahead of Libra  XRP cryptocurrency gains toehold in commerce,news,By Tom Wilson LONDON  Reuters    Facebook s Libra may be grabbing all the headlines at the moment  yet a major cryptocurrency already exists that s gained a toehold in mainstream commerce  XRP  the third biggest cryptocurrency by market value  seeks to succeed where bitcoin and other digital currencies have largely failed  in powering fast and low cost transactions  In a rare example of a cryptocurrency finding a practical use beyond speculative trading  it has gained a certain amount of traction  with some large financial firms using XRP for international payments   Yet the price of XRP  often referred to as Ripple  has dropped by a quarter so far this year  even as bitcoin has more than doubled and other smaller coins such as ethereum have made slim gains   XRP s price performance goes against assumptions of a positive correlation between real world usage and the price of cryptocurrencies  The fact that bitcoin  the largest digital currency by far  has grabbed an even bigger share of the market this year is a sign that traders looking to capitalize on volatile price moves remain the industry s main driver   To track the emergence of hundreds of smaller rivals to bitcoin  collectively known as  altcoins   Reuters is looking at the leading players as they grab the attention of investors  companies and regulators  The third in the Reuters series on altcoins looks at the prospects  and challenges  for XRP  WHAT S THE IDEA   Seven year old XRP is one of the most successful examples  thus far  of attempts to build cryptocurrencies capable of entering mainstream finance and commerce   It has been developed by California based tech company Ripple  which offers a blockchain based payments platform  XRP is intended to act as a kind of bridge for cross border payments for firms that use Ripple  and can also be used for e commerce and peer to peer transfers  The currency was designed to help these companies   from payment providers to remittance firms   settle transactions instantly  pay lower fees and free up capital typically tied up in payments using traditional money  With traditional transfers  firms often use working capital to maintain balances in their settlement accounts  ensuring liquidity as one currency is converted to another  That helps customers receive funds more quickly   Ripple says customers can use XRP instead of traditional money for liquidity  allowing firms to free up working capital   It says payments using XRP settle in four seconds  compared with over an hour for bitcoin and three to five days for traditional systems used for fiat money    That s actually much less exposure and risk   said Monica Long  senior vice president of marketing and communications at Ripple   SO HOW S THAT DIFFERENT TO BITCOIN  XRP  like Facebook s proposed Libra  veers away from the ethos of bitcoin  the original cryptocurrency  which aimed to sidestep the financial establishment by dispensing with a central authority  A team of developers at Ripple maintain the XRP ledger s software  stewarding the technology  That  potentially  means that companies are more comfortable dealing with XRP than bitcoin  which is largely unsupervised and unregulated   The way XRP is produced also differs   While bitcoin  miners  compete against each other using powerful computers to solve algorithms and earn new coins  XRP s entire supply of 100 billion was created at its birth   Ripple now holds large reserves of XRP in escrow accounts  selling the tokens to large investors to boost liquidity and widen the spread of the technology  That means the company has centralized control over the supply of XRP    GRAPHIC  A tale of two coins  XRP and bitcoin in 2019      WHAT ABOUT LIBRA  While there are some similarities between Libra and XRP  notable differences also exist   Both coins aim to address problems in the payments sector  from high intermediary fees to lengthy transfer times  Yet Libra s target audience differs  with Facebook  NASDAQ FB  saying it will offer people who lack bank accounts access to easier money transfers  XRP  in contrast  is targeted at traditional financial firms   And while XRP s value fluctuates  Libra s doesn t  it is a  stablecoin  whose backing by traditional assets such as bank deposits and short term government securities is designed to dampen volatility  Nevertheless Libra  which has faced fierce opposition from politicians and regulators  could affect XRP s prospects  not least because Facebook s vast 2 4 billion users offer the currency an existing user base  WHO S USING IT   For the most part  payment and FX firms   Ripple says around a dozen firms use XRP for liquidity  One of the most well known is U S  remittances firm MoneyGram International  O MGI   in which Ripple invested  30 million in June  London based Mercury FX  which counts small businesses and wealthy individuals as clients  uses XRP to facilitate payments into and out of countries such as Mexico and the Philippines    The top three reasons one would use it would be speed  costs  security   said Alastair Constance  its founder   Your speed to settle a payment is higher  and your cost comes down dramatically    HOW HAS THE MARKET RESPONDED  XRP has slumped around 25  this year  versus a near 115  gain for bitcoin  To be sure  other altcoins have also failed to match bitcoin s advance  Yet other major players such as ethereum  the second biggest by market value   the price of a coin multiplied by the number of coins in the market   have stayed above water this year  The slide has come despite XRP gaining some traction in the global payments business  which covers anything from card payments to wiring money overseas and  according to consultancy Accenture  NYSE ACN   is worth about  1 5 trillion this year   Crypto market players say that Ripple s sales of XRP have ratcheted up pressure on prices and tempered any boost from XRP s payments progress  Ripple holds XRP in escrow accounts and sells directly to the market to boost liquidity  It said in a July report that XRP markets should resemble traditional foreign exchange markets  which are typically highly liquid and efficient   Ripple needs to provide the token  to encourage the spending  the use of that in their system   said Denis Vinokourov  head of research at BeQuant  a crypto exchange in London    It s a necessary evil  It hurts the price in the short term  but in the long term the usage of it will eventually increase    Ripple s Monica Long shrugged off the price moves   We think about XRP price and volatility over a longer arc of time  not day to day or week to week  but rather over the course of years   she said    What we re focused on   what we think will build greater stability in the asset   is its utility and liquidity    DO TRADERS LIKE IT   Yes and no   Unlike other cryptocurrencies  XRP is highly liquid therefore attractive for high frequency traders  hedge funds and other investors who seek to trade off short term price moves in digital coin markets   Still  some market players said the heavy supply of XRP in markets pushed prices down and thus makes it unpopular with longer term investors   Volumes and volatility from a trading perspective breed opportunity   it s fantastic for the automated trading world   said Cameron Dickie  head of EMEA sales at crypto market maker B2C2   But it s not so good for people looking to buy and hold    This story has been refiled to modify

138408,359923,ACN,Libor Refuses to Die,news," Bloomberg Opinion     An advertisement showing in U K  cinemas currently shows a boy hesitating to kiss a female zombie   But I m kinda hot   she says  popping chewing gum into her mouth before they lock lips   and her arm drops off  The finance community has a similarly conflicted relationship with Libor  the reference interest rates for everything from mortgages to car loans to corporate debt  This makes it likely that the benchmarks will survive beyond their planned termination date 
The current plan is for Libor to  wink out of existence by the end of 2021  Changes in the wholesale funding market mean it s no longer based on actual transactions between banks  The Financial Conduct Authority is adamant that the U K  finance industry should shift to using the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average rate  known as Sonia   In other jurisdictions  including the U S  and the euro area  regulators are implementing replacements 
But with a bit more than two years to go  a combination of complacency  complexity and inertia is keeping Libor very much alive 
The Bank of England s  Bank Overground  blog pointed out recently that the value of sterling swap contracts referencing Libor is increasing rather than decreasing  according to data compiled by LCH Ltd   the derivatives clearing house 
The value of contracts that extend beyond Libor s mooted end date has increased since April 2018  and stands currently at more than 10 trillion pounds   12 trillion   as the chart above shows  Even by 2026  more than 5 trillion pounds of Libor swaps will still be outstanding   Use of Libor remains widespread  and this poses risks to market stability   the Bank of England blog says 
There has been some progress in moving financial products to the regulators  recommended replacement  Earlier this month  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc s NatWest unit switched the reference rate on an existing loan to South West Water to Sonia  In July  the same bank made the first new loan based on Sonia  to National Express Group Plc 
Of course  some of the warnings about the need to accelerate away from Libor are self serving  Consultants and lawyers will make money from offering expensive advice on the transition  it s in their interests to emphasize the dangers 
But the sheer volume of outstanding notes around the world still tied to Libor and expiring after 2021   as much as  864 billion  the International Capital Markets Association estimated earlier this year   leaves many financiers skeptical that the regulators will carry out their threat to kill off the benchmarks as planned 
A survey published last month by consulting company Accenture  NYSE ACN  Plc showed 23  of respondents expect Libor to survive past its current death date  The poll of 177 global banks  asset managers and companies showed just 18  of the respondents described their shift away from the benchmarks as  mature   with only one fifth saying they were  operationally ready  
Regulators face a tough choice  If Libor wins a stay of execution  there will be even less pressure to switch away from the old reference rates  But if they stick to their guns  billions of dollars and euros and pounds of contracts will come untethered as the interest rates on which their payments are based disappear 
That risk is too big to ignore  Sure  Libor is flawed and outdated and probably beyond redemption  But with less than 27 months to go  the finance industry needs more time to come to terms with its demise  Let Libor live on  Sometimes even a zombie can be hard to resist ",2019-10-10,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/libor-refuses-to-die-1994313,1994313
138411,359926,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Accenture  NYSE ACN   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ACN that show why this consulting company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ACN  shares are up 0 53  over the past week while the Zacks Consulting Services industry is down 1 07  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 15  compares favorably with the industry s 1 59  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Accenture have risen 14 32   and are up 54 76  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 13 37  and 32 19   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ACN s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ACN is currently averaging 1 826 823 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ACN 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ACN s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 78 to  7 82 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ACN is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Accenture on your short list ",2020-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200496340,200496340
138412,359927,ACN,The Truth About Market Timing   January 06  2020,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Business Services stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Cinedigm Corp  CIDM   ABM Industries Incorporated  ABM   Accenture PLC  NYSE ACN   Alliance Data Systems Corporation  NYSE ADS   Advanced Disposal Services Inc   ADSW 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose lose situation 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He warns not to sell during small crashes  and weather the storm by focusing on the long term 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets

Next generation 5G technology  which can provide data speeds at least 20 times faster than 4G  will underpin the great advances of the next era  from self driving cars and augmented reality to smart cities and artificial intelligence 
The two companies said in separate statements on Tuesday that they aimed to work together on sites such as factory floors  airports and harbors 
Ericsson  which competes with Finland s Nokia  HE NOKIA  and China s Huawei  to build mobile data infrastructure worldwide  said that its so called Campus networks would combine public and private mobile connectivity 
The stakes are high in an industry that is expected to spend  275 billion on 5G technology over the next seven years in the United States alone  according to Accenture  NYSE ACN  estimates 
Gartner said in a report earlier this year that most 5G deployments will initially focus on islands of deployment  adding that less than 45  of communications service providers globally will have launched commercial 5G networks by 2025

138438,359953,ACN, Have a great day     robohelp leaves banking fraud victims cold,news,By Lawrence White LONDON  Reuters     Have a great day   was not the way Gavin Rennick expected  Zlatan   an agent for his bank  Revolut  to end their instant messaging chat about the 46 000 pounds   56 470  scammers had stolen from his account in just 24 hours  Fraudsters posing as Revolut staff had called him  warned him of  suspicious activity  on his account and persuaded him to log in to the app to take various steps to avert it    thereby enabling them to empty his account  Their action had left the 32 year old from Belfast stranded in Australia and penniless  Turning in his panic to Revolut s in app chat based support  he was confronted with a gauche messaging bot  Rita   who passes more serious complaints on to humans   It made me think where is the human side of banking  you need to realize you re dealing with human beings who ve lost a lot of money and are scared   Rennick said  Revolut said that the security lapses stemmed from phone numbers which can be faked or  spoofed  by fraudsters  rather than due to its app  adding it was rectifying shortcomings in its response to fraud   Digital banks like Revolut  which has racked up 7 million customers worldwide since it was set up four years ago with the backing of venture capital  are growing at lightning speed  luring new  mostly younger customers with snazzy apps  cheap access to cash abroad and low rates on foreign exchange  Revolut and peers such as Monzo and Starling are set to treble their total customer base from 13 million to 35 million in the next year  consulting group Accenture  NYSE ACN  predicts  However  if things go wrong  fraud victims at Revolut can find themselves without the support infrastructure offered by traditional banks  Rennick said he was refunded ten weeks after his money was stolen following a stressful battle with the help system  Four Revolut customers  including Rennick  who lost at least  150 000 in total  said the chat was slow  written in poor English and unhelpful  All were eventually refunded  simply finding the funds back in their accounts  The attacks on Revolut are part of a growing problem facing banks  with some 1 2 billion pounds stolen in 2018 from lenders in Britain alone according to industry body UK Finance  The Financial Ombudsman Service said complaints about frauds and scams rose to over 12 000 in the 2018 19 financial year  an all time record and up 43 percent on the previous year  Britain s Financial Conduct Authority has said banks need to focus on fraud prevention  not just reimbursement  to restore customers  faith  For customers like Rennick  a key part of restoring that trust is the way fraud is handled  HELP Revolut acknowledges some problems in how it handled fraud cases and in how its in App chat works  due to a lack of resources and adequate response systems  The company on Sept  2 said it has opened a new customer service center in Portugal and will hire up to 400 staff there for handling enquiries from customers worldwide  Revolut has meanwhile diverted staff from other tasks to manage fraud attacks   It is incredibly expensive to have people answering the phones for fraud cases because there are clear peaks in demand  but it s really important for resolving a case quickly and being able to explain to a customer what s happened   said Richard Emery  an independent expert who specializes in helping bank fraud victims   The online chats just felt so incompetent  they had no idea what s going on  it gave me no confidence I d get my money back   said Victoria Frost  an airline cabin crew worker and scam victim  who said many of her colleagues use the app  Soups Ranjan  San Francisco based head of financial crime risk at Revolut  told Reuters his unit was hiring aggressively to reach an eventual total of around 140 anti fraud workers  In many cases Revolut is adding features now that would have helped the recent victims  he said  Frost was deceived by a text message that appeared to come from a Revolut phone number  asking her to click on a link to what appeared to be a legitimate company website  Scammers in these SMS message or  smishing  attacks use security holes in the text messaging system to  spoof  or impersonate a company s phone number  Revolut said all its customer interactions are done by in App chat and it never calls users or invites them to log into websites in this way  Revolut acknowledged that the names such as Mila and Zlatan that customers see when talking to in App help are pseudonyms  designed to prevent service staff from being identified   I have a serious concern with organizations like Revolut where you cannot talk to someone and they have no facility for phoning you   bank fraud expert Emery said   Ranjan said Revolut has improved the tone and professionalism of its help staff and is looking at adding phone support in the near future

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 50   A quarter ago  it was expected that this consulting company would post earnings of  1 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 74  delivering a surprise of 1 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Accenture  which belongs to the Zacks Consulting Services industry  posted revenues of  11 36 billion for the quarter ended November 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 94   This compares to year ago revenues of  10 61 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Accenture shares have added about 45 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 27 3  
What s Next for Accenture 
While Accenture has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Accenture was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

138444,359959,ACN,When Does Market Timing Actually Work    December 20  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Business Services stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Cinedigm Corp  CIDM   ABM Industries Incorporated  ABM   Accenture PLC  NYSE ACN   Alliance Data Systems Corporation  NYSE ADS   Advanced Disposal Services Inc   ADSW 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

Fiat Chrysler deliveries fell 6 1 percent   Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  s reportedly declined 4 7 percent  and Toyota Motor Corp  s dipped 4 4 percent  trailing projections for a month in which industry demand is expected to slow  Nissan Motor Co  s bounce back from a disastrous month a year ago was more tempered than analysts were estimating  and Honda Motor Co  sales were little changed 

Key Insights

Concern about interest rates appears to be giving consumers pause  especially as average vehicle prices creep higher  according to Jessica Caldwell  an analyst for Edmunds   We just keep seeing rising average transaction prices   she said in an interview  The car shopping researcher says interest rates on new car purchases have hovered above 6 percent every month this year 
 We are disappointed with how sales turned out   with interest rates a factor  Brian Irwin  Accenture  NYSE ACN  Plc s managing director for North American automotive  said in an interview  He now expects U S  sales to fall below 17 million vehicles this year from 17 3 million last year 
Nissan  whose total sales rose 9 percent  credited cut rate financing offers with helping boost its redesigned Altima sedan in April  and the automaker is expanding that program to its Rogue SUV this month   Offering a special rate has done well for us   said Billy Hayes  a division vice president for Nissan North America 
Ford s U S  sales fell 4 7 percent  according to Automotive News  That was steeper than the 4 percent drop predicted by analysts  The Ford brand fell 4 7 percent  while Lincoln dropped 6 2 percent  the publication reported 
Fiat Chrysler announced after its third straight monthly U S  sales decline that it s going to shift to quarterly reporting  The company is taking after GM  which made the switch a year ago  and Ford  which followed suit beginning in January 
The Detroit Three are killing off several slow selling passenger cars from their lineup  The shift to sharing results on a quarterly basis is to some extent aimed at trying to avoid focusing attention on the volatility those moves will cause

138460,359975,ACN,Startups target banks  small business customers in FX payments drive,news,"By Tom Wilson and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON  Reuters    Revolut and TransferWise are signing up thousands of small businesses a month for foreign exchange payments  touting slicker service and lower fees as they try to take on banks in a sector with flows of  7 trillion a year 
The British money transfer firms have expanded by targeting the retail market with offers of cheaper and faster ways to send cash internationally 
But the much bigger    and lucrative    market for small and medium sized businesses remains overwhelmingly with banks  Many small firms accuse them of using slow  outdated technology and charging fees as high as those for retail clients 
 Small businesses don t get any better prices than consumers   said Stuart Gregory  head of TransferWise for Business   You re not getting speed  convenience  you re not getting a good price  
Banks say they are overhauling their systems to offer faster  simplified services and cutting fees  And experts say lenders  ability to offer a wide range of services    such as overdrafts and loans    means many businesses will still pick traditional financial institutions when making FX payments 
Small firms sent between  6 trillion and  7 trillion of cross border flows globally in 2017  consultancy McKinsey said last year  compared with  400 billion to  500 billion in individual to individual payments 
TransferWise is signing up 10 000 new businesses a month  double the rate of late last year  and growth in TransferWise s business customer base is outstripping that for retail clients  Gregory said  although many clients are micro firms 
It expects businesses to account within a few years for a quarter of its overall 3 billion pounds   3 9 billion  monthly flows  up from about a sixth  or 500 million pounds  today 
TransferWise  which is valued at an estimated  4 billion  has also been selling its platform to financial firms since November  
Customers include British digital bank Monzo and Dutch bank Bunq  It said it is also talking to Groupe BPCE about integrating its platform into the French lender 
Revolut  another rare example of a British fintech  unicorn  worth over  1 billion  expects monthly transaction volumes by businesses to top  1 billion in May  from  218 million in June last year 
It has attracted 100 000 businesses    up from 33 000 last June    and is adding 3 000 to 6 000 customers a month  TransferWise declined to give its overall business customer number 
Sukand Ramachandran  partner in BCG s financial institutions practice  said fintechs had an opportunity    but only where volumes were small 
They face compliance and regulatory hurdles as they grow  raising costs  They may also become increasingly reliant on banks for the liquidity needed to serve their customers 
 As long as the ticket size is not too big  there is an opportunity  The banks may be happy to give away the smaller transactions   Ramachandran said 
FIGHTING BACK
Small companies typically pay overseas suppliers  or foreign workers  via their bank  paying transaction fees and a  spread  on the forex rate 
International payment revenues across all customers top  200 billion plus globally a year  according to McKinsey  Business to business revenues total  127 billion  although most likely comes from big lower margin corporate customers 
Revenues from consumer to consumer payments totaled  26 billion  with a 6 percent revenue margin  McKinsey said 
Using the traditional SWIFT network  a bank owned cooperative launched in the 1970s  payments can take days to reach their destination 
Marwan Forzley  co founder of San Francisco based transfer firm Veem  acknowledged that banks would continue to take the vast majority of volumes  but said the size of the market meant there was room to grow 
 It s an industry that has been using the existing platforms for decades with no innovation   Forzley said  adding that Veem had more than 100 000 users  2 1 2 times more than in early 2018 
Ross Targett  CEO of Code Kingdoms  a startup that makes software for teaching coding skills  said using TransferWise had saved the firm  95 000 last year 
 We were getting  8 000 invoices  and getting  7 500 back   he said   Where s all this gone  Bad FX rates  admin fees and the percentage  the bank  leverages on top of it  
Banks are fighting back  In 2017 SWIFT introduced an initiative to leverage newer technology and accelerate transfer times    many payments reach beneficiaries in under 30 minutes 
 The big banks are trying to improve their customer experiences   said Sulabh Agarwal  a payments expert at consultancy Accenture  NYSE ACN    The challenge for banks is  How much do you cannibalize the existing business  
BCG s Ramachandran said the  biggest thing banks need to do is make it easier  to make payments   They don t necessarily need to be the cheapest  
Dutch e scooter operator Dott chose Revolut because of the ease with which it could open a bank account and lower fees 
But CEO Maxim Romain said that should his business need more sophisticated services as it grows  it was possible  Revolut will be a little bit less relevant for us

This indicator of growth emerged at the end of April  when the U S  Congress released its latest quarterly data on lobbying on Capitol Hill  Its statistics revealed that the number of companies and organizations lobbying for crypto had increased between Q4 2018 and Q1 2019  with lobbying efforts from the likes of Mastercard  NYSE MA   Accenture  NYSE ACN  and EY underlining how the regulatory fate of blockchain and cryptocurrencies isn t of interest only to Coinbase  Coin Center and other representatives of the crypto industry ",2019-06-10,Cointelegraph,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/why-lobbying-growth-is-a-sign-that-crypto-is-maturing-1892793,1892793
138463,359978,ACN,The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About   November 26  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Business Services stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Cinedigm Corp  CIDM   ABM Industries Incorporated  ABM   Accenture PLC  NYSE ACN   Alliance Data Systems Corporation  NYSE ADS   Advanced Disposal Services Inc   ADSW 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both CoreLogic and Accenture have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
CLGX currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 02  while ACN has a forward P E of 25 54  We also note that CLGX has a PEG ratio of 1 37  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 47 
Another notable valuation metric for CLGX is its P B ratio of 3 49  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ACN has a P B of 8 53 
These metrics  and several others  help CLGX earn a Value grade of A  while ACN has been given a Value grade of C

Besides StanChart and BOC Hong Kong joint ventures  the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  HKMA  has also issued the so called virtual banking license to a venture led by online insurer ZhongAn Online P C Insurance 
The new license will give its holders access to a lucrative retail banking market in the Asian financial hub  one where many consumers are unhappy with the current options

 It is a major milestone in reinforcing Hong Kong s position as a premier international financial center   Norman Chan  chief executive of the HKMA  Hong Kong s de facto central bank and banking regulator  said in a statement on Wednesday 
 I believe that virtual banks will not only help drive FinTech and innovation  but also bring about brand new customer experiences and further promote financial inclusion in Hong Kong   he said 
However  the entrenched position in Hong Kong of established banks  such as HSBC  StanChart and a slew of Chinese banks  is expected to be a major challenge for the holders of the online only banking license  whose road to profitability could be long 
StanChart will own 65 1 percent in SC Digital Solutions Ltd JV  while the rest will be owned by Ctrip Financial as well as Hong Kong based telecoms groups PCCW Ltd and HKT Trust and HKT Ltd  the HKMA said

It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

138497,360012,ACN,The Market Timing Secrets No One Talks About   October 07  2019,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Business Services stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  ABM Industries Incorporated  ABM   Adecco  SIX ADEN  SA  AHEXY   Advanced Disposal Services Inc   ADSW   Alliance Data Systems Corporation  NYSE ADS   Accenture PLC  NYSE ACN 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets

For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  7 79 per share and revenue of  45 87 billion  which would represent changes of  5 84  and  6 14   respectively  from the prior year 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for ACN  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

The Consulting Services industry is part of the Business Services sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 62  which puts it in the top 25  of all 250  industries

138519,360034,ACN,A Bad Elliott Wave Omen For Accenture Investors,opinion,"Accenture plc  NYSE ACN  is the global leader in professional services  It partners with more than 3 4 of the companies in the Fortune 500 and serves 92 of the top 100  Through its five segments   Strategy  Consulting  Digital  Technology and Operations   Accenture covers the whole spectrum of business services expertise 
However  despite its leading position  Accenture plc  NYSE ACN  is not immune to the whims of the business cycle  Businesses tend to cut their expenses in a recession  leading to lower revenues for companies like Accenture which rely on business spending 




With Accenture  NYSE ACN  stock near all time highs and a   can ACN decline from here  If yes  by how much  Let s apply the  to the chart below and see if it can help us answer there two important questions 
The weekly chart of ACN shows the stock entire uptrend from  11 30 in October 2002  Seventeen years later  the price is hovering above  193 a share for a total gain of 1608   not counting the dividends  While a good visualization of Accenture s impressive performance for almost two decades  this charts reveals one more thing 
Accenture  NYSE ACN  Stock Not as Strong as the Company 
The rally from  11 30 to  202 80 so far looks like a textbook five wave impulse pattern  It is labeled I II III IV V with an extended third wave  a flat correction in wave II and a sharp zig zag in wave IV  Unfortunately for the bulls  the Elliott Wave theory states that a three wave correction follows every impulse

138555,360070,ACN,Global banks chase Asia techs transaction business  as trade war rumbles,news,"By Sumeet Chatterjee HONG KONG  Reuters    Global lenders including  Citigroup   N C  and HSBC  L HSBA  are stepping up efforts to sell day to day banking services to Asia s fast growing new technology firms  amid growing competition for more traditional transaction banking  The workaday transaction banking business  which refers to services that deal with companies  operational needs such as trade financing  cash management and facilitating payments  has been a source of stable returns without consuming much capital for banks in Asia  the largest trading region in the world  While the impact of the trade war between the United States and China has not been felt on that business yet   in part because a temporary truce has delayed new tariffs that were due to kick in on Jan  1   analysts say the tensions have clouded the outlook for Asian economies and goods trade and made the services sector more attractive  The targets for the new initiative include e commerce firms  mobile payment service providers and ride hailing companies   from China s Ant Financial and Grab in Southeast Asia to PayTM and Flipkart in India  said senior bankers and consultants  Standard trade finance business has become commoditized  and Asia is seeing rapid digitisation of cash and growing demand for real time transaction infrastructure  said Rajesh Mehta  Citi s Asia Pacific head of treasury and trade solutions   Cash management for e commerce companies     with their long distribution chains in the region is becoming a big opportunity  as these companies grow and their supply chain network becomes bigger and more complex   he said  Citi saw revenues from its technology clients  including e commerce firms  surging 20 percent so far this year compared with the same period last year  up from 17 percent growth in 2017  making it the fastest growing segment for the bank s Asia Pacific treasury and trade solutions unit  The growth across banks in this segment is set to be boosted by surging transactions involving digital platforms in Asia and as many technology firms go cross border  potentially offsetting any impact from the trade war  banking industry officials said  The digital commerce market in Asia Pacific is set to surge two fold to reach more than  1 1 trillion by 2022  accounting for almost two thirds of the business globally  according to consultancy Accenture  NYSE ACN    The big play here is how can one dominate the services economy going forward and that s where the big battleground is   said Mohit Mehrotra  Deloitte Asia Pacific strategy consulting co leader   All these trade wars are about the goods economy   DIGITAL PUSH IN ASIA The sharpened focus on techs is also crucial as transaction banking has become the bedrock in Asia for global banks  who use those deep and sticky relationships with clients to pitch other services such as investment and private banking   The transaction banking offerings for the online platforms include processing of payments from customers and to suppliers in real time  at times in multiple currencies  as well as managing payrolls and creating innovative financing structures  HSBC  for example  which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia  is working with Hong Kong logistics start ups GoGoVan and Lalamove to facilitate the collection of real time digital payments on a faster payment system   In June  the British headquartered lender also closed a S 500 million   364 million   five year asset backed syndicated loan for Singapore based ride hailing service Grab   We have relationship managers now focusing much more keenly on new economy and services sectors to manage their increasingly digital needs   said Stuart Tait  head of commercial banking in Asia Pacific at HSBC  The scramble among global banks for a bigger share of transaction banking business from technology companies in Asia also comes as many of those firms are going cross border and expanding their offerings  While China s Ant Financial and Tencent are battling for the mobile payment business in Southeast Asia  ride hailing services Grab and Go Jek are vying to bring banking  e commerce and food delivery to every corner of Southeast Asia   Even if there is a lot of cash in Asia  it is digitizing at a much faster pace than anywhere outside the region   Morgan McKenney  Citi Asia Pacific cash management head  said   Anyone with  pay  in their name we typically support    Standard Chartered   L STAN  was in June this year picked by Ant Financial  operator of China s biggest mobile payment platform  to enable real time fund transfer for its blockchain technology based cross border digital wallet remittance service  With a view to grabbing a bigger share of the business  the banks are investing more in technology  entering into tie ups with fintechs  and doing in house data mining to understand consumer trends and cash flows in the digital economy   Speed of delivery of transaction banking services and accuracy of delivery are very critical for the digital technology companies   StanChart s global head of transaction banking  Lisa Robins  said

Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

138561,360076,ACN,CRAI Or ACN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Consulting Services stocks are likely familiar with CRA International  CRAI  and Accenture  NYSE ACN   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  CRA International is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Accenture has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that CRAI has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CRAI currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 56  while ACN has a forward P E of 24 53  We also note that CRAI has a PEG ratio of 1 20  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 37 
Another notable valuation metric for CRAI is its P B ratio of 1 69  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ACN has a P B of 9 26 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CRAI s Value grade of A and ACN s Value grade of D 
CRAI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that CRAI is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-09-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crai-or-acn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200465858,200465858
138562,360077,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on September 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 2  
Revenues are expected to be  11 07 billion  up 9 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 49  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Accenture 
For Accenture  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Accenture will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Accenture would post earnings of  1 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  2 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Accenture doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-09-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200466205,200466205

138616,360131,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Accenture basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Accenture imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Accenture
For the fiscal year ending August    2019  this consulting company is expected to earn  7 33 per share  which is a change of 8 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Accenture  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Accenture to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-08-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200457702,200457702
138617,360132,ACN,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   August 26  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Business Services stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Adecco  SIX ADEN  SA  AHEXY   Advanced Disposal Services Inc   ADSW   Alliance Data Systems Corporation  NYSE ADS   Accenture PLC  NYSE ACN   ABM Industries Incorporated  ABM 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

Accenture is one of 196 individual stocks in the Business Services sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  5 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors

138670,360185,ACN,Accenture sees  secular downward  trend in bank fees,news,"By Guillermo Parra Bernal
SAO PAULO  Reuters    Bank s services fees face  secular downward  pressure in the long run  which will drive lenders back toward credit transactions whose margins are resilient to competition and new technologies  a senior executive at management consultants Accenture Plc  N ACN  said 
Banks have relied in recent years on sales of insurance  credit debit cards  asset management and other products as a way to offset narrowing margins on lending related activities and higher capital requirements  Return on equity in those so called fee segments can be three or four times bigger than in lending 
But Alan McIntyre  senior managing director for global banking at Accenture s consulting arm  said services such as investment advisory or payment processing are some of the ripest for innovation  Technology helps financial start ups gain customers at the expense of traditional banks  which face  fee margin compression because of compressive disruption   he said 
Traditional lenders  as a result  will end up relying more on lending spreads  McIntyre told Reuters in an interview  given that  they will not easily undergo compression  due to their complexity in many cases  
His remarks underscore how technology could make banking far more personalized and reliant on relationships than many think  Artificial intelligence will be the main channel through which banks will interact with their customers by the end of the decade  McIntyre s group said in a report earlier this year 
McIntyre  in Brazil over the past week to visit customers  said so called  Big Tech  is wary of entering the territory of banks due to fear of central bank regulations 
Digital customer experience is not really enough to steal many customers away from traditional banking relationships  he said  noting that customers are moving on to digital ones at a single digit pace in many markets 
 The existing threat is Big Tech intermediating bank customers and leaving banks as utilities who provide products but don t manage the customer relationship   McIntyre said 
He added that Brazilian banks have a  false sense of security  in their profitability  noting that domestic and global peers alike must think more seriously about efficiency to remain attractive to investors ",2017-09-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/accenture-sees-secular-downward-trend-in-bank-fees-529422,529422

138674,360189,ACN,Booz Allen  BAH  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding  BAH   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  69 25 in the previous session  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has gained 53 5  since the start of the year compared to the 33 8  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 38 2  return for the Zacks Government Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 29  2019  Booz Allen reported EPS of  0 83 versus consensus estimate of  0 72 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 45  
For the current fiscal year  Booz Allen is expected to post earnings of  3 01 per share on  7 23 billion in revenues  This represents a 9 06  change in EPS on a 7 83  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 36 per share on  7 74 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 64  and 7 08   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Booz Allen may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Booz Allen has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 23X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 20 5X versus its peer group s average of 16 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 85  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Booz Allen currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Booz Allen passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Booz Allen shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Booz Allen Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Booz Allen have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including FTI Consulting  FCN   Broadridge Financial Solutions  BR   and Accenture  NYSE ACN   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 14  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Booz Allen  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/booz-allen-bah-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200446354,200446354
138675,360190,ACN,CLGX Or ACN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Consulting Services sector have probably already heard of CoreLogic  CLGX  and Accenture  NYSE ACN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
CoreLogic has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Accenture has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  This means that CLGX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
CLGX currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 07  while ACN has a forward P E of 26 93  We also note that CLGX has a PEG ratio of 1 64  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 61 
Another notable valuation metric for CLGX is its P B ratio of 3 90  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ACN has a P B of 9 38 
These metrics  and several others  help CLGX earn a Value grade of B  while ACN has been given a Value grade of C 
CLGX sticks out from ACN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that CLGX is the better option right now ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clgx-or-acn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200447020,200447020

138692,360207,ACN,AI to become main way banks interact with customers within three years  Accenture,news,"By Jemima Kelly LONDON  Reuters    Artificial intelligence  AI  will become the primary way banks interact with their customers within the next three years  according to three quarters of bankers surveyed by consultancy Accenture  N ACN  in a new report   Four in five bankers believe AI will  revolutionise  the way in which banks gather information as well as how they interact with their clients  said the Accenture Banking Technology Vision 2017 report  which surveyed more than 600 top bankers and also consulted tech industry experts and academics   Artificial intelligence    the technology behind driverless cars  drones and voice recognition software    is seen by the financial world as a key technology which  along with other  fintech  innovations such as blockchain  will change the face of banking in the coming years   More than three quarters of respondents to the survey believed that AI would enable more simple user interfaces  which would help banks create a more human like customer experience   The big paradox here is that people think technology will lead to banking becoming more and more automated and less and less personalized  but what we ve seen coming through here is the view that technology will actually help banking become a lot more personalized   said Alan McIntyre  head of the Accenture s banking practice and co author of the report     It  will give people the impression that the bank knows them a lot better  and in many ways it will take banking back to the feeling that people had when there were more human interactions    PRIVACY CONCERNS The top reason for using AI for user interfaces  cited by 60 percent of the bankers surveyed  was  to gain data analysis and insights    But worries over the privacy of data were cited as the top challenge  with one in three also saying that the fact users often prefer human interactions could also be a problem   The report also found that  while the number of human interactions in bank branches or over the phone was falling and would continue to do so  the quality and importance of human contact would increase    What you re going to get on the bankers  side is access to far better information  and that s going to allow them to understand what your needs are and what the advice is that they need to give you   said McIntyre   Banks  advisory arms are an area considered one of the ripest for technological innovation

138695,360210,ACN,ACN Vs  IT  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Consulting Services stocks have likely encountered both Accenture  NYSE ACN  and Gartner  IT   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Accenture has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Gartner has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ACN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than IT has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ACN currently has a forward P E ratio of 26 07  while IT has a forward P E of 42 33  We also note that ACN has a PEG ratio of 2 52  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  IT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 99 
Another notable valuation metric for ACN is its P B ratio of 9 08  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  IT has a P B of 17 62 
These metrics  and several others  help ACN earn a Value grade of B  while IT has been given a Value grade of D 
ACN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ACN is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acn-vs-it-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200438499,200438499

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Accenture shares have added about 30  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 2  
What s Next for Accenture 
While Accenture has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

138718,360233,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Accenture is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Accenture imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Accenture
For the fiscal year ending August    2019  this consulting company is expected to earn  7 33 per share  which is a change of 8 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Accenture  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

138719,360234,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Accenture  NYSE ACN   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  188 74 in the previous session  Accenture has gained 33 8  since the start of the year compared to the 30  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 28 9  return for the Zacks Consulting Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 27  2019  Accenture reported EPS of  1 93 versus consensus estimate of  1 88 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 88  
For the current fiscal year  Accenture is expected to post earnings of  7 32 per share on  43 24 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 75  change in EPS on a 9 27  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 96 per share on  46 26 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 8 72  and 6 97   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Accenture may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Accenture has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 25 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 23X versus its peer group s average of 16 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 49  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Accenture fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Accenture shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200436792,200436792

With a long term expected EPS growth rate of 13 5  and a market cap of  921 5 million  Navigant seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolios 

 
Factors That Bode Well
Navigant is investing in technology infrastructure to augment its technology based service offerings  It has also invested in development programs to improve sales effectiveness and collaboration across the organization  Other focus areas include employee development  talent management and mentoring programs  We believe that these initiatives should add to Navigant s ability to grow its business organically 
The company s managed services business is currently in good shape driven by better execution in healthcare managed services  contribution from Health System Solutions  HSS  joint venture and a new Financial  Risk   Compliance Advisory  FSAC  segment managed services engagement  It is in currently a significant contributor to revenues before reimbursements  RBR  
The business represented 30  of RBR in the first quarter  The Energy segment continues to see strong demand from both commercial and government clients  The segment s first quarter 2019 RBR increased 8  year over year 
Navigant scommitment toward creating value for shareholders underline its confidence in business  It returned more than  55 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter and is confident about achieving its goal to return up to  175 million by August 2019 
Last Words
Despite riding on significant growth prospects  Navigant is not free from overhangs  Higher talent costs due to a competitive talent market coupled with Trump s stringent policies on immigration are hurting consulting services stocks  Nevertheless  we believe that a strong demand environment and improving operating efficiency bode well for Navigant

138723,360238,ACN,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Accenture  ACN ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Accenture  NYSE ACN  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this consulting company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Accenture is 10 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Accenture is 15 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Accenture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Accenture has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

138749,360264,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Accenture  NYSE ACN  reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 27  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  11 01 billion  up 6 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Accenture 
For Accenture  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Accenture will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Accenture would post earnings of  1 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 73  delivering a surprise of  10 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Accenture doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200433308,200433308

138767,360282,ACN,Booz Allen  BAH  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding  BAH   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  63 07 in the previous session  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has gained 39 4  since the start of the year compared to the 23 8  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 26 9  return for the Zacks Government Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 28  2019  Booz Allen reported EPS of  0 64 versus consensus estimate of  0 61 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 45  
For the current fiscal year  Booz Allen is expected to post earnings of  3 per share on  7 17 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 7  change in EPS on a 6 93  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 32 per share on  7 58 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 67  and 5 73   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Booz Allen may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Booz Allen has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 20 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 24 7X versus its peer group s average of 16X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 44  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Booz Allen currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Booz Allen meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Booz Allen shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Booz Allen Stack Up to the Competition

including Oracle  Eli Lilly and Mondelez  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Oracle s shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer Software industry in the past six months  gaining  14 7  vs   21 4   Oracle is one of the largest enterprise grade database  middleware and application software providers  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is benefiting from strong adoption of its cloud based solutions  comprising Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM  among others Partnerships with the likes of Accenture  NYSE ACN  are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud base clientele  Also  anticipated strong demand for the next generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will boost its competitive position against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS  Nevertheless  stiff competition in the cloud market from dominant players is anticipated to limit margin expansion  Further  lower hardware volumes are anticipated to hurt top line growth consequently keeping margins under pressure  Additionally  integration risks from buyouts remain a concern  You can   Shares of Eli Lilly have gained  2 2  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has gained  1 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Lilly s revenue growth in 2019 will likely be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well as new migraine drug  Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis face generic competition Lilly has made significant pipeline progress in the past year with several positive late stage data readouts  multiple approvals and regulatory submissions  Lilly also added promising new pipeline assets through

increase of the Zacks Food Preparation industry  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is steadily gaining from strategic pricing endeavors  In fact  during the first quarter of 2019  balanced pricing and volume mix helped organic revenues to rise nearly 3 7   Also  pricing led to adjusted gross margin improvement Going forward  management plans to continue striking a balance between volumes and pricing  Additionally  it is progressing well with saving initiatives  Mondelez also focuses on brand building through innovation  It is bolstering presence in emerging markets However  the company

138785,360300,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Is Up 1 24  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Accenture  NYSE ACN   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ACN that show why this consulting company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ACN  shares are up 1 24  over the past week while the Zacks Consulting Services industry is up 1 07  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 16  compares favorably with the industry s 3 18  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Accenture have risen 16 11   and are up 20 24  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 9 4  and 13 29   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ACN s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ACN is averaging 1 549 813 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ACN 
Over the past two months  13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ACN s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 20 to  7 31 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  12 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ACN is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Accenture on your short list ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-is-up-124-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200413692,200413692
138786,360301,ACN,Unemployment Hits 50 Year Low  6 Business Services Picks,opinion,In April  the unemployment rate declined to its lowest level in nearly 50 years  Job additions came in significantly above expectations  indicating that economic expansion has retained steam even when it is only months short of becoming the longest in history  The report also provided fresh evidence that the economy is beginning to gather momentum after a quiet start to the year  Meanwhile  the pace of wage growth came in below expectations  However  the increase in wages exceeded inflation  indicating an improvement in real wages  Additionally  the real unemployment rate remained flat over the month  Once again  professional and business services led job gains  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Unemployment Lowest Since 1969 Last month  the unemployment rate declined from 3 8  to 3 6   This is the lowest level registered since December 1969 and significantly better than the estimated rate of 3 8   The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and people only sporadically looking for jobs  remained flat at 7 3   a level where it has lingered since February Meanwhile  average hourly earnings increased 6 cents to  27 77  However  the monthly increase of 0 2  came in below expectations of a 0 3  increase  But the year over year increase in earnings remained flat at 3 2   The average workweek also declined from 34 5 hours to 34 4 hours This decline in working hours per week helped to boost average hourly pay  Further  the yearly pace of wage growth is well above the current pace of inflation of 1 9   implying that workers are enjoying an increase in real wages Professional and Business Services Lead GainsThe economy added 263 000 jobs in April  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 189 000  This marks the 100th consecutive month of job growth for the U S  economy  Further  since the Great Recession ended in 2009  the economy has created more than 20 million jobs  While some characterize the pace of the current expansion as slow  this could actually add to its durability  Job gains for preceding months were revised upward overall  Job additions for March were reduced from 196 000 to 189 000  Meanwhile  February s jobs numbers were increased from 33 000 to 56 000  taking the net gain for the two prior months to 16 000  Jobs gains have maintained an impressive monthly average of 205 000 in the year to date period At the forefront of job gains were  construction  healthcare  social assistance and financial activities  which added 33 000  27 000  26 000 and 12 000 jobs  respectively  However  the largest contributor to job additions was professional and business services with 76 000 new jobs  The sector has added 535 000 jobs in the last 12 months Our ChoicesJob additions for April have exceeded expectations by a wide margin  Meanwhile  the unemployment rate is plumbing fresh lows even as wage gains continue unhindered  Further  job gains for the last two months have also been revised upward  Taken together  these are signs that the economy is picking up after a slow start to the year Professional and business services remain at the forefront of job gains  Adding stocks from this sector looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Limbach Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ LMB   is a provider of commercial specialty contract services Limbach Holdings has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and VGM Score of A  The company s expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for

138802,360317,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Accenture  NYSE ACN   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  178 42 in the previous session  Accenture has gained 26 3  since the start of the year compared to the 22 6  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 23 5  return for the Zacks Consulting Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 28  2019  Accenture reported EPS of  1 73 versus consensus estimate of  1 57 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 63  
For the current fiscal year  Accenture is expected to post earnings of  7 3 per share on  43 11 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 31  change in EPS on an 8 93  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 93 per share on  46 04 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 8 53  and 6 81   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Accenture may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Accenture has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 24 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 21 7X versus its peer group s average of 14 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 36  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Accenture passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Accenture shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200404743,200404743
138803,360318,ACN,ACN Vs  IT  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Consulting Services sector might want to consider either Accenture  NYSE ACN  or Gartner  IT   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Accenture and Gartner are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ACN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ACN currently has a forward P E ratio of 24 40  while IT has a forward P E of 39 06  We also note that ACN has a PEG ratio of 2 36  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  IT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 75 
Another notable valuation metric for ACN is its P B ratio of 8 62  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  IT has a P B of 16 35 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ACN s Value grade of B and IT s Value grade of F 
ACN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than IT  so it seems like value investors will conclude that ACN is the superior option right now ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acn-vs-it-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200404710,200404710
138804,360319,ACN,Here s Why Accenture  ACN  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Accenture  NYSE ACN   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ACN  shares are up 6 52  over the past week while the Zacks Consulting Services industry is up 2  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 07  compares favorably with the industry s 2 19  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Accenture have increased 21 17  over the past quarter  and have gained 17 54  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 14 77  and 10 75   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ACN s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ACN is averaging 2 292 030 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ACN 
Over the past two months  14 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ACN s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 20 to  7 30 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  13 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

138808,360323,ACN,ACN Or IT  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Consulting Services sector have probably already heard of Accenture  NYSE ACN  and Gartner  IT   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Accenture is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Gartner has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that ACN has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ACN currently has a forward P E ratio of 24 71  while IT has a forward P E of 40 17  We also note that ACN has a PEG ratio of 2 39  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  IT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 83 
Another notable valuation metric for ACN is its P B ratio of 8 83  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  IT has a P B of 16 82 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ACN s Value grade of B and IT s Value grade of F 
ACN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ACN is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acn-or-it-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200410060,200410060

138831,360346,ACN,What Makes Accenture  ACN  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Accenture basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Accenture imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Accenture
For the fiscal year ending August    2019  this consulting company is expected to earn  7 27 per share  which is a change of 7 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Accenture  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

138833,360348,ACN,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Accenture,opinion,"Accenture plc   NYSE ACN   is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective  as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for ACN broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting a short term bullish trend

138834,360349,ACN,Global Payments  GPN  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Global Payments  GPN  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 6 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  139 4 in the previous session  Global Payments has gained 33 6  since the start of the year compared to the 23  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 24 1  return for the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 13  2019  Global Payments reported EPS of  1 33 versus consensus estimate of  1 32 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 21 11  
For the current fiscal year  Global Payments is expected to post earnings of  6 03 per share on  4 46 billion in revenues  This represents a 16 18  change in EPS on a 18 89  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 04 per share on  4 77 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 16 89  and 6 97   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Global Payments may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Global Payments has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 22 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 15 6X versus its peer group s average of 15 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 29  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Global Payments currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Global Payments meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Global Payments shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Global Payments Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Global Payments have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Diebold Nixdorf   DBD   Barrett Business Services  BBSI   and Accenture  NYSE ACN   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 39  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Global Payments  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-payments-gpn-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200403998,200403998

continued in fourth quarter fiscal 2018 Despite a sales miss in the fiscal fourth quarter  the company has delivered positive sales surprise in eight out of the last 10 quarters  Results gained from strength in both Pro and DIY categories  It also benefited from efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers  with localized and innovative products  and improved productivity The Zacks analyst thinks the Pro segment benefits from efforts to enhance service capabilities  including the new B2B website for the Pros  Moreover  the company outlined a solid view for fiscal 2019 and reaffirmed long term financial targets However  the company has suffered lower than expected sales and comps in the fiscal fourth quarter  Tough comparisons  hurricane related sales gains in the

138854,360369,ACN,Earnings Preview  Accenture  ACN  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Accenture  NYSE ACN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 6  
Revenues are expected to be  10 28 billion  up 7 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Accenture 
For Accenture  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Accenture will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Accenture would post earnings of  1 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 96  delivering a surprise of  6 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Accenture doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-accenture-acn-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200399852,200399852

138860,360375,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Tops Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 73 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 57 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 58 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10 19   A quarter ago  it was expected that this consulting company would post earnings of  1 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 96  delivering a surprise of 6 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Accenture  which belongs to the Zacks Consulting Services industry  posted revenues of  10 45 billion for the quarter ended February 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 63   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 59 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Accenture shares have added about 18 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 11 9  
What s Next for Accenture 
While Accenture has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Accenture was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 91 on  11 05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 21 on  42 92 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

138884,360399,ACN,III Vs  ACN  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Consulting Services sector have probably already heard of Information Services Group  III  and Accenture  NYSE ACN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Information Services Group is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Accenture has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that III s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
III currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 96  while ACN has a forward P E of 22 46  We also note that III has a PEG ratio of 0 78  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 17 
Another notable valuation metric for III is its P B ratio of 2 56  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ACN has a P B of 8 23 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to III s Value grade of A and ACN s Value grade of D 
III is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that III is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-03-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iii-vs-acn-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200396406,200396406
138885,360400,ACN,Will Accenture  ACN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Accenture  NYSE ACN   which belongs to the Zacks Consulting Services industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This consulting company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4 23  
For the most recent quarter  Accenture was expected to post earnings of  1 84 per share  but it reported  1 96 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 52   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 55 per share  while it actually produced  1 58 per share  a surprise of 1 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Accenture  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Accenture has an Earnings ESP of  1 91  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on March 28  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-accenture-acn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200397749,200397749

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Home Depot  NYSE HD   Oracle  ORCL  and Union Pacific  UNP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Home Depot s shares have gained  11 7  over past three months  underperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry s  13 1  increase  Home Depot boasts a five year long trend of beating earnings estimates  which continued in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  
Despite a sales miss in the fiscal fourth quarter  the company has delivered positive sales surprise in eight out of the last 10 quarters  Results gained from strength in both Pro and DIY categories  It also benefited from efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers  with localized and innovative products  and improved productivity 
The Zacks analyst thinks the Pro segment benefits from efforts to enhance service capabilities  including the new B2B website for the Pros  Moreover  the company outlined a solid view for fiscal 2019 and reaffirmed long term financial targets  
However  the company has suffered lower than expected sales and comps in the fiscal fourth quarter  Tough comparisons  hurricane related sales gains in the prior year  and unfavorable winter weather hurt comps 
 You can   
Shares of Oracle have outperformed the Zacks Computer Software industry in the past six months  gaining  6  vs   3 7   Oracle reported stellar third quarter results  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is benefiting from strong adoption of its cloud based solutions  comprising Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM  among others  
Partnerships with the likes of Accenture  NYSE ACN  are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud base clientele  Also  anticipated strong demand for the next generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will boost competitive position against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS   
Nevertheless  stiff competition in the cloud market from dominant players is anticipated to limit margin expansion  Lower hardware volumes are anticipated to hurt top line growth consequently keeping margins under pressure  Also  integration risks from buyouts remain a concern 
 You can   
Buy ranked Union Pacific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry   1 4  vs   0 8   over the past six months  Union Pacific reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018  Both the metrics also increased year over year  Higher freight revenues on the back of volume growth aided top line growth  
For 2019  the company anticipates volumes to increase in the low single digit range  The Zacks analyst thinks Union Pacific s efforts to reward its shareholders are encouraging  Notably  the company has hiked dividends four times since November 2017  
Improvement in operating ratio and low tax rates are added positives  Its efforts to promote safety are noteworthy as well  However  high debt levels and operating expenses are concerns  Escalated capital expenditures are contributing to rise in costs

138933,360448,ACN,III Vs  ACN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Consulting Services stocks have likely encountered both Information Services Group  III  and Accenture  NYSE ACN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Information Services Group has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Accenture has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that III likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ACN has recently  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
III currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 85  while ACN has a forward P E of 21 13  We also note that III has a PEG ratio of 0 70  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 04 
Another notable valuation metric for III is its P B ratio of 2 52  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ACN has a P B of 9 07 
These metrics  and several others  help III earn a Value grade of B  while ACN has been given a Value grade of D 
III stands above ACN thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that III is the superior value option right now ",2018-12-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iii-vs-acn-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200369540,200369540
138936,360451,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Surpasses Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 96 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 84 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 79 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 52   A quarter ago  it was expected that this consulting company would post earnings of  1 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 58  delivering a surprise of 1 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Accenture  which belongs to the Zacks Consulting Services industry  posted revenues of  10 61 billion for the quarter ended November 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 52 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Accenture shares have lost about 1 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s decline of  6 2  
What s Next for Accenture 
While Accenture has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Accenture was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 60 on  10 26 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 20 on  42 69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

138960,360475,ACN,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Accenture  ACN ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Accenture  NYSE ACN   which belongs to the Zacks Consulting Services industry 
This consulting company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 31  
For the most recent quarter  Accenture was expected to post earnings of  1 55 per share  but it reported  1 58 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 94   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 71 per share  while it actually produced  1 79 per share  a surprise of 4 68  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Accenture lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Accenture has an Earnings ESP of  0 69  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on December 20  2018 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

138962,360477,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 20  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 4  
Revenues are expected to be  10 48 billion  up 10 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 19  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Accenture 
For Accenture  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Accenture will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Accenture would post earnings of  1 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 58  delivering a surprise of  1 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Accenture appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-acn-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200367850,200367850

The ecosystem is an integral part of the cloud based informatics research platform  which is being developed by Accenture in collaboration with Merck   NYSE MRK   on Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   Amazon Web Services   AWS    The platform enables scientific research based organizations in the life sciences industry to quickly access  aggregate and analyze research data from multiple applications  It facilitates easier collaboration across the R D enterprise  including external partners 
The new ecosystem will enable ISVs leverage the platform s use of open  industry standard based application programming interfaces  APIs  to integrate technology components  applications and content into the platform

To Conclude
We believe that the latest move will help Accenture boost its Products segment as it comprises the Life Sciences industry group  which serves pharmaceutical  medical technology and biotechnology companies  Performance of this segment was particularly strong in the last reported quarter  with revenues increasing 12  on a year over year basis

139031,360546,ACN,Booz Allen  BAH  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding   NYSE BAH    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11 6  over the past month  BAH hit a new 52 week high of  44 17 in the previous session  Booz Allen Hamilton has gained 15 5  since the start of the year compared to the 8 5  move for the Business Services sector and the 4 8  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 29  2018  Booz Allen Hamilton reported EPS of  0 52 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 45 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 2 5  
Valuation Metrics
While BAH has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 19 6X versus its peer group s average of 14 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 74  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Booz Allen Hamilton Holding meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though BAH shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Dun   Bradstreet   NYSE DNB    Accenture   NYSE ACN    and FleetCor Technologies   NYSE FLT    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 17  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BAH  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/booz-allen-bah-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200320503,200320503

The partnership aims at creating a position for the TransUnion Professor of Data Science  for which a nation wide search will be done  The professor will join as a senior faculty member in the Mathematics  Statistics and Computer Science department  and work with a large group of researchers of data science across the campus 
TransUnion president and CEO informed   We re looking forward to fostering a program with UIC  and bringing more students into this course of study ultimately leading to greater innovation and technology breakthroughs that we can only imagine today  
We observe that TransUnion stock has rallied 58 6  over the past year  significantly outperforming the 25 2  growth recorded by the  it belongs to 

The Bigger Picture
While LinkedIn s 2017 Emerging Jobs Report lists the data science industry as the second fastest growing industry  McKinsey projects a shortage of 140 000 190 000 deep analytic talent positions  and 1 5 million analysts and analytics managers in 2018 in the United States alone 
This is naturally a matter of concern for TransUnion  which is a leading provider of data and analytics solutions  It appears  by trying to add more students to the field of data science  the company is paving way for future recruitments from UIC

139033,360548,ACN,ABM Industries  ABM  Stock Down 32  In A Year  Here s Why,opinion,"Shares of ABM Industries Inc    NYSE ABM   have lost 33  against the  s growth of 17 4  in a year 

 
Moreover  the facility management provider s shares tumbled to a 52 week low of  28 54 during the trading session on May 29  The figure recovered marginally to close at  28 82  down 1 3  
Reasons Behind the Plunge
ABM Industries operates in a highly competitive industry where the barriers to entry are very low  This makes it difficult for the company to maintain strong and long term relationships with clients  In order to win new clients and retain the existing ones  the company has to remain technologically updated to meet varying and rapidly changing client demands 
This increases operating expenses of the company  thereby reducing margins  In 2017  operating expenses rose 14  to  1 34 billion  As of Jan 31  2018  the figure was up 19 6  to 1 43 billion  Rising operating costs are a major headwind for the company s growth 
The company s business outside the United States  especially in the United Kingdom  remains susceptible to the outcome of Brexit  With the exit of U K  from the European Union  EU   the European economy has become highly unpredictable with disruptions and restrictions in acquisitions and trade with other European Union members  Such activities weigh on company s revenues and margins 
ABM Industries has a highly leveraged balance sheet  Notably  its long term debt rose from  268 3 million in 2016 to  1 16 billion at the end of 2017  The company had  62 8 million of cash and cash equivalents in 2017  As of Jan 31  2018  cash and cash equivalents were  68 6 million while long term debt was  1 17 billion  This implies that ABM Industries is currently unable to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt

SAP with its partners will provide customer deployment services for 10 SAP Leonardo IoT accelerators  This include SAP Predictive Maintenance and Service solution packages  SAP Connected Goods software  SAP Asset Intelligence Network  SAP Vehicle Insights application  SAP Global Track and Trace solution  and SAP Leonardo IoT Foundation as well as SAP Edge Services

139295,360810,ACN,DST Boosts Shareholder Returns With Share Buyback  Dividend,opinion,"In a move to further enhance shareholder s wealth  DST Systems  Inc  s   NYSE DST   board of directors recently approved a new share repurchase program and increased the quarterly cash dividend rate  The latest move reflects the company s sound financial position and favorable prospects 
The new authorization permits DST to buy back up to  300 million worth of its common stock  As of Apr 28  2017  the company had approximately 30 881 651 shares outstanding  Notably  management s new authorization comes after DST completed its previous  300 million share repurchase program last month 
Per the new program  DST will have the discretionary power to terminate the buyback at any time it wishes and can repurchase its common stock under the prevailing market and business conditions  Share repurchase can be made in open market or by private transaction in accordance with Rule 10b 18 of Securities and Exchange Commission  Rule 10b 18 provides companies with a  safe harbor  in case of share repurchase  Under this rule it is assumed that the company has not violated anti fraud provisions DST Systems  Inc  Price

   Apart from approving the new share repurchase program  management raised its quarterly cash dividend payment rate  The board of directors declared a cash dividend of 36 cents on a pre split basis  representing an approximately 3  increase from the previous pre split quarterly dividend payment of 35 cents  The newly approved dividend will be payable on Jun 9 to shareholders of record as of May 26 
Concurrent with the share repurchase and dividend announcements  the board of directors approved a two for one split of the company s common stock  After the split  DST expects its outstanding shares to increase to approximately 61 763 302 
Management s recent moves were welcomed by investors as evident from an over 1  increase in DST Systems  share price  We note that DST has outperformed the Zacks  industry on a year to date basis  While the stock returned 16 1   the industry gained 15 8  in that time frame 

The outperformance can be attributed to DST s strong business model  The company generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from long term contracts 
DST Systems  strong balance sheet provides it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder friendly initiatives as well as scope for product and geographical expansions  The company exited the last quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly  260 4 million 
We believe that dividend payments and share repurchases not only enhance shareholder return but also raise the market value of the stock  Through dividend payouts  companies bolster investor confidence  persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip  Looking ahead  DST remains confident of its growth potential  thereby raising hopes for further enhancement of shareholder value through share buybacks 
Some other companies with a consistent track record of returning excess cash through share repurchases and dividend payments include Yahoo  Inc    NASDAQ YHOO    Arrow Electronics   NYSE ARW   and Accenture plc   NYSE ACN

139297,360812,ACN,Accenture  ACN  Buys E commerce Solution Provider Media Hive,opinion,"In an effort to expand its agency business  global consulting giant  Accenture Plc   NYSE ACN    yesterday announced the acquisition of Media Hive  an e commerce solution provider  However  financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps 
Media Hive will join the Accenture Interactive platform  part of the company s digital marketing services arm  Accenture Digital  Accenture Interactive was formed in 2009 to deliver superior consulting  technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers  CMOs  
Founded in 2003 by Thomas McGee and Greg O Keeffe  Media Hive helps its clients in transforming their businesses through its expertise in providing cross channel commerce strategies  developing custom applications and creating innovative retail experience for any device 
Therefore  the integration of Media Hive s expertise will help Accenture in enhancing its Interactive capabilities in implementing Salesforce   NYSE CRM   Commerce Cloud and delivering best in class commerce experience for its clients  Notably  Salesforce Commerce Cloud was earlier known as  in July last year 
Shares of Accenture gained slightly over 1  yesterday  Notably  the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the year to date period   The industry gained 3 3   while the stock returned 4 4  during the aforementioned period 

Enhancing Digital Capabilities
Since the formation of Accenture Interactive  the company has made significant acquisitions to enhance its digital marketing capabilities  including the acquisition of Reactive Media  an Australian digital services provider and Brightstep  a Swedish digital content and commerce solution provider 
In November last year  Accenture acquired privately held UK based creative advertisement agency  Karmarama  a full service digital agency  In this year so far  Accenture has acquired a majority stake in IMJ Corporation and SinnerSchrader AG  Prior to that  Accenture acquired AD Dialeto  Pacific Link and Chaotic Moon  These acquisitions are part of the company s efforts to boost its digital marketing capabilities globally 
In our opinion  the acquisition of Media Hive will further help Accenture to provide end to end digital marketing services  which will bring a deeper and broader set of digital solutions to its clients  Notably  Media Hive will be Accenture s 11th acquisition globally  since 2013  under its Interactive platform 
Considering the growing need for digital marketing  we anticipate Accenture s investment in digital and marketing capabilities to be conducive to long term growth  It will also help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers  such as International Business Machines Corp    NYSE IBM    Dell and Deloitte 
Acquisitions   A Key Growth Strategy
Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets  Last year  the company completed or signed about 12 acquisition deals across various business segments  including IT security  CRM capabilities and strategy consulting  In 2015  it closed 21 takeovers 
These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into newer markets  diversify and broaden its product portfolio  and maintain the leading position  A strong cash balance of  3 24 billion and an operating cash flow of  1 24 billion at the end of second quarter fiscal 2017 are expected to support Accenture s inorganic growth strategy Accenture PLC Price

   Bottom Line
Accenture s long term prospects look promising due to its sustained focus on innovative product launches  continuous investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities  as well as major acquisitions  Moreover  we believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company s revenue stream 
The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

   Quarter EPS Estimate Change for Accenture StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock  you shouldn t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there  This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season which is obviously vital for momentum investors Right now  ACN is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter s earnings estimate projections  In the time frame  EPS estimates for Accenture have gone up by 1 5  compared to an industry average move of 0 0   suggesting that not only is ACN heading in the right direction  but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too ACN Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with ACN as of late too Over the past two months  11 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to no downward revisions for the full year  while we are also seeing 7 upward revisions with no downward revisions for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate  as two months ago ACN was expected to post earnings of  5 82 share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  5 90 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have ACN as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep ACN on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-10-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-accenture-(acn)-200158430,200158430
139365,360880,ACN,Business Services Stock Outlook   October 2016,opinion,"The business services sector provides ancillary services to the other players in the market  Hence  the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another  Importantly  this dynamism opens the door to many business services companies 
Notably  business service accounts for a major portion of a country s gross domestic product  GDP  with the gradual shift in the global economy having moved from agriculture to industry to now business services  The sector  therefore  plays a major role in a country s overall development 
The intensely competitive business services sector must rigorously work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues so that its profitability does not suffer  A focus on functions and activities close to its core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale  besides improving competitive positioning 
The fortunes of business service operators are closely tied to the health of the broader economy  As per the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA   domestic economy has been expanding  at a rate of 0 8  in the first quarter of 2016 and 1 4  in the second quarter  on higher contribution from personal consumption expenditures and increased residential fixed investment  The growth momentum is now expected to accelerate by 1 5  in 2016 and 2 5  in 2017 
This improving outlook for the U S  economy is therefore a net positive for the sector  Though the bureau presently estimates total industrial production to decline 1  in 2016  the same is expected to be on the growth trajectory in 2017  with an estimated increase of 1 4   thus offering opportunities of growth and expansion to business service providers  Moreover  a projected rise in expenditure should lend support to the business service sector 
Economic sensitivity aside  business service companies are quite conservatively managed  with a large number of players sharing their excess cash with shareholders through dividends and share buybacks 
Nonetheless  the business service sector is highly fragmented  with no single service provider enjoying market dominance  As per business reports  the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25  to the overall revenue  However  given its unique nature  Zacks has classified the group as one of the 16 sectors  the S P s official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the  Industrials  sector   Notably  with about 3 4  of total market capitalization  the sector is estimated to have 2 9  share of income in 2016

139413,360928,ACN,Seeking High Quality Dividend Growth Stocks  Try Accenture,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  is the type of high quality dividend growth stock I like to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio 
The company has raised its dividend every year since it began paying one in 2005  recording annual dividend growth greater than 20  during that time period 
Accenture s dividend scores extremely high marks for safety and growth thanks to the company s healthy payout ratios  excellent free cash flow generation  clean balance sheet  and proven durability 
Let s take a closer look at Accenture as a potential investment opportunity for investors building a dividend portfolio Business OverviewAccenture is one of the largest professional services companies in the world and provides a range of end to end services and solutions in strategy  consulting  digital technology  and operations  Accenture develops and implements technology solutions to improve its clients  productivity and efficiency 
The company was started in the 1950s and now serves more than 40 industries and delivers virtually every business function needed by its customers 
Accenture s clients include 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and over 80  of the Fortune Global 500  Approximately 54  of Accenture s revenue is generated from consulting with the remaining 46  from outsourcing activities 
By geography  North America is the company s largest region and accounts for 47  of total revenue  Europe generates another 35  of revenue  and the remaining 17  are from growth markets such as Brazil 
By operating group  Accenture generates 25  of its sales from Products  consumer goods  retail  travel services  industrial  life sciences   21  from Financial Services  banking  capital markets  insurance   20  from Communications  Media and Tech  18  from Health and Public Service  and 15  from Resources  chemicals  energy  utilities  natural resources  Business AnalysisAccenture s competitive advantages begin with its long operating history  wide range of services  and focus on developing its people 
The company has been in business for more than 60 years  which has given it the time needed to establish long lasting customer relationships and build out its portfolio of skills and services 
The longer Accenture works with a client  the more ingrained it becomes in the client s business processes and key strategic issues  As a result  switching costs are created that help with client retention 
For example  97 of the firm s top 100 clients have worked with Accenture for at least 10 years  The firm also owns one of the 50 most valuable brands in the world and is a trusted partner 
Few companies can match the breadth and reach of Accenture s services  which is a requirement to serve large multinational clients  The company has offices in more than 50 countries around the world and is able to deliver end to end solutions virtually anywhere 
Accenture delivers its services through nearly 20 focused industry groups and consistently acquires smaller rivals to round out its services  The company has invested about  2 5 billion in nearly 40 acquisitions over its last three fiscal years to enhance its skills and gain scale in key growth areas such as digital 
As the pace of technological advancements accelerates  Accenture is becoming an even more important partner for its clients because it helps them be the digital disruptors rather than the disruptors 
From 3D printing  cloud computing  data analytics  and security to virtual reality and robotics  Accenture plays a leading role in helping its clients go more digital with their products and services 
Digital related  cloud related  and security related services now represent close to 40  of Accenture s revenue and are growing at a double digit clip 
Accenture has a clear lead in the digital arena  which is fueling a lot of the company s growth  For example  Accenture is the number one enterprise services provider for the cloud 
The company does cloud services for nearly 80  of the Fortune 100 and is the number one provider to all of the leading players in the ecosystem today such as Oracle  NYSE ORCL   SAP  NYSE SAP   and Salesforce  NYSE CRM  
Above all else  Accenture is a human capital business  The firm s services are provided by its people  and the company must differentiate based on its expertise and trust accumulated with clients 
To stay ahead of the pack  Accenture spends heavily on its employees  The company invested more than  800 million on training and development in fiscal year 2015  This is more than double the amount that Accenture invested in property and equipment and represented more than  2 000 per employee 
With over 375 000 employees  including thousands of PhDs  web developers  data scientists  digital marketers  and big data specialists  Accenture s skilled workforce would be very hard to replicate   especially on a global scale 
As a capital light business  Accenture also benefits from being able to adapt its business model somewhat more easily to changing conditions  The company can hire  train  or acquire new personnel to fill holes in its services portfolio and stay ahead of trends  This is much easier than retooling a large manufacturing factory 
Headcount can also be adjusted up or down based on the economy s strength  helping Accenture better manage its profitability 
A final strength of the firm is its diversity  Approximately 80  of its revenue is derived from nine industry markets  and Accenture s nine largest geographic markets also account for 80  of sales  The firm s top 150 clients account for just over half of total revenue  too 
Simply put  Accenture is a very durable business with numerous intangible assets  e g  brand recognition  skilled workforce  long term client relationships  that make it hard to disrupt 
With that said  every business still faces risks 
Key RisksAccenture believes that 25  of the world s economy will be digital by 2020  up from 15  in 2005 
While the ongoing shift to digital is helping a large chunk of Accenture s business today  it goes without saying that the digital revolution is causing many companies to face an unprecedented amount of change   including Accenture 
One example would be the rise of software as a service  SaaS   which is taking market share from on premise deployments of software 
SaaS deployments are smaller in size  which means less revenue available for parts of Accenture s outsourcing business  IBM  NYSE IBM  has certainly been caught off guard by a number of technological advancements  e g  cloud computing   which have really hurt its business in recent years 
For now  Accenture s core businesses have continued to grow  The company s digital offerings have also done extremely well  but it s worth keeping an eye on the impact technology changes could have on Accenture s business model and long term earnings power 
Besides technological changes  most of Accenture s markets are extremely competitive  The company s long term future could be hurt if cheaper overseas competitors begin to pressure the industry s pricing model or if clients move some of Accenture s services in house 
For now  I believe Accenture s favorable competitive positioning remains intact Dividend Analysis  AccentureWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Accenture s Dividend Safety Score of 100 suggests that the company s dividend is one of the safest available in the market  The company s payout ratios are one of the most important financial ratios supporting Accenture s strong dividend safety 
Over the last four quarters  Accenture s dividend payments have consumed approximately 40  of the free cash flow and earnings the company has generated 
As seen below  Accenture s dividend payout ratios have increased over the last decade and hovered close to 40  in recent years  This is a healthy level because it provides plenty of room for future dividend growth and a nice margin of safety in case business fundamentals unexpectedly declined Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Besides payout ratios  a company s recession performance is another important factor to consider when evaluating dividend safety  Cyclical companies that experience large swings in sales and earnings can be more vulnerable to future dividend cuts 
Accenture performed fairly well during the last recession  As seen below  the company s sales only dipped by 8  in fiscal year 2009  and its operating margin remained resilient  The company s stock also outperformed the S P 500 by nearly 30  in 2008  Many companies did much worse than Accenture 
Accenture s business performed relatively well throughout the recession because its services are needed by businesses through each stage of the economic cycle  As technology continues advancing  companies must continue investing in innovation and productivity to remain competitive 
Accenture can also help companies reduce their spending  save costs  and better align their operations for future opportunities Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Another factor supporting Accenture s strong Dividend Safety Score is the firm s consistent free cash flow generation  Without free cash flow  companies cannot continue paying dividends unless they issue debt or equity  I only invest in companies that consistently generate free cash flow  and Accenture is no exception 
Accenture has generated positive free cash flow each year for more than a decade  highlighting the quality of its asset light business model  The company even grew its free cash flow per share each year during the last recession Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Analyzing a company s return on invested capital is important because it provides clues about a company s economic moat and ability to quickly compound earnings 
Businesses that earn high returns on invested capital create economic value and typically have a stronger ability to pay dividends 
Accenture s business requires very little capital to run  As I mentioned earlier  the company spent more on training its employees last year than it did on purchases of capital equipment and property 
As seen in the chart below  Accenture s asset light business model has generated a superb return on invested capital over the last decade  highlighting its moat and ability to compound earnings Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Studying a company s balance sheet is also critical to gain an understanding of its dividend safety  Businesses will always make debt payments before distributing dividends  and companies with too much debt can be at greater risk of dividend cuts if financial results unexpectedly deteriorate 
Accenture s balance sheet is in fantastic shape  As seen below  the company has  3 5 billion in cash and practically no debt  It maintains investment grade credit ratings and could cover its current dividend payment for nearly three years just by using its cash on hand Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Accenture s dividend is extremely safe  The company maintains healthy payout ratios  generates consistent free cash flow  earns strong returns  and has a rock solid balance sheet Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Accenture s Dividend Growth Score of 96 suggests that the company has some of the strongest dividend growth potential in the market 
Accenture began paying dividends in late 2005  and the company has increased its dividend every year since then  With a 10 year dividend growth streak  Accenture is a member of the Dividend Achievers list 
As seen below  Accenture s dividend growth has been excellent  The company s dividend has increased by 21 6  per year over the last decade and grown at a double digit annual rate over the last three years 
The company s last dividend increase was an 8  boost in late 2015  and investors should be aware that Accenture pays its dividends on a semi annual schedule Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Dividend growth over the next few years will likely sit in the mid  to upper single digit range  tracking Accenture s underlying earnings growth 
Management could grow Accenture s dividend at a meaningfully faster rate considering the company s practically debt free balance sheet   3 billion hoard of cash  stable business fundamentals  and healthy payout ratios near 40  ValuationShares of Accenture trade at a forward looking P E multiple of 21 6 and offer a dividend yield of 1 9   which is somewhat lower than the stock s five year average dividend yield of 2 1  
Accenture estimates that its market is growing close to 4  per year  Over the long run  it seems unlikely that Accenture would be able to grow much faster than the overall market given its existing large size  over  30 billion in annual revenue  and the law of large numbers 
If Accenture clocks in mid single digit revenue growth over the long term  it seems reasonable to expect the company s underlying earnings per share to grow at a somewhat faster pace   perhaps mid  to upper single digit annual growth 
For comparison s sake  Accenture s earnings per share and free cash flow per share have compounded at 12 3  and 7 9  per year  respectively  over the last five years 
Under these assumptions  Accenture s annual total return potential is approximately 8 11   1 9  dividend yield plus 6 9  annual earnings growth  
The stock appears to be reasonably valued to me but certainly doesn t look cheap either  High quality businesses rarely go on sale 
ConclusionAccenture reminds me of some of my favorite blue chip dividend stocks  The company provides timeless services  consulting and outsourcing   benefits from its brand recognition and breadth of services  participates in extremely large and fragmented markets  and has a long runway for earnings and dividend growth 
Dividend growth investors should keep an eye on this high quality stock  While Accenture s dividend yield is relatively low  the company s long term total return potential remains strong ",2016-07-20,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acn:-seeking-high-quality-dividend-growth-stocks-try-accenture-200143051,200143051

139514,361029,ACN,June s Most Attractive Dangerous Stocks,opinion,"Our Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks for June were made available to the public at midnight on Wednesday  May saw some strong performances from our picks  Most Attractive small cap stock CTC Media  NASDAQ CTCM  gained 19   and large cap SanDisk Corporation  NASDAQ SNDK  rose 12  
Our Most Dangerous stocks   0 8   rose by less than the S P 500   2 1   and outperformed as a short portfolio  By far the biggest decliner in the portfolio was PowerSecure International  NYSE POWR   which declined 62  in May after a poor Q1 results  POWR shares crashed two days after our report was made available to subscribers  but before it was released for public purchase 
These successes underscore the benefit of our diligence  Being a true value investor is an increasingly difficult  if not impossible  task  By scrupulously analyzing every word in annual reports  our research protects investors  portfolios and allows our clients to execute value investing strategies with more confidence and integrity 
11 new stocks make our Most Attractive list and 12 new stocks fall onto the Most Dangerous list this month 
Our Most Attractive stocks have high and rising return on invested capital  ROIC  and low price to economic book value ratios  Most Dangerous stocks have misleading earnings and long growth appreciation periods implied in their market valuations 
Most Attractive Stock Feature For June  Syntel  Inc   SYNT    82 share 
Syntel Inc   NASDAQ SYNT  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive stocks for June  SYNT is down 10  this year  but unlike many of the other beat up tech stocks  it has positive and growing economic earnings 
SYNT s long track record of growth and profitability is hard to match  Over the past ten years  SYNT has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 20  compounded annually while maintaining an average ROIC of 57   Figure 1 gives more detail 

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Sometimes  such a high ROIC can be a warning sign for future regression to the mean  but a look at SYNT s competitors shows such a fear is unwarranted in this case  Accenture  NYSE ACN  earns a 60  ROIC and Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH  earns a 40  ROIC  IT consulting and outsourcing is a low capital intensity business  so high ROICs are more the norm 
One area of concern is SYNT s high level of customer concentration  10 customers make up 77  of its revenue  and the largest  American Express  NYSE AXP   accounts for 25  of total revenue  On the positive side  SYNT has shown itself to be adept at retaining customers  97  of SYNT s revenue in 2013 came from repeat clients 
SYNT s most recent Form 10 Q also contains some encouraging results  SYNT grew revenues in its  Retail  Logistics  and Telecom  and  Healthcare and Life Sciences  segments by 79  and 30  year over year  respectively  Strong growth in these segments shows that the company is making some headway in diversifying its businesses aside from its largest segment   Banking and Financial Services  
One would expect a growing  highly profitable company to also command a premium valuation  but the market has surprisingly low expectations for SYNT  Its current valuation of   82 share gives it a price to economic book value ratio of 1 2  which implies that the company will only grow NOPAT by 20  for the remainder of its corporate life 
Even with a modest expectation of just 8  NOPAT growth for the next 10 years  SYNT has a fair value of   105 share  Given its track record of profit growth  SYNT looks like a good bet to meet or even exceed that expectation 
Most Dangerous Stock Feature For June  LoJack Corporation  LOJN   5 50 share 
LoJack Corporation  NASDAQ LOJN  is one of the additions to the Most Dangerous list this month  The stock has become significantly more dangerous over the last month due to its 16  increase in valuation 
LOJN has fallen far since its peak in the mid 2000 s when it neared  30 share  2014 has seen a mini resurgence for the stock however  as LOJN has soared 50  on earnings beats and bullish analyst write ups  Digging deeper into the numbers shows that LOJN s earnings are misleading and its valuation implies unrealistic growth expectations 
LOJN reported  3 2 million in GAAP net income for 2013  but the vast majority of that income came from non operating items  Primarily  LOJN benefited from 
  primarily attributable to a gain on the sale of the company s shares in Absolute Software 
A  due to a legal settlement 
A  to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
A  2 6 million  
All these items could be found either on the income statement or the cash flow statement  so there s really no excuse for investors not to identify these items and make the necessary adjustments  Once all the non operating items are removed  we can see that LOJN s true NOPAT was only  0 15 million for 2013 
By looking at NOPAT rather than accounting earnings  we can see just how much growth is baked into LOJN s valuation  In order to justify   5 50 share  LOJN would need to grow NOPAT by 40  compounded annually for 12 years 
Given LOJN s recent track record of declining margins and profits  the growth implied by its stock price seems unrealistic  Management s decision to shift to pre installed units on cars has helped stabilize revenue  but it has hurt margins  Meanwhile  LOJN s goal of providing a full  connected car  experience is still in its early stages  and the company faces significant competition on that front from large companies such as AT T  T  
I ve written before about why performance chasing in the stock market is a bad idea  LOJN has been a high flyer in 2014  while SYNT has been a dud  However  looking at the fundamentals  rather than the price movement  shows that SYNT is primed to reward investors while LOJN carries significant risk

139518,361033,ACN,Insider News Reveals Second Oil Crash Coming,opinion,"Oil producers and investors started to breathe a little easier recently 
Crude oil prices touched their lowest closing level in six years last week  then rallied on the back of a weakening U S  dollar 
The  started to diminish after  that rates won t rise any time soon 
Many optimists are expecting oil prices to continue to rise  But that s just wishful thinking 
You see  I m in Hong Kong right now  and my contacts have revealed some startling facts 
The Catastrophic Reality
The truth is  we may be on the verge of another price collapse that s likely to occur in the second quarter 
Inventories are continuing to rise  and storage tanks are close to capacity  With nowhere for the oil to go  suppliers will likely flood the market  which could cause a plunge in prices that will force the industry to lower production 
That will be the point of capitulation 
This might seem like an outrageous prediction  but the chance of such a scenario taking place isn t far fetched when you consider the factors that may precipitate such an event 
Inventories can only climb if one of two things are occurring  Either less oil is being consumed or too much is being produced 
Well  both of these factors are at play concurrently right now 
The latest figures coming out of Cushing  Oklahoma show that capacity is between 60  and 75   Early last year  the daily figures were half that 
At the current rate of production and consumption  capacity is estimated to be reached by the end of May 
Smaller producers are making the situation more difficult by producing even more in an effort to try to capture hedges while premiums still exist  Hedges can be put on for 2016 at premiums of up to  10 more than current spot prices  And when you have debt to service  any increase in projected cash flows is critical 
To further exacerbate the situation  oil is priced in dollars  And as the dollar strengthens  the price weakens 
There is also a wildcard that could spur a short term rise in prices  Rebels have toppled Yemen s government and Saudi Arabia started employing defense tactics  Yemen s proximity to Saudi Arabia could be perceived as a threat to oil production  sparking a temporary rise in demand and prices 
But the insider story that could fill storage to capacity comes from 8 000 miles away in China 
The Last Straw
My sources in Hong Kong  who are connected to major players on the mainland  are indicating that the slowdown in China may be even greater than the official numbers 
China s  official  growth rate fell to 7 4  in 2014  the lowest in 25 years  But other sources are saying it will be lower 
The International Monetary Fund is projecting growth to come in at 6 8  in 2014  Analysts from Oxford Economics  a well respected consulting firm that covers global markets with the likes of Accenture plc  NYSE ACN   are calling for growth to come in at 6  
China s own economic leadership estimates that growth must be at least 7  to maintain adequate employment for a growing work force  I m sure the official numbers from China will be above 7   but those numbers shouldn t be trusted 
As China s economy slows  the country will demand less oil  The resulting excess oil could fill storage tanks to capacity 
That will be the point of capitulation  which provides excellent entry points across the investing spectrum 
As we all know  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  if it culled production  But just a few days ago  OPEC reiterated its goal of continuing to produce at current levels until another country curtails production first 
Saudi Arabia seems firm in its plan and is not open to negotiating  Last week  the Algerians tried to convene a summit to discuss prices  but only Angola showed up  Last month  the Nigerians wanted a meeting of OPEC members  but the idea was squashed by the Saudis 
Everyone is feeling the pain  but we re not yet at the point where the pain is significant enough to spur the major players into action  When the price begins to trade south of  40 for a sustained period  we may start to see movement to curtail production globally 
The risk to oil prices is still tilted to the downside  and investors should be keeping their powder dry at this point 
And the chase continues

139520,361035,ACN,Here s Why Accenture Is Gaining,opinion,"Accenture  NYSE ACN  is having an incredibly strong day in the market today  and for good reason  The company recently reported its earnings for the most recent quarter  blowing away all expectations  As a result  investors are incredibly excited about the stock  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from earnings  how investors reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from ACN moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
ACN Blows Away Earnings Expectations
As mentioned above  ACN reported its earnings for the second fiscal quarter before the opening bell this morning as expected  The earnings were overwhelmingly positive  blowing away consensus estimates with regard to how the company would perform  Here s what we saw   
Top Line Revenue   In terms of top line revenue  Accenture came in well ahead of analyst expectations  In the quarter  it was expected that the company would produce revenue in the amount of  7 72 billion  However  ACN actually reported revenue in the amount of  7 95 billion 
Earnings   Not only did ACN beat revenue expectations  it came in well ahead on earnings as well  During the quarter  analysts expected that the company would report earnings in the amount of  1 18 per share  However  the company actually reported earnings  0 16 ahead of estimates at  1 34 per share 
Guidance   As if beating earnings and revenue expectations isn t enough to get investors excited  the company also reported guidance that was overwhelmingly positive  In the third fiscal quarter  ACN is expecting to produce revenue in the range between  8 10 billion and  8 35 billion  This is at the high end of analyst expectations at  8 17 billion  For the full year  Accenture expects to report earnings in the range of  5 21 to  5 32 per share  a notch up from previous guidance between  5 09 and  5 24 per share 
How Investors Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that when positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with that company  Well  there are few pieces of news that are more positive in the eyes of investors than solid earnings and guidance  As a result  investors are excited and ACN is climbing in the market  Currently  10 25   the stock is trading at  110 98 per share after a gain of  3 32 per share or 3 08  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I m expecting to see overwhelmingly positive movement out of ACN  The truth is that investors want to see growth  and solid earnings are a clear indication that a company is well capable of growth  What makes this even more incredible is the fact that the European economy has been struggling in a big way  and even through that  ACN was able to produce solid gains  All in all  I m expecting to see strong growth moving forward ",2016-03-24,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/accenture-(acn)-stock:-here’s-why-it’s-gaining-today-200122791,200122791
