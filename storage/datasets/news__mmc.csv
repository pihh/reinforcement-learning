151483,372999,MMC,Global insurance first half M A value hits highest level since financial crisis,news," Reuters    Global insurance mergers and acquisitions rose to 37 billion euros in the first six months of 2018  with a host of mega deals resulting in the highest first half total since the financial crisis  a report by Willis Towers Watson  O WLTW  and Mergermarket showed 
The first half saw 14 insurance deals worth over 500 million euros   567 80 million   but total deal volume fell to 84 deals  the lowest number since 2009  the report showed 
The report cited the changing nature of business models as a driver for deals  with regulatory pressures leading to new models and more firms trying to return to their core strategy  
The report also said companies are divesting unwanted parts of their business  meaning that valuable assets are once again on the market  The report included completed deals with a value of at least  5 million 
For private equity investors  record levels of inflow   with cash reserves reaching  1 trillion in 2017   has driven interest in insurance assets  leading to complex acquisitions from these buyers in 2018 
Private equity firm Bain Capital agreed to buy esure  L ESUR  for 1 21 billion pounds in August  ending over two years of speculation around the British insurer being a takeover target for U S  private equity firms 
According to the report regulatory change has played a big role in the U S   as tax reform in the country has provided an immediate boost to company earnings since the turn of the year 
 Debt continues to be cheap  and following the recent tax reforms  U S  companies have been given a steroid kick  We will continue to see an active M A market   Managing Director at Willis Towers Watson Jack Gibson  said 
 It s just a matter of paying the right price and overcoming the hurdles that have led to deals taking longer to consummate and perhaps driving the lower number of deals this year  
Earlier in September  U S  financial services group Marsh   McLennan Companies Inc  N MMC  agreed to buy  Jardine Lloyd  Thompson  L JLT  valuing the British insurance and reinsurance broker at about 4 3 billion pounds 
The report highlighted growing investment from Asian companies  but said political and economic uncertainty could affect global dealmaking  with volatility surrounding Britain s impending exit from the European Union and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington threatening appetites 
The period also saw seven deals in the reinsurance sector and  Swiss Re   S SRENH  expects the global reinsurance industry to consolidate as the distinction between insurers and reinsurers become increasingly blurred ",2018-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-insurance-firsthalf-ma-value-hits-highest-level-since-financial-crisis-1666903,1666903

151485,373001,MMC,Pension adviser Mercer cautions on Fisher Investments,news,"By Ross Kerber
NEW YORK  Reuters    Pension adviser Mercer has cautioned clients about Fisher Investments in the wake of off color comments by firm founder Ken Fisher  citing concerns of a potential loss of assets and staff turnover  according to an Oct  16 memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday 
It is the latest fallout for Fisher which has faced client outflows of  3 billion following Fisher s remarks that critics have said were sexist 
Mercer did not suggest clients terminate the firm as rival pension adviser NEPC has done  however  This stance which could help Fisher as it campaigns to keep assets 
A Fisher representative did not comment 
Mercer and NEPC are among an influential group that counsels pension plans and other institutions on which investment managers they should hire to handle assets 
In the memo Mercer  part of Marsh   McLennan Cos  N MMC   said it has added the term  provisional  to its ratings of Fisher products  A Mercer spokesman said it does not comment on individual ratings 
A Florida State Board of Administration spokesman said via email that  provisional  means  there is uncertainty about a rating that Mercer expects to resolve quickly  
The board  for which Fisher manages  168 million  on Tuesday provided the Mercer research memo dated Oct  16 in response to a public records request  and an Oct  14 memo in which Mercer first added the provisional qualifier 
The board had previously said it was reviewing Fisher s firm in the wake of his comments at an Oct  8 investment conference  for which he has apologized 
Mercer wrote that after a conference call with Fisher Investments  top executives  though not with Fisher himself  it would keep monitoring factors including the stability of the firm s investment teams and assets under management  or AUM  and that it could further change ratings 
 We remain mindful that concerns regarding potential AUM loss and staff turnover may take time to play out   Mercer wrote 
So far withdrawals at Mercer have been just a fraction of its  114 billion under management 
According to an attendee of the Oct  8 conference  Fisher made derogatory remarks about genitalia and picking up girls  among other topics  Fisher has apologized in several forums  although he initially pushed back on some criticism 
In an Oct  10 note to clients that Mercer s Oct  14 memo included  Fisher apologized but rejected the idea his remarks were sexist  Fisher wrote that attention his comments received on social media  deliberately mischaracterizes them  ",2019-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pension-adviser-mercer-cautions-on-fisher-investments-2007127,2007127

 Reuters    American International Group Inc  N AIG  on Thursday named Peter Zaffino  the executive overseeing a turnaround effort of the company s general insurance unit  as the company s president 
Zaffino  AIG s global chief operating officer and chief of its general insurance business  will continue to serve in those roles when he becomes president on Jan  1  2020  AIG said

Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorWelcome to Marsh   McLennan Companies conference call  Today s conference is being recorded  Fourth quarter 2019 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning  They are available on the company s website at   Please note that remarks made today may include forward looking statements  Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements  For a more detailed discussion of those factors  please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings  including our most recent Form 10 K  all of which are available on the MMC website  During the call today  we may also discuss certain non GAAP financial measures  For a reconciliation of those measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures  please refer to the schedule in today s earnings release  I will now turn the conference over to Dan Glaser  president and CEO of Marsh   McLennan Companies Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Holly  Good morning  and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today  I m Dan Glaser  president and CEO of Marsh   McLennan  Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney  our CFO  and the CEOs of our businesses  John Doyle of Marsh  Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter  Martine Ferland of Mercer  and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman  Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt  head of investor relations  2019 was a remarkable year for Marsh   McLennan  We completed the acquisition of JLT  the largest deal in our history while delivering strong financial results and managing the global integration  MMC is well positioned Our talent  capabilities  expertise and leadership has never been stronger  The addition of world class talented JLT complements our best in class teams in Marsh   McLennan  And while we still have work to do  we feel good about how the cultures are coming together  Nearly all our teams are now sitting together  And more and more  we are in the market working as one  We finished the year with revenue of  16 7 billion  up 11   This represents our highest annual top line growth in 20 years and is a step change for us  On a run rate basis  we now have over  17 billion of annual revenue  We had an excellent year and are pleased that in the midst of the integration  we generated underlying growth of 4   the tenth year in a row where our underlying growth was in the 3  to 5  range  14  adjusted NOI growth  110 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 7  adjusted EPS growth  consistent with our guidance of modest dilution in the first year of the deal  We met our capital management objectives to reduce our share count and increase our dividend by double digits  and we are running ahead of schedule on acquisition related cost savings  We now expect run rate savings of at least  350 million  and we will continue to drive for additional operating efficiencies  Overall  I am pleased with our performance in 2019  We consistently challenge ourselves to balance delivering for today while positioning for sustained growth in the future  even in an exceptional year like 2019  We continue to invest in Marsh   McLennan Agency  our fast growing U S  middle market brokerage business  completing five acquisitions in 2019  resulting in current run rate revenue of  1 7 billion  and we have a robust pipeline for 2020  We made additional investments in digital  technology and analytics  We see further opportunities to leverage technology to expand in small commercial  as well as streamline and automate our business  We also see increasing opportunity to leverage the collective strength  expertise and relationships across our businesses to deliver enhanced value to clients and drive growth  Lastly  2019 saw the seamless transition of leadership at Mercer with Martine taking over as CEO  Martine moved quickly to install new leadership in key areas  energize the workforce and implement changes that streamline the operating model  create more efficiency and enable better execution  As we conclude 2019  we emerge a stronger firm than we started out the year with record revenue  record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share  As we look to the future  there is significant uncertainty in the world  given current global issues like geopolitical risk  negative interest rates  trade friction  extreme weather and climate change  pandemic risk and cyber risk  We come to the fore in these dynamic times by providing trusted support to our clients in the areas of risk  strategy and people  Marsh   McLennan provided thought leadership on key global issues at the world economic forum in Davos  This marks the 15th consecutive year we produced the annual global risk report  together with the world economic forum  The report ranks the top global risks  And this year  climate  and weather related risk created the greatest concern  Climate change was the most prominent issue discussed at Davos  and there is growing recognition of the urgency of both mitigation and adaptation  We are engaged with our clients across all of our businesses on helping them assess the impact of the change in climate  Mercer and Oliver Wyman led sessions on general quality  longevity  responsible investment and AI readiness  Despite all the uncertainty in the world  I am optimistic  Business leaders continue to push for growth and investment despite near term risks and fears about the longer term implications of climate change  The perspectives and insights we provide on these topics are a reminder of the uniqueness of MMC and the value we bring to our clients  Let me spend a moment on current P C insurance pricing trends  Pricing is firming across a wide range of geographies and lines  The Marsh Global Insurance market index saw an increase of nearly 11  in the fourth quarter compared with 8  in the third quarter  6  in the second quarter and 3  in the first  Global property insurance and financial and professional lines saw the highest average renewal rate increases at 13  and 18   respectively  Casualty rates are up 3  on average  up slightly versus the third quarter  Commercial auto and excess casualty continue to see rates rising  while workers  comp continues to see rates decline  Note that the Marsh Index skews to larger risks which are seeing higher increases  although middle market and small commercial insurance rates are up in certain geographies  Turning to reinsurance  the Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate On Line Index rose by 5  at the January 1 renewals  Total dedicated reinsurance capital increased by approximately 2  at year end  Although renewal outcomes vary widely across individual programs  capacity is tightened in some stressed classes by commercial auto  D O  medical professional and general liability  The retrocessional market continues to see meaningful increases in rates at January 1  driven  in part  by trapped capital  a lack of new alternative capital entrants and continued redemptions from third party investors  The overall global P C insurance market is challenging  and we continue to work hard to deliver the best solutions for our clients  It is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities shine  Turning to the fourth quarter  we are pleased with our results  Our overall revenue growth in the quarter was 15   Underlying revenue grew 3  with growth in both segments  Marsh grew 3  in the quarter on an underlying basis which is solid but slower than the prior quarter  as expected  due to a peak headwind on new business and a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018  Guy Carpenter finished the year strong with 10  underlying revenue growth in the quarter  Mercer delivered 4  underlying revenue growth in the quarter  the strongest growth since the first quarter of 2018  And Oliver Wyman declined by 2   as we expected  The overall fourth quarter saw a strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points and adjusted operating income growth of 17   As we consistently say  it is important not to overemphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over longer periods of time  Looking at the full year  we are pleased with our results  We generated strong overall revenue growth of 11  for the full year with 4  underlying growth  We demonstrated top line strength across our businesses while achieving the initial benefits of the integration  On an underlying basis  Marsh delivered solid growth of 4  for the second consecutive year  Guy Carpenter had strong year with 5  growth  Mercer had 2  growth  and Oliver Wyman grew 6  for the year despite the pullback in the fourth quarter  Our adjusted NOI grew 14  with overall margin expansion of 110 basis points for the year  marking the 12th consecutive year we have reported margin expansion  Adjusted EPS grew 7  or 8  on a constant currency basis  consistent with our guidance of modest adjusted EPS dilution in the first year of the JLT acquisition  In sum  2019 was an example of strong overall execution on multiple levels  As we look to 2020 and beyond  our future is bright  The addition of JLT enhances our competitive position  We are increasingly bringing our collective strength to clients  and we expect to see benefits from our investments in digital and technology  In 2020  we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3  to 5  range  margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth  With that  let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results  Mark McGivney    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Dan  and good morning  We are pleased with our fourth quarter results which capped a strong year in 2019  Consolidated revenue increased 15  in the quarter to  4 3 billion  reflecting underlying growth of 3  and the continued contribution from JLT  Operating income was  592 million  while adjusted operating income rose 17  to  856 million  Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21 9   GAAP EPS rose to  0 76  and adjusted EPS increased 9  to  1 19  Looking at risk and insurance services  fourth quarter revenue grew 24  to  2 4 billion and was up 3  on an underlying basis  a good result  considering the tough comparison Marsh faced with strong fourth quarter in 2018 and the fact that Q4 was JLT s seasonally largest quarter  Adjusted operating income increased 31  to  550 million  and the adjusted margin expanded 200 basis points to 25 7   For the year  revenue was  9 6 billion  an increase of 17  with solid underlying growth of 4   Adjusted operating income for the year was up an impressive 17   and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 50 basis points to 26 3   At Marsh  revenue in the quarter rose 23  to  2 2 billion  increasing 3  on an underlying basis  The U S  Canada division  underlying growth was 4  for the quarter and 5  for the full year  This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of 4  or higher underlying growth for U S  Canada  In the quarter  the international division had underlying growth of 1  with Asia Pacific  up 7   Latin America  up 2   and EMEA  down 1   For the full year  revenue at Marsh was  8 billion  an increase of 17  or 4  on an underlying basis  Guy Carpenter s revenue was  152 million  an increase of 10  on an underlying basis for the quarter  representing an outstanding finish to a strong year  The growth in the quarter benefited from strong results in North America  as well as growth in retrocessional  and an active quarter for GC security  For the year  revenue was  1 5 billion  an increase of 15  or 5  on an underlying basis  In the consulting segment  fourth quarter revenue increased 4  to  1 9 billion with underlying growth of 2   Consulting s adjusted operating income was flat year over year at  359 million  and the adjusted operating margin of 19 7  declined 60 basis points versus a year ago  But looking at the full year  margin expansion was solid  For the year  revenue was  7 1 billion  an increase of 5  with underlying growth of 3   Adjusted operating income for the year was up 9  to  1 3 billion  and our adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 18 6   Mercer s revenue increased 8  in the quarter to  1 3 billion with underlying growth of 4   Wealth increased 2  on an underlying basis with investment management up high single digits  and defined benefit  down low single digits  Our overall assets under management continued to grow  and at year end  exceeded  305 billion  up 5  sequentially and 26  year over year  Health revenue grew 6  on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter  reflecting strong growth in both international and the U S  Career grew 4  on an underlying basis with strong growth in the surveying products and digital implementation  For the year  revenue at Mercer was  5 billion  an increase of 6  or 2  on an underlying basis  Oliver Wyman s revenue in fourth quarter was  559 million  a decline of 2  on an underlying basis  As we said on our last call  we expected a pullback in the fourth quarter  For the full year  Oliver Wyman produced strong underlying revenue growth  6   We made great progress in 2019 on the JLT integration and are on plan or ahead of schedule on key milestones  We continue to expect the transaction will be modestly dilutive to adjusted EPS in the first year  neutral in year two and accretive in year three  We are ahead of schedule on cost savings and restructuring actions  We now estimate run rate savings of at least  350 million  We expect to incur approximately  625 million of cash costs to generate those savings  In addition  there will be approximately  75 million of noncash charges  mostly property related costs  as we consolidate our real estate footprint  We achieved approximately  125 million in savings through year end 2019 and expect to achieve the balance by the end of 2021  We also incurred  335 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in 2019 to achieve these savings as our expectation is the bulk of the remaining costs will be incurred in 2020 with a more modest amount extending into 2021  This update reflects the plans we have today  As we continue to get deeper into the integration  there is a possibility for more savings opportunities to emerge  As we look to the first quarter of 2020  keep in mind this is the last quarter where our year over year comparisons are impacted by JLT  Remember  in RIS  the first quarter is seasonally small for JLT  In addition  JLT s employee benefits margins are relatively low in the first quarter  and we expect this  along with some quarterly volatility  will result in a decline in first quarter consulting margins  However  for the full year  as Dan mentioned  we expect strong earnings growth  consolidated adjusted operating margin expansion  Turning back to the fourth quarter  Adjusted corporate expense was  53 million in the quarter  In the fourth quarter  we recorded  264 million of noteworthy items  the majority of which are related to the JLT acquisition  Included in the total are  143 million of JLT integration costs  the largest category of which is severance   17 million of JLT acquisition related costs   56 million of other restructuring costs  and  42 million of earn out true ups relating to prior acquisitions  As we typically do on our fourth quarter call  I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan  Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were  122 million in 2019  up slightly from the  112 million in 2018  We expect cash contributions in 2020 will be roughly  160 million  For 2020  we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be slightly lower than in 2019  Based on current expectations  we would assume roughly  264 million for this item in 2020  Investment income was  2 million in the fourth quarter for both GAAP and adjusted results  For the full year 2019  our GAAP investment income was  22 million  and adjusted investment income was approximately  12 million  For 2020  we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis  Foreign exchange was a slight headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter  and it had  0 05 per share negative impact for the full year 2019  Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels  we expect FX to be a slight headwind to adjusted EPS for 2020  Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23 4   compared with 23 6  in the fourth quarter last year  For the full year 2019  our adjusted tax rate was 24 1   Excluding discrete items  our adjusted tax rate for the full year was approximately 26   When we give forward guidance around our tax rate  we do not project discrete items  which can be positive or negative  Based on the current environment  it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25  and 26  for 2020  In the fourth quarter  we repurchased 1 8 million shares of our stock for  185 million  For the full year 2019  we repurchased 4 8 million shares for  485 million  Total debt at the end of 2019 was  12 billion  compared with  12 6 billion at the end of the third quarter  Next debt maturity is in March 2020 when  500 million of senior notes will mature  During the fourth quarter  we incurred  130 million of interest expense  We expect approximately the same amount in the first quarter of 2020  As we look to 2020  the framework for capital management we discussed in the early stages of JLT is still on track  This year  we currently expect to deploy approximately  2 6 billion to  2 9 billion of capital across three broad categories  debt reduction  dividend  in line with our objective of double digit increases annually  and a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases  Directionally  we currently expect the amount of capital deployed to be roughly equivalent across these three categories  This plan allows us to maintain our dividend growth objectives and meet the commitments for deleveraging we laid out when we announced JLT  It also provides flexibility for M A  We ve consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term  Our track record is good  as evidenced by our return on invested capital of nearly 20  over the last three years  Given our deleveraging plan and our acquisition pipeline  we currently do not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020  Ultimately  share repurchases later in the year will depend on how the M A pipeline develops  Our deleveraging should be largely complete by the end of this year  and we expect to have substantial flexibility in terms of capital deployment in 2021 and beyond  Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was  1 2 billion  Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled  444 million and included  24 million for acquisitions   235 million for dividends and  185 million for share repurchases  For the full year 2019  uses of cash totaled  7 5 billion and included  6 1 billion for acquisitions   890 million for dividends and  485 million for share repurchase  In summary  we are proud of what we accomplished in 2019  We are very much on track with the objectives we set when we announced the JLT acquisition  And as we look forward to 2020  our outlook is for another year of strong performance  With that  I m happy to hand it back to Dan Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Mark  Operator  we are ready to begin Q A  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  We will take our first question today from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Hi  Thanks  Good morning  So my first question  you guys updated the savings program for JLT today  It also seems like intangibles are coming in a good amount lower than when you guys had announced this deal  So I m just trying to  I guess  get from that  that you have these two tailwinds to your numbers  and you still are reaffirming  I guess  that the deal will be breakeven in 2020 and accretive in 2021  So what s the offset relative to your initial expectations that this deal might not be accretive sooner than you had expected Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer No  Actually  it s going to be  Elyse  accretive  consistent with our original expectations  And so the deal of this size  there s always a number of puts and takes  And as you mentioned  we think the cost savings are higher  We think the amortization is lower  but we also needed to divest some businesses  principally aerospace  but also some minority interest in other businesses  like CRP  here in the U S   which we did not anticipate going into the transaction  And so    and we also have some revenue headwinds that we had described before  Whether that was from new business pipeline issues or some staff inspections  those are things that we re grappling with  So you put it all together  and the deal is tracking in line with our original expectations  And our original expectations  I ll just remind everybody  were really good  That was going to be a good  solid financial transaction  which was also very strategic in nature for Marsh   McLennan as a company  And when we talk about things like accretion and dilution  it s always a level of how we re growing  So we expect 2020 to be a strong year in adjusted EPS growth  and that s what breakeven means to us Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  That s helpful  And then my second question  on last quarter s call  you guys had alluded to the overall margin for the company expanding more than the year to date level  It seems like the fourth quarter came in a little bit below your expectations  Was that just maybe a little bit weaker consulting margin  Just trying to understand what happened in the fourth quarter as we kind of think about the level of margin improvement going forward Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer We focus very much on earnings growth and top line growth much more than we do on margin  and we certainly don t really pay much attention to any one single quarter  We were satisfied for the year with 110 bps  and the fourth quarter was pretty consistent to the year  There s always a lot going on in all of our businesses  And so it s not that we look at one versus the other as in any way coming up short of what our expectations were  I mean  when I look at margins  in general  for the company  2019 is going to be our 12th consecutive year of margin expansion and really significant levels of margin expansion  You go back a decade  and we re up by 1 300 bps  You go back five years  we re up 450 bps plus in both segments and as a company  And so    but just to go back  I wouldn t look at any one quarter as being indicative  You need to look at longer periods of time  And margin expansion  for us  is an outcome of how we run the business  which is revenue growth almost always exceed expense growth  And that will give us margin expansion over time  And the only areas that we were really driving for some margin this year was in RIS  in parts of the portfolio  particularly  in Guy Carpenter that we felt we needed to adjust JLT to just more similar margin levels than what we had normally been operating within as Marsh   McLennan  Next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse  Please go ahead  Your line is open Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    Analyst Good morning  First question regarding the risk and insurance segment  Looking at the EMEA segment  growth there has been  let s call it  very  very low single digits for the past couple of years  Is that a pace that we should kind of    any color  is that a patient  maybe  we should expect thinking about into this year  And then I guess  also  LatAm growth  also just a little bit weaker in the second half of the year  Anything going on there and just thinking out till 2020 Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer So I ll take it a little bit  and then I ll hand over to John  Overall  we believe we re set up well in both EMEA and Latin America for future growth  not even in    not only in 2020  but beyond  Obviously  EMEA includes the U K   which has been our biggest area of overlap with JLT and where we knew we re going to be a bit choppy for a while  And so that s essentially when we look at the business  we unpack the different component parts of EMEA  But  John  do you want to add more to that John Doyle    Chief Executive Officer  Marsh Sure  Dan  Thanks  Big picture  23  GAAP growth in the quarter  It is very  very big growth  17  for the full year  4  underlying growth for the full year  So I was pleased with the results  As Dan noted  as we expected  in the U K   the underlying growth was impacted by integration related headwinds  and some first quarter challenges remain  But I will say I m encouraged by improvements in the underlying performance in the U K  We made some leadership changes now about 18 months ago in the U K   and they re setting the foundation for stronger growth going forward  And in Latin America  as I noted in the last call  again  integration related challenges  they ll persist through the first quarter  But Latin America remains a high growth region for us  So for the second quarter on  expect improved results there  And again  I wanted to say  I m pleased overall with the growth  I m quite proud of the team  We managed through a lot of change throughout all of 2019  and we maintained our focus on serving our clients in what s an increasingly challenging market as well  As Dan noted  we re a stronger team entering 2020  JLT is obviously a big part of that  but we also added Wortham in the year  18 and did a lot of work on integration of Wortham last year  And we added two top 100 firms in the United States to MMA as well  So I m quite excited about the team and how we re positioned as we enter 2020 Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer You got another one  Mike Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    Analyst That s helpful  Yes  Lastly  sticking on the brokerage space  Dan  in your prepared remarks  I think you said it was a challenging marketplace  I assume you re referring to what s maybe become  a hard market   And you can correct me if I m wrong  Just curious  does this challenging market also put a little bit pressure on Marsh s expense base  given your employees are working potentially even harder to represent their clients in this marketplace Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer We re built to operate well across cycles  and  I mean  the    I wouldn t necessarily classify the entire market is a hard market  It s certainly hard in pockets  And it s certainly true  as you noted  that Marsh and Guy Carpenter brokers have to run a lot harder to get things done and have to work really hard and creatively in order to serve clients in these challenging market conditions  And so we recognize that  We don t believe that that puts any overpressure on our expense levels  more than the fact that we recognize that our people are working harder than ever before  And we appreciate that  and we reward them for it  But our teams are driven by serving clients  and so that s what their focus is  So they re out there hustling  not in the belief that somehow their compensation or anything else is going to change  it s actually that they re focused on delivering for their clients  Next question  please OperatorOur next question today comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research  Please go ahead Ryan Tunis    Autonomous Research    Analyst Yes  Thanks  Good morning  Dan  I guess I was hoping maybe you might be able to quantify perhaps the type of drags you think right now the organic revenue growth rate is feeling because of  I want to say  disruption because of the JLT integration process  And was that worse this quarter than the third quarter  Is it still getting worse  Or is the magnitude of that lessening going forward Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  let me talk about that broadly because I think it s a good question  First of all  I d start with the basis  When I look at our underlying growth  I m pleased with 3  in the quarter  and I m really pleased with 4  for the year  If you look at the quarter  Guy Carpenter had a terrific quarter and a strong year  top and bottom line  Oliver Wyman  as expected  they had a tough quarter but 6  for the year  Mercer  4   solid for the fourth quarter and sequentially improving throughout the year  And again  Marsh  I m pleased with the 3   given  as we told you  there were some tough comps  both from Marsh s performance last year in the fourth quarter but also JLT s performance in the fourth quarter and the new business hurdle  which was a very big new business quarter for JLT last year  We had talked to you about the pipeline issues throughout the year  And so in the context of the largest acquisition in our history  I m quite happy with the underlying growth level  Although I just want to take another minute to talk about growth a little bit more because I understand the way you re looking at it  It s not the way I look at it  From my perspective  we ve had a tremendous growth year on multiple levels  and we have significantly outgrown our competitors  We ve outgrown our competitors in capabilities  in talent  our headcount of 10 000 people from this time last year  We ve outgrown our competitors in revenue and the number of clients  and it all starts with GAAP  There are certain times where GAAP is more important than underlying  And I think this year was one of those times  I mean  our total revenue is up 11  in 2019 and 15  in the fourth quarter  We look at RIS  RIS grew 24  in the fourth quarter  We ve been at it for 148 years  If it grows 24  in the quarter at a firm like ours  it s something  And as John was alluding to before  you need to look specifically in Marsh  Latin America was up 15  in the year  Asia Pacific  39   EMEA  16   all in 2019  And our base and our trajectory will be better for years and years to come as a result of the remarkable year we had in 2019 on a growth basis  If you have something else  Ryan Ryan Tunis    Autonomous Research    Analyst Yes  yes  Just    I guess  just on U S  Canada organic  a little bit of deceleration there  and kind of just curious for your perspective into 2020 thinking about the market conditions  Like does it doesn t seem to be a tailwind  How are you thinking about how all that comes together Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer I mean  U S  Canada performance has been terrific the last couple of years  But  John  do you want to talk about that a little bit more John Doyle    Chief Executive Officer  Marsh Yes  I m quite pleased with our team  Ryan  in the U S  and Canada  We had a terrific year this year  I would also remind you that we had 7  organic growth last year in    the underlying growth in the fourth quarter  Both MMA and Marsh had terrific years  We also had a very good finish to the year in Canada and quite a strong year there as well  Our MGA operations in the U S  are performing quite well as well  Our private client business did quite well from a growth perspective  On the specialty front  we had good growth in our credit specialties  Our private equity business  aviation did well  and the transaction risk and cyber are a couple of products that are growing nicely at the moment Ryan Tunis    Autonomous Research    Analyst Thank you Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Next question  please OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Yes  Thank you  Good morning  everybody  I was just curious  Dan  on your thoughts on how much    I guess  at a very high level  how much do you think there s more room to go on the legs of the P C overall pricing environment  I mean  is that going to peak  Do you say  I guess  a peak time for maybe by the end of this year  Or how much more room do you think there is to grow on the overall environment for pricing Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer That s a  64 question  I mean  at the end  you ve got different things at work  I think you ve got many insurance companies who are dissatisfied with the results they have achieved financially over the last several years  and so there was a factor impacting many companies at the same time  And they ve got a little blood in the eye  and they are looking to get back to a better position  You also have the thoughts around social inflation and how real that is and how it s impacting their book  As it rolls forward  you have pressures on the reinsurance side  And I ll go to John and Peter in a minute to give a little bit more  but there is pressure on the reinsurance side  which may build throughout the year  which will put some pressure on primary carriers  And so ultimately  it s a matter of what s the loss activity and the premium levels will  over time  reflect  whether it s in a benign environment or whether it s a harsh one  I mean  certainly  when I think about this year  I look at the level of catastrophe potential  And if it s a tough cat year  really  we re in for quite a ride  If it s a benign year in the Southeast  particularly  well  maybe some of the window is out of the cell  But I also think a lot has to do with how casualty develops  But why don t we start with the primary  And John    and then we ll go to reinsurance  just to talk more broadly about market conditions and maybe if we have any prognosis  But  John John Doyle    Chief Executive Officer  Marsh For me  it s an earnings driven market change  for sure  Dan talked about some of the trends continuing into the first quarter  There continues to be a very wide range of outcomes in markets around the world  I don t consider it a hard market  although it s certainly become more challenging for our clients  On a geography basis  Australia  the U S  and U K  wholesale are seeing the largest increases  In the U S   it s about 10  and going for the high teens average rate increase in Australia  In Asia  Continental Europe  Middle East  Latin America  U K  retail  more mid single digit price increases  You look at it from a product perspective  Dan  there  property is up 13  globally  financial lines  up 17   meaningful increases there  family  up 3   where we see a real mix where comp continues to be down  Excess liability  though  particularly in certain classes of business  are quite stressed at the moment  And public P L  particularly in the United States and Australia  are a couple of classes that are most challenging  I would note  Dan talked about this  again  but our index skews the large accounts  The middle market is flat to low single digits in many markets    in most markets around the world  but we re continuing to hear from underwriters  They re concerned about rising loss cost  as Dan noted  social inflation  or the impact of litigation funding on the claim environment  We re also observing and working with our clients through some challenging verdicts and large settlements in pharma  in chemicals and commercial auto and in P L  So there is no question  There s some stress in the loss environment  and it s difficult to predict where markets will head  but there are some storm on underwriting Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Peter Hearn    Chief Executive Officer  Guy Carpenter I think from a reinsurance standpoint  the market is responding very responsibly  And it s really been a function at one one  the pricing and the renewals were largely shaped by a couple of factors  deteriorating loss experience  a lack of new alternative capital and increasing challenges in the environment with regard to primary insurance and retrocessional markets  There s a wide span of pricing  Some was flat to down in certain geographies  In others  it was up significantly  The retrocessional market  we saw increases of between 15  and 20   But I don t believe the market    the reinsurance business is hard  I think it s more expensive  but it certainly isn t a hard market  which we define as at any price  you can t generate traction Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thanks Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Mike  do you have a follow up Michael Phillips    Morgan Stanley    Analyst No  Thank you  all  for your thoughts  Appreciate it Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer OK  Thank you  Next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW  Please go ahead Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst Great  Thanks  Dan  you ve been very upfront about the fact that when you worked on the merger  you anticipated some level of producer and client outflow  And I m wondering  if we look forward to 2020  is there any margin pressure  Because in 2019  overly simplistically  you had revenues associated with people that had left the firm Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer It s a good question  But our anticipation  as I was mentioning before  there s always a lot of puts and takes in the transaction of this size and geographic breadth  And as we look to 2020  we expect to expand margins as Marsh   McLennan  And so we think that it will be our 13th consecutive year of margin expansion  and we think we ll have a strong year in the adjusted EPS  I would say when we went into the transaction  big people business combination  we expected some level of defection  And so when we sit here today and we look at where we are  even though there are some people who left the firm who we would have preferred not leave the firm  we re in good shape  Where we had the most significant levels of leavers would be  let s say  in London  in the U K  market in London  Well  we are strong in London  We were strong  and we are stronger today  and more people by a very  very wide majority stayed rather than left  And so we re in great shape from that perspective  And so when I mentioned 10 000 additional headcount  And they are smart  hardworking  talented people  which will deliver a lot of value for us into the future  And our ability in a place like London to regenerate ourselves using our existing capability  the JLT addition and then going into the market to replace some people who had left  our ability to regenerate half talent in London is among the highest places in the world  And so it s not something that s anything more than short term John Doyle    Chief Executive Officer  Marsh And I would also note that the voluntary turnover rate at legacy Marsh was the best it s been since collected the data  So from that perspective  it s quite a stable year from talent perspective Meyer Shields    KBW    Analyst Yes  Just a quick one  So in the breakdown by segment  there was an 8   I guess  hit to Guy Carpenter s revenue from a divestiture  Is that going to persist for the next few quarters Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Mark  why don t you take that Mark McGivney    Chief Financial Officer Meyer  on that schedule  you ll see that column heading  it s Acquisitions and Positions in Others  So from time to time  we ll have just changes in mapping of businesses or other things that we use that column to just to make sure that year over year comparisons are apples to apples  There was no divestiture in Guy Carpenter  really was just comparability adjustments  And the fact that Guy Carpenter s revenue base was so small in the quarter  it just magnified that  There should be no ongoing impact from that Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan  Please go ahead Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hi  Good morning  So just a question  first  on Oliver Wyman and the weakness there  I think organic growth slowed the last couple of quarters  How much of that is just normal volatility in the business versus maybe shifts in spending on the part of your clients Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So a couple of things  I ve mentioned in the past that Oliver Wyman has more volatility on the top line than our other businesses because they have less recurring revenue  but they actually had a strong year through nine months  and we had anticipated some slowdown in the fourth quarter  But Scott  do you want to give more detail Scott McDonald    Chief Executive Officer  Oliver Wyman Sure  We definitely had a weak Q4  but there was really nothing significant that happened  And the result was driven by three things  The first was some project movement from quarter to quarter  which regularly happens with us and drives some volatility  You can see that coming in Q4  and we signaled a little bit of a pullback on our last call  The second thing was we did have a solid Q4 last year  where we grew 7   And the third thing was we did see a modest  but what feels very much like a temporary  slowdown in a couple of markets in Q4  So broadly  the business was strong across sectors  but both Europe and Asia showed some weakness  primarily in the financial services business  But that feels like it was temporary  And the Q4 result  it hasn t changed our medium term expectations  We continue to plan for mid  to high single digit revenue build over time  And for the time being  at least  demand for consulting services feels solid across sectors and across regions Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thanks  And   Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Do you have a follow up  Jimmy Jimmy Bhullar    J P  Morgan    Analyst Secondly  on Guy Carpenter in the second    each of the past couple of quarters  you ve had double digit growth  And those are obviously the lowest quarters of the year in terms of the base  How much of this is driven just by the small base versus maybe better momentum in the business that could potentially carry into this year Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Peter  do you want to   Peter Hearn    Chief Executive Officer  Guy Carpenter Jimmy  its really a combination of both  They are smaller quarters for us  but they re also being driven by good new growth  our third year of record new business wins in the United States in our retrocession business and our Asia Pacific business  Our facultative business  which we very rarely talk about  has grown significantly  All of those can impact a small quarter  as you ve seen in Q3 and 4  but it s more a function of phasing than it is anything else and a very disciplined approach to sales and growth Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer We were very pleased with the 5  growth for the year  So next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Hi  Good morning  My first question is just around the cost saves from the integration programs  Do you have any sense how much of that  350 million or greater will actually fall to the bottom line versus get reinvested back in the platform Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer I mean  general sense is that the majority of it will fall right to the bottom line  and that s how we projected when we originally put things together that  Obviously  earnings will go up  so some of it will go into bonus pools and that sort of thing  But a lot of the efficiency gains that we have developed is because of the investments that Marsh   McLennan made over a number of years  When you think about things like financial systems  we re Oracle 12  everywhere in the world  HR systems  we re Workday  everywhere in the world  We use Salesforce extensively throughout the world  And so we re able to take an organization like JLT and integrate our systems and controls and functions reasonably seamlessly without adding to a lot of our existing cost base in order to do that  and that gives us a lot of benefit and really should not impact the frontline client facing people all that much  And that s one of the reasons why most of it will drop Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  Understood  And then going back to some of the questions around growth  the 3  to 5  organic growth target that  I think  you ve talked about in the past  Just looking one of your peers have been kind of talking about just kind of mid single digit or better over the long term  and I m just trying to square the 3  to 5  to that other guidance  Are there structural differences between the two organizations  Was it just more conservative guidance on your part  Are there just near term headwinds just with the integration now that maybe once you get through those  you do that higher step up in that organic growth number Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I m one of those people who are like you are what your results say you are  And for the last 10 years  we ve been in the 3  to 5  organic growth range  I do not believe that we have many competitors  We re a pretty unique company across the breadth of the things we do  Clearly  we have certain formidable competitors in parts of our business  But across all of the things that we do  including Oliver Wyman and some of the strong businesses we have within Mercer  we don t have many direct competitors  But when I look at the competitive landscape  I absolutely believe I wouldn t change our strategic positioning with anybody  I wouldn t exchange our capabilities with anybody or our culture  And there s no reason under the sun to where our revenue growth performance would not be as good or better than any of our competitors over time  Next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney  Please go ahead Larry Greenberg    Janney Montgomery Scott    Analyst Thank you  Not much left to ask  but I guess this is for Mark  Just wondering if maybe the trajectory of expenses has accelerated a bit from earlier  from when you initially gave your guidance on that  I mean  it looked like you    what you saved in 2019 as a percentage of what you now think is the total is a little bit higher than how you initially walked into this period  And I m    so I m just wondering if that s correct Mark McGivney    Chief Financial Officer I guess  Larry  just a little bit further on phasing  As I said  we expect to take most of the actions to generate the full  350 million by the end of this year  Just by what I said with the charges  it would be a little bit spilling into 2021  And the savings    the remainder of savings will come in over the two years  probably more in 2020 than 2021  But as I said earlier  we expect to realize the full impact of the savings by the end of 2021 Larry Greenberg    Janney Montgomery Scott    Analyst Thanks  That s it Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer OK  Thank you OperatorOur next questions comes from Dave Styblo of Jefferies  Please go ahead Dave Styblo    Jefferies    Analyst Hi there  Thanks for the questions  Just want to ask a little bit about capital deployment after 2020  I think you guys are pretty much done with your debt paydown plans  Curious how that affects your thinking for M A after this year  Does that open up in that the possibly of doing something a little bit larger  Or are you guys inclined just to keep things on a more modest basis as you continue to integrate JLT Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer We have acquisitions that are a core part of our long term strategy  We ve done something like 175 plus acquisitions since January 1  2009  We tend to be a balanced company  When we look about    we put our dividend first  It s sacrosanct  We want to grow it double digit every year  And that s going to be for the sake of argument  look at a number of circa  1 billion for that  which should mean  in most years  2021 and beyond  roughly a couple of billion dollars to deploy between acquisitions and share repurchase  And as we ve said in the past  we favor acquisitions over share repurchase  the very reason we re building a great company  And our focus    and as we ve shown over time  we ve been able to do that  You look at Marsh   McLennan Agency in 2009  0 revenue and no position  And now we ve got a terrific platform   1 7 billion  growing well  good EBITDA margins  etc  We re in a business that we otherwise would not have been in  That s what s called building a company  and we re committed to continuing to do that  And we have all kinds of opportunities across the enterprise  not just in Marsh  but across the firm in order to acquire our way to be a better  stronger  more formidable company in the future  And so when we look at that  2 billion  and our debt to EBITDA at that level will probably be in the low 2s  and so we would have the ability to flex if we needed to  but there s certainly nothing that we re pining for in terms of a larger or mega acquisition  We ll see how the strategy develops over time  But certainly  having circa  3 billion to deploy year after year after year is going to make us one of the great companies of the world Dave Styblo    Jefferies    Analyst Right  Got it  OK  And then just a quick housekeeping  I think I heard for the first quarter  given the business mix and so forth  that consulting margins were expected to be down year over year  I don t know if I heard a comment about RIS Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  No  We didn t make a comment specifically about RIS  We wanted to point out consulting because of our visibility to it  and we recognize that consulting has its own attributes  RIS is a different kind of business  And so as you know  the consulting margin declined in the fourth quarter  even though we had a 90 bps improvement for consulting for the year  And so we just wanted to give a heads up that our expectation was for a decline in the first quarter for a variety of different reasons  which our view is temporary  And when we look at the full year of 2020  we expect it to be our 13th year of consolidated margin expansion for the entire firm OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS  Please go ahead Brian Meredith    UBS    Analyst Hey  thanks  Just two quick ones here  First  just curious on the EMEA organic revenue growth  the slowdown we had in the fourth quarter  I know you explained  Should we expect it to kind of continue into the first half of 2020 as some of this leadership changes go on Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer John  you want to take that John Doyle    Chief Executive Officer  Marsh Yes  I think the    Brian  there are still some headwinds in the first quarter  for sure  But as I noted earlier  I think the underlying performance  as we work our way through    cut through some of the integration related headwinds  I think we ll see improved performance throughout the rest of the year  And by the way  in the Middle East  a terrific growth year last year  good solid results in Continental Europe as well  So obviously  somewhat hopeful that the U K  economy will continue to pick up  Now there s more uncertainty around Brexit  so a number of different factors that will ultimately determine where we are  But I m quite encouraged by how our team is leading through all this change Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer And also  just to bear in mind  the new leader in the U K  is a Marsh veteran  He s worked for the firm for more than 30 years and ran Canada for us  had other big jobs  So it s not like somebody coming in and having to learn the role  He knows the business very well  And as we mentioned in previous calls  when we think about the short and midterm  we are optimistic about Britain  Britain has sort of been through the wringer over the last couple of years  but there s now clarity around Brexit  We ve got new leadership in the U K   where we re in many different businesses  from large account through to small commercial  And we believe it s going to be a great business for us over a stretch of time Brian Meredith    UBS    Analyst Great  And then my second question  just hopefully  just a quick one here  Could the coronavirus have any impact on your growth in the fourth quarter  in your Asia Pacific business  do you think at all Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I mean  we re monitoring the situation closely  like I m sure everybody is  and our primary concern is definitely to help our colleagues and their families  And we re doing everything we can to assist clients as they think through possible scenarios that can impact their business  But it s just too early to see that as to whether there s going to be any impact on our business  Asia or otherwise  We ll just have to see how this plays out in the coming weeks OperatorThank you  I would now like to turn the call back to Dan Glaser  president and CEO of Marsh   McLennan Companies for any closing remarks Dan Glaser    President and Chief Executive Officer I d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning and certainly thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication  as well as our clients for their support  Hope everybody has a good day  Thank you very much Operator Operator

151522,373038,MMC,After its near death  AIG CEO plots revival by returning to basics,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn NEW YORK  Reuters    Brian Duperreault  who rejoined American International Group Inc  N AIG  as chief executive officer last year to turn the company around  remembers another era when the insurer was trying to blaze a trail toward greatness  In 1973  Duperreault arrived at AIG s old Lower Manhattan office to interview for an actuarial position  The company s name was painted on the brick exterior of the building and linoleum tiles were missing from the floor inside  leaving spots of exposed cement and old  dried glue  He was 26  fresh out of the U S  Army and knew nothing about the insurance business  but Duperreault was sold on AIG s scrappy vibe and high energy employees   I had made a choice with my heart and not with my head   he said in an interview   But it worked out pretty well   Now 71  Duperreault is taking a different gamble at the other end of his career  trying to restore lost shine to a company that has struggled ever since a  182 billion taxpayer bailout saved it from collapse in 2008   AIG finished repaying the debt  plus a  22 7 billion return  in 2012  but is still wrestling with the consequences of its near death  including the sale of prized businesses to repay the U S  government  and a post bailout talent drain  In two interviews  Duperreault detailed plans to expand AIG s international reach  improve underwriting practices and make employees feel proud to work at AIG  but also more accountable for performance  As AIG s sixth CEO in a decade  Duperreault is bringing back some practices from the era of Maurice  Hank  Greenberg  the man who built AIG into a global insurance colossus  For example  Duperreault is letting business heads set their own budgets and performance goals  and giving underwriters more autonomy  Duperreault is also hunting for acquisitions that will boost performance and reestablish AIG s broad reach outside the United States   Possible targets could include an international life or an employee benefits business  The latter would enhance AIG s Life and Retirement business and could also cater to commercial customers who have asked for the service  people familiar with the matter said  SMART RISK TAKING But Duperreault s most critical task is overhauling AIG s underwriting culture after years spent chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks   Duperreault and his deputies have been telling staff to be more selective about clients and wind down or revise unprofitable policies  AIG is also buying reinsurance to mitigate losses on old business   Why are we performing badly when others are performing okay or pretty good   Duperreault said   It really just goes back to smart risk taking  You can t play every hand   Duperreault s immediate challenge  as he describes it  is to get the company underwriting risks profitable again   a key measure of an insurer s performance and something AIG has not done since 2007  Then he wants to get it growing again  Duperreault has told investors AIG will break even on underwriting by the start of 2019  which is only a  waypoint  on a path to richer profits  he told Reuters  Since taking the helm  Duperreault has hired more than a dozen senior executives and 125 senior underwriters to help execute his vision  Many have previously worked at AIG  Duperreault s own  43 1 million in 2017 compensation is the largest of any AIG CEO since Greenberg left the company in 2005  according to filings   Graphic    Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis criticized pay for Duppereault and other executives ahead of AIG s annual meeting in May  arguing that the company was not performing well enough to lavish tens of millions of dollars upon top executives  Just 62 percent of voting shareholders signed off on compensation  far below the roughly 90 percent support S P 500 companies typically receive  according to compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy  Some analysts say Duperreault s strategies make sense  but success is far from guaranteed  Last year  AIG reported its lowest revenue and worst loss since the financial crisis  and this year has not been much better   I think he can get the process started   said Sandler O Neill analyst Paul Newsome   But it will take a very  very long time to get it back to what it was before  if that s even possible   AIG shares have lost more than 95 percent of their value since 2007  including 11 percent since Duperreault s hiring     Valued at  47 4 billion  AIG is now worth about half of AIA Group Ltd  HK 1299   a former life insurance subsidiary it spun off to reimburse taxpayers  and one fifth of its peak value of  239 billion in 2000  EVERY DOLLAR In response to criticism about compensation  Duperreault said that  in his view  every dollar that goes toward hiring people who can profitably grow revenue is a dollar well spent   If you hire people to make money  that s probably something you should continue doing   Duperreault said  Some on Wall Street welcome his top tier hirings   All of those people left their jobs in high up positions across the industry to go help Brian fix AIG   said  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Elyse Greenspan  Before he left AIG in 1994 to head a company himself  Duperreault had spent more than 20 years rising through the ranks under Greenberg s tutelage  Duperreault then headed ACE Ltd  transforming it from a niche insurer into a global powerhouse  and in 2008 became CEO of Marsh   McLennan Companies Inc  N MMC  to reinvigorate the troubled insurance brokerage after it settled a bid rigging case  At AIG  Duperreault has also been working to improve relations with regulators  One of Duperreault s early challenges was getting AIG off the list of Systemically Important Financial Institutions  or SIFIs  that regulators drew up after the financial crisis  The company had previously been trying to convince regulators that AIG was no longer a risk to the financial system after selling or winding down some  560 billion in assets and ditching the derivatives business that nearly capsized the company in 2008  But it was on Duperreault s watch that the council of top regulators removed AIG s SIFI shackles last September  He also had to win over state insurance regulators for his plan to move discontinued business lines to a separate reinsurance unit in Bermuda  a global insurance hub where the unit has favorable requirements for capital it has to set aside  State regulators were initially concerned about moving those businesses out of their oversight  but after Duperreault spoke to the regulators and created a new executive level regulatory affairs position  AIG was able to establish the unit  called DSA Re   I think we were able to create a level of comfort that this was a well thought out transaction with a concrete business rationale   said Thomas Leonardi  a former Connecticut insurance commissioner and investment banker who took up the new role at AIG last year  Last month   Carlyle Group  LP  O CG  agreed to buy nearly 20 percent of DSA Re  The investment could spur more deals  analysts said  Other deals Duperreault has struck include buying Bermuda based reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd for  5 56 billion in July  and a UK group life insurance specialist from Munich Re for undisclosed terms in June   Finding more acquisition targets that meet his criteria has been difficult  Duperreault said  Duperreault is looking for a company in a large market with a mature legal system that does not cost too much

151553,373069,MMC,Why Marsh   McLennan  MMC  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Marsh   McLennan  MMC   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Brokerage industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this global professional services firm providing strategy  risk and people solutions has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 5 33   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Marsh   McLennan came out with earnings of  1 52 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 45 per share  representing a surprise of 4 83   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 03 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 09 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 83  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Marsh   McLennan  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Marsh   McLennan has an Earnings ESP of  0 63  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-marsh--mclennan-mmc-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200445229,200445229

major stocks  including Caterpillar  Walmart and McDonald s  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Caterpillar s shares have underperformed the Zacks Construction and Mining industry   3 2  vs   3 1   over the past six months  Caterpillar s second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share declined year over year despite higher revenues  In fact  both earnings and revenues missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate The company anticipates earnings per share at the lower end of its guidance of  12 06  13 06 for 2019  With regard to the Construction Industries segment  North America will primarily aid growth while China will act as a hindrance  Improving commodity prices will support capital expenditure in the mining sector  which in turn will drive the Resource Industries segment Investments in expanded offerings and services  and digital initiatives like e commerce will also fuel growth  Its cost reduction efforts will help sustain margins despite material cost inflation  However  the recent downward trend in monthly retail sales remains a concern  You can   Shares of Walmart have outperformed the Zacks Supermarkets industry in the year to date period  gaining  17 4  vs  13 8   The Zacks analyst thinks Walmart s focus on strengthening e commerce and store operations has aided the company

Walmart com and online grocery performances  Encouragingly  e commerce sales are expected to rise nearly 35  in fiscal 2020 The company is also making efforts to improve its International unit by shifting focus to profitable countries  However  the addition of Flipkart was a drag on Walmart s operating income Moreover  transportation costs  compelling pricing strategy and tariff related worries are threats to margins  Nonetheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term  You can   McDonald s  shares have gained 7  in the last three months  underperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry  which has gained 8 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes McDonald s various sales and digital initiatives as well as positive comparable sales bode well for the company  Furthermore  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing 16 quarters The company s increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of EOTF restaurants in the United States is an added positive  These apart  efforts to drive growth in international markets are encouraging  However  high labor costs and currency headwinds remain concerns Additionally  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time  Even its heightened focus on refranchising might cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today

151610,373126,MMC,Marsh   McLennan  MMC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Marsh   McLennan  MMC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This global professional services firm providing strategy  risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 20 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 48  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh   McLennan 
For Marsh   McLennan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 74  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marsh   McLennan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marsh   McLennan would post earnings of  1 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  5 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

151633,373149,MMC,Analysts Estimate Marsh   McLennan  MMC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Marsh   McLennan  MMC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This global professional services firm providing strategy  risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 72 billion  up 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 46  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh   McLennan 
For Marsh   McLennan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marsh   McLennan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marsh   McLennan would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  4  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 83   A quarter ago  it was expected that this global professional services firm providing strategy  risk and people solutions would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of 4

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Marsh   McLennan shares have added about 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for Marsh   McLennan 
While Marsh   McLennan has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Marsh   McLennan was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 44 on  4 19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 60 on  16 20 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Insurance   Brokerage is currently in the bottom 22  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marsh--mclennan-mmc-beats-q4-earnings-estimates-200381793,200381793
