3702,225217,CHEF,Fed up with Facebook  U S  fund managers look for alternatives,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Facebook Inc s  O FB  losses are becoming other companies  gains   Concerns about the social media giant s declining profit margins and battered reputation have prompted 93 U S  mutual funds to completely sell out of their positions in the company so far this year  exacerbating a roughly 35 percent decline in Facebook s share price from its highs  according to Refinitiv s Lipper research service   The selling by fund firms including Fidelity Investments  The Hartford and Putnam Investments combined for a total of nearly 12 million shares  and came amid similar moves to liquidate positions in the company by prominent growth focused hedge funds  Jana Partners and Third Point LLC  for instance  together sold nearly 3 7 million Facebook shares in the third quarter  according to securities filings   Funds that have dumped Facebook  whose shares helped lead the broad U S  market higher the last two years  are now favoring investments ranging from payments companies like  Visa Inc   N V  and Worldpay Inc  N WP  to consumer companies including PepsiCo Inc  O PEP  and Chef s Warehouse Inc  O CHEF  because they expect the troubles at the social media company to continue as it leaves its era of rapid growth behind  Facebook was rocked by disclosures earlier this year that the personal information of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shares with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica   The revelations in the first quarter of 2018 about data privacy issues and the growing global concerns about data security and the potential for increased regulation made it challenging to handicap the required investments to remedy some of these issues  which we anticipated would weigh meaningfully on earnings growth in coming quarters   said Jim Hamel  portfolio manager of the Artisan Global Opportunities Fund  O ARTRX   Hamel s fund  which liquidated its position in May  reaped a nearly 400 percent gain on Facebook after buying during its initial public offering in May 2012  which was priced at  38 a share  Hamel said he has used the gains to add to positions in the fast growing global digital payments industry such as Worldpay  whose shares are up 12 percent for the year to date   Greg Woodard  managing director at Manning   Napier  said his firm  which began buying Facebook in November 2012 at around  20 per share  sold all its Facebook shares this year as part of a broad move away from cyclical technology companies  Facebook s  most recent guidance really substantiated the margin contraction that we had started to worry about  and when we looked at the price and our future growth expectations they didn t match up with what the market was forecasting   he said  Woodard said his firm has added positions in software developer EPam Systems Inc  N EPAM  and global beverage company PepsiCo  and has been adding to its position in Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  on dips   BROKEN  STOCK   While Facebook is now trading at a more compelling valuation following the steep declines in its share price  questions about its ability to maintain and accelerate its growth rate may leave Facebook in a no man s land between a growth stock that appeals to investors focused on rapid expansion and a value stock that appeals to investors looking for companies that trade at a discount or offer attractive dividends    Once a company gets put into the penalty box by a growth investor it s hard to get out   said Todd Rosenbluth  director of mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA   When a stock is perceived as a broken growth stock it loses its appeal  whereas a declining stock price for a value stock can often make it more appealing    Woodard  the Manning   Napier fund manager  said his firm would not purchase shares of Facebook again in its growth strategies  and instead would put the company into a fund that focuses on  companies that need to fix themselves  if he were to buy it again   
For that to happen  Facebook s stock price would need to be  significantly lower   he said   The gap is not worth putting a number on it  ",2018-12-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fed-up-with-facebook-us-fund-managers-look-for-alternatives-1712948,1712948

sluggishness across segments such as the North America Retail and the Europe   Australia hampered results  Also  margins were weak due to higher input costs and other expenses  These downturns have

countered by sluggishness in bakery flour  Organically  sales rose 2  from the year ago quarter s levels Europe   Australia  The segment s revenues declined 10 2  to  499 5 million due to unfavorable year on year comparison  Further  sales declined 3  year over year on an organic basis  Lower sales stemmed from a tough operating environment in France and weak trends in ice cream  However  the decline was somewhat offset by double digit growth in snack bars Asia   Latin America  Revenues declined almost 9 1  from the year ago quarter s levels to  395 9 million due to unfavorable currency

Considering only continuing operations  adjusted gross margin declined 2 1 percentage points to 33 4   which included a negative impact of about 170 basis points from the recent acquisitions  Apart

30393,251908,CHEF,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Middlesex Water  ONE  Chefs  Warehouse  Davide Campari And Las Vegas Sands,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  May 31  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Middlesex Water Company   NASDAQ MSEX    ONE Gas  Inc    NYSE OGS    The Chefs  Warehouse  Inc    NASDAQ CHEF    Davide Campari Milano S p A    OTC DVDCY   and Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog 5 Recession Proof Stocks to Buy as Yield Curve InvertsThe recent inversion of the yield curve is sending out a warning signal about the global economy  Lingering trade tensions have unnerved investors  pushing investors toward government bonds and dragging the benchmark yield down With fears of an imminent recession  investors should ideally take refuge in recession proof stocks that have a steady stream of customers  irrespective of market conditions Bond Market Shows Signs of a SlowdownBenchmark U S  Treasury yield recently tanked to its 20 month low and the yield curve between the 10 year note and three month bills also inverted   a sign of impending recession  The 10 year Treasury note is now at around 2 26   its lowest level since 2017  whereas the 3 month Treasury bills yielded 2 3   and that s above the 10 year rate So  what led to the inverted yield curve  As trade tensions spooked Wall Street  investors pulled money out of equities and opted for safe haven government bonds  leading to decline in the 10 year Treasury yield  After all  bond yields tend to move opposite to prices China recently gave out signs of escalating the trade war with the United States  triggering fears of a prolonged dispute that can upset global economic growth and squeeze corporate profits  Beijing is ready to use rare earth minerals including 17 chemical elements used in almost everything from mobile phones  computer memory chips and rechargeable batteries to military equipment Adding to worries  China s Huawei Technologies is thinking of filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration in its latest effort to fight sanctions from Washington  The White House has added Huawei to its Entity List that includes companies that American firms can t sell technology without obtaining a license from the U S  government  Following this  chip bigwigs like Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Corp and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc  to name a few  have restricted supply of major software and hardware components to Huawei Kim Forrest  chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners  summed up by saying that  earlier in the year we thought the U S  China agreement was close to being done  and now it looks more far away than ever and that is making investors worried  Don t Shun Equities  Instead Buy Recession Proof StocksContrary to popular belief  there are stocks that do well during economic downturns  Prominent among them are defensive stocks  These stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the larger market  Their products are in constant demand  irrespective of market volatility  and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity  gas and water are essentials  Food companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations The idea of investing in  vice  stocks can also be considered  After all  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is recession proof  The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers  irrespective of market conditions  which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits Noteworthy vice stocks includes beer and gaming companies  Lest we forget  booze consumption is increasing at a slow but steady pace this year  according to data researcher Nielsen  And the rise in consumption is certainly a positive for alcohol stocks  Meanwhile  robust initiatives helped multi jurisdictional gaming companies progress by leaps and bounds  But  let s admit that things are looking up for such companies mostly due to improved consumer confidence Buy These 5 Recession Proof Stocks NowWe have  thus  selected five stocks from the aforesaid areas that

30396,251911,CHEF,5 Top Picks To Stay Safe Amid Renewed U S  China Tariff War ,opinion,The year old trade conflict between the United States and China is likely to be prolonged as tariff war has started once again  As indicated by President Donald Trump earlier this week  the U S  government hiked tariff rates to 25  from 10  on  200 billion Chinese exports China s Commerce Ministry has also warned that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U S  exports to counter its aggressive stance  So far  the U S  government has levied 25  tariff on  250 billion of Chinese goods while China has imposed  110 billion tariffs on U S  goods  Moreover  Trump also threatened to impose 25  tariff on additional  325 billion of Chinese goods any time soon Per the Office of the U S  Trade Representative  the country imported  539 5 billion of goods from China in 2018  U S  trade deficit with China was at  419 2 billion last year  Therefore  virtually all Chinese goods will face U S  tariffs if the Trump administration levies duties on all proposed items Trade Conflict Likely to Prolong  Trade tension between the United States and China started in March 2018  when the Trump administration levied tariffs of 25  on imported steel and 10  on imported aluminum from several countries including the Asian super power  Although  trade conflicts with other countries were solved by and large last year  tensions with China intensified day by day  resulting in severe stock market volatility and the worst performance of Wall Street in a decade Trade war appeared to be heading for an amicable solution this year as both countries showed urgency since it is affecting not only the combatants  but also other economies  However  the trade spat heightened yet again when it was finally moving toward mutual agreement U S  officials are accusing China of  erosion of commitments  and backtracking on promises made during the negotiation process  Though a Chinese delegation led by vice premier Liu He is currently in Washington for the latest round of trade talk this week   the possibility of a deal is uncertain Notably  The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese delegation adopted a rigid attitude in the final phase of negotiation buoyed by their assessment that the U S  government will finally compromise on hard stances on negotiation  Recently President Trump criticized Fed chair Jerome Powell of not lowering interest rate  which was taken by China as a sign that all is not well in the U S  economy It is widely considered in the U S  financial circle that President Trump perhaps wants stock markets to be steadied before next Presidential election due next year  A strong U S  economy and solution to the trade problem will strengthen both consumer and business confidences  This will surely result in a bull run in Wall Street The Chinese administration is trying to delay the trade deal so that it can affect U S  GDP and generate volatility in stock markets  China s government may wish to deal with a new U S  administration rather than a hard bargainer like President Trump Our Top PicksAt this juncture  investing in defensive sectors such as utilities  telecom and consumer staple will be fruitful  Defensive stocks are generally immune to the vagaries of the economic cycle  That s because these companies provide basic services like food  electricity  gas  water and communications  which can never go out of demand  We have narrowed down our search to five stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  The chart below shows price performance of our five picks year to date The Chefs  Warehouse Inc    NASDAQ CHEF   is a distributor of specialty food products in the United States  It serves the specific needs of chefs who

imported  539 5 billion of goods from China in 2018  U S  trade deficit with China was at  419 2 billion last year  Therefore  virtually all Chinese goods will face U S  tariffs if the Trump administration levies duties on all proposed items Trade Conflict Likely to Prolong  Trade tension between the United States and China started in March 2018  when the Trump administration levied tariffs of 25  on imported steel and 10  on imported aluminum from several countries including the Asian super power  Although  trade conflicts with other countries were solved by and large last year  tensions with China intensified day by day  resulting in severe stock market volatility and the worst performance of Wall Street in a decade Trade war appeared to be heading for an amicable solution this year as both countries showed urgency since it is affecting not only the combatants  but also other economies  However  the trade spat heightened yet again when it was finally moving toward mutual agreement U S  officials are accusing China of  erosion of commitments  and backtracking on promises made during the negotiation process  Though a Chinese delegation led by vice premier Liu He is currently in Washington for the latest round of trade talk this week   the possibility of a deal is uncertain Notably  The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese delegation adopted a rigid attitude in the final phase of negotiation buoyed by their assessment that the U S  government will finally compromise on hard stances on negotiation  Recently President Trump criticized Fed chair Jerome Powell of not lowering interest rate  which was taken by China as a sign that all is not well in the U S  economy It is widely considered in the U S  financial circle that President Trump perhaps wants stock markets to be steadied before next Presidential election due next year  A strong U S  economy and solution to the trade problem will strengthen both consumer and business confidences  This will surely result in a bull run in Wall Street The Chinese administration is trying to delay the trade deal so that it can affect U S  GDP and generate volatility in stock markets  China s government may wish to deal with a new U S  administration rather than a hard bargainer like President Trump Our Top PicksAt this juncture  investing in defensive sectors such as utilities  telecom and consumer staple will be fruitful  Defensive stocks are generally immune to the vagaries of the economic cycle  That s because these companies provide basic services like food  electricity  gas  water and communications  which can never go out of demand  We have narrowed down our search to five stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  The Chefs  Warehouse Inc is a

30399,251914,CHEF,5 Top Stocks To Survive The Wall Street Bloodbath ,opinion,The United States and China are at a deadlock over trade negotiations as President Trump continues to demand concrete

in low beta defensive companies seems prudent  Such stocks provide risk adjusted returns  consistent dividend and steady earnings  regardless of the state of the equity market Investors Brace for China Retaliation to U S  TariffsInvestors are worried about Trump s chief economic advisor s warning that China might retaliate against the higher tariffs Washington imposed last week  Trade negotiations between the world s largest economies couldn t end in a deal  even though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the talks were  constructive  China s Commerce Ministry had warned that they would retaliate by imposing  necessary countermeasures  if higher tariffs were put into effect  Unfortunately  tariffs on Chinese goods were raised to 25  from 10  The situation may worsen as Trump threatened to levy tariffs on all Chinese goods with America  And this means imposing tariffs on the remaining  325 billion worth of Chinese products  His moves will invariably affect more than 5 000 China made products  including fresh and frozen foods  chemicals  textiles  metalwork  building materials  electronics and consumer goods Trump said that Beijing  broke the deal   Trump criticized trade imbalances between the countries  Protection of intellectual property rights by the way continues to be a bone of contention for the economies  Beijing  however  remained defiant  The People s Daily  a newspaper controlled by the Chinese ruling Communist Party said that  at no time will China forfeit the country s respect  and no one should expect China to swallow bitter fruit that harms its core interests  Why U S  China Trade War is DamagingInvestors are worried that the trade war might destabilize an already slowing global economy  The International Monetary Fund  in the meantime  warned a tariff war would pose a  threat to the global economy  Thanks to higher tariffs  Chinese goods will surely become more costly compared to U S  products  And if consumers start buying U S  products  eventually prices will move north  So  in both cases  U S  consumers will bear the cost By the way  higher prices of imported goods generally lead to an uptick in inflation  Trump did hope that Americans will purchase more U S  products  and more jobs will be created to fulfill the growing demand  But  with higher prices  consumers will invariably reduce consumption and the firms won t be able to create new jobs China won t be spared either  The country uses the dollars it earns from exports to buy goods across the globe  But  due to the trade tensions  Chinese exports to the United States fell 18 5  to  31 2 billion in March 2019  And if this continues  China won t have many dollars to pay for its imports Sell in May and Go AwayStocks are  in fact  bleeding

30402,251917,CHEF,Can Transformation Efforts Aid Newell s Sales Graph In 2019 ,opinion,Shares of Newell Brands Inc    NASDAQ NWL   have lost 38 1  in a year s time  underperforming the  s 11 4  decline  This dismal performance can mainly be attributed to the company s soft sales and strained margins trend  Nevertheless  the company is executing its Transformation Plan well  through market share gains  point of sale growth  innovation  enhancement of e commerce and cost saving plans  Let s delve deep Factors Impacting Newell s SharesIn third quarter 2018  Newell missed sales estimates for the third straight time  The top line also declined 7 7  year over year on account of the adverse impact from the new revenue recognition standard  unfavorable currency rates and a decline in core sales  The metric was further affected by the loss of sales from the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us  The company s business segments too witnessed a sales decline year over year Despite gains from cost synergies and savings  Newell has been witnessing margin pressures for the last few quarters now  Absence of earnings related to divested businesses  commodity cost inflation  adverse product mix as well as increased advertising  promotion and investments toward e commerce expansion have been hurting margins Gross margin contracted 10 basis points  bps  in the third quarter of 2018  marking seventh straight quarter of decline  While operating margin expanded 10 bps in the reported quarter  it contracted in the preceding four quarters Progress of the Transformation PlanNewell is pacing up quite well with its Transformation Plan by offloading its non core businesses  which account for nearly 35  of the company s sales In sync with this  management recently completed the sale of Pure Fishing and Jostens businesses for gross proceeds of nearly  2 6 billion  While the Pure Fishing business was sold to Sycamore Partners  the other was divested to Platinum Equity  Pure Fishing business includes brands like Abu Garcia  All Star  Berkley  Chub  Fenwick  Greys  Hardy  Hodgman  Johnson  JRC  Mitchell  Penn  Pflueger  Sebile  Shakespeare  SpiderWire  Stren and Ugly Stik  The Jostens business comprises products like yearbooks  publications  jewelry and consumer goods  which are used by K 12 educational  college and professional sports segments Earlier  the company had divested businesses  including The Waddington Group  Rawlings Sporting Goods Company and Goody Products  for about  2 6 billion of after tax proceeds  Divestiture of these non core brands is expected to reshape the company s portfolio and improve operational efficiency  Management continues to expect roughly  10 billion in net proceeds from these divestitures Newell also improved leverage by allocating divestiture proceeds to pay down debt and share repurchases  As a result  it exited the third quarter of 2018 with  2 5 billion lesser debt than the prior year  The company reduced debt by  890 million to  9 6 billion in the reported quarter  Additionally  Newell deployed  107 million for dividends and  511 million for share repurchases  Further  it intends to buyback more than 40  of its outstanding shares  with the divestiture after tax proceeds Apart from reinforcing its financial position  Newell focuses on retaining its investment grade rating and paying an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019  targeting 30 35  payout ratio  The execution of the plan through simplification of operations is likely to reduce the number of manufacturing facilities by 66   distribution centers by 55   brands by 45   number of employees by 39  as well as reduce above 30 ERP systems to two by the end of 2019 Bottom LineWe expect Newell s Transformation Plan to provide a cushion to the stock and soon reverse the dismal trend  Additionally  we expect the company to continue with its solid earnings trend  supported by its expected long term earnings growth rate of 4 9   Notably  the company has outpaced earnings estimates in 11 of the trailing 14 quarters Presently  Newell has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You May Count on These Promising Consumer Staples StocksThe Chefs  Warehouse  Inc    NASDAQ CHEF   has an expected long term earnings growth rate of 19  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ OLLI   is also a Zacks Ranked  2 stock  which has an impressive long term earnings growth rate of 24 7  Tupperware Brands Corporation   NYSE TUP   outpaced the earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  the average being 6 2   Further  the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-12-27,Zacks

30415,251930,CHEF,5 Recession Proof Stocks To Buy As Yield Curve Inverts,opinion,The recent inversion of the yield curve is sending out a warning signal about the global economy  Lingering trade tensions have unnerved investors  pushing investors toward government bonds and dragging the benchmark yield down With fears of an imminent recession  investors should ideally take refuge in recession proof stocks that have a steady stream of customers  irrespective of market conditions Bond Market Shows Signs of a SlowdownBenchmark U S  Treasury yield recently tanked to its 20 month low and the yield curve between the 10 year note and three month bills also inverted   a sign of impending recession  The 10 year Treasury note is now at around 2 26   its lowest level since 2017  whereas the 3 month Treasury bills yielded 2 3   and that s above the 10 year rate So  what led to the inverted yield curve  As trade tensions spooked Wall Street  investors pulled money out of equities and opted for safe haven government bonds  leading to decline in the 10 year Treasury yield  After all  bond yields tend to move opposite to prices China recently gave out signs of escalating the trade war with the United States  triggering fears of a prolonged dispute that can upset global economic growth and squeeze corporate profits  Beijing is ready to use rare earth minerals including 17 chemical elements used in almost everything from mobile phones  computer memory chips and rechargeable batteries to military equipment Adding to worries  China s Huawei Technologies is thinking of filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration in its latest effort to fight sanctions from Washington  The White House has added Huawei to its Entity List that includes companies that American firms can t sell technology without obtaining a license from the U S  government  Following this  chip bigwigs like Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Corp and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc  to name a few  have restricted supply of major software and hardware components to Huawei Kim Forrest  chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners  summed up by saying that  earlier in the year we thought the U S  China agreement was close to being done  and now it looks more far away than ever and that is making investors worried  Don t Shun Equities  Instead Buy Recession Proof StocksContrary to popular belief  there are stocks that do well during economic downturns  Prominent among them are defensive stocks  These stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales

snacks  owing to lost distribution  and dismal performance of weight management brands While the aforementioned factors have been a drag on revenues  rising expenses has been marring the company s profitability  Stiff competition in the food space has been compelling companies  including Kellogg  to engage in greater promotional and marketing spend   In fact  planned increases in advertising

30577,252092,CHEF,Can Solid Strategies Help Sysco s  SYY  Stock Revive In 2019 ,opinion,Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   has been off investors  radar lately  as this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has tumbled 11 5  in the past three months  wider than the  s decline of 7 6   We note that the company has been battling cost related hurdles for quite some time  Also  the company s international performance witnessed a slowdown in the last reported quarter Nevertheless  Sysco s U S  Foodservice unit is a major area of strength  Also  the company is progressing quite well with its strategies for 2020  That said  let s see if these endeavors can help this renowned food player revive in 2019 Hurdles in Sysco s PathSysco has long been witnessing cost inflation  which has been denting its margins  The company encountered cost related headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  mainly due to a tight U S  labor market  Moreover  gross margin in this segment contracted 7 basis points  bps  to 20 10   caused by a fall in food cost inflation in U S  Broadline  particularly due to meat  poultry and produce category deflation  During the quarter  operating expenses in the U S  Foodservice unit increased 5 8   owing to higher supply chain expenses related to both transport and warehouse  In fact  warehouse and transportation related costs also posed concerns to the company s SYGMA unit and the International segment s Canada region The company s International unit also incurred increased costs related to investments in integration and transformation  which is likely to linger  Further  increased fuel costs led to escalated U S  Foodservice unit operating expenses  which also included overtime costs and other costs related to additional hiring  owing to a tight labor market  The company expects its warehouse and transportation costs associated with supply chain to persist  which is a threat to margins Apart from this  Sysco s international unit s performance depicted a slowdown in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Segment sales climbed 0 6  to roughly  2 921 million  reflecting a sharp fall from 7 9  growth witnessed in the previous quarter  Results were quite mixed in the first quarter  Management stated that sales from Canada were weaker than expected  though consumers  sentiments are favorable there  However  consumers  sentiments are unfavorable in the U K   with several restaurant closures and Brexit related worries Also  a tough operating environment in Mexico hampered Latin America s performance to an extent  though it was somewhat compensated by solid performance in Costa Rica  The company is focused on combining Brake France and Davigel  which should help it utilize the scale of these businesses and deliver accelerated growth  However  these activities entail high integration costs Efforts to Aid RevivalSysco s U S  Foodservice unit has been performing well for quite some time now  The robust trend continued in first quarter fiscal 2019  wherein earnings and sales advanced year over year  mainly buoyed by strength in U S  Foodservice operations  Sales in this division advanced 5 6  to  10 399 4 million  where local case volumes within U S  Broadline operations climbed 5 2   including organic sales growth of 3 7   and total case volumes ascended 5 7   wherein organic sales increased 4 3    Total case volumes gained from increased local and national customers  Notably  local case volumes in this segment have been rising year over year for 18 consecutive quarters now Additionally  rising restaurant sales have been benefitting the company s U S  operations for a while  Well  a rosy economic scenario  marked by elevated consumers  confidence and favorable consumer spending  is likely to continue working in favor of restaurant sales  thereby being a driver for the U S  Foodservice segment  While the company expects supply chain related headwinds to persist  it is on track with its strategic priorities that are expected to drive growth and fuel value creation Talking of strategic priorities  Sysco is on track with its four core plans  which include enhancing consumers  experience  optimizing business  stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy  In this regard  the company is focused on enhancing assortments  making constant innovations  ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands  Further  to evolve with the changing consumer preferences  Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e commerce operations  Moreover  it plans to improve supply chain  increase transparency  enhance deliveries and manage product costs effectively   Also  the company s solid balance sheet and free cash flow augmenting ability will help it make business investments  continue with mergers and acquisitions  make share buybacks  provide adequate dividends and repay debt All said  we expect Sysco s solid growth initiatives to help the company

30678,252193,CHEF,Campbell Gains On Buyouts   Snacks Unit  U S  Soup Sales Soft,opinion,Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   appears to be a preferred pick  given this convenience food products provider s dedicated efforts to strengthen brand portfolio through buyouts and other strategic initiatives  Further  the company is undertaking cost saving endeavors and shifting focus to areas with higher growth potential  These efforts are likely to help the company counter hurdles like escalated cost woes and soft U S  soup sales Markedly  Campbell has rallied close to 15  in the past six months compared with the  s growth of 2 5   Let s delve deeper and see how this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is positioned  Recent Strategic Actions Bode WellCampbell is taking various important actions to enhance the company s performance and boost shareholders  value  These actions are part of the company s portfolio review and Board led strategy  Markedly  Campbell plans to bring focus on two separate businesses in its key North American market   Campbell Snacks  and Campbell Meals and Beverages  Further  the company plans to divest non key businesses   Campbell International  which includes Arnott s and the Kelsen Group  and Campbell Fresh   to sharpen focus and enhance portfolio  Incidentally  the company has been struggling with its C Fresh segment for a while now  During the first quarter  C Fresh sales slipped 1  to  232 million on account of softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages Coming back to the divestiture plans  the company intends to utilize proceeds from the sale of the aforementioned businesses to curtail debt considerably  Banking on a more focused portfolio  management now targets cost savings of  945 million by 2022  The incremental savings are likely to come on the back of Campbell Soup s efforts to streamline its structure  augment its zero based budgeting endeavors and maintain focus on manufacturing network optimization  During the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Campbell generated savings worth  45 million as part of its multi year cost savings program  which included synergies associated with Snyder s Lance s buyout Snacks Business   a Key DriverTalking of increasing focus on more profitable businesses  Campbell plans to channelize its portfolio toward the fast growing snacking category  which is expected to form about half of Campbell s proforma sales in future  Markedly  Campbell acquired Snyder s Lance in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  This acquisition will help Campbell create a distinguished snacking business and enhance performance of the global biscuits and snacks portfolio  Such constant efforts to expand the snacking category have also helped the company s global biscuits and snacks business perform well  Evidently  sales at this division surged 77  to  1 218 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019  forming 45  of the company s top line Buyouts Bolstering PerformanceCampbell is keen on making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and accelerate future growth  The Snyder s Lance acquisition marked the company s biggest acquisition till date  Prior to this  the company acquired leading organic broth and soup producer  Pacific Foods to expand in the fast growing organic food space  Notably  contributions from Snyder s Lance and Pacific Foods drove Campbell s top line growth of 25  in first quarter fiscal 2019  wherein sales declined 3  on an organic basis Hurdles Likely to be OffsetCampbell has been witnessing strained margins for a while now  In first quarter fiscal 2019  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 4 9 percentage points to 31 6   owing to impact from recent buyouts  cost inflation  escalated supply chain expenses and increased promotional spending  The cost inflation stemmed from increased prices of dairy  steel cans  wheat  vegetables and resins along with continued rise in transportation and logistics expenses  Also  adverse portfolio mix and higher distribution costs weighed on gross margin  Management expects fiscal 2019 gross margin to decline nearly 2 percentage points due to cost inflation and elevated promotional expenditure Campbell has also been suffering from soft U S  soup sales  which declined 6  in the first quarter  excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout and impacts from the changes in revenue recognition   This was accountable to lower sales of condensed soups and ready to serve soups  U S  soup sales were hampered by greater market competition and promotions  Though the company is making efforts to improve trends in the U S  soup business  it is likely to decline in fiscal 2019 Nevertheless  Campbell s focus on areas with better prospects  solid cost saving efforts and other growth drivers are likely to help the company offset these hurdles and sustain momentum Don t Miss These Solid Food StocksChefs  Warehouse   NASDAQ CHEF

30680,252195,CHEF,5 Stocks To Buy Amid Rising Trade Risks And Fed Rates,opinion,The volatility induced in the financial markets in recent times is making investors jittery as they eagerly await an affirmative outcome from President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart s meeting this week  Whatever the outcome of the G 20 summit  it could affect the already hostile Washington Beijing relations In addition  a fourth Fed rate hike for this year is expected in December as well  which isn t painting a hopeful picture for the financial markets  Given the state of affairs  it would be prudent to invest in defensive stocks that are less affected by macroeconomic issues and market volatility Trade War Scenario Likely to PersistIn an interview earlier this week  Trump had said that it s highly unlikely he would accept Beijing s request to hold off raising tariffs from 10  to 25  beginning next year  The U S  tariffs on Chinese goods will increase to 25  from January 2019  Trump also said that in case the talks don t go well  he could put tariffs on the remaining  267 billion of Chinese products at a rate of 10 25  Earlier this week  Trump suggested he might impose 10  tariff on laptops and iPhones imported from China   I mean  I can make it 10 percent  and people could stand that very easily   the president told Wall Street Journal Given the hostile scenario  a positive outcome is unlikely  Therefore  market volatility could continue A Probable Fourth Fed Hike Could Slow EconomyAlthough the Federal Reserve didn t raise rates in November  a December rate hike could be in the cards  Strong consumer spending  job gains and record low unemployment rate are some of the factors that substantially contribute to the Fed s possible decision to hike rates next month But a global slowdown  turbulent markets for the last two months and a huge sell off last week have made the Fed uncertain about rising rates further in 2019  But a fourth rate hike this year could slow the economy down  as it could affect consumer spending  which accounts for two thirds of the U S  economy  to a large extent  In fact  U S  economic growth could slow down from 2 9  estimated this year to 2 3  in 2019  added Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Why Invest in Defensive Stocks Now Defensive stocks are safe options when markets are volatile  At the same time  defensive stocks are not impulsive

first quarter adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share that came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents  and also declined sharply from 20 cents recorded in the year ago period  The downside can be attributed to lower net sales  higher interest  and other financing expenses and factors that affected gross margin Net sales fell 5  year over year to  560 8 million  missing the Zacks Consensus

at the United States segment dropped 8  year over year to  244 million mainly due to decrease registered across Pantry and Better For You Snacks platforms  This was partly mitigated by an increase in the Pure Personal Care platform despite production challenges  Sales were also impacted by the company s decision to focus on the Top 500 SKUs rather than lower margin SKUs Net sales in the United Kingdom slid 2  to  218 6 million due to a decline of 4  in Hain Daniels net sales  This was partly offset by 4  and 8  sales growth witnessed in Tilda and Ella s Kitchen  respectively Net sales for the Rest of the World segments declined 5  to  98 3 million  Net sales for Hain Celestial Canada and Hain Ventures decreased 5  and 18   respectively  while net sales for Hain Celestial Europe were flat The Hain Celestial Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Costs   MarginsAdjusted gross margin contracted 250 basis points  bps  to 19  owing to increased investments related to trade and promotions in the United States  escalated freight and commodity expenses  production issues at Personal Care platform and supply chain disruption in the United States  This was somewhat made up by cost savings of  13 million from Project Terra SG A expenses decreased nearly 4  to  82 3 million due to cost savings from Project Terra and lower performance based compensation expense  However  the same increased 10 bps to 14 7  as a percentage of sales Adjusted operating income tanked 42  to  20 9 million  while adjusted operating margin contracted 240 bps to 3 7   Adjusted EBITDA plunged

company s adjusted gross margin contracted 4 9 percentage points to 31 6   which included a negative impact of about 190 basis points from the recent buyouts  Apart from this  the gross margin contraction was accountable to cost inflation  escalated supply chain expenses and increased promotional spending  This was somewhat compensated by productivity improvements and gains from cost

flat year over year at  1 244 million  Further  the segment s organic sales were down 5  due to softness across U S  soup  Prego pasta sauces and Canadian sales  Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout and impacts from the changes in revenue recognition  U S  soup sales fell 6  on account of lower sales of condensed soups and ready to serve soups  This was partly compensated by higher broth sales  U S  soup sales were hampered by greater market competition and promotions Global Biscuits and Snacks  Sales at this division soared 77  at  1 218 million  Excluding gains from the Snyder s Lance s buyout and currency headwinds  organic sales slipped 1  due to soft sales of Kelsen cookies in the United States  Notably  Goldfish crackers sales rose marginally  but continued being hurt by the voluntary recall made in July Campbell Fresh  Sales at this segment slipped 1  to  232 million on account of softness in Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages  This was

million On a segmental adjusted basis  adjusted operating profit at the Oilseeds segment rose significantly year over year to  349 million  The upside can be attributed to solid Crushing and

was somewhat offset  with soft results at Refining  Packaging  Biodiesel and Other categories  Moreover  peanut shelling margins were down  attributable to higher peanut inventories and tough market conditions Further  adjusted operating profit at the Origination segment was  129 million  significantly up from  39 million in the year ago quarter  This improvement was driven by gains from solid

Emulsifiers and proteins also performed impressively in Specialty Ingredients  Further  the Health   Wellness business  with the inclusion of Protexin  performed well  However  lower lysine production

30806,252321,CHEF,Post Midterm Days Spell Good Time For Stocks  5 Picks,opinion,Traditionally  the stock market tends to rise after a midterm election irrespective of the outcome  In fact  in the current situation where the Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives while GOP retained the Senate  stocks are poised to perform even better  To top it  the U S  economy is in sound shape and trade war fears have somewhat subsided Given such bullishness  investing in sound stocks that can make the most of the current scenario seems prudent After Midterms  Stocks Could Jump 20 According to The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS    the S P 500 s returns on an average has always improved in November especially after midterms  according to data going back to 1970  This has aided the month of November to generate a return of 1 09  during a presidential election  slightly more than 1 08  generated during November in an off year The current split Congress  in fact  further bodes well for the stock markets  return in the near future  In the present situation  where Democrats control the House and Republicans  the Senate  the S P 500 is widely expected to gain 20  on an average in the following one year period  Meanwhile  if Republicans had won the House and Democrats the Senate  then the S P 500 was anticipated to gain a meagre 3  However  if we still ignore the outcome  the equity market is widely expected to gain momentum post midterm  Per S P Capital IQ  the S P 500 has increased on average 15 3  in the six months following midterm election in the third year of a given presidency  which is incidentally this year  The research also showed that the frequency of advance  FoA  for this occurrence was 94  of the overall time period of Oct 31  1944 Sep 29  2014   Source  S P Capital IQ Stephen McBride  the editor of RiskHedge report  also chipped in and said that stocks have climbed an average of 17  in the year after a midterm election since 1946  McBride too acknowledged that it s the third year of a presidential term and historically the strongest year for the stock market The stock market  by the way  historically gains in the November through May period or the so called  winter  months  while markets have been more or less flat during the  summer  months  May October   For instance  the Dow Jones has registered an average gain of 7

trends  The U S  economy is doing well and that should eventually help the stock market gain traction  In the last two quarters  the U S  economy recorded the fastest six month growth in four years and is on track to hit the Trump administration s annual growth target of 3   If that happens  it would be the best yearly performance since 2005  two years before the Great Recession The U S  economy got a boost in the third quarter  with GDP increasing at an annualized pace of 3 5   per the U S  Commerce Department  In fact  the country s total output of goods and services followed an even stronger 4 2  growth in the second quarter  On the geopolitical front things are looking up as well  Trump recently had a  very good conversation  with President Xi Jinping of China  Trump tweeted that trade discussions with China were  moving along nicely  ahead of face to face talks between the two superpowers at the G20 summit in Argentina later this month  Beijing  in response  said that they are also ready for talks with the US to resolve trade issues  Needless to say  the United States and China have been involved in a tit for tat trade clash for a pretty long time  which could have

30830,252345,CHEF,Kellogg  K  Cuts View On Q3 Earnings Miss  Costs On The Rise ,opinion,Kellogg Company   NYSE K   came out with third quarter 2018 results  wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year  and the former marked its sixth consecutive beat  While earnings gained from higher revenues and gains from tax reforms  revenues were backed by buyouts and organic sales growth However  the company marked its first earnings miss after two successive beats  and also lowered its earnings outlook on account of increased costs related to brand building investments and logistics  and co packing expenses associated with new pack format expansions Q3 in DetailAdjusted earnings of  1 06 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Nevertheless  the bottom line increased 2 9  year over year  supported by tax gains from the U S  tax reforms  somewhat negated by increased interest costs associated with buyout related debt  On a currency neutral basis  adjusted earnings increased 3 9  to  1 07 per share Kellogg Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Kellogg reported revenues of  3 469 billion  up 6 8  year over year  The upside can be primarily attributed to the takeover of RXBAR and consolidation of Multipro  The top line also outpaced the consensus mark of  3 417 million  On a constant currency  cc  basis  sales during the quarter improved 9 3  Further  organic revenues climbed 0 4  on the back of impressive underlying growth even amid tough year over year comparisons in various businesses  Also  results were somewhat negatively impacted by unfavorable list price adjustments and SKU rationalization in the company s U S  Snacks unit  associated with its conversion from Direct Store Delivery or DSD  The company s currency neutral adjusted gross profit rose 1 2  to  1 257 million  while the respective margin contracted 290 basis points  bps  to 35 4  Kellogg s adjusted operating profit fell 4  to  471 million  owing to planned increases in advertising and promotion investments along with elevated higher distribution expenses  Notably  the company is on track with its Project K restructuring program  Further  adjusted operating margin contracted 150 bps to 13 6  Segment DiscussionNorth America  Kellogg s North America sales of  2 188 million rose 1 1  from the prior year quarter s level  mainly due to gains from RX s buyout  Organic sales declined due to list price adjustments and SKU rationalization in the company s U S  Snacks unit  stemming from last year s conversion out of DSD  During the quarter  sales declined across the U S  Snacks  U S  Morning Foods and U S  Specialty Channels categories  Also  adjusted operating profit declined on account of advertising and promotional investments  and other incremental costs Europe  The segment s revenues of  596 million slipped 0 5  year on year  owing to unfavorable currency movements  On a currency neutral basis  sales grew on the back of high snacks sales  Adjusted operating profit improved on a year over year basis Latin America  Revenues of  239 million in the segment improved 1 4  year on year  aided by growth witnessed across Mexico and Mercosur  partially offset by currency headwinds  Higher net sales also fueled adjusted operating profit growth Asia Pacific  The segment s revenues of  446 million improved substantially year over year on the back of strong growth in cereals and snacks as well as growth in the developed and emerging markets  The region also gained from the consolidation of Multipro  Adjusted operating profit witnessed a sharp improvement Other FinancialsKellogg ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  309 million  long term debt of  8 715 million and total equity of  3 615 million On a year to date basis  the company generated cash from operating activities of  926 million OutlookKellogg s third quarter performance was driven by both acquisition gains and organic sales growth  Further  the company witnessed enhanced consumption trends across core markets  brands and categories  The company is also on track to generate productivity savings  which are enabling it to counter cost pressures  mainly stemming from higher transport costs  Further  Kellogg continues to witness increased costs related to brand building investments and logistics  and co packing expenses associated with new pack format expansions Though these factors weighed on the company s operating profit  Kellogg plans to continue with these investments as they bode well for future growth  This may entail escalated costs in the near term  while the company s planned installation of an in house packing facility may help it enhance margins over the medium term Kellogg now expects revenues to grow about 5   at cc  compared with the previously guidance of 4 5   The raised guidance reflects better net sales and consumption trends  while it continues to incorporate adverse impacts from the DSD transition at U S  Snacks division However  adjusted operating profit growth  at cc  is now anticipated to remain roughly flat year over year compared with 5 7  growth forecasted earlier  Management expects higher investments  mix shifts and costs related to expansion of co packed pack formats to dent fourth quarter operating profit Consequently  the company trimmed its adjusted earnings growth view to 7 8   at cc  from 11 13  projected earlier  This can be attributed to a decline in adjusted operating profit  somewhat made up by lower effective tax rate Price PerformanceThis

lines declined year over year and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In fact  this marked the company s third straight quarter of bottom line miss  Results were hurt by a tough Mexican market  difficult commodity market in the United States and high feed costs in Europe Shares of the company fell close to 5  during yesterday s after market trading session  In fact  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has crashed 44 1  in a year compared with the  s decline of 3 4  Q3 in DetailQuarterly adjusted earnings came in at 21 cents per share  significantly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents  Also  the bottom line plunged substantially from 98 cents reported in the year ago period  This could be attributable to lower revenues  higher interest expenses and dismal margins Pilgrim s Pride Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    In the reported quarter  Pilgrim s Pride generated net sales of  2 697 6 million  down 3 4  year over year  Also  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 720 million  Results were hurt by sluggish environment in Mexico and tough commodity chicken pricing in the United States Revenues from U S  operations came in at  1 864 2 million  down 3 8  year over year  owing to one of the toughest pricing scenario in commodity chicken  However  the region gained some respite from a comparatively better performance of non commodity chicken  which includes organic and small birds Further  Mexican operations generated revenues of  306 7 million in the reported quarter  down 10 1  year over year  This could be accountable to an extremely difficult market environment in the country where pricing was impacted by excess supply stemming from strong growing conditions  Nevertheless  the company stated that pricing has already started recovering in the region  Further  Prepared Foods continues to perform strongly  under both premium Pilgrim s and Del Dia categories  This is likely to elevate the company s Mexican portfolio toward including more unique and superior value products with higher margins The top line results from the European operations also improved 2 4  year over year to  526 7 million

30846,252361,CHEF,Wall Street Mayhem To Persist In November  5 Defensive Picks ,opinion,Wall Street has endured a difficult October  its worst monthly performance this year  Notably  all three major stock indexes suffered losses over the month  The Dow fell 5 1   its biggest monthly drop since January 2016  The S P 500 slumped 6 9   its biggest monthly decline since September 2011  Meanwhile  Nasdaq Composite plummeted 9 2   marking its largest monthly slide since November 2008 The situation is likely to intensify in the near term with mid term Congressional elections less than a week away and the Federal Reserve signaling one more rate hike this year  Lingering trade conflicts with China and concerns regarding the longevity of earnings momentum may result in more volatile trading in Wall Street going forward  At this juncture  it would be prudent to pick defensive stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio US China Trade War IntensifiesOn Oct 29  Bloomberg reported that United States is preparing to impose tariffs on all residual imports from China in early December  if trade related negotiations between President Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping fail to resolve trade conflicts  The latest round of tariffs could be worth  257 billion  Notably  the Trump administration has already imposed  250 billion tariffs on Chinese goods while China levied  110 billion of retaliatory tariffs on U S  imports   On Oct 8  the IMF projected that global growth rate will be 3 7  for both 2018 and 2019  a decline of 0 2  from its earlier projection given in July due to the trade conflicts between the United States and China Concerns Regarding Fed s Monetary PolicyThe Federal Reserve has already increased benchmark interest rate three times in 2018  Each time the rate was increased by a quarter percentage points  Despite this  in October  Fed chair Jerome Powell announced interest rates have a long way to go before hitting neutral  a clear indication of further rate hikes  Higher interest rate will raise the cost of funds of investing in risky assets like equities  Instead investors may be better off investing money in risk free government securities Will Earnings Momentum Continue As of Oct 31  313 of the S P 500 members have reported third quarter earnings  For these companies  total earnings are up 22 7  year over year on 8 4  higher

store expenses in the third quarter climbed 12 5  to  281 4 million  while as a percentage of sales the same increased to 21 2  from 20 7  in the year ago period  This uptick can be attributed to

30917,252432,CHEF,Zacks com Featured Expert Kevin Matras Highlights  Chef s Warehouse  Easterly Government Properties  Opus Bank  TowneBank And UGI,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 6  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  The Chef s Warehouse   NASDAQ CHEF    Easterly Government Properties   NYSE DEA    Opus Bank   NASDAQ OPB    TowneBank   NASDAQ TOWN   and UGI Corp    NYSE UGI    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit  and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research The Power of New Analyst CoverageBroker recommendations    love them or hate them  they do have their place  And we all look at them eventually Whether you re a small individual investor or a large institutional portfolio manager  or somewhere in between   who doesn t like it when a stock gets an upgraded rating or sees a new analyst jumping in with coverage  We all do   Although I should note that  in general  the change in the average broker recommendation is a better indicator than the actual recommendation itself  Anyway  today I want to talk about companies that receive new analyst coverage One of the things that generates analyst coverage is investor interest  How else can you explain the increased analyst coverage for Facebook  NASDAQ FB   a company that s only been public for 2 1 2 yrs   in comparison to a company like GE  public for more than 40 yrs   And as new coverage is initiated  it becomes more visible  which in turn means potentially more demand  read higher prices  This is often the case because analysts almost always initiate coverage with a positive recommendation   Why write a research report on a company not widely followed only to say it stinks  And when it comes to companies with little to no analyst coverage  that one new recommendation can sometimes give portfolio managers the validation they need to build a position   And the more money they can invest  the more they can potentially influence prices  The best way to use this information is to look for companies with analyst coverage that has increased over the last 4 weeks Simply look at the number of analyst recommendations now in comparison to the number of analyst recommendations 4 weeks ago  An increase in coverage is bullish whereas a decrease in coverage is bearish It s typically more bullish if the increase went from none to one or if the coverage was minimal to begin with   Going from 25 to 26 isn t going to have the same impact because that 26th analyst isn t discovering something  new    But increased coverage is better than decreased coverage    assuming the coverage is positive of course For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

30933,252448,CHEF,Chefs  Warehouse  CHEF  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The Chefs  Warehouse   NASDAQ CHEF    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17 1  over the past month  CHEF hit a new 52 week high of  30 32 in the previous session  The Chefs  Warehouse has gained 37 3  since the start of the year compared to the  11  move for the Consumer Staples sector and the  11 2  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 9  2018  The Chefs  Warehouse reported EPS of  0 03 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 1  
For the current fiscal year  The Chefs  Warehouse is expected to post earnings of  0 73 per share on  1 41 billion in revenues  This represents a 65 91  change in EPS on an 8 53  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  0 92 per share on  1 5 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 25 34  and 6 15   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
The Chefs  Warehouse may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CHEF  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
The Chefs  Warehouse has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 38 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 23 5X versus its peer group s average of 12 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 75  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective The Chefs  Warehouse  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  The Chefs  Warehouse currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if The Chefs  Warehouse fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though CHEF shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does The Chefs  Warehouse Stack Up to the Competition

of  1 807 million  Unfavorable volume mix hurt net sales by nearly one percentage point  mainly due to weakness across oils  peanut butter and baking categories  somewhat compensated by strength in coffee  However  sales were positively impacted by improved net price realization and favorable currency movements  Markedly  net sales received benefits of  4 6 million owing to favorable currency exchange Adjusted gross profit climbed 1  to  674 8 million  whereas adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 37 9   Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased roughly 3  to  348 3 million  with the adjusted operating margin improving 60 basis points to 19 6   Adjusted operating income growth was backed by a decline in SD A costs Segment PerformanceU S  Retail Coffee Market  The company s U S  Retail Coffee Market segment sales came in at  508 2 million  which increased  2 3 million from the prior year period  This was backed by favorable volume mix  primarily attributable to Dunkin  Donuts and Folgers brand  This was somewhat countered by lower net price realization at the Folgers brand Segment profit jumped 4  to  156 million  due to improved volume mix and lower input costs  somewhat negated by escalated marketing costs and reduced pricing   U S  Retail Consumer Foods   Sales in the segment dipped 2  to  465 3 million  Higher net price realization was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix  mainly led by Crisco  Jif and Pillsbury brands  partly compensated by Smucker brand gains Segment profit increased 5  to  114 1 million  as the impact of lower volume mix was more than offset by improved pricing and costs U S  Retail Pet Foods  Net sales dipped  0 9 million to  533 6 million owing to lower volume mix  mainly due to certain voluntary product recalls  This was partly countered by better net price realization  Segment profit tumbled 13  to  102 1 million owing to unfavorable volume mix  pricing and costs  Charges associated with product recalls also hurt segment profit International and Away from Home  Effective May 1  2017  the company s U S  Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home Net sales grew 2  from the prior year quarter to  274 2 million  courtesy of favorable volume mix and positive impacts of currency rates   This was partly countered by lower net price realization  Segment profit rose 2  to  49 6 million  thanks to

solidified its pet foods portfolio  Moreover  management is considering the sale of its U S  baking business  which highlights its strategy of portfolio optimization and shifts focus to the growing coffee  snacking  and pet food categories  Smucker also remains on track with its cost containment plans  which helped it make investments in its core growth brands including Dunkin  Donuts  Smucker s Uncrustables and Nature s Recipe All said  the company expects net sales for fiscal 2019 to advance 13  year over year to reach  8 3 billion The company envisions fiscal 2019 earnings in the range of  8 40  8 65 per share  up from  7 96 recorded in fiscal 2017  The upside is likely to be backed by gains from Ainsworth buyout  cost saving efforts and benefits from U S  tax reforms  Evidently  effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be roughly 24 5   lower than the fiscal 2018 rate of 29 6  However  increased marketing costs  rising freight and raw material costs  and increased interest expenses are likely to weigh on bottom line  Incidentally  the company expects marketing costs to rise considerably  particularly to support the launches of 1850 coffee and Jif PowerUps Free

30956,252471,CHEF,5 Food Stocks Offering Tastier Returns Than S P 500,opinion,"The food industry has been in troubled waters of late  The industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition  tight margins and aggressive promotional environment  Moreover  customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low cost alternatives to national brands  which are hurting the food companies 
With e commerce major Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   acquiring the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM  investors became skeptical  The traditional food companies feared losing customers and had to face pricing pressure amid tight margins  as Amazon is expected to keep grocery prices low  Amazon s deal has changed the retail landscape and has intensified competition both in stores and online 
If we look into the  s performance  we note that it has lost around 10  year to date  On the other hand  the S P 500 generated a return of 14  over the said time frame 

Industry giants like General Mills  NYSE GIS   Inc  and Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB  have also disappointed investors in their recently reported quarterly results  While   primarily hurt due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food and lower sales of yogurts and cereals in North America  Campbell s top and bottom line results have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate as the company faces intense global competition for nearly all key products 
Consequently  excessive pressure from competitors is likely to cause Campbell to incur greater marketing and other costs or reduce prices  all of these are likely to hurt the company s overall performance 
Nevertheless  not all food majors are underperforming  Companies such as Pinnacle Foods  Inc   The J M  Smucker Co  have resorted to cost cuts and are focusing on innovation to boost sales  Sysco Corp  NYSE SYY   and United Natural Foods  Inc  are banking on acquisitions to drive growth 
McCormick   Company  Inc    NYSE MKC   has been gaining momentum of late driven by its efforts to boost its portfolio  Though rising material costs  sluggish sales in the U K  and higher brand marketing expenses have raised concerns for sustaining the company s performance  its acquisitions  cost savings and innovation initiatives bode well  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company also posted upbeat  recently and raised its fiscal outlook  You can see

Adjusted earnings of  1 12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 by 6 7   We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 15 straight quarters  excluding the current quarter  In the third quarter  adjusted earnings were also 9  higher year over year owing to higher operating income  Further  the favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings were offset by an increase in brand marketing and material costs and currency headwinds 
Revenues and Profits
In the reported quarter the global leader in flavors and spices generated revenues of  1 185 million  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 146 million by 3 4   Revenues grew about 9  from the prior year quarter  including currency tailwinds of 1   Sales were driven by strong base business and impressive product portfolio growth 
The acquisitions  food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group  RB Foods  in August 2017 and Enrico Giotti SpA in December 2016  also contributed to higher sales by 4   Excluding currency headwinds  revenues grew 7   driven by both the consumer and industrial segments 
The company s adjusted operating income grew 18 6  to  204 million in the third quarter  On a constant currency basis  it increased 19  due to higher sales  cost savings and lower selling  general   administrative costs  A shift in the portfolio to more value added products also boosted sales McCormick   Company  Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Segment Details
Consumer Business  Segment revenues grew 5   primarily driven by strong base business and new product sales compared with the year ago period  Solid performance in the Americas was driven by the acquisition of RB Foods as well as strong pricing  new products and expanded distribution  Sales also grew in China and India  which were partially offset by weak sales in the United Kingdom  where the retail environment suffers from stiff competition 
Adjusted operating income grew 9   on a constant currency basis  driven by the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the impact of higher material costs and brand marketing expenses 
Industrial Business  Industrial segment sales grew 14  with minimum impact from currency  driven by increased sales across all three of its regions  While sales in the Americas were led by continued growth momentum in branded foodservice  as well as incremental sales from RB Foods  sales in EMEA region was driven by sales from Giotti acquisition 
Sales to both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies also increased during the quarter  Industrial sales in the Asia Pacific region increased in the quarter driven by new products and promotional activities of quick service restaurants 
On a constant currency basis  adjusted operating income rose 44  year over year  driven by favorable impact of higher sales  product mix and CCI led cost savingsand favorable selling  general and administrative costs  more than offset the unfavorable impact of increases in material costs and an increase in brand marketing 
Fiscal 2017 Guidance Raised 
For fiscal 2017  the company has revised its guidance reflecting the acquisition of RB Foods and lower currency impact on earnings  The company now expects sales to grow approximately 9 10  in fiscal 2017  in comparison with approximately 4 6  announced earlier  Excluding currency  McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10 11  in fiscal 2017  in comparison with approximately 5 7  announced previously 
The company expects higher brand marketing  increased pricing  new products  expanded distribution and acquisitions to contribute to the growth  Further  the company anticipates pricing actions to offset higher material costs  which are anticipated to rise by mid single digits  In addition  the company has raised its cost savings target to at least  105 million  compared with the earlier goal of approximately  100 million 
The company now expects 2017 adjusted operating income to grow approximately 20 21   from adjusted operating income of  657 million in 2016  Previously  the company anticipated adjusted operating income growth of 8 10   On constant currency basis  adjusted operating income is now expected to grow 21 22  
Driven by higher sales and operating income  McCormick now expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of  4 20  4 24 per share  compared with  4 05  4 13 per share estimated previously  This marks an increase of 11 12  compared with  3 78 in 2016  Also  currency will unfavorably impact earnings by 1   compared to 2 percentage points previously  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is  4 09 per share  which is below the guidance range 
Our Take
Overall  McCormick is focusing on driving revenues through acquisitions and expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2017  Its cost saving initiative is also appealing  However  earnings growth is likely to be hurt by higher input costs as well as brand marketing expenses

30979,252494,CHEF,Consumer Staples Sees Rising Momentum  7 Stocks To Scoop Up,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year  on the back of improved economic scenario buoyed by rising consumer confidence  which is a key determinant of the economy s health  Although consumer confidence declined marginally in September due to hurricane Harvey and Irma s impact in Texas and Florida  we believe the economic conditions are quite favorable and indicate that the economy will continue to grow in the near term 
The improving economy was also supported by labor market optimism and the recent gross domestic product  GDP  rate provided by the Commerce Department in consumer spending for the second quarter 2017  The commerce department stated that GDP rose 3 1  in the second quarter of 2017  the highest in two years  The recent tax cut proposal proposed by President Trump further instills confidence 
However  we understand that the U S  economy is not fully immune to global uncertainties  which could limit growth potential  But the encouraging data as well as the new tax reforms reflects that the economy is in good shape and the spending power is likely to increase going forward  This is also well reflected in the three key U S  indexes  which have closed in positive territory so far this year  The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 13 0   The S P 500 rose 11 9   while Nasdaq grew 20 3  on a year to date basis 

How Will Investors Gain From This Scenario 
At this moment  investors must be looking for those stocks that have been gaining momentum and are expected to outpace market s performance in the coming months  Rightly  momentum investing can prove to be a winning strategy for investors seeking higher returns in a short span  We believe that the bullish projections present significant growth opportunity for momentum investors   
This strategy mainly suggests capturing profits by buying stocks that have witnessed an uptrend in the past few weeks or months  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than drift away from the trajectory 
Here we have highlighted few consumer staple stocks  which have outperformed the market s performance so far this year  Further  these stocks carry a  of either A or B along with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see

Adjusted earnings in the first quarter came in at  1 51 per share  which were way behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 61 by 6 2   Earnings also declined 19  year over year  due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits  which were negatively impacted by planned increases in marketing expense and commodity costs 
Revenue and Margin Details
Net sales in the quarter declined 4  year over year to  1 749 billion  The fall was due to lower volume mix  notably in coffee and oils  which were partially offset by gains in pet food  Net pricing added 1 percentage point to net sales  as higher net pricing for coffee and the Smucker s brand was partially offset by lower net pricing within the company s U S  Retail Pet Foods segment  Currency negatively impacted sales by  1 8 million  Net sales also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 816 billion by 3 7   Notably  sales have posted negative surprises in five out of the last seven consecutive quarters 
Adjusted gross profit fell 10  due to lower volume mix  higher costs and unfavorable pricing  Despite cost saving initiatives  the company s adjusted operating profit declined 17  due to lower gross profits

Segment Performance
U S  Retail Coffee Market  The company s biggest segment  U S  Retail Coffee Market  reported a 6  decline in sales to  480 8 million  This was primarily due to 8  lower volume mix driven by lower volume for the Folgers brand  partially offset by gains for the Dunkin  Donuts and Caf  Bustelo brands  The lower volume mix was mostly offset by 2  higher net price realization 
Segment profit declined 29  to  123 8 million  due to the negative impact of volume mix  lower net pricing and higher commodity costs  Encouragingly  the company anticipates the impact of higher costs to moderate throughout the remainder of the fiscal 2018 
U S  Retail Consumer Foods  This segment s sales declined 8  in the quarter to  492 4 million  Higher net price realization  driven by the Smucker s and Crisco brands  added 3  to the sales  but was offset by 11  lower volume mix  primarily attributed to the Crisco  Pillsbury and Smucker s brands 
Segment profit was flat at  110 9 million as the impact of lower volume mix was offset by higher pricing and reduced marketing expense 
U S  Retail Pet Foods  Segment net sales were almost flat at  521 7 million in the quarter  as improved volume mix  primarily related to the Nature s Recipe and Natural Balance brands was mostly offset by lower net price realization across the portfolio  Segment profit declined 20  to  98 3 million due to decline in sales  lower pricing  higher commodity costs as well as higher marketing expense 
International and Away from Home  Effective May 1  2017  the company s U S  Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home 
Net sales of the segment increased 3  from the prior year quarter to  254 0 million  reflecting favorable volume mix driven by the Jif and Smucker s brands   Net price realization improved  but was offset by currency headwinds  Segment profit declined 3  to  38 3 million as top line growth were more than offset by unfavorable currency  higher commodity costs  and expenses related to the construction of the Smucker s Uncrustables production facility in Longmont  Colorado J M  Smucker Company  The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

31030,252545,CHEF,Which Food Stocks Should You Buy Amid Grocery Industry Woes ,opinion,"The grocery industry has been grappling with several challenges like stiff competition  and aggressive promotional environment of late  Traditional grocery rivals are strengthening their franchises and outside players are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples 
Customers are becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low cost alternatives to national brands  Food deflation had added to the woes over the last one year where oversupply in some types of food   particularly meat  poultry and dairy   dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions  However  the scenario is now better with prices starting to increase 
The biggest blow to the grocery industry came when e Commerce biggie Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   announced an all cash  13 7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc    NASDAQ WFM    citing pricing concerns  Shares of several grocery store chains tumbled on Aug 24 following Federal Trade Commission approval to Amazon to purchase Whole Foods 
While shares of big box retailers like The Kroger Co    NYSE KR   declined 7 71  and nearly touched its 52 week low  Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  fell more than 5   Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  dipped 3 99   Sprouts Farmers Market Inc  shares declined 6 95   while shares of SUPERVALU Inc  dropped 6 60   On the other hand  Whole Foods  stock inched up 0 72  
Amazon s Deal and Its Impact on the Food Industry
Amazon will close the deal on Aug 28 and will acquire Whole Foods  around 470 stores across the U S   U K  and Canada along with 87 000 employees and its solid reputation  Notably  the Texas based Whole Foods deals in natural and organic offerings at a premium price  which is in contradiction with Amazon s track record of keeping the prices low 
So Amazon will lower the prices of Whole Foods  as soon as the acquisition is completed  to lock in customer loyalty  Some of the items whose prices will be slashed include Whole Trade bananas  organic avocados  organic large brown eggs  and kale and other organic food  The company also announced certain Whole Foods products will be available through Amazon com  AmazonFresh  Prime Pantry and Prime Now 
With Amazon s huge cash balance and expansion capabilities  we believe such acquisitions can change the retail landscape and ward off competitors  Amazon s move to lower grocery prices has been met with apprehension at grocery stores and supermarkets as they may experience pricing pressure and lose customers  Some investors also worry that Amazon s deal would squeeze profit margins in an industry already known for stiff competition and tight margins 
The entry of Amazon has caused a disruption in the grocery segment and has made investors skeptical of investing in the industry  However  not all food companies are underperforming  There are still quite a few food stocks which are poised to grow and investing in them will be a prudent move 
How to Pick the Best Stocks 
With the help of our new style score system  we have identified four food stocks that have excellent prospects and seem to be unaffected by this deal  Such stocks also boast a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics  Our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  You can see  
Prominent Choices
Based in Ridgefield  Connecticut  The Chefs  Warehouse  Inc    NASDAQ CHEF   is a distributor of specialty food products in the United States  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM Score of B  The company has a long term earnings growth rate of 19 00   which also makes it a viable investors  choice 
Investors can also count on Chicago based Ingredion Inc    NYSE INGR    which is an ingredients solutions provider specializing in nature based sweeteners  starches and nutrition ingredients  It carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM Score of B  It has a long term earnings growth rate of 11 00  
Coming to the share price movement  Chef s Warehouse has rallied 12 9  over the last six months  while Ingredion grew 1 5   On the other hand  the  declined 7 0  in the same time frame 

We also suggest investing in Sanderson Farms  Inc    NASDAQ SAFM    which is engaged in the production  processing  marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken products  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a VGM Score of A 
Another chicken company which warrants a look is Pilgrim s Pride Corporation   NASDAQ PPC    The company sports a Zacks Rank  1 and has a VGM Score of B 
If we look into the share price movement  we note that while Sanderson Farms has rallied 45 5  in the last six months  Pilgrim s Pride grew 38 9   Both the stocks outperformed the   which gained only 5 9  over the said time frame

31031,252546,CHEF,Can Kimberly Clark s Revival Efforts Bring A Turnaround ,opinion,"Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   has been losing sheen over the last few quarters due to slower organic sales growth amid highly competitive promotional environment  Nevertheless  we believe the company s higher cost savings  continued product innovation  strong international presence to act as catalysts 
Let s delve deeper to understand the factors which have been hurting the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company and find out if the company has the potential to rebound 
Slower Organic Sales Growth in Emerging Markets
Kimberly Clark has been witnessing sluggish organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets over the last few quarters  We note that the company posted organic sales growth of 5  in both the first and second quarter of 2016  which decelerated to 3  in the third quarter  Though it showed some improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016 with organic sales growth of 4   it remained flat in the first quarter of 2017 and grew just 2  in the second quarter of 2017  While performance improved in China  it softened in Latin America  particularly in Brazil and Argentina  due to lower volumes  and highly competitive promotional activity and a difficult economic environment 
Higher Commodity Costs due to Inflation
The company has been benefiting from lower commodities cost through 2016  However  the company now anticipates a rise in input costs in 2017  on a modest increase in inflation  going ahead  The company anticipates higher prices of raw materials  including pulp  in 2017 
Weak Quarterly Performance
Kimberly Clark was unable to pull off the second quarter of 2017 earnings due to higher input cost inflation and lower sales due to softness in North America  Kimberly Clark reported weaker than expected numbers in the second quarter of 2017  wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Notably  sales have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five out of the last seven quarters  Following the dismal third quarter results  the company forecasts soft earnings guidance for full year and now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of  6 20  6 35 Kimberly Clark Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    What Lies Ahead 
In order to improve the company s sales and profits  Kimberly Clark remains focused on innovating products on a regular basis  The company believes that innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories  The company is focusing in the training pant category to drive growth  In the second quarter of 2017  the company launched innovative ranges of Huggies for markets of China and Russia  Over the near term  the company has a number of products lined up for launch in North America  including Huggies Snug and Dry diapers  Good Nights youth pants  and Depend underwear 
Kimberly Clark is also aggressively cutting costs through a program called Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere  FORCE  to boost profits  As a result  for 2017  the company expects to generate cost savings in the range of  425  450 million from the FORCE program  up from the earlier forecast of  400 million 
While sluggish organic sales growth in Latin America is hurting the company s sales  The company is witnessing increased organic sales in diapers in Eastern Europe and China due to strong volume growth and innovation  In China  volume growth is expected to remain healthy along with improvement in pricing in 2017  In fact  the company expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017  despite the current promotional environment 
Share Price Performance and Estimates Trend
The consumer products giant has exhibited a bearish run over the last one year  However  the decline was almost in line with the industry s decline  If we look into the last one month s performance  we note that the stock declined roughly 1 3   narrower than the  s decline of 2 9   The industry is currently placed at the top 27  of the Zacks Classified industries  72 out of 256   This signals that the company s initiatives to turnaround the stock is bearing fruit 

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and for the full year 2017 has remained unchanged in the last 30 days period  in contrary to the estimates revision over the last 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at  1 55  down from  1 60 per share in the last 60 days  Similarly for 2017  the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined from  6 29 per share to  6 22  over the same time frame 
Bottom Line
Though we cannot ignore the fact that Kimberly Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth  due to highly competitive promotional activity since past many quarters  we believe the company s higher cost savings  continued product innovation  strong international presence have been the positive catalysts to bring a turnaround in the stock in the near term

31032,252547,CHEF,5 Value Food Stocks To Bet On Amid Grocery Industry Woes,opinion,"The grocery industry is having a tough time currently  The industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition  tight margins and aggressive promotional environment 
Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals  which are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples  Customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low cost alternatives to national brands  which are hurting the food companies 
The problems worsened when e Commerce biggie Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   announced an all cash  13 7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM     Shares of a number of grocery store chains  including Kroger  NYSE KR  and Sprouts Farmers Market  dipped on Aug 28  after the deal officially came into effect  Losses spread across the food sector as shares of Kraft Heinz  Post Holdings  Kellogg Company  NYSE K   ConAgra Foods  NYSE CAG  and Treehouse Foods tumbled

Initiatives to Boost Business
Though heightened competition in the pet food business in the near term remains a concern  we are impressed with strong organic sales growth  product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions  Within pet snacks  the change in pricing strategies to improve the competitive positioning of Kibbles  n Bits in the mainstream dog food category is driving volumes and is expected to support further growth 
In the long term  the company expects to remain on track with its cost savings initiatives  The company anticipates to launch improved K Cup products in the Coffee and snacking segments

SUPERVALU intends to use at least  750 million from the net proceeds to prepay its outstanding debt  The remaining net sale proceeds are to be used to further reduce debt and improve its capital structure  as well as to fund corporate and growth initiatives SUPERVALU INC Price
    The grocery retailer has been recently suffering from lower than expected sales in the Retail and Save A Lot segments  Higher competition in the grocery business as well as a challenging sales and retail environment can be attributed for the decline in sales in the retail business of the company 
Additionally a deflationary environment as well as unfavorable year over year comparisons is also hurting the Save A Lot segment  The cumulative effect of these factors is anticipated to affect the top line negatively in second half fiscal 2017  Additionally  the company expects the comparable sales in the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter

31082,252597,CHEF,Recent Analyst Upgrades Make These 5 Stocks Attractive,opinion,Investors strive to design a portfolio of stocks that will fetch them handsome returns  However  the task is easier said than done because selecting the right stocks at any point of time is no mean feat  Given the time constraint that we all face  it is quite impossible for individual investors to have thorough knowledge about all stocks In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   The proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed to experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Proper GuideBroker ratings are backed by sound logic and are by no means arbitrary  Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock Naturally  when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock  they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario Don t Leave out the Top LineWhile we have already talked about the bottom line  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  This holds true especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our
