204755,426271,GOLD,Freeport CEO  looking forward  to deals once expansion projects done,news,"By Ernest Scheyder
 Reuters    Freeport McMoran Inc  N FCX   the world s largest publicly traded copper producer  would consider acquisitions  mergers or other deals once three ongoing expansion projects finish by 2022  Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in an interview on Tuesday 
Demand for copper is projected to surge this decade because of the rising popularity of electric vehicles  which use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines  That  in turn  is expected to fuel an M A wave across the sector 
Despite that  Phoenix  Arizona based Freeport s shares are worth half what they were in 2010  dragged down by uncertainty over the company s stake in a major Indonesian mine and debt from an ill fated oil and gas venture 
But those issues are largely behind the company  which is about to open a copper mine in the United States  is expanding Indonesia s Grasberg mine and has launched an analytics program to boost production in Peru 
Those projects should double the company s cash flow and boost the company s stock price  giving the company ammunition to consider deals  Adkerson told Reuters 
 I m looking forward to having a new experience in my career toward accessing alternatives and deciding which way we go   said Adkerson  an accountant by training who became CEO in 2003 
Those alternatives could include buying part or all of another company  building new mines or other deals  he said 
 We don t have a clear directive now on what that direction could be  but we will be attractively situated and will have an opportunity to add value through investments   said Adkerson 
According to recent news reports   Barrick Gold Corp   TO ABX  CEO Mark Bristow has spoken favorably of Freeport s assets and a potential combination 
Adkerson declined to comment  A Barrick spokeswoman declined to comment 
Adkerson  73  said he has no plans to retire and is in good health 
 This is not a time that I m thinking about walking away   he said 
Adkerson called the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus in China a  real black swan event   The term is a reference to the book  Black Swan   which looks at the potentially catastrophic effects of unpredictable events 
Copper prices  have dropped more than 10  this month on concerns the virus could affect the global economy  Copper prices are closely linked to global economic health because the metal is used for construction and manufacturing 
Freeport s stock dropped more than 9  last Thursday due in part to virus concerns even as the company posted better than expected quarterly results 
Its shares were 2 5  higher at  11 175 in afternoon trading  along with a broad rally in global equity markets as investors took a less pessimistic view of the potential economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak ",2020-01-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/freeport-ceo-looking-forward-to-deals-once-expansion-projects-done-2069710,2069710
204756,426272,GOLD,Acacia seeks stay of international arbitration against Tanzania,news,By Barbara Lewis and Yadarisa Shabong LONDON  Reuters    Acacia Mining said on Wednesday it was seeking a stay of international arbitration proceedings against Tanzania  a step that could ease tensions between the two sides locked in a dispute following a  190 billion tax bill  Adding to pressure on Acacia  the company said late on Tuesday it had been notified of an imminent ban on the use of a storage dam that would prevent its North Mara gold mine   its main source of revenue   from operating  The offer to postpone arbitration  which was scheduled to start on Monday  precedes a looming July 19 deadline for Acacia s majority owner Barrick Gold Corp  holder of a 63 9  stake  to make a firm bid to buy out Acacia  Acacia and other shareholders have been opposing the offer  saying it is too cheap  International arbitration is generally a last resort for mining companies in disputes with governments   But some of Acacia s shareholders have said it has a good chance of winning  which would increase the value of the company and could be preferable to accepting too low an offer from Barrick  Barrick declined to comment on Wednesday  It has been leading negotiations with Tanzania over a  190 billion tax bill   about four times the country s gross domestic product  The bill was handed to Acacia in 2017 for allegedly under reporting output  Acacia denies the allegation   If the Tanzanian government agrees to the stay  Acacia would expect the arbitration hearing to be postponed to provide time for the government of Tanzania to complete its settlement discussions with Barrick Gold Corp   Acacia said in a statement  ENVIRONMENTAL RULES Tanzanian allegations that Acacia has broken environmental regulations have ratcheted up the pressure on Acacia  Late on Tuesday  Acacia said the Tanzanian National Environment Management Council issued a notice for Acacia s North Mara mine to prevent it using its tailings storage facility by 6 a m  local time on Saturday on the grounds the mine had breached environment rules  In a statement  Acacia said it would request any investigation reports or data upon which the North Mara notice is based   Acacia s North Mara mine was issued with an Environmental Protection Order and fine in May 2019 for alleged deficiencies at a tailings storage facility   But Acacia says it has never received any reports that would justify the ban on use  It said the North Mara technical team has been working  constructively and collaboratively  with the Tanzanian government  Analysts at Berenberg  which rates Acacia  hold   said the postponement request should be received positively by Tanzania  But it said the risk for Acacia is a prolonged outage at North Mara  which would have a  very significant  impact on finances given the mine makes up 70  of group revenue  and cannot operate without a tailings dam   Acacia s share price was 0 5  lower at 180 6 pence at 1115 GMT ,2019-07-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/acacia-seeks-stay-of-international-arbitration-against-tanzania-1925729,1925729
204757,426273,GOLD,Barrick Gold Agrees to Buy Out Acacia Mining  Ending Standoff,news," Bloomberg     Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE GOLD  agreed to buy out minority shareholders in Acacia Mining PLC  LON ACAA   ending a standoff between the two companies in a plan aimed at resolving the unit s long running dispute with Tanzania s government 
The two companies had been debating the value of Acacia since Barrick s informal offer in May to buy the roughly 36  stake in the company it doesn t already own  Acacia has been locked in a public battle with Tanzania since 2017 and the agreement with Barrick follows days after the government ordered Acacia to stop using a tailings facility at a core gold mine 
Acacia s shares rallied as much as 18  on the news and traded at 219 4 pence at 9 09 a m  in London  The stock had gained 1 8  this year through Thursday 
Today s news suggests Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow was forced to shift his position that he wouldn t raise the bid  In an interview with Bloomberg News in June  Bristow said he had no intention of raising the offer  But the CEO faced shareholder pressure in recent months  with Odey Asset Management opposing the valuation 
Still  the new bid gives Acacia shareholders a significant premium  Since mid 2017  Acacia shares have traded below Barrick s current offer for all but a handful of days 
Acacia is fully satisfied with the final terms  said acting Chief Executive Officer Peter Geleta 
 Given all the circumstances this is possibly the best outcome   he said by phone 
A successful deal would close the nearly decade long chapter of Acacia s life as a public miner  after the unit was spun out in 2010 as  African Barrick Gold   Since then it s fended off challenges spanning an infiltration by criminal gangs  to invasion by hundreds of intruders armed with machetes and hammers and mining tax changes 
Two years ago  Tanzania imposed an export ban on Acacia and handed the miner a  190 billion tax bill  Since then  the company s position in the country has deteriorated further  with the government saying in May it would no longer allow Acacia to manage its mines in the country and will only work with Barrick 
The dispute with Tanzania has had a crippling effect of Acacia s business    forcing the company to stockpile output and curb production    and its shares dropped 50  since the start of 2017 before Thursday s announcement 
Barrick has led discussions with the government in an effort to solve the impasse  while Acacia moved ahead separately with arbitration proceedings 
In a 2017 meeting between President John Magufuli and Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton  it was tentatively agreed that Acacia would pay  300 million to the government to settle tax claims and would split future returns from operations with the country  At the time  Acacia criticized the move and blamed Barrick for its worsening relationship with Tanzania after Thornton took over negotiations ",2019-07-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/barrick-gold-agrees-to-buy-out-acacia-mining-ending-standoff-1928371,1928371

204763,426279,GOLD,Barrick CEO Expects to Raise  1 5 Billion in Asset Sales,news," Bloomberg     Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE GOLD   which completed its acquisition of  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd  at the beginning of the year  has identified  1 5 billion in assets the miner intends to sell  Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said 
 Our focus is realizing  1 5 billion through next year   Bristow said Wednesday in an interview in Toronto  The assets will be sold once they are optimized enough to create sufficient value for shareholders  he said 
The gold sector has been anticipating a wave of asset sales in the wake of Barrick s  5 4 billion acquisition of Randgold and a second mega merger that created Newmont Goldcorp Corp  The newly combined giants were expected to put several unloved mines up for sale  leaving lots of room for maneuvering by company executives who have missed out on the dealmaking 
The objective is for the sale process to be well advanced by mid 2020  Barrick said in its first quarter earnings statement  its first results since its acquisition of Randgold was completed 
 It s not a fire sale  it s a considered process   Bristow said in a separate interview with Bloomberg TV   We ll work with those stakeholders  and we will let the market know when we re ready to let them know once we ve got a way forward for each of those assets  
Barrick climbed 1 8 percent to  12 95 at 9 43 a m  in New York  That pared the shares  decline this year to 4 3 percent 
Barrick will focus on finding the right buyers for its assets and is willing to help them manage the mines during a transition period  if required  Bristow told BTV  Some of the assets Barrick is selling are in countries that the company still wants to invest in  he says 
In the meantime  the Toronto based miner also won t hesitate to  pick up other assets  that may be available 
Barrick said its joint venture agreement with Newmont is expected to close by the end of the quarter  In March  Barrick withdrew a  17 8 billion hostile bid for rival Newmont after negotiating the joint venture combining most of their assets in Nevada  Barrick has a 61 5 percent stake in the JV to Newmont Goldcorp s 38 5

204764,426280,GOLD,World Bank court orders Pakistan pay  5 8 billion damages to Tethyan Copper,news,"By Dave Sherwood

Tethyan Copper discovered vast mineral wealth more than a decade ago in Reko Diq  at the foot of an extinct volcano near Pakistan s frontier with Iran and Afghanistan  The deposit was set to rank among the world s biggest untapped copper and gold mines 
The company said it had invested more than  220 million by the time Pakistan s government  in 2011  unexpectedly refused to grant them the mining lease needed to keep operating 
The World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  ICSID  ruled against Pakistan in 2017  but until now had yet to determine the damages owed to Tethyan 
Tethyan board chair William Hayes said in a statement the company was still  willing to strike a deal with Pakistan   but added that  it would continue protecting its commercial and legal interests until the dispute was over  
The Reko Diq mine has become a test case for Prime Minister Imran Khan s ability to attract serious foreign investment to Pakistan as it struggles to stave off an economic crisis that has forced it to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout 
Pakistan s military sees Reko Diq as a strategic national asset and had taken a key role in its development amid the dispute with Antofagasta and Barrick  sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this year ",2019-07-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/world-bank-court-orders-pakistan-pay-58-billion-damages-to-tethyan-copper-1922829,1922829

SAN JUAN  Argentina Reuters     Barrick Gold Corp  failed to complete improvements to the Veladero mine in Argentina that could have prevented the third spill of cyanide solution in 18 months  leading to eventual sanctions for the world s biggest gold miner  a judge told Reuters 
Barrick appears to have missed deadlines on three orders from local authorities  including replacing pipes  before the March 28 spill  said Pablo Oritja  the judge overseeing cases related to Veladero in the nearby town of Jachal  where  Barrick out  graffiti lines the streets 
 If they had changed pipes as ordered  the decoupling  of pipes  would not have occurred   Oritja told Reuters on Friday  the day after meeting the head of the mining police in western Argentina s San Juan province  where Veladero and Jachal are located 
The findings  will eventually end in sanctions against the company   said Oritja  judge at the Judicial Court of Jachal 
The investigation into past negligence  along with the provincial government s review of Barrick s mine improvement plan  could delay the Canadian company s goal of restoring one of its top five mines worldwide to normal production in June 
Barrick  TO ABX   N ABX  has followed established regulatory procedures to comply with the requirements issued by San Juan authorities following the recent spills at Veladero  spokesman Andy Lloyd told Reuters in response to Oritja s comments 
Sanctions would come from the San Juan government and could include a fine and restrictions to operating Veladero  Oritja  who indicted nine current and former Barrick executives accused of negligence after Barrick s first spill in 2015  could also levy more charges if he determines cyanide posed harm to people or the environment 
San Juan s government suspended the addition of cyanide to Veladero s gold processing facility after the latest spill  and gave the mine an ultimatum to overhaul safety and environmental operations  Cyanide is used to separate the gold from ore 
In September  all operations at Veladero were temporarily shut down  adding to Barrick s troubles in South America  where its Pascua Lama project on the Argentine Chile border has been on hold since 2013 due to environmental issues  political opposition  labor unrest and development costs 
San Juan province Mining Minister Alberto Hensel says the repeated Veladero spills may result in a fine higher than the  9 8 million Barrick paid after the first spill  when a United Nations agency said 1 million liters of solution containing cyanide spilled into a river providing drinking water 
The spills in September 2016 and March of this year were smaller and contained in the mine site  Barrick and the San Juan mining police said 
Still  Oritja ordered blood tests last month to check for health problems related to cyanide in residents of Jachal  a town of mostly mud homes 150 kilometers from Veladero that remains poor despite its proximity to Argentina s largest gold reserves 
Lloyd said there have been no health risk to communities or the environment  though the company seeks to improve transparency and relations with nearby towns 
 URGENT REVIEW 
The incomplete orders referenced by Oritja were given in December and February and involve fixing Veladero s pipe system  a source at the San Juan government told Reuters 
Hensel said Barrick also failed to complete an  urgent review  of the pipe system before the third spill  Lloyd said an engineering report on the pipes was completed  in recent weeks  
Lloyd said Veladero had 2 685 active environmental obligations and a compliance rate of 99 percent  and was taking action on the one percent 
 This is a strong track record when you step back and consider the number of permits and obligations involved  and the fact that at any mine  there is always an ongoing process to respond to and implement regulatory actions that take time to complete and involve ongoing discussions with regulators   Lloyd said 
Barrick presented San Juan province with a new plan in late April  Hensel told Reuters  after an initial one was rejected  All proposed work would need to be approved and completed before restrictions are lifted  he said 
Primary repairs  included in a  500 million five year investment plan  should be finished before a recently announced sale of half of Veladero to  Shandong Gold  Mining Co  SS 600547  is finalized  Lloyd said  though Shandong will share future costs 
Barrick could complete the work in May and is targeting normal operations in June  depending on local government approvals and the resolution of all legal matters  Lloyd said 
In addition to investigations from the San Juan government and Oritja  Federal Environment Minister Sergio Bergman has asked another court to halt all operations at Veladero pending repairs 
 The repeated incidents imply negligence   Bergman said in an interview   Barrick did not comply with what was demanded  ",2017-05-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-barrick-faces-sanctions-for-argentina-cyanide-spills,-judge-says-481076",481076

204802,426318,GOLD,Barrick Gold reaches  140 million accord in U S  investor lawsuit,news,"By Nate Raymond
NEW YORK  Reuters     Barrick Gold Corp   TO ABX  has agreed to pay  140 million to resolve a U S  lawsuit accusing the gold producer of concealing problems at a South American mine and of fraudulently inflating the company s market value  according to court papers 
The settlement  disclosed in papers filed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court  would resolve a class action accusing Barrick of deceiving investors about environmental problems afflicting its Pascua Lama project on the border of Argentina and Chile 
 I am pleased we were able to reach this resolution for investors   James Hughes  a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the law firm Motley Rice  said in a statement 
Barrick in a statement confirmed the  140 million accord and said the value of the settlement is insured 
 Barrick continues to believe that the claims alleged by the lead plaintiffs in the litigation are unfounded  and under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company has not accepted any charges of wrongdoing or liability   the company said 
The settlement  which requires court approval  comes two months after a federal judge cleared the way for shareholders who bought or acquired Barrick stock between May 7  2009 and Nov  1  2013 to pursue the case as a class action 
Barrick bought the Pascua Lama project in 1994  and had been counting on it to generate a large percentage of its overall gold production 
But cost overruns  environmental issues  labor unrest  political opposition and falling bullion prices contributed to Barrick s decision on Oct  31  2013 to indefinitely halt the project  after it had already spent more than  5 billion 
Investors in the lawsuit contended Barrick touted Pascua Lama during this period as a  world class project that will contribute low cost ounces at double digit returns   even as it became clear the project would fall short of expectations 
The lead plaintiffs in the case were Union Asset Management Holding AG and LRI Invest S A

Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold  which struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in rising rate environments

204826,426342,GOLD,What s In The Offing For Commercial Metals   CMC  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Commercial Metals Company   NYSE CMC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Oct 23  before the opening bell Which Way are the Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter revenues suggests growth of 20  to  1 57 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for

average positive surprise being 8 27   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key Factors to ConsiderSpending on construction activity in the United States continues to

Conducive markets in Poland and Commercial Metals  investment in the country poise it well  These factors are likely to have contributed to the company s fiscal fourth quarter performance The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Americas Recycling segment s revenues is pegged at  266 million  suggesting a decline of 26 3  from the year ago quarter  The segment is expected to report operating profit of  2 21 million  87  lower than the prior year quarter s figure of  17 million For the Americas Mills segment revenues  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at  853 million  projecting 41 2  year on year growth from the prior year quarter s  604 million  The segment s operating profit is projected at  144 million  indicating an improvement of 34 5  from the  107 million reported in the prior year quarter  Benefits from the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S A  production of spooled material at the Arizona micro mill and strong rebar demand at the micro mill in Durant  OK will likely have aided the company s to be reported quarter s results The Americas Fabrication segment is anticipated to report revenues of  609 million in the quarter to be reported  indicating a 50 7  jump from the  404 million recorded in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  However  the segment is expected to report an operating loss of  21 8 million compared with the prior

Nevertheless  inflationary pressures on manufacturing costs due to a tight labor market  and consumable raw material prices are expected to have dented the company s margins in the quarter  Furthermore  its debt to equity ratio has gone up to fund the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S A  Consequently  the company s margins in the to be

204827,426343,GOLD,Gold Miners Index  Valuations Remain Cheap,opinion,"The Gold Miners Index has rallied 60  off of its September 2018 lows Despite this significant move higher  valuations remain subdued on a historical basis Given the likely robust revenue growth rates we ll see in Q3 and Q4 earnings reports  any weakness is likely to get bought up by funds into Q1 2020 The Gold Miners Index  GDX  has seen an incredible rally off of its September 2018 lows and was up as much as 75  before the ensuing correction in September  The good news for investors in the sector is that valuations remain quite palatable despite this significant thrust higher  While most would expect the group to be expensive after out performing nearly all other industries in the past twelve months  this is not the case at all  The recent 15  correction in the Gold Miners Index has pulled many of the gold majors down to even more appetizing levels on a valuation basis  and I would expect funds to step in as buyers if we do see any weakness from now until the end of Q1 2020  This is because both earnings and revenue estimates continue to be revised higher  and this will leave these companies even more undervalued as we enter the next year  We ve yet to see complete confirmation the lows are in  but the reward to risk for investors in the sector is the best it s been since May 
While some investors prefer to use P E ratios as a way of gauging valuation in a sector  I much prefer using price to sales ratios as it s much more challenging to manipulate  Some accounting tricks can be played with earnings by moving items around into different categories  but there is nothing a company can do to manage revenues  Outside of a non core asset sale  which is rare  I have found the price to sales ratios to be one of the best ways to gauge valuation metrics  If we take a look at the largest gold miners and compare where they sat in the 2000 s vs  where they sit now  we can see that things are not even approaching frothy levels from a pure valuation standpoint 
Looking at the above chart  it s evident that the prior peaks in price to sales for miners were multiples of where we sit currently  Yamana Gold  AUY  peaked at 36 0x sales in 2006  Agnico Eagle  AEM  topped at 26 6x sales in 2009  and Barrick Gold  GOLD  topped at 7 4x sales in 2006  The median peak price to sales ratio over the past fifteen years for gold majors has been 13 9x  while the average peak price to sales ratio was 18 1x  Due to significant outliers among some mid cap names  I believe the median values are much more relevant 
If we look at current valuations on the right side of the chart  the price to sales ratio among the same five gold majors is currently sitting at 2 91x on a median basis  This is nearly 10  below the peak price to sales ratio at the 2016 highs  and this should be extremely encouraging to investors  The reason for this is that gold is not only at higher prices providing better margins for these gold majors  but gold  GLD  NYSE GLD   broke out this year  something it couldn t achieve in 2016 
To summarize  the gold majors are currently trading 10  below their 2016 peak valuations despite working with better margins  and a five year breakout in gold  If we were to return to the 2016 peak levels  we would see the Gold Miners Index return to the  30 00 level  If we were to trade 15  above 2016 price to sales peak levels  which is closer to fair value  the Gold Miners Index would head over the  32 50 level  20  upside from here  For this reason  there is undoubtedly a case to be made to be nibbling on miners into weakness  I would expect any drop under the  26 00 level to find strong buying pressure from funds as most gold companies are likely to report record revenues in 2020

204830,426346,GOLD,2 Gold Stocks Squeezing Shorts,opinion,"U S  China trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty has been a boon for gold prices in recent months  and mining shares have benefited from this increased appetite for the safe haven asset  Two gold stocks in particular that caught our attention are Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE GOLD  and  Eldorado Gold Corp   NYSE EGO   both of which have been the targets of short sellers in recent months and are trading near new highs    fuel for more upside 
Barrick Gold Shorts Start Covering

Barrick Gold was last seen down 0 2  at  18 14  as a stronger U S  dollar weighs on gold prices  The shares are still up almost 58  from a late May bounce near  11 60  and recently found support at their rising 60 day moving average following a brief pullback from their Aug  28 two year peak at  20 07 
The gold stock has been burning short sellers during its longer term climb  too   on GOLD rose almost 46  between the June 1 and Sept  1 reporting periods to 32 42 million shares  Some of the weaker bearish hands capitulated to Barrick Gold s burst higher in recent months  though  with short interest down 16 4  in the most recent reporting period  Continued short covering could create tailwinds for the security 
A round of bull notes could draw buyers to Barrick Gold  too  Currently  eight of 13 analysts maintain a lukewarm  hold  rating on the stock  while the average 12 month price target of  19 20 is a slim 6 2  premium to the equity s present perch  leaving the door wide open for upward revisions from the brokerage bunch 




Eldorado Gold Stock is Up 160  Since May
Eldorado Gold  meanwhile  is down 3 2  today at  7 95  testing a recent footing atop its 60 day moving average  The shares were trading just above  3 in late May  but have since surged 160   and tiptoed into double digit territory earlier this month for the first time since October 2017 
Short sellers made a beeline for the stock during its summer surge  with short interest more than doubling between the May 15 and July 1 reporting periods  These bearish bets have since been cut in half  but the 3 48 million shares still held by shorts is well above historical lows  EGO stock could be headed higher  should shorts continue to buy back their borrowed shares

204831,426347,GOLD,Why America s Critical Minerals Strategy Is Doomed To Fail,opinion,"Donald Trump started a trade war with China thinking  obviously  that his administration could win it 
Through a combination of hubris and ignorance  this president failed to see America s soft underbelly  its Achilles heel 

The answer is the country s heavy reliance on foreign supplies of critical minerals   the raw materials it needs to become a leader in high technology  transportation  energy and defense  Materials like lithium  rare earths  cobalt and graphite 
For years the United States and Canada didn t bother to explore for these minerals and build mines  Globalization brought with it the mentality that all countries are free traders  and friends  Dirty mining and processing  NIMBY  Let China do it  let the DRC do it  let whoever do it 
China recognized opportunity knocking and answered the door  seizing control of almost all REE processing and magnet manufacturing  in the space of about 10 years 
When the Chinese placed restrictions on rare earth elements in 2010  in reaction to a territorial dispute with Japan  prices of the materials used in a number of energy and defense related applications skyrocketed  Good for REE miners  bad for end users  
Then  earlier this year  as part of its trade war strategy  China raised the prospect of cutting exports of the commodities that are critical to America s defense  energy electronics and auto sectors 
 United States  don t underestimate China s ability to strike back   the official  People s Daily  newspaper stated   Will rare earths become a counter weapon for China to hit back against the pressure the United States has put on for no reason at all  The answer is no mystery   it added in an apparent reference to the United States blacklisting large tech company Huawei for reasons of US national security 
Suddenly  the once remote possibility of using critical metals like REEs  as pawns in the trade war  became more likely  But it s more than rare earths  The US is dependent on foreign countries for over 20 critical metals  including battery metals used in electronic devices like cell phones and electric vehicles 
Without a reliable supply chain  a country must depend on outsiders  This gives foreign suppliers incredible leverage over the United States  There is always the possibility of slowed flows or bans on strategic materials  due to politics or trade disputes 

The Trump administration recognized this when the president issued an executive order in December 2017  instructing his government to devise  a strategy to reduce the Nation s reliance on critical minerals  that are largely imported 

 The United States must not remain reliant on foreign competitors like Russia and China for the critical minerals needed to keep our economy and our country safe   Reuters quoted President Trump saying  The directive was a response to the US Geological Survey s first assessment of US critical minerals since 1973  Its report concluded that the US relies on China for sourcing 20 out of the 23 minerals deemed critical for US national security and the economy 

If China were to suddenly refuse sale of any of these 20 metals the US deems critical to the economy or defense of the nation  such as manganese needed to make steel  or rare earths used by the Military  the US economy and its defense capabilities would be in serious trouble 

Included on that list are the building blocks of the new electrified economy  including lithium and rare earths  China has a stranglehold on both of these metals  meaning it can use them as a cudgel in trade talks with the United States 

There are a few different ways the US could meet this threat of foreign countries restricting  or embargoing  critical minerals  One way is to encourage the exploration and mining of these metals  in the United States or Canada  

North America is well endowed with huge  quality rare earth deposits  enough to supply us with decades and decades of production  What we lack is processing and larger scale manufacturing  But we have a ready supply to meet an admittedly smallish market  the US Military uses about 500 tonnes  and REE processing has already started happening outside China 
Mountain Pass in California will start processing REEs by the end of 2020 Lynas signed a joint venture agreement with Blue  Line Corp   NYSE LN   to build a rare earths processing plant in Texas 

A second way would be to identify countries that are friendly to US interests  and invite them to join a US led  critical minerals consortium   Members could include Canada  Mexico  Chile  Argentina  Peru   all countries rich in mineral wealth the US could sign offtake agreements with  We ll return to this idea further down  

The third way is what the US actually did  Form a group of countries to strategize about critical minerals  but invite all the wrong countries to the table   
ERGI  a bad idea 
The Energy Resource Governance Initiative  ERGI  was created in June as part of a government wide action plan to reduce US reliance on imported critical minerals  

Led by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo   ERGI promotes sound governance and resilient supply chains in the energy minerals sector  Through this initiative  the U S  Department of State s Bureau of Energy Resources  ENR  engages countries to advance governance principles  share best practices  and encourage a level playing field   reads a Sept  26 press release  

That sounds pretty bland  but what is interesting  and disturbing  is the ERGI s mandate of sharing mining expertise with countries in the group  So  the United States is going to help countries like the DRC  Namibia and Brazil   all of which have been courted by and  married  to China through numerous mineral offtake agreements and loans   to discover and develop mineral deposits of lithium  cobalt and copper  presumably so they can sell more of said minerals to their lead benefactor  China  

In exchange  these developing  ie  poor  countries accept China s offer to build hundreds of billions worth of infrastructure  thus bringing them closer to Beijing and drawing them further away from the United States  

So far nine countries have joined the US  Australia  Botswana  Peru  Argentina  Brazil  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Namibia  the Philippines and Zambia 
To see how wrong headed the ERGI group is  as currently comprised  let s take a few examples  

Australia is certainly a mining nation  with ample supplies of gold  rare earths  iron ore and coal  but the logistical challenges of shipping ores to the United States are  to put it mildly  prohibitive  That s probably why Australia ranks as America s 24th largest trading partner in goods  with just  35 billion in two way trade conducted in 2018  Of the  10 billion worth of Australian imports  none were minerals  The top two imported goods were beef and pharmaceuticals  
In contrast the US did  659 billion in goods trade last year with China  its largest trading partner  
Basketcase Argentina 

Argentina has an abundance of lithium  gold and silver  but its economy is in ruins  The country has one of the world s highest inflation rates  22   and its economic growth shrunk 5 8  in the first quarter  A recent poll  showing President Macri is likely to lose the October election  resulted in the peso crashing to a record low  Argentina is also heavily indebted  over the last 60 years the IMF s loans have gone from hundreds of millions to the billions  with the International Monetary Fund agreeing to a  50 billion loan in 2018 
In early September  in an effort to stabilize markets  following the currency s fall to 60 pesos per US dollar  
Most countries on the ERDI list are deeply enmeshed with China  which has already inked numerous offtake agreements to supply it with critical and other metals  

In 2017  Shandong Gold   SS 600547  partnered with Barrick  NYSE GOLD   the world s biggest gold producer  to purchase a 50  stake in the Veladero gold mine on the Chile Argentina border  The  960 million deal included Shandong  one of China s top gold miners  studying the possibility of building the massive Pascua Lama gold deposit Barrick has been trying to develop on the same border  The Chinese firm could also work with Barrick to explore other mines in the El Indio gold belt of Chile 

More recently  in August China s Ganfeng Lithium raised its stake in the Cauchari Olaroz lithium brine project in Argentina to 50   in a  160 million deal with Chilean state lithium miner SQM  The JV partnership with Lithium Americas plans to start production in 2020  
Corrupt Brazil 

Brazil  one of the best mining jurisdictions with a wealth of minerals including iron ore  gold  copper  manganese and bauxite  should be tightening control of its mineral riches as it struggles through a major recession fueled by a corruption scandal  Instead the country has opened its doors to foreign investment  namely  Chinese 

According to Dealogic  Chinese M A of Brazilian companies totalled  10 8 billion in 2017 and  11 9 billion in 2016  Chinese banks and investment groups have committed  15 billion of a  20 billion China Brazil Fund  a Beijing managed fund to finance infrastructure projects that was launched in 2016  The fund is to speed resource development  including rail projects  There s also the  10 billion  dollars for oil  loan between China Development Bank and Petrobas  the Brazilian state oil company  In return for paying off Petrobas  debts  China gets oil supply commitments for Chinese buyers   
Tying up Africa  
  as it works towards its goal of mass EV adoption  and ensures its factories have access to clean technology raw materials like cobalt  lithium and graphite 

In a  9 billion joint venture with the DRC government  China got the rights to the vast copper and cobalt resources of the North Kivu in exchange for providing  6 billion worth of infrastructure including roads  dams  hospitals  schools and railway links  China controls about 85  of global cobalt supply  including an offtake agreement with  Glencore   LON GLEN   the largest producer of the mineral  to sell cobalt hydroxide to Chinese chemicals firm GEM  China Molybdenum is the largest shareholder in the major DRC copper cobalt mine Tenke Fungurume  which supplies cobalt to the Kokkola refinery in Finland  China imports 98  of its cobalt from the DRC and produces around half of the world s refined cobalt 
In under 10 years  the number of China headquartered mining companies with assets in Africa went from just a handful in 2006  to 120 in 2015  Two high profile examples are the acquisition  by China General Nuclear Power Corporation  of the Husab uranium project in Namibia  and Zijin Mining s involvement  39 6   in the massive Kamoa Kakula copper deposit in the DRC 
Last year Desert Lion Energy entered into an   to acquire all the lithium concentrate from the first phase of its Rubicon and Helikon properties in Namibia  In July 2018 the first 30 000 tonnes of concentrate were shipped to China for processing  
Resource nationalists 
Two other countries on the ERGI list  Zambia and the Philippines  have used the heavy hand of the state to extract more revenue or to exert more control over local mines  
In Zambia  changes in mining taxes have driven up costs and forced copper miners to reduce output  The country s copper production has already tumbled 11 3  in the first quarter of 2019 versus the last quarter of 2018  
An economic crisis is forcing the country to consider seizing copper mines  including Vedanta s Konkola Copper Mines  KCM  which Zambia accuses of breaching its operating license and polluting the lands of nearly 2 000 villagers  A court hearing in England is pending 
In 2017 the Philippines shut down 23 nickel mines ostensibly for environmental reasons  This year  a nickel mining hub in the country s south  affecting four mining companies  will close indefinitely while the regional government conducts an audit  
China s mining investments in Africa bear further scrutiny since this is the kind of model that could  and should be emulated by the United States as it looks to source critical minerals abroad  though late in the game  The Chinese like to do business government to government  not between the government and a company  For the US to have any chance of catching up to China  they will need to do the same  
The China model 
In the 1990s  Africa was languishing in debt  disease  droughts and civil wars  Who can forget the failure of the United Nations to stop the massacre in Rwanda  
One country that didn t turn its back  that saw opportunity in Africa  was China   it was the help of China that led several African countries  where the Chinese invested  down a better economic road  
It also helps that Africa has a patient new friend with deep pockets and a long view  When the rest of the world was dismissing Africa as a troubled backwater  China was busily embracing it  maybe recalling its own rise from famine and chaos   China has been striking deals with struggling developing countries   the  axis of the unloved   in her words   in return for investment  employment and infrastructure 
Why did China choose Africa  The answer is simple  China needed to secure raw materials for the country s economic boom that started around 2000  and Africa had those materials  
The sheer size of the African continent   the world s second largest   implies a bounty of natural resources  South Africa and Botswana are rich in diamonds  the DRC supplies 60  of the world s   a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of electric vehicle batteries  Africa ranks highly as a source of aluminum  chromite  copper  gold  iron ore  manganese  zinc  graphite  coal  oil  uranium  platinum group elements  and phosphate rock  
Armed with hundreds of billions of US dollars from the country s foreign reserves  in the early 00 s    to fuel China s exploding economy 
China wanted to diversify out of the massive US dollar component of its foreign exchange reserves  so the SOE SWFs had no problem dealing in straight cash and operating in what some might consider high risk areas  Chinese investors shifted their focus from Australia and Canada to higher risk destinations which included Brazil  Ecuador and Africa 
According to a Pricewaterhouse Cooper  PwC  report on M A activity in the mining sector for the decade ending in 2010  PwC counted a total of 400 Chinese deals worth US 48 billion  At the start of that decade  China was a negligible player in M A 
The Chinese are making massive loans  building huge infrastructure projects such as   dams  bridges  roads  schools and hospitals  While SOEs and SWFs are making deals for the country s resources  other Chinese companies are building the necessary infrastructure that every country needs to build a future for its citizens  This is the key to China s overseas investments   adding infrastructure capacity makes their massive  most often early stage resource investments viable and creates a long lasting economic legacy for the host country 
Thanks to the trillions of foreign exchange reserves it holds  China offers loans at highly competitive interest rates  For example  the Export Import Bank of China  Exim Bank  gave the Angolan government three loans at interest rates ranging from LIBOR  London Interbank Offered Rate   the rate banks charge each other on loans   1 25    up to LIBOR  1 75  
The Chinese have a longer term horizon for repayment  because they are mostly after off take mineral supply agreements from early stage development projects 
Reconstruction in war battered Angola was helped by three oil backed loans  then Chinese companies came in and built roads  railways  hospitals  schools  and water systems  Nigeria took two loans from China to finance electricity generating projects  The Chinese built a hydropower project in the Republic of the Congo that was repaid in oil and built another hydropower project in Ghana that was repaid in cocoa beans 
 While the West supports microfinance for the poor in Africa  China is setting up a  5 billion equity fund to foster investment there  The West advocates trade liberalization to open African markets  China constructs special economic zones to draw Chinese firms to the continent  Westerners support government and democracy  the Chinese build roads and dams   Isaac Twumasi Quantus
The overall Chinese package is very attractive and there are a lot of resource rich countries taking the Chinese up on their offers 
Monroe lite
Could the US do the same in other countries  Of course it could  
In the 1800 s the United States under President James Monroe invoked the Monroe Doctrine  which stated that any effort by European nations to control any independent state in North or South America would be viewed as  an unfriendly disposition towards the United States   
The intent of the Monroe Doctrine was to free the newly independent colonies of Latin America from mostly Spain and Portugal  so that the States could exert its influence undisturbed 
The point of mentioning the Monroe Doctrine is to illustrate how far the United States has moved away from it  Now  the real influencer in Latin America is China  evidenced by the billions worth of investment either through the purchase of mining and energy company stakes  or outright mine acquisitions 
Arguably  following the model set out by the ERGI would only accelerate China s lead over the United States viz a viz cutting deals with foreign mining assets  
However  now that the United States has become more aware of its critical metals vulnerabilities  through China s trade war threat to restrict rare earth exports for example  it may consider a sort of  Monroe lite  doctrine focused on a strategy for achieving productive and conflict free critical mineral supply chains  
As mentioned a better way of advancing US critical mineral development would be to identify countries that are friendly to US interests  and invite them to join a US led  critical minerals consortium   Members could include Canada  Mexico  Chile  Argentina and Peru   all countries rich in mineral wealth the US could sign offtake agreements with  and within a reasonable shipping distance from US ports  
The group could even be expanded to include Japan and South Korea  two large Asian economies  heavily export driven  that are tied through military alliances to the US  That way  the consortium could engender friendships and deals not only between miners and suppliers  but suppliers and manufacturers   such as a  mine to battery to EV  supply chain that could include mining companies  battery manufacturers and auto makers  
Moreover  such a consortium would also be a springboard for economic growth and employment  Build mines and all the associated infrastructure  bringing badly needed  high paying jobs to impoverished regions of Latin America  thereby lifting people out of poverty and lessening the steady march of migrants to the US border  looking for a better life  With Monroe lite  taken directly from the Chinese playbook on resource tie up  who needs a border wall ",2019-09-29,Richard Mills,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-americas-critical-minerals-strategy-is-doomed-to-fail-200468966,200468966

204846,426362,GOLD,5 Breakout Stocks For Superlative Returns,opinion,As favored a strategy as it is divisive  picking breakout stocks is one of the most popular techniques among active investors  The idea is fairly simple    to identify stocks trading within a narrow band and buying them when they move above this channel or sell when they move below  If a stock moves above the channel  it promises substantial gains for investors But critics warn of the risk of timing such a move or identifying a wrong breakout level  However  when executed correctly  this strategy can yield lucrative gains  which explains its enduring popularity Identifying Breakout LevelsThe key to this strategy is calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The floor of a stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the resistance is a stock s breakout level and it can gain substantially if it breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand  demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening

204867,426383,GOLD,What Is GOLD Telling Us About The Metals Market ,opinion,"Since this article is being addressed to longer term investors  I think you will likely appreciate the message within this write up 
While I analyze the metals markets on many time frames  this perspective is based upon a daily chart which has months to still play out 
But  before I move into my perspective of the market  allow me to summarize how I view the metals market in general so everyone can make the appropriate decisions for their own accounts  especially since some of you may not agree with the prism through which I view the metals  However  I can tell you that it is based upon much experience with the metals market 
So  let me back up to the last quarter of 2015  As the market was meandering in an overlapping manner into the lows we struck  I was noting that I was buying heavily into the complex as I expected that many stocks  as well as the metals  were completing long term bottoming structures in the last quarter of 2015  And  we all know what happened in the first half of 2016  The rally in early 2016 presented me with a nice 5 wave structure off a bottoming target we set well before we struck it  And  when the market bottoms where it should  and develops a 5 wave rally  I begin to view the market with bullish glasses rather than bearish ones 
It is for this reason that whenever the market presented us with a 3rd wave break out potential over the last 2 years  I outlined it as my primary perspective  As I have explained many times in the past  if the train is getting ready to leave the station  I want to be on it  And  although the market invalidated two break out set ups over the last 2 years  that did not discourage me 
Moreover  I was quite clear to all those that follow my analysis to refrain from using leverage for the  set ups   Rather  I have cautioned many times about the evils of leverage until the market proves it s in the heart of a 3rd wave 
Those that have heeded my words  and have steered clear of leveraged positions  have done quite well over the last three years  In fact  if we look at Barrick  NYSE GOLD  alone  you would see that it is up over 2X since we initially bought it back in 2015  How many major stocks do you own that have been up 2X over the last three years  even though they went sideways in a multi year correction 
So  now the question is what does GOLD tell me about the rest of the metals complex  Well  it tells me that I want to remain on the long side of the market  You see  while the market may provide us with more consolidation  I have no reason at this time to re consider my long positions until I see how GOLD rallies to the next target in the 27 region  And  with GOLD at 15 85 as I write this article  that means I am expecting another 70  appreciation in this stock before I have to re evaluate my holdings  Moreover  since my purchase was from much lower levels  my stops are now set at the 11 50 region 
This means that GOLD is telling me that the metals complex is likely setting up for another strong run as we look towards 2020  And  ideally  I would like to see GOLD blow through that 27 region  on its way well over 38 in the coming year or two   No  that was not a misprint  
So  as this market sets up its next bullish move higher  I think we can sit back  set our stops  and simply let the market run and work for us in the coming months to year ahead ",2019-07-11,Avi Gilburt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-is-gold-telling-us-about-the-metals-market-200438702,200438702
204868,426384,GOLD,Gold And Silver Miners  The Hot Action Is Now,opinion,"It s the ultimate  no brainer  that serious American GDP growth  in the 6  range or higher  can only happen by eliminating the PIT  personal income tax  for the middle class 
QE and low interest rates incentivize pathetic levels of debt oriented GDP growth while incentivizing the government to get more reckless with the money that is borrowed and extorted from citizens as taxes 
Elimination of the PIT would instantly turn the debt bombed middle class of America into a  savings and purchasing power machine  
With higher rates and elimination of the PIT  government would be forced to shrink  banks would eagerly loan out the savings to mainstream business  and the middle class would consume with savings rather than credit card debt 
The bad news  The PIT won t be eliminated  and government worship of debt  QE  low rates  and extortion is not going away 
The good news  That means the gold price is going higher 

The key buy and sell levels for gold 
Gold investors should be eager buyers of gold  silver  and the miners in the  1390 gold price area or on a breakout above  1440 

This is the key weekly gold chart 
The most likely scenario for gold now is a rally towards  1500  1523  followed by a significant pullback that will probably look a lot like the late 2009 pullback 
What actually happens is almost certainly going to depend on the actions and statements from the Fed at the July 31 meeting 
If the Fed isn t as dovish as expected  gold could pullback towards  1320 quite quickly  A half point cut and a dovish outlook could produce a dramatic  target overshoot  for gold  A surge to  1750 would be quite realistic in that situation 
Whatever happens   1390   1360  and  1320 are all key buy zones and  1440   1500  and  1750 are all decent profit booking targets 

This is the daily silver chart  Like Rodney Dangerfield  silver doesn t get much respect  but that s because inflation has yet to really surge 
Having said that  the silver chart is beginning to look quite bullish  A breakout from an inverse H S bottom pattern has occurred  and the pullback was flag like 
The target of both the flag and the H S pattern is the  16 50 area highs of February 
From a risk reward perspective  silver is beginning to look superior to the US stock market 

This is the swing trade chart 
Swing trade enthusiasts can get in on the leveraged ETF action for gold stocks and the Nasdaq with my guswinger com service  We are also carrying a massive Barrick  NYSE GOLD  position  Signals are available by email  and cell phone text for traders with US cell phone numbers  

An analytical look at the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  daily chart  I use a 24hour chart for GDX  On this chart  a surge above  26 45 would be a fresh buy signal not just for GDX  but for most intermediate and senior gold producers 

This is the silver stocks ETF  NYSE SIL  chart 
Note the recent superior performance of the silver miners compared to silver bullion 
There is an H S bull continuation pattern forming on the chart and I believe that pattern makes an  upside blast  to my  34 target price zone highly likely 
The bottom line for gold and silver stocks  The action is solid  and the action is now

204870,426386,GOLD,Gold  Good News But Where s The Demand ,opinion,"This is the long term gold chart  Fundamental and technical analysis are both strongly supporting gold s rally towards the key 1400 area 
Having said that  COMEX price action mainly reflects action in the physical market and this is the weak season for gold  Investors need patience  News in the West that  should  push gold  100 ounce higher is in play  but modest physical market demand in China and India means that rallies are modest 

If this news was happening during the Chinese New Year Jan Feb peak physical demand time frame  gold would be staging a  barnburner  rally 
Instead  it s contained in a  1280  1350 consolidation range 

This is the daily gold chart 
The bottom line  Gold is on a journey to the  1400  1420 price zone  but it s not a rocket ride  It s more of what I call a  bull eraplod  
The other fact to keep in mind is that the inversion of the US yield curve with artificially low rates isn t suggesting that Americaneconomic growth is  cratering  
Growth is slowing down  but it s too early to predict that a recession is imminent  A US China trade deal could provide somemedium term support for stock markets without being negative for gold 
Central bank gold accumulation is another positive factor  but it s currently only about 50 60 tons a month  In the weak season Chindian demand often drops from 200  tons a month to about60 80 
Central bank and Western fear trade demand is decent  but isn t making up for the shortfall caused by the drop in Chindiandemand  That s being reflected in commercial trader action on the COMEX 
Gold is rallying strongly from the  1280 zone because Chindian dealers are buyers there  They are fading their buying in the 1310  1320 area  leaving Western money managers to do the heavy lifting  That s no easy task with Chindia quiet 
To put it simply  Western financial news is gold supportive in content  but until Chindian buying resumes in size gold will bemore of a trader s market than the start of a  huge bull run  

The good news is that  1280  1350 gold is a great price for the miners  and many are surging to one fresh high after another  This is the fabulous VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  chart 
I ve suggested that a Friday close of  23 or higher for GDX and  14 for Barrick  GOLD NYSE  would open the door to a much more significant rally for most gold and silver mining stocks 
GDX closed above  23 yesterday and Barrick  NYSE GOLD  closed above  14  It s not Friday yet  but this is a very positive sign 
I don t expect gold to move above  1350 until Chindian demand begins to strengthen in August  unless there s a major economicshock in the West 
Having said that  when it does rise to  1400  1420  I expect a massive bull run to occur in the miners  The logic for this outlook is that most analysts have underestimated the profits that miners will make at  1400   and global stock markets are likely to swoon again in the Aug Octcrash season 
In Sept 2018  gold was in the  1200 range  If it is in the  1400 area in Sept 2019 with stock markets swooning  institutionalmoney managers could engage in a gold stock buying frenzy 
A September rate cut from the Fed to calm the panic would likely enhance the frenzy 

This is the silver stock ETF chart 
Note the recent rise of the key TRIX indicator above the zero line 
That s the sign of a technically healthy market  A sustained bull run for silver stocks would be signaled by a Friday SIL NYSE closeabove  30

204880,426396,GOLD,Gold  Price Action Positive And Poised To Continue,opinion,"As the new year begins  gold continues to gain respect as the ultimate investment asset  Unfortunately  the same cannot be said for the U S  dollar 
Most investors tend to view the dollar as a  safe haven   but the big bank forex traders that really move the currency market view the dollar as a risk on asset class 
They view gold and the Japanese yen as the main risk off assets  So  when the dollar falls against the yen and gold as the U S  stock market rises  all may not be quite as it seems to investors 

After building an immense sloping H S top pattern  the dollar has collapsed against the yen and is now almost in  free fall  
That top pattern is technically a  head and shoulders  top  bear consolidation pattern   and its implications are ominous 
I m short the dollar versus the yen  and short the dollar versus the yuan  in the forex market  Traders are making solid profits on these anti dollar trades 
We re also long Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares  NYSE NUGT  and Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   With John Thornton and Mark Bristow at Barrick s helm  I now have a  200 long term price target for Barrick  The NYSE stock symbol is set to change from ABX to GOLD tomorrow  and that s positive news 


As 2019 begins  investors need to think hard about whether it s more important to predict a late cycle rally for the U S  stock market  or a much better idea to focus on the spectacularly bullish price action taking place on the long term gold chart 
India s government is launching a new pro gold policy within a few weeks  That will see gold become endorsed as a respected investment asset class by the government  A significant chop in the import duty will likely follow  and discussions are already underway with Russian entities about duty free imports 
In the U S   the current collapse in the dollar comes late in the business cycle  The big bank forex departments are almost universally negative on the dollar  and rightly so 

The dollar melt down against the yen is happening as the U S  stock market trades lower on ramped up quantitative tightening that Fed chair Powell now says is on  auto pilot   Investors who ignore quantitative tightening in the late stage of the U S  business cycle are making as big a mistake as ignoring quantitative easing at the 2009 trough of the cycle 
Also  a Dow Theory sell signal could take place in 2019 if both the Transports and the Industrials cannot make new daily closing highs and then break the current lows 
I m long the Dow now via  NYSE UDOW   but that s just a technical swing trade  albeit a winner already  In the big picture  investors need to think about only one thing in 2019 and that is gold 
While the job market is officially very tight  a lot of that tightness can be explained by a large number of part time jobs  The labor department counts one worker working two part time jobs as two people working  That s arguably fraudulent accounting  Regardless  the huge number of part time jobs is the main cause of the slow growth in wage inflation 
Having said that  as the full time jobs market tightens significantly in 2019  much more wage inflation will appear  and it will do so as corporate earnings fade towards the single digits growth range 
In a nutshell  Welcome America  to the rebirth of Stagflation 
I ve predicted that investors are making a mistake if they sit around and wait for Trump to  make things great  while the U S  government debt rises ever higher in the late stage of the business cycle  It s an understandable mistake that comes from frustration with the hideous socialist and war mongering policies of past U S  administrations  The murderous war mongering has been financed with gargantuan debt  making it even more vile 
Regardless  the much wiser plan of action is to use Trump s incredible work ethic and business acumen as personal inspiration to take professional action in the gold and silver market 


This is the awesome silver chart  I wanted to see a three day close over  15 20  a Friday close over that same price  and I also hoped to see that  cake  iced with a 2018 year end close above  15 20 
All three technical events occurred  While the short term target is the decent price area at  16  I am projecting much higher prices over the 2019 2022 time frame  It s important that all precious metals investors understand that while gold soared above its 1980 high in 2010 2011  silver barely made it back to its 1980 high of about  50  That s because the world has been in a general deflationary  lower rates  cycle since about 1980 
Now  stagflation and higher rates over the long term  like occurred in America in 1966  1980  are beginning  When silver barely made it back to its 1980 high after 30 years  the price action was not  parabolic  like it was in the late 1970s  It was more of a modest blip related to gold dragging silver modestly higher in an overall risk off play  What s coming for silver now is much different than what happened in 2011  It will be parabolic  as stagflation reaches a crescendo  years from now   but it s only barely beginning 



I ve boldly referred to GDX  NYSE GDX  as  Prince of Assets GDX  and called the entire  23    18 price zone the most important investor accumulation zone in the history of markets 
With maverick money managers like Ray Dalio calling for a U S  inflationary depression while amateur investors try to gamble on the late stage of the stock market cycle  I predict there s a 90  chance that I m proven correct 
On this GDX chart  I d like investors to note the bullish action  the enormous volume  and also take a close look at the  21 67 resistance area that GDX has already closed above repeatedly since arriving there  All the price action is positive  and it s poised to become much more positive as January trading gets underway  Perhaps I should let  Queen Gold  and  King Silver  have the final word as 2019 begins  which is  Happy New Year to the entire world gold community ",2019-01-02,Stewart Thomson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/happy-new-year-from-queen-gold--king-silver-200372158,200372158

204884,426400,GOLD, Gold Has Suddenly Regained Its Luster,opinion,"The sentiment shift is still subtle  but it s both real and widespread  After a few years of being ignored and or dismissed as basically useless  gold is cool again  attracting positive press and increasing accumulation by big investors 
India  for instance  imported less gold than usual in the first part of this year but lately has ramped up its buying  with August imports more than double the year earlier amount 

Hungary just did something even more dramatic 

Hungary Boosts Gold Reserves 10 Fold  Citing Safety Concerns
Hungary s central bank increased its gold reserves 10 fold  citing the need to improve its holdings  safety  joining regional peers with relatively high ownership in the European Union s east 
Following a similar move by Poland  the central bank in Budapest now holds 31 5 tons of the metal  taking the share among total reserves to 4 4 percent  in line with the average in the region  according to a statement published on its website Tuesday 


Meanwhile  the long dormant South African gold miners are seeing sudden interest 

Is the Canary in the Gold Mine Coming to Life Again 
Back in late 2015 and early 2016  we wrote about a leading indicator for gold stocks  namely the sub sector of marginal   and hence highly leveraged to the gold price   South African gold stocks  Our example du jour at the time was Harmony Gold  HMY   see  Marginal Producer Takes Off  and  The Canary in the Gold Mine  for the details  
As we write these words  something is cooking in South African gold stocks  that much is absolutely certain  Here is a chart of the JSE Gold Index in ZAR  South African rand  terms 



While we cannot be sure why investors have suddenly become enamored with the precious metals sector  it is probably a good guess that gold stocks are by now so cheap that they are considered a worthwhile target for rotation purposes 

And it s not just South African miners  The industry s big names are suddenly outperforming tech stocks  From Thursday s Wall Street Journal 

Investors Are Digging Gold Again
In times of market turmoil  investors often embrace gold  And when that happens  gold mining stocks tend to do even better 
That has certainly been the case so far this month  New York gold futures are up about 3  so far in October versus a roughly 4  decline for the S P 500  Shares of many of the world s biggest gold miners  meanwhile  have notched double digit gains 
Companies like Toronto s Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE ABX   0 75    South Africa s AngloGold Ashanti NYSE AU  0 15  and Acacia Mining  LON ACAA  are all up around 15  to 19  after a bruising summer  The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  exchange traded fund and the iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners  NASDAQ RING  fund which track indexes of global gold mining firms are up around 9  to 11  this month 



Gold miner stocks allow investors to double down on bets the gold price will rise  These companies have higher fixed investment costs and can become much more profitable when gold prices climb  Many of these companies pay out hefty dividends  too 
An added bonus  Hopes for further consolidation are adding to the momentum after Barrick Gold in September agreed to buy Randgold Resources Ltd   LON RRS  for  6 billion  Investors have poured  278 million into the VanEck gold miner ETF over the past month  according to FactSet  while flows into EPFR tracked gold funds climbed to an 11 week high last week 

Notice the WSJ appealing to investor animal spirits by touting the benefits of gold miner leverage  

 Gold miner stocks allow investors to double down on bets the gold price will rise  These companies have higher fixed investment costs and can become much more profitable when gold prices climb  Many of these companies pay out hefty dividends  too  

This is the kind of thing that hasn t been said of gold miners for a long time  because when the metal s price is declining extreme leverage works in reverse to crush earnings  Now  however  the other  happier edge of the leverage sword is starting to cut 
WSJ also predicts a surge in M A   which is always exciting because it offers a sudden payoff without the long wait for earnings to accrete over time   and then points out that money is pouring into related ETFs  thus reassuring new investors that they re not alone  but part of a growing trend  These are the kind statements that get people excited 
If history is any guide  end of cycle dynamics should now take over  with rising volatility sending capital pouring out of  risk on  assets and into safe havens  So expect a lot more media accounts explaining the advantages of sound money and the benefits of miner leverage

204885,426401,GOLD,Trigger Time For Gold Stocks,opinion,"After breaking upside from a double bottom pattern  gold continues its solid price action  More good times lie directly ahead for precious metals investors  because Chinese New Year buy season begins very soon 

Note the solid position of my key 14 7 7 Stochastics indicator on this daily gold chart 
The US stock market s  traditional end of the year rally  is turning into a veritable turkey shoot for the bears  Gold seems immune to the action  suggesting that unseen inflationary pressures may be larger than most investors realize 

Investors need to understand that as the business cycle matures  volatility in the stock market rises 
Any decline could be the start of a bear market  A  buy the dip  approach to the market becomes a death trap as corporate earnings peak  rates rise  GDP peaks  and inflation gains attention 
The bottom line  US stock market bears crack the whip  and late cycle price chasers take a horrific trip 

Morgan Stanley s top currency analysts believe the dollar has peaked against most of the currencies it recently rallied against  Hedge fund  superman  Ray Dalio is talking about a 30  dollar devaluation  He proposes monetizing the US government s huge debt as a  final solution  
I ve suggested a  Plaza Accord 2 0  is going to happen  I believe President Trump will lead preliminary discussions about it from behind closed doors at the upcoming G20 meeting 

As empires peak and then die  the peak usually comes with the nation enveloped in a state of  war worship  
Massive amounts of money are borrowed by the government to fund the madness  but even that isn t so enough  so more is extorted via  taxes  from struggling citizens 
In the case of America  more than 25  of the government s gargantuan debt is easily attributable to war worship 
The final nail the US government s debt coffin likely came when instead of cutting the capital gains tax to zero and beginning a Treasury monthly gold buy program  the government decided to impose tariff taxes to  boost growth and make trade fair  
Import tariffs are the best form of taxation  but only when used instead of income and capital gains taxation  In this case  tariffs are layered on top of income and capital gains taxes  The bottom line  Instead of becoming a super sized version of Switzerland  America risks becoming a stag flationary wasteland 
Ray Dalio speaks of  other currencies  rising to prominence as the dollar fades  He says he doesn t want to be specific about it though  Is that because gold is one of those currencies 
The US stock market has begun collapsing  inflation is on the move  and junior miners should be looking good  Are they 

Most of the world s smallest resource companies are in the Canadian CDNX index 
It s the best indication of the overall health of the global junior mining and junior energy sectors  I highlight key buy and sell action points on my gracelandjuniors com website for many of the CDNX component stocks  This is a look at the signals for the index itself 
There s no significant buy signal yet  but in early 2019 as inflation likely moves higher and US GDP declines  a  America  it s time to usher in the new year with a new and not so exciting era of substantial stagflation   welcome mat will be rolled out 
I expect to get a major buy signal for the entire junior mining sector as that happens 

I m impressed with the price action of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  on this daily chart 
Note how quickly GDX has surged back above the neckline of that pesky H S top pattern after breaking down  That s positive action and now there s a bull wedge in play too 

This is the long term GDX  Trigger Time  chart 
Investors also need to watch the price of Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  closely  If it can close above  14 00 on Friday of this week  that will be a major buy signal  and Barrick is my most important lead indicator for GDX and the entire senior gold stocks sector 
All gold stock investor eyes need to be laser focused on the  22 50 zone for GDX  because if GDX can stage two consecutive Friday closes above that price  I will have a massive buy signal in play 
Thanks 
Cheers

204890,426406,GOLD,Barrick  ABX  Up 2 2  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX    Shares have added about 2 2  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ABX due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Barrick s Q1 Earnings In Line  Sales Beat EstimatesBarrick recorded net earnings  attributable to equity holders  of  158 million or 14 cents per share for first quarter 2018 compared with  679 million or 58 cents a year ago Barring one time items  adjusted net earnings came in at 15 cents per share for the quarter  which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Revenues fell roughly 10 2  year over year to  1 790 million in the first quarter  The figure however  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 764 9 million Cost of sales  applicable to gold production  fell roughly 15 5  year over year to  1 046 million in the quarter According to the company  first quarter results benefited from higher gold prices despite lower production levels compared to the prior year quarter Operational HighlightsTotal gold production was 1 05 million ounces in the first quarter  down roughly 19 9  from 1 31 million ounces a year ago Average realized price of gold rose 19 2  year over year to  1 332 per ounce  AISC increased 4 1  to  804 per ounce from  772 in the year ago quarter Copper production decreased to 85 million pounds from 95 million pounds in the prior year quarter  Average realized copper price was  2 98 per pound  up from  2 76 a year ago Financial PositionCash and cash equivalents were  2 384 million at the end of first quarter  up roughly 4 7  year over year At the end of the quarter  Barrick s debt was  6 344 million  down 16 9  from  7 633 million a year ago  The company plans to reduce its total debt to  5 billion by the end of 2018  using cash flows from operations and cash in hand  Also  more than three quarters of the company s  6 4 billion of outstanding debt will not mature until 2032 GuidanceFor 2018  Barrick continues to anticipate gold production in the range of 4 5 5 million ounces at AISC of  765  815 per ounce and cost of sales of  810  850 per ounce The company expects gold production in the second quarter of 2018 to be more or less in line with the first quarter at around 1 million ounces  The results in the second quarter are likely to be impacted from a scheduled maintenance shutdown at the Barrick Nevada roaster 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus    VGM Scores
At this time  ABX has an average Growth Score of C  though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D  The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side  putting it in the top 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Interestingly  ABX has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/barrick-abx-up-22-since-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200318699,200318699
204891,426407,GOLD,Call Options Are Cheap On This Bouncing Gold Stock ,opinion,"Shares of Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE ABX  have been trending higher since they touched a two year low of  11 07 in early March  The gold mining stock has recently consolidated some of these gain near a trendline with historically bullish implications  And with front month implied volatilities low  it could be time to bet on ABX s next leg higher with call options 
Taking a closer look at the charts  the stock rallied nearly 25  from its March low to its late April peak at  13 80  ABX has since pulled back to within one standard deviation of its 40 day moving average  and according to Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  there have been six other times this has occurred in the last three years after the stock has been trading above the trendline 60  of the time in the past two months  and in eight of the previous 10 trading days 

Today  ABX shares are up 0 8  at  13 44  rising in step with gold prices amid   Should the stock continue to bounce from its 40 day trendline  there s plenty of skepticism priced in  which could help fuel the fire  For starters  most analysts remain on the sidelines  with 13 of 17 maintaining a  hold  or worse rating on Barrick Gold    leaving the door open for upgrades to draw buyers to the table 
Plus  short term options traders are more put heavy than usual  per the equity s Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 1 09    in the 75th percentile of its annual range  Peak front month open interest of 37 751 contracts resides at the underfoot June 13 put  which could create a level of options related support as the hedges related to these bets unwind 
Those wanting to bet on more near term upside for Barrick Gold stock may want to consider options  The equity s Schaeffer s Volatility Index  SVI  of 23  ranks in the 7th annual percentile  meaning short term options are pricing in lower than usual volatility expectations at the moment ",2018-05-25,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/call-options-are-cheap-on-this-bouncing-gold-stock-200319205,200319205
204892,426408,GOLD,Gold Mining Industry s Costs Are Higher Than Market Realizes ,opinion,"New information suggests that the cost to produce gold is much higher than what the market realizes  As the cost to produce gold has skyrocketed over the past two decades  the mining industry has hidden certain costs by placing them in their capital expenditures  This has lowered their  Cost of Sales  figures but has significantly increased their capital expenditures 
Furthermore  this massive cost shift has forced the gold mining industry to tackle these big problems  with big solutions  However  these big solutions come at a big cost  For example  as the average gold ore grade has fallen substantially over the past 20 years  the gold mining industry now has to move a great deal more ore to produce the same or even less gold 
In order to move a great deal more ore  the mining industry has to spend a lot more on trucks  tires  materials  energy  and labor  In my newest video below  I show in detail the BIG CHANGES taking place in the top four gold miners in the world 

I believe several of the charts in this video has never been seen before by precious metals investors and alternative media community  To understand why the cost to produce gold is higher than what the industry has led us to believe  we have to focus on the massive amount of capital invested by the gold mining industry 
Unfortunately  the investment of billions of additional dollars in capital expenditures by the top gold miners has not kept production from falling  Actually  the top four gold mining companies  production peaked more than ten years ago and continued to trend lower 
One of the charts in the video shows the enormous increase in the amount of ore processed at Barrick s Nevada Gold Mining Operations  In just 20 years  Barrick s  NYSE ABX  Goldstrike and Cortez Mines now how to process four times  24 million tons of ore  to produce the same amount of gold then they did in 1998 

To understand the tremendous increase in capital expenditures and costs to process four times more ore to produce the same amount of gold at Barrick s top mines  I highly recommend watching the video above  Moreover  I provide additional cost analysis on the top four gold miners as a group 
The gold mining industry is plagued by rising costs in all areas  While some of these costs have decreased over the past several years due to a falling oil price  these costs will likely increase going forward as ore grades continue to decline  Furthermore  as global oil production begins to experience  Seneca Cliff  like declines in the future  gold production will be negatively impacted  even with much higher gold prices

204900,426416,GOLD,Commodities Flashing Once In A Generation Buy Signal,opinion,"Since the commodities supercycle began unwinding 10 years ago  many investors have been waiting for the right conditions to trigger mean reversion and lift prices  I believe those conditions are either firmly in place right now or  at the very least  in their early stages 
Among them are factors I ve discussed at length elsewhere a weaker US dollar  a steadily flattening yield curve  overvalued U S  stocks  expectations of  trade war jitters  geopolitical risks and more 
In addition  nearly 60 percent of money managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch believe 2018 could be the peak year for stocks  A recent J P  Morgan survey found that three quarters of ultra high net worth individuals forecast a U S  recession in the next two years 
All of this makes the investment case for commodities  gold  and energy more compelling than at any other time in recent memory 
Exhibit A is the chart below  which I ve shared before but recently updated with new data  Relative to equities  commodities are as cheap right now as they ve been in decades  This is literally a once in a generation opportunity that investors with a long term view should seriously consider  For perspective  had you invested in a fund tracking the S P GSCI or an equivalent commodities index in 2000  you would have seen a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of around 10 percent for the next 10 years  according to Bloomberg data 

We all know that past performance is no guarantee of future results  but it s doubtful you re going to get a clearer or resounding signal that now could be an ideal time to add to your commodities exposure  If you feel as if you ve been stuck at a traffic light these past few years  just waiting to put your foot on the accelerator  you can breathe a sigh of relief because the light may have just turned green 
Goldman  Time to Overweight Commodities
I m not alone in my bullishness  In a note last week  analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote that  the strategic case for owning commodities has rarely been stronger   The bank recommends an overweight position  estimating that commodities will yield at least 10 percent over the next 12 months  with most of the gains being made by crude oil and aluminum 
Whereas crude traders are responding primarily to concerns that output could be disrupted by intensifying conflict in the Middle East  specifically oil producer Syria  aluminum prices have skyrocketed following the imposition of fresh U S  sanctions against a number of Russian firms  Among them is United Company RUSAL  MCX RUAL   the world s second largest aluminum company  responsible for producing as much as 6 percent of global supply 
WTI Testing  70 Resistance
Since its low of  26 per barrel in February 2016  the price of West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude has surged nearly five fold and is currently at its highest level in more than three years  Last Wednesday  oil jumped nearly 3 percent on reports that US inventories had fallen more than expected  suggesting the global glut continues to recede  And on Thursday  WTI tested resistance at  70  a level we haven t seen since November 2014 

But prices retreated again Friday after President Donald Trump blasted OPEC on  proving once again how quants comb through social media at lightning speed and use sentiment analysis to inform their trades   With record amounts of Oil all over the place  including the fully loaded ships at sea  Oil prices are artificially Very High  No good and will not be accepted   the president said 
As I shared with you earlier this month  OPEC and Russia are planning to work more closely together to limit output for a number of years  possibly as many as 10 or 20  Such an agreement would help support oil prices Saudi Arabia  in particular  seeks higher prices to take Saudi Aramco  the world s largest energy company  public but it s likely American shale producers would ramp up production to fill the void  The U S  is now the number two oil producer in the world  having overtaken Saudi Arabia late last year 
Will We See  3 000 Aluminum 
Aluminum is likewise enjoying a strong rally  jumping sharply more than 23 percent since the White House announced sanctions against select Russian firms and oligarchs in response to the Eastern European country s alleged interference during the 2016 presidential election  In nine of the past 11 trading days through Thursday  the metal posted positive gains  surging nearly 6 percent on Wednesday alone 

Aluminum soared to  2 715 per metric ton in intraday trading Thursday  the highest we ve seen since April 2011  The rally may have further to run  writes Goldman Sachs  which forecasts a price range of between  2 800 and  3 000 this year 
Australian British multinational Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  and Melbourne based BHP  NYSE BHP   two of the world s top aluminum producers  were both upgraded to  BUY  this week by CLSA  partly in response to rising aluminum prices but also because they maintain strong balance sheets and are expected to generate favorable free cash flow  FCF  this year 
China s One Belt  One Road Still Needs Biblical Amounts of Materials
Also bolstering the commodities investment story is China s massive ongoing  Belt and Road  megaproject  also known as the Silk Road Economic Belt  In a note last week  CLSA reminded us that the infrastructure initiative is still in its infancy  expected to be completed by 2049  It will cut through as many as 68 countries across Asia and Europe  affecting an estimated 62 percent of the world s population  China has already spent approximately  180 billion to complete various projects  but many billions more will go toward building roads  ports  dams  high speed rail  airports and more all to  enhance regional connectivity   as President Xi Jinping put it  and strengthen China s economic clout 
To give you some scale as to how monumental and historic this undertaking truly is  the graphic below  courtesy of BHP  compares the development to the U S  Marshall Plan  then one of the most expensive projects in human history  The Belt and Road initiative could eventually cost 12 times as much or more  with total spending estimates ranging between  4 trillion and  8 trillion 

Estimates of how much energy and natural resources will be needed during the development phase vary wildly  but I think it s fair to assume that demand will continue to be supported for some time 
Gold Supply Concerns Highlight Rarity
Gold ended last week down slightly  the first time in three weeks it s done so  It looks as if gold investors took some profits late in the week after the yellow metal came close to breaching  1 360 on Wednesday 
I still believe gold could hit  1 500 an ounce this year on rising consumer and producer prices  which I think are understated  This is more than apparent when you compare the official U S  consumer price index  CPI  and alternative measures such as the New York Fed s Underlying Inflation Gauge  UIG   And as Dr  Ed Yardeni points out in a recent post  the word  inflation  appeared as many as 106 times during the latest Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting  a sign that Fed members could be getting more and more concerned about mounting inflationary pressures 
Recent reports also suggest gold production is slowing  which could help support prices long term  Exploration budgets have been declining pretty steadily since 2012 after the price of gold peaked  and fewer and fewer large deposit mines are being discovered 
Last week the China Gold Association announced that the country  the largest producer of gold  produced 98 million metric tons in the March quarter  down some 3 percent from the same period last year  This comes after total Chinese output in 2017 fell 6 percent year over year to 426 million tons  Granted  miners have been pressured by Beijing to curtail production as part of the government s enforcement of tougher environmental protection policies  but the decline in output is part of a downward trend we re seeing across the board  especially among major producers 
Take a look at the declining quarterly output of Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   the world s largest gold miner  According to its preliminary results for the first quarter  Barrick produced a total of 1 05 million ounces from its 10 projects  That s only a 2 percent decrease from the same quarter last year  but a far cry from where it was seven years ago 

Since the news hit April 11  shares of Barrick are up about 3 percent  even after a Friday selloff 
While some investors might view the lower output as disappointing  others no doubt see it as a reminder that gold is a finite resource  one of the many reasons why it s remained so highly valued for centuries  As I ve written before  the low hanging fruit has likely already been picked  making the task of mining the yellow metal more difficult as well as expensive  Supply isn t growing nearly as fast as it once did 
And yet demand continues to climb  Not only do the peoples of India  China  Turkey and other countries have a strong cultural affinity to gold an obsession that will only intensify as incomes rise but the metal still plays a vital role as a portfolio diversifier in times of economic and political uncertainty

204901,426417,GOLD,Gold Investors  Jobs Report Tactics,opinion,"A time tested mantra for the US stock market is   Sell in May and go away  
The depth of a stock market sell off that begins in May depends on where the United States economy sits in the business cycle  In the early stages of the cycle  sell offs that begin in May are great buying opportunities 
As the business cycle peaks  the US stock market has a nasty habit of not just losing upside momentum in May  but suffering a horrific crash in September or October 
Tomorrow is the next FOMC meeting and there s clearly a new sheriff in central bank town 
I refer to Ben Bernanke as Dr  Jeckyll and Jay Powell as Mr  Hyde  The bottom line is that Powell is proceeding with aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening  QT  
With the Fed now deploying a major hiking cycle while the business cycle is in a late stage  the more appropriate mantra for 2018 could be   Sell in May or get blown away  

Note the price zone on this Dow chart that I ve defined as a key line in the sand for the US stock market 
Some Fed speakers have talked about the potential for the central bank to become more aggressive  given the inflationary implication of tax cuts coming at this late stage of the business cycle  If Powell himself makes any such statement this week it could create an institutional investor panic  That would likely send the Dow tumbling under my line in the sand zone 

Stock market investors who bought only in recent years should give serious consideration to the use of put options as a strategy to mitigate the fast growing risks that the US central bank is putting on their table 
My personal stock market focus is China and India  and to a lesser degree South Korea and Japan  These markets can crash along with the US market  but they are poised to recover more quickly and offer vastly more long term upside potential than US markets 
Most neocons think that North Korea s Kim responded to Trump threatening him  I don t believe Kim or most North Koreans are threatened by Trump at all  Trump did show Kim that if North Korea wants to spew endless war mongering propaganda about America  he can do so too  He simply showed Kim how silly and outdated this propaganda is for the modern era 
Peace on the Korean peninsula is coming not because of silly  hawk talk  from Trump but because North Korea s government is ready to make economic deals and move away from pure communism  Trump has likely offered significant economic carrots to Kim in return for dialing back its nuclear weapons programs 
 Some big investors see warning signs ahead for markets but are holding their positions  Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris is taking action  He s put half of his  5 7 billion net worth into gold     Bloomberg News  May 1  2018 

Sawiris is arguably one of the world s biggest gold stock investors  He s a master investor with a target of  1700 to  1800 for bullion 
Sawiris wants to see more hardcore business owners on the boards of gold mining companies  His opinion is that there are too many miners and bankers on these boards  and to really succeed in what I call the  gold bull era   more businessmen are needed  I agree 

Sawiris is one of the largest shareholders in Australia s Evolution Mining  AX EVN  stock  and it s pretty clear he s riding a winning horse  Evolution is the number two gold producer in Australia now and it s magnificently poised to prosper in the China and India oriented gold bull era 
I have a long term target of  100 a share for Evolution  Investors can be comfortable paying as much as  10 for this fabulous company  In the  5 to  3 area  I m an eager buyer on every 25cents dip and an eager seller of a third of what I buy on rallies that carry the stock 50cents higher than my buy price 
I cover Evolution  and other key Aussie miners  on my junior miners site at gracelandjuniors com It s a key component of my extensive  Thunder Down Under  portfolio 

Gold bullion is performing exactly as I ve projected it would over the past couple of weeks  Excitingly  it s now entering my key  1310 to  1280 buy zone 
Investors who took my recommendation to buy put options in the  1370 area should begin booking juicy profits on those options now  Book more profits on more options on any deeper weakness under  1300 ahead of this Friday s jobs report release 
I don t expect any serious upside gold price fireworks to occur until the Fed s June meeting is complete  That will almost certainly see Powell oversee another rate hike and a ramp up of QT  That should shock US stock and bond markets and blast gold higher  Having said that  gold is oversold now  In the days following the jobs report  a decent move higher is likely in the cards for gold price enthusiasts 

For the past few years  key Chinese gold jewellery stocks and Aussie miners have soared higher while VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  and most Western miners have languished  I think that s about to change  with GDX set to join the upside fun  regardless of what happens to bullion in the medium term 
Yesterday s high volume day should be noted  Days where volume spikes tend to suggest a minor trend rally or decline is almost finished  Some GDX components  like Barrick  NYSE ABX  have soared higher while bullion has swooned  That hasn t happened in a meaningful way since the heady inflationary days of the 1960s and 1970s  The inflation that will be created by launching tax cuts in the late stage of the business cycle is only beginning  and investors need to get positioned in gold stocks now to benefit 
Investors should focus any buying of protective put options more on bullion than gold stocks  Regardless  gold bullion is poised for good second half of the year performance  and gold stocks are poised for a great one 
Thanks
Cheers

204915,426431,GOLD,Large Speculators And The House Of Pain ,opinion,"Every bottom in gold is characterized by massive long liquidation by the Large Specs  precious metals analyst Michael Ballanger states 

This week s COT report once again confirms that the Large Speculators are arguably the stupidest group of gold traders in existence  To be certain  as criminality is to the Commercials  brainlessness is to the Large Specs  They are constantly long massive positions at major turning points in gold and silver and are consistently on the wrong side of the trade  Pundits love to refer to the Small Speculators as  dumb retail  or the typically green  blindly optimistic newcomer piling into gold futures after receiving an e blast from one of the blogs praising the regenerative powers of gold and silver  However  I have been watching the Small Specs for a while now and they have actually been on the right side far more often  but without question  residing forever and a day in the House of Pain  are the Large Specs  The last two COT reports illustrate this point perfectly but first take a peek at the last 30 days of gold trading 

You can see how the gold market traded down in the two COT weeks ended February 6 and 13 amidst massive liquidation by the large speculators 
Now observe the massive liquidation of all of those positions bought in late January as high as  1 370 as the blogger world chortled and chimed   1 360 breakout     Recalling  MJB Rule 1 of Gold Trading   what is it that we do when an obvious technical support or resistance level is taken out  Why  we go the other way of course  You SELL  breakouts  and you BUY  breakdowns  because of one resounding theme  THE GOLD MARKET IS RIGGED  31 656 contracts were purged from the Large Spec portfolios representing 3 165 600 ounces of gold with a notional value  assuming average liquidation price of  1 315  of  4 162 764 000  Forget about the cretins on the other side of those comedic capitulations  we KNOW all about the machinations of the Commercials  What slays me  though  is just how much money is lost and how it happens literally four or five times a year but what is unmistakeable is that every bottom in gold is characterized by massive long liquidation by the Large Specs 

Last week I was feeling pretty much vindicated as the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  NYSE UVXY  got hammered back down into the mid teens from my exit points at  23 25 after a brief stint above  30  as the panic of early February was replaced by the solace and certainty of plunge protection  Massaged back under  10 by the serial interventionalists and master manipulators manning the trading desks of the government sponsored agencies around the planet  you want to avoid this vehicle for another few weeks as you can pretty much assume that the big boys will resume their volatility suppressing antics if for no other reason than to teach the latecomers a painful lesson or how  past performance is no guarantee of future profit   Delving into Barron s  Market Lab  this weekend  I noticed that the American Association of Individual Investors sentiment index went from 44 8  bulls the week before the meltdown to 37  bulls during the meltdown and right back to 48 5  bulls this past week  rendering sentiment to where nothing about the 10  one week plunge mattered  Rising yields  hot CPI  heightened volatility mattered not as we head into the final stretch of winter  which is exactly what I wrote last week about the market heading right back up to test or exceed the highs by the end of May 

You can see how quickly market sentiment exited the  Euphoria  levels from late January  but it is still way above the levels seen last summer when the reading was a hair above  Panic  
I was also feeling pretty cocky that the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares ETF  NYSE JNUG  which I grabbed at  13 35 two Fridays ago  was powering above  16 after a two day dip to  11 34 but once again  late Friday goofiness took gold down below  1 350 again and the Gold Miners threw a tantrum with the ARCA Gold BUGS off 2 33  on the day alone  Nevertheless  I continue to be a buyer of any and all dips in the physical metals and always have to remind myself just how much of a move would be required to get to  all time highs   a phrase we have had to listen to for most of the past 15 months for every asset class EXCEPT gold 

People tend to forget just how far down the Gold Miners have fallen since the highs of 2011 but when you look at how pathetic they have been managed over the years  you have to wonder why anyone would buy them  Look at Barrick s Pascua Lama project where they have written down U S  429 million because they broke every rule in the book muscling their way into water rights  environmental breaches  and incompetent execution  There are times when I wish they would exclude Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  from the Gold Miner Indices altogether and let the well run smaller companies like Eldorado  NYSE EGO  and AngloGold  NYSE AU  carry the water 
It might also be nicely refreshing to see one of the major mining companies actually join into the lawsuits of bullion banks such as Scotiabank  HSBC  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn    UBS and Barclay s but since they just never know when they might need one of them to either lend them some money or head up a financing  they just stick their heads in the sand while the product they search for  produce and sell gets suppressed  injuring all of their shareholders on a daily basis 
We head into what is ostensibly the final week of February with the arrival of Spring a mere thirty one days away  With this weekend s  Up and Down Wall Street  entitled  The Ghost of Inflation Reappears   Barron s Randall Forsyth does a pretty good job in accidentally removing inflation fears as a potential stock market land mine because  as you all know  when something becomes a headline in Barron s  it is  by the time of arrival  obsolete  Mind you  it wasn t the cover story so perhaps it will resurface later in the Spring when the CPI detonator really gets flipped 
I am not going to make any dire predictions as to the vibrancy of the current stock market rebound but based upon the behavior of the market last Monday and Tuesday  I am convinced that the powers that be were hell bent to avoid a full on technical breakdown  The orchestrated rebound after the S P knifed down through the 200 dma at 2 540 was classic PPT so anyone wondering whether or not the central planners had cut the umbilical cord found out on the last trading day of the week that the serial interventionalists had not yet left the equity market building  However  they are sticking a microscopic pin into the bubble so as to allow a slow leak as opposed to a  POP  and that  I contend  will be the continuing mantra for the balance of 2018 
I had a call from a buddy who is getting killed on his  Short euro  Short yen  strategy  which he executed on the assumption that like all other financial crises  the USD would rally in response to either higher rates  which we have  and or safe haven buying  The problem with that is when you are the largest debtor nation on the globe  rising interest rates challenge the viability of your currency because of DEBT  The U S  dollar is no longer the safe haven  it is now the Achilles Heel of the global economic reflation and I didn t write  recovery  or  expansion  or  boom  further cementing my belief that what worked from 2009 until 2017 will not work in 2018 and beyond  The game has changed  the tide has turned  and formerly successful investment tactics will need to be replaced

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ABX due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Barrick s Q4 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesBarrick recorded net loss  attributable to equity holders  of  314 million or 27 per share for fourth quarter 2017 against net earnings of  425 million or 36 cents a year ago Barring one time items  adjusted net earnings came in at  253 million or 22 cents per share for the quarter  Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents Revenues fell roughly 3 9  year over year to  2 228 million in the fourth quarter  but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 181 million Cost of sales fell roughly 3  year over year to  1 411 million in the quarter Full Year 2017 ResultsFor 2017  Barrick Gold reported adjusted net earnings of  876 million or 75 cents per share  up 7  from  818 million or 70 cents per share in 2016 Revenues went down roughly 2 2  year over year to  8 374 million  Operational HighlightsTotal gold production was 1 339 million ounces in the fourth quarter  down roughly 11 7  from 1 516 million ounces a year ago Average realized price of gold rose 5 2  year over year to  1 280 per ounce in the quarter  AISC increased 3 3  year over year to  756 per ounce from  732 in the year ago quarter Copper production decreased to 99 million pounds in the fourth quarter from 101 million pounds in the prior year quarter  Average realized copper price was  3 34 per pound  up from  2 62 a year ago Financial PositionCash and cash equivalents were  2 234 million at the end of 2017  down roughly 6 5  year over year During 2017  Barrick Gold reduced total debt by  1 51 billion to  6 4 billion  surpassing its target of  1 45 billion  The company plans to reduce its total debt to  5 billion by the end of 2018  using portfolio optimizing and cash flows from operations  Also  more than three quarters of the company s  6 4 billion of outstanding debt will not mature until 2032 GuidanceFor 2018  Barrick Gold anticipates gold production in the range of 4 5 5 million ounces at AISC of  765  815 per ounce and cost of sales of  810  850 per ounce Per the company  higher cost guidance reflects lower expected gold production from Pueblo Viejo  Veladero and Barrick Nevada  higher costs at Acacia and increased processing of higher cost inventory   Moreover  Barrick Gold expects gold production for the first quarter to be roughly 1 million ounces at proportionately higher costs than those anticipated for the remainder of the year  mainly due to scheduled maintenance at Pueblo Viejo and lower grades at Barrick Nevada

204917,426433,GOLD,Is Barrick Gold  ABX  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Barrick Gold has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 2x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Barrick Gold s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Barrick Gold has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Barrick Gold stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Barrick Gold has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ABX is somewhat in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Barrick Gold currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Barrick Gold a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Barrick Gold might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of D  This gives ABX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen one up and eight down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 23 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 8 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus

What s more  overall prices tracked by this basket of consumer goods rose 2 1  year over year  which also came in above expectations  Coupled with the recent rise in wages  investors have even more reason to fear that the Fed will raise interest rates in order to curb possible inflation

Spot gold was up 0 4  at  1 279 99 an ounce after touching  1 284 97  its highest level since Sep 29  Last week  the bullion had logged a fourth straight weekly loss due to a stronger dollar  strength in U S  equities and growing expectations of a rate hike by the Fed in December President Trump s Tweets Rekindle North Korea FearsSafe haven demand for the yellow metal received a boost as the latest tweets by U S  President Donald Trump were construed by investors as that the United States North Korea standoff could be about to enter a new phase  Per the President s tweets  years of talking with North Korea over its nuclear buildup have proved futile and that  only one thing will work   This gave rise to conjecture that military action was on Trump s mind North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons are a  powerful deterrent  which assure North Korea s sovereignty  Last week  President Trump had commented during a photo session with senior military officials that the gathering could represent  the calm before the storm   No further light was thrown on the comment though Gold Q3  In ReviewGold hit its lowest point of the quarter in early July  when it fell to  1 204 per ounce on higher expectations of a rate hike  Gold prices peaked to  1 351 an ounce on Sep 8  the highest this year  on escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea Despite rising to above  1 300 level in September  gold prices subsequently went on the back foot as investors grow more optimistic about the prospect of U S  rate hikes and tax cuts that are likely to boost the U S  economy  Further  with the North Korean conflict taking a back seat for some time and strong numbers coming in from the United States  investors have renewed appetite for riskier assets  which has dulled the demand for safe haven gold Nevertheless  gold gained 5  in the third quarter  Gains from a weaker US dollar and geopolitical tensions between the United States and North Korea were the main highlights  The Fed also drove gold prices during the quarter  The central bank suggested at its last meeting that it will implement one more interest rate hike later this year and another three in 2018 
What Lies Ahead for Gold Gold had a good start to the fourth quarter  However  gold s upside may be dented as the dollar is likely to strengthen on expectations of the Fed hiking interest rates in December  However  geopolitical tensions  terrorist attacks might fuel safe haven demand and prop up gold prices  Further  prices will be aided by retail demand in India as last quarter of the year is seasonally strong for gold in India  with the upcoming Diwali festival and wedding season Improved Price Performance  Attractive Valuation In the third quarter  the Zacks  has gained 5 7   outperforming the S P 500 s advance of 3 8  Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures   the gold mining industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 7 36  lower than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 11 49  The industry s lower than market positioning calls for some more upside moving ahead We have  consequently  highlighted a few gold stocks that are good buys right now  backed by a strong Zacks Rank and upward estimate revisions Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd    TO KL   engages in the exploration and development of gold properties  The company owns and operates five underground gold mines  including the Macassa mine  the Holt mine  and the Taylor mine in Ontario  Canada  and the Fosterville Mine in Victoria and the Cosmo Mine in Northern Territory  Australia  as well as four milling facilities in Canada and Australia

204931,426447,GOLD,Gold And Gold Stocks  Patterns  Cycles and Insider Activity  Part 2 ,opinion,"Cycles and Sentiment
Another recurring pattern consists of the seasonally strong period in gold around the turn of the year  which is bisected by a mid to late December interim low in the gold price  An additional boost can be expected in January and Feburary from the strong seasonal uptrend in silver and platinum group metals as well  to see the seasonal PGM charts  scroll down to our addendum to this   
Rallies in silver tend to be quite supportive for precious metals stock indexes  as silver stocks have an even higher beta than their gold brethren  note in this context that the Philadelphia Gold Silver is the more broad based of the two indexes these days and contains far more silver stocks than the HUI  
Below is the 20 year seasonal gold chart  with the period from the December 20 interim low to the late February peak highlighted  Note that the statistical data shown on the chart refer specifically to the highlighted period  which in turn is an average of the action at this time of the year over the past 20 years 
Obviously  there are years in which no gain is achieved in the seasonally strong period  but over the past 20 years the probability that prices would rally was 70   14 6   7 3   Moreover  while the gains in profitable years ranged from  8 52 to  17 98   losses were much smaller  confined to a range of just  1 60 to  3 30  
Interestingly  even if one averages only the performance of bear market years  i e   years which close at a y y loss   the period of strength still shows up during January  We suspect this is due to the exceptional seasonal strength in silver during this time period  gold probably tends to rise in sympathy 

Gold  20 year seasonal chart with all relevant statistics  The December interim low is close to the mid December Fed meeting  i e   in recent years the seasonal pattern and the  FOMC relief rally  were going hand in hand
The 20 year seasonal chart of silver exhibits even more strength over a slightly longer time period starting on the same date  the probability of a rally is 80   and the average gain is 9 39   profits ranging from  12 90 to  42 92    which is a stunning 58 70  annualized 

Note  regardless of how long the period chosen for the calculation is  the seasonally strong period in silver is always clearly visible and exceptionally large  it is even noticeable if one averages only bearish years  Apparently industrial users traditionally stock up at the beginning of the year  Strength in silver tends to particularly helpful for the performance of the XAU and HUI indexes 
By coincidence  a 13   month gold time cycle discussed by Tom McClellan in  also aligns very closely with the seasonal trend this year  as it bottoms in December  Here is a chart that shows this cycle  Note that both full and half cycles apparently often tend to align with lows and occasionally consecutive lows  surround  the projected cycle low  In short  this is not the most precise of cycles 

A gold time cycle followed by Tom McClellan   its 2017 trough is in the last week of December 
Such  fixed  time cycles generally have less validity than seasonal patterns  but we thought it was interesting that this particular one happens to coincide with the December turning point in the seasonal trend and the other data points pointing to a December trend change this year 
Regarding sentiment  we want to mention two data points that stood out around the time of the mid December low  a  just ahead of the FOMC meeting the second lowest DSI reading of the year occurred  DSI  daily sentiment index of futures traders  13  bulls   the lowest was 10  at the July low   and b  at the same time the sentimentrader Optix indicator  which combines positioning data in futures and options with the most prominent surveys  fell to 31 points   the lowest reading since early January of 2016 


Gold Optix   not only was the reading of 31 points the lowest since 04 January 2016  it also indicated that bearish sentiment became more pronounced despite gold trading at a higher level than on previous occasions when the Optix reached short term lows this year  This can be interpreted as a bullish divergence  In fact  gold price  Optix level divergences at lows are quite a common feature  interestingly  they are not as frequent at peaks  
Sentiment data follow prices  which tends to limit their usefulness  especially in strongly trending markets  We have noticed that depending on whether a strong overarching uptrend or downtrend is underway  the range in which the Optix moves will shift up or down  Once one has a good idea of what this range is  one can expect that readings near its upper and or lower bounds will at least lead to short term counter trend moves  regardless of the primary trend 
If the gold market moves sideways   as it has done over the past 1   years   the Optix tends to be quite reliable as a short term contrary indicator  An extremely low  or high  reading that occurs near the boundaries of a sideways price range is usually associated with a medium to longer term opportunity 
Insider Activity
We have kept the best for last   this may well be the most interesting and encouraging of the data points we have discussed  As our friends at  in Canada recently reported  lately insider buying at gold companies has basically  gone off the charts  compared to historical standards 

The spike in insider buying in the gold sector this fall  which went hand in hand with the decline in prices  was already the second one this year  but it attained extraordinary proportions 
There are several things worth noting here  first of all  insider buying in the gold sector is rare  especially outside of the exploration  junior sub sector  When exploration company insiders buy  it signals that they are confident in discoveries they have made and believe that investors have yet to realize what their true value is 
While explorers no doubt benefit from rising metal prices  they are not a sine qua non for their success   it is enough if prices manage to remain fairly stable  By way of example  if a company starts out with nothing but a hunch about where to drill  and it suddenly finds a million ounces of near surface high grade gold  it won t matter much whether gold trades at  1 200 or  1 300   a re rating of the stock is certain to happen either way 
Two things were remarkable about the recent surge in insider buying  for one thing  it was the biggest since the fall of 2015  which was one of the most noteworthy such buying sprees in a long time as well   Secondly  it was quite broad based  there was a lot of buying from insiders at senior and mid tier producers  As an example  numerous Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  insiders purchased sizable amounts of stock in the public markets  n b   it is best to consult   a number of US data providers are silent on the matter  

ABX  daily over the past two years  The chart pattern is of course reminiscent of the HUI pattern  only it looks actually a bit weaker  Since April the declines seem to be a lot more vigorous than the bounces  Insiders have bought the stock hand over fist between late November and late December though   presumably the chart will soon improve 
Keep in mind that gold mining insiders have no special insight in future gold price trends  So what is the message when insiders at senior and mid tier producers buy stock in the companies they run  Obviously their buying has to be based on what they do know and have control over  We would take it as a sign that the trend toward better cost control and improving margins continues apace  and insiders evidently believe the market is still underestimating it 
Lastly  gold mining insiders have definitely proved savvy with respect to their timing in recent years  Their purchases from mid to late 2015 were certainly amply rewarded  and they actually happened to catch at least a short term low this summer as well  In any case  it is definitely worth paying heed when they buy as much as they recently have   one would normally expect this to be at least of medium term significance 
Conclusion
To summarize  chart patterns  seasonal trends and cycles  sentiment and insider buying all paint a fairly positive picture for the gold sector at the moment  This should at least be good enough to support a short term move higher  and perhaps more 
However  as we noted at the beginning of   things are never as clear cut as one would like  One fly in the ointment is the fact that the major fundamental gold price drivers are not exactly bullishly aligned right now  Similar to what we observed earlier this year already  they are at best in a neutral or slightly bearish position 
That said  they are pregnant with possibilities  i e   they all could quite easily turn bullish in view of the increasingly hostile monetary backdrop   We will discuss fundamentals and inter market relationships relevant to gold in a follow up post shortly ",2017-12-29,Pater Tenebrarum,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-gold-stocks--patterns-cycles-and-insider-activity-part-2-200276507,200276507
204937,426453,GOLD,Gold  Silver And Miners Are Sizzling Hot,opinion,"Gold and silver prices have reached important long term buying interest areas last week and we have the first reversal signs  If you have been reading my daily analysis in gold through my partnership with  you know I remain longer term bullish and you were notified promptly by the wedge pattern breakout and the warning signs we were given before the upside reversal 


My minimum bounce target is at  1 260 but overall I believe there are a lot of chances that an important low is in and that a new upward move has started  that eventually will break the long term downward sloping trend line we have hit so many times and got rejected

From both a fundamental and technical perspective  this rally is now due for a pause  Technically  an inverse H S bottom pattern appears to be forming  A pause now in the neckline area at about  1260 would allow the right shoulder of this pattern to form 
Fundamentally  the next Fed meeting is tomorrow and gold tends to trade softly around Fed events  I ve recommended light profit booking into this rally and I continue to do so 

This is the important US dollar versus Japanese yen chart 
The dollar has fallen against the yen and fallen against gold since July 10  In the short term  a pause for gold and a rally for the dollar seems imminent 
In the bigger picture  the dollar could begin a  meltdown  phase as gold bursts above the neckline in the  1260 area  A move above  1260 opens the door to a surge towards  1300  which is a bigger profit booking area for gold investors 

VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  had a particularly nasty day yesterday  It broke down from a negative wedge pattern on heavy volume 

Acacia Mining  LON ACAA  is majority owned by Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   and Barrick is a major GDX component stock 
While Acacia could theoretically recover from this nightmare  it looks hopeless  Even if they do convince the Tanzanian government to reduce the tax bill  that could take years  The sand in Acacia s hourglass is running out fast 
Gold stocks are likely to stumble more than gold in the short term because of this Acacia quagmire  There is some very good  big picture  news though 

I ve been a little disappointed with the slow pace of the Trump administration in making its campaign promises happen 
Having said that  Trump s appointment of Randy Quarles to the Fed may be a much more positive event than most analysts realize  It could be his most important action since taking office 
That s because it may represent the beginning of the end for the bank bonus system that has benefitted Wall Street at the expense of Main Street 
The bottom line is that Dodd Frank regulation has combined with low interest rates to create a small business loans quagmire  Thousands of small American banks aren t engaged in trading with other people s money like the big banks are  They get all the regulatory stick  and none of the trading with other people s money carrot 
Quarles could make significant progress in ending this hideous quagmire by reducing regulations  That opens the door to ending the 22 year down cycle in money velocity 
The arrival of Quarles at the Fed with a deregulatory mandate is not a  free gold stocks parabola now  buy signal  but it is a key step in an important process that can reward patient gold stock investors  It s very difficult for gold stocks to consistently outperform gold bullion while US money velocity is in a bear cycle 
I ve dubbed Randy Quarles  Mr  America   That s because he can be the catalyst that ends the bear cycle in bank loans  money velocity  and gold stocks versus gold  A few more rate hikes from Janet combined with real deregulation of the US banking system can produce a powerful bull cycle in bank loans to Main Street 
It would come at the expense of Wall Street  I ve predicted that if Quarles is successful  Main Street can grow America s GDP at a 5  rate  while the US stock market goes into a stagflationary gulag  The entire world gold community should cheer that Quarles makes the US banking system  Main Street  and gold stocks  great

204942,426458,GOLD,Centenera Mining  How Cheap Is It  ,opinion,"Centenera Mining Corp  V CT  is a target and catalyst rich  100  Argentina focused junior  with highly prospective assets spanning Copper   Cu    Gold   Au   and Lithium   Li    It has a market cap of just C 11 4 M   US  8 4 M  May 12th  at C 0 20 per share   meaningfully undervalued in my view  CT has 7 properties projects  3 of which are front and center 
The most important project to watch is an outcropping Cu Au porphyry system with a discovery hole intersection of 353 m grading 0 49  Cu Eq   incl  243 m at 0 57  Cu Eq   incl  88 m at 0 69    The Company also has a gold project with a JORC compliant conceptual geological target of 600k   940k ounces Au at 0 92   0 94 g t  and a promising hard rock lithium opportunity undergoing a property wide mapping and detailed surface sampling program  On top of it all  a tremendous management  Board   technical team  see details below  

Centenera Mining was formed in mid 2015 in anticipation of a much more pro mining governmental party coming to power in Argentina  This came to pass when Mauricio Macri won the Presidency in late 2015  Since then  improved sentiment continues to take root  culminating in the imminent signing of a comprehensive Federal Mining law  Here s an update from Mining com on the topic 

Argentine authorities  industry players and unions are expected to sign a long awaited federal mining agreement that unifies existing legislation across the country  The nation  once a favourite of mining investors  has fallen behind neighbours Chile and Peru despite containing rich deposits of copper  gold  silver and zinc  Under the previous Administration  Argentina received investment of only  10 billion from 2007 to 2015  while Chile s mining investments totaled  80 billion and Peru s  52 billion over the same period 

Stronger confidence is evidenced by the acquisition of Goldrock s Lindero Gold project in Salta Province by Fortuna Silver Mines  2016   Several projects companies are attracting attention   investment  For instance  Golden Arrow Resources Corporation  V GRG  Chinchillas Silver Project in Jujuy Province  where Silver Standard Resources  TSX  SSO   NASDAQ  SSRI   exercised an option  March 2017  to form a 75  25   private  JV company centered on Chinchillas   Silver Standards s producing Pirquitas Mine 
Barrick Gold Corporation  TO ABX   NYSE ABX  the world s largest gold producer recently agreed to co develop one of its largest mines  Veladero   April 2017  with a State backed Chinese firm  The agreement also contemplates the parties jointly developing the massive Pascua Lamagold project  and co investment opportunities along the border of Argentina   Chile 
Huachi Cu Au project
In January 2017 Centenera signed a binding Letter of Intent granting it an option to earn a 100  interest  subject to a 2  NSR  in the Huachi Copper Gold property from Macondo S A  The Property consists of a central copper gold porphyry deposit and a peripheral epithermal gold system  The Company is targeting the large scale Cu Au porphyry system  On March 6th  a NI 43 101  was published 
Huachi is in San Juan Province  2nd highest ranked Province in Argentina  Source  Fraser Institute Mining Survey  2017  in the northwestern region of the country  Despite a long history  it was first drilled in 2006 with a key discovery hole intersecting 199 m grading 0 35  Copper Equivalent   Cu Eq    from surface  Several more drill holes were completed  the best returned 353 m grading 0 49  Cu Eq   incl  243 m at 0 57  Cu Eq  incl  88 m at 0 69   

Historical exploration includes detailed geological   alteration mapping  surface rock sampling  a geophysical induced polarization survey west of known mineralization and 20 diamond drill holes totalling 6 640 m  Between 1979 1999 limited field studies were completed by government agencies  including German   Japanese groups  work that resulted in a total of 406 samples 
From 2005 2007  Cardero Resources conducted a modern  systematic exploration campaign focused on the porphyry mineralization  The program consisted of systematic rock sampling  detailed property scale mapping  an IP survey  and drilling  11 holes  2 552 m   The goal was to delineate copper gold porphyrymineralization 
Cardero viewed the exploration results as positive  but for financial reasons allowed the option to expire in 2009  The following year the property was optioned by Kestrel Gold Inc  who drilled 10 diamond drill holes  4 174 m  in 2011 focused on the peripheral epithermal gold system  NOTE   Current focus is on the Cu Au porphyry system 

 Exploration programs completed by Cardero from 2005   2007  and Kestrel  2011   2012  greatly increased the understanding and potential of the Property  Cardero s was the first comprehensive modern exploration with an emphasis on finding and defining a porphyry copper deposit  Cardero was successful in identifying both widespread porphyry copper and low sulphidation epithermal gold style mineralization    Source  Page 51 of  

As a rough valuation exercise  one could compare Huachi to First Quantum s Taca Taca project  which was acquired for US 0 015 per Measured  Indicated   Inferred resource pound Cu Eq  Current pre development projects are valued by the market in the range of  US 0 01 US 0 025 per pound Cu Eq in the ground  However  since many have a primary project with a PEA  PFS or BFS attached  I assume a per pound value of US 0 0075 

Management is shooting for 500 Metric tonnes   Mt    drill results this year will be telling  At 500 Mt x 0 40  Cu Eq  that would be 4 41 billion pounds  worth  US 33 M   at  0 0075 lb   equal to  C 0 61 per share  The chart below assumes all warrants options are exercised  C  US    1 3333 and 0 40  Cu Eq  Indicative share prices are based on millions of tonnes of potential resource  from 200 to 800 million  and the prospective market valuation  from US 0 005 lb  to US 0 0125 lb  
To be perfectly clear  500 M tonnes is far from a sure thing  However  historical exploration points to targets to be drilled this yearthat could provide evidence of a scale that attracts attention  Many projects with solid grades reach into the hundreds of millions of tonnes  but the cost   benefit analysis of additional drilling becomes increasingly difficult without the real possibility of economically viable scale  That s why Huachi s substantial 353 m length intersection is so promising  a few more 150 200 m  intervals with good grade would make a world of difference 
Organullo Gold Project
The  has a JORC compliant conceptual  non NI 43 101 compliant  exploration target tonnage and grade ranging from 600k   940k ounces Au at 0 92   0 94 g t  A good start  but the project will require significant drilling to fully assess the extent of mineralization  Management feels it would be too time consuming and equity dilutive to move Organullo forward alone  A plan of farming it out is well underway  with conversations among a small number of interested parties 
In terms of potential valuation  the obvious comparison is the above mentioned Fortuna Silver acquisition of Goldrock s Lindero project last year for US 130 M  or about US 60 oz of gold  Lindero was far more advanced than Organullo is today  it had  2 17 M  combined  Proven  Probable  Measured   Indicated ounces at an average grade of  0 6 g t  And  Lindero was at an advanced exploration stage  sporting a US 150 M NPV and 26  IRR  By contrast  Organullo has only a conceptual exploration target of  the midpoint  770 000 ounces at a grade of  0 93 g t  So  50  higher grade  but 4 5 years behind where Lindero was when it was acquired 

So  770 000 ounces x US 60 oz   US 42 2 M  Discounting that figure back 4 years at 20  equates to a prospective valuation of  US 22 M for 100  of the project  However  it s reasonable to assume that Centenera might end up farming out 75  of the project  to minimize equity dilution from exploration development   Arguably a 25  Interest  perhaps free carried for a few years  might be worth US 22 M x 25    US 5 5 M  which equates to  C 0 13 per share  NOTE   A highly speculative assessment  but there s room for resource growth  and the grade is strong   Therefore  Huachi   Organullo alone could be worth nearly C 0 75 per share  AND evidence supporting or refuting this indicative valuation exercise is forthcoming 
Meanwhile  management is diligently working towards farming out Organullo and possibly Huachi  but not before further drill results   This would free up managerial and capital resources to actively pursue other compelling undervalued assets 
Hard rock Lithium Play in Salta Province
One last property worth mentioning is the Company s hard rock Lithium play  The El Quemado project is located in Salta Province   top ranked province in Argentina   80 km west of the city of Salta and consists of 7 959 hectares on 19 claims  Several known pegmatite occurrences have been found  most of which have seen limited historical exploitation  The project includes the historic El Quemado small scale mine  a former tantalum operation 
Historical production was focused on tantalum  niobium   bismuth  but modern demand   economics would greatly favor lithium  subject to grade   purity   For example  the world s largest hard rock lithium producer  located in the Greenbushes pegmatite belt of southwest Australia  mined mostly tantalum before lithium was first produced in the mid 2000s  Despite historical production  no modern systematic exploration has been undertaken at El Quemado  meaning that observed occurrences have never been drilled or subject to formal resource estimation 
Management  Board   Advisory Team Members
Every company claims to have the best team  but pound for pound CT truly has a great one  For a small company to have such talented players speaks volumes about the attractiveness of CT s asset portfolio  President  CEO   Director Keith Henderson M Sc  has 20 years  mining industry executive experience in Africa  Europe  North   South America  I m impressed with Keith s technical expertise  but also his business acumen  He s been very candid about the substantial upside  but also the work that needs to be done and the risks ahead  Importantly  Keith understands the benefits of bringing in partners to fund exploration activities to minimize equity dilution 
This week s announcement of John Drobe  P  Geo joining CT as Lead Technical Advisor really caught my attention  He s not only a 30 year mining veteran  but also a world class expert  specializing in   porphyry copper gold  epithermal and skarn deposits throughout Latin America   Exploration Manager Tyler Caswell  P  Geo compliments Mr  Drobe s remarkable skill set  Caswell was most recently with MMG Ltd  where he was focused on resource expansion   exploration at the Las Bambas porphyry   skarn deposit cluster in southern Peru 
Director Henk Van Alphen  with 35 year s experience  has multiple successes under his belt  including in his current role as Chairman of lithium junior Wealth Minerals  a company that s increased its market cap by  400  in the past 18 months  Henk s reputation and industry contacts are unsurpassed  especially in South America 
Make no mistake  Centenera Mining Corp  is a highly speculative investment  but the size of the prize is considerable  De risking via farm outs this year and exploration results from Huachi  Cu Au  and El Quemado  Li  represent near term catalysts that management is cautiously optimistic about  The share price briefly touched C 0 50 in October of last year when Cu   Au prices were stronger  and was as high as C 0 295 in February  Notably  the high tick of C 0 50 per share was before management executed the Huachi option agreement 
CT has 57 M shares outstanding   4 575 M options at C 0 25   10 8 M warrants at C 0 15    C 0 30  Except for 400k options issued this week  all options   warrants expire between May 15   December 31st  2017  Management states that     60  of stock with supportive shareholders

204947,426463,GOLD,Gold And The Inflationary Firestorm,opinion,"Hardly a day goes by now without more good news for gold investors appearing  and the pace of this news flow is accelerating 

Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan was interviewed by the World Gold Council in the February edition of their influential  Gold Investor  magazine 
That s a snapshot of some of the interview  The former head of the Fed gives a magnificent report card to gold as the ultimate asset and currency 

In India  the restrictions on cash withdrawals from banks are set to end on March 13  That s just two days ahead of the ultra important US debt ceiling deadline on March 15 
March 15 is also the date of the next interest rate decision from the Fed  The bottom line  gold obsessed Indians will soon have the ability to purchase significant amounts of gold to bet on ongoing problems for the US government 
America is the world s largest debtor nation  and as Alan Greenspan notes  the country desperately needs enormous infrastructure spending  but it can t afford it  President Trump is almost certainly going to press congress to put even more debt on the backs of ageing American citizens to get that infrastructure spending done 
That s going to create significant inflationary pressure  and the US central bank s rate hikes are going to exacerbate the problem 
That s because the bank is in  uncharted waters   the enormous QE money ball sitting at the Fed has been a huge cause of deflation  It s put a drag on money velocity by incentivizing banks to hold reserves at the Fed 
Trump is killing the Dodd Frank bank reserve requirement rules at roughly the same time as the Fed hikes rates again  That creates a powerful incentive for the banks to move money out of the Fed and put it into the fractional reserve banking system 
As that happens  money velocity is going to reverse and it could literally  skyrocket   Back in 2013 I predicted that the Fed was beginning preparations to taper QE to zero  to be followed by a long rate hiking cycle  I also predicted that US real interest rates would go negative as the Fed began raising rates 

Clearly  that s exactly what is happening  and I ll dare to suggest that the gold community s  inflationary fun  has barely started 

This is the gold chart  Short term price enthusiasts can be buyers at my  1220 support zone  and sellers at  1245 
Gold has  attacked  the  1245 area twice  and another inflationary rate hike from the Fed and or a hike in the debt ceiling from Trump is almost certainly to be the catalyst that Indians and bank FOREX traders use to bid gold through that resistance zone 

This is the GDX chart 
Gold stocks are drifting sideways in a loose rectangle formation  Technically  the odds of an upside breakout are about 67   using the classic Edwards   Magee handbook on technical analysis 
The only way to make an ageing debtor great is to force the debtor to pay what they owe and reduce their debt levels 
Unfortunately  the Trump administration appears to be under the impression that using strategies designed to work superbly in a low debt environment will work equally well in a high debt environment 

It s not just the American government that is embarking on a protectionist agenda  It s happening in many countries  and institutional money managers clearly see that as positive for gold 
Horrifically  ageing American debtor citizens have used most of their savings for daily living expenses because of low interest rates  Now  surging inflation with only modestly higher interest rates is set to ravage the purchasing power of the remnants of those savings 
Wave pressures are substantial  but so far corporations have not passed on the wage inflation to consumers in a major way  More rate hikes will end the stock buybacks game for corporations  and put serious pressure on their ability to finance their business operations 

Businesses will soon respond with significant price increases at the retail level  This is the ABX chart 
When the inflationary grim reaper comes to town  gold stocks and silver are an investor s best friend  The  19 area represents a convergence of both trend line and horizontal support 
Note the high volume bar in play last week  Volume tends to spike near the end of a minor trend rally  and the upcoming pullback is likely an ideal entry point for all American inflation enthusiasts 

The upcoming March 15 debt ceiling and rate hike fireworks show is just one of many reasons to own gold  silver  and high quality gold stocks for both the short and long term  This is the silver chart  Silver price enthusiasts who want to be on board for a big upside ride as corporations pass on wage inflation to consumers should be eager buyers in the  17 25 area

204948,426464,GOLD,Soros And Paulson Out Of Gold,opinion,"In the fourth quarter of 2016  Soros Fund Management got out of gold  while Paulson   Co  reduced its stake in the SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   What does it mean for the gold market 
According to regulatory filings publisher earlier this month  Soros sold out his remaining shares in Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   the largest gold mining company in the world  The move followed getting out of shares of the SPDR Gold Trust in the previous quarter  Meanwhile  John Paulson reduced his stake in than investment fund from 4 8 million to 4 4 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2016 
These moves may indicate that market fundamentals are believed to be bearish for the yellow metal  You see  when important gold bulls are selling their holdings in the shiny metal  it may mean something  It seems that Soros and Paulson are embracing the Trump Trade  betting on softened regulations  tax cuts  higher interest rates  and a stronger U S  dollar 
However  the regulatory filings show the investment positions at the end of 2016  But a lot changed in 2017   February is almost gone and the Trump rally is waning  Investors worry about the new president s rhetoric that a strong dollar is bad for the U S  This is why gold has performed well so far this year  Now  markets focus on today s Trump address to the Joint Session of Congress  which could be an important event for the gold market 
The take home message is that Soros and Paulson reduced their exposure to gold in the fourth quarter of 2016  It may be an important bearish signal  but it does not have to be one  Hedge funds often change minds   for example  another financial guru  Stanley Druckenmiller exited his entire gold position during the election night  but came back in December and January due to cautious comments from the central banks and uncertainty over Trump  Hence  as we wrote in the previous edition of the GNM  investors should never buy or sell gold blindly just because someone else did it  Instead  they should always do their own research  considering both  and  
Disclaimer  Please note that the aim of the above analysis is to discuss the likely long term impact of the featured phenomenon on the price of gold and this analysis does not indicate  nor does it aim to do so  whether gold is likely to move higher or lower in the short  or medium term  In order to determine the latter  many additional factors need to be considered  i e  sentiment  chart patterns  cycles  indicators  ratios  self similar patterns and more  and we are taking them into account  and discussing the short  and medium term outlook  in our trading alerts ",2017-03-01,Arkadiusz Sieron,https://www.investing.com/analysis/soros-and-paulson-out-of-gold-200177337,200177337
204949,426465,GOLD,Barrick  ABX   Shandong Ink Deal To Tap Mineral Resources,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   and Shandong Gold Group Co   Ltd  have entered into a strategic cooperation agreement  The deal will not only strengthen Barrick s relationship with China but will also help it to tap available mineral resources over the long term Per the terms of the agreement  the listed arm of Shandong  Shandong Gold Mining Co   Ltd   will initially acquire 50  interest of Barrick s Veladero mine for a consideration of  960 million  Following which  Barrick and Shandong will jointly explore the Pascua Lama mineral deposits  Both the companies will evaluate further investment opportunities in the El Indio Gold Belt  located on the border of Chile and Argentina  bearing world class gold mines and projects including Pascua Lama  Veladero and Alturas Both the companies will share knowledge and resources to achieve operational efficiency  safety and environmental stewardship with continued focus on underground mining  Barrick s operating experience in the region will be complemented by Shandong s access to substantial mining  construction and engineering expertise Post the completion of the deal  the Veladero mine will be managed by the Joint Venture Board  comprising of three nominees appointed by each company  Chief Innovation Officer  Michelle Ash  will lead Barrick s team while Shandong s team will be led by Deputy General Manager for Technology  Cui Lun The transaction is expected to close at the end of second quarter of 2017  subject to regulatory and other approvals  It received approval from the shareholders of Shandong Gold Group  SASAC  State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission  and the NDRC  National Development and Reform Commission  However  application for approval is still pending from the shareholders of Shandong Gold Mining Co   Ltd  and other Chinese regulatory authorities including SAFE  State Administration of Foreign Exchange  and MOFCOM  Ministry of Commerce  The strategic cooperation agreement will help Barrick to create long term value for shareholders  government and the community  It will also help the company to pare existing debt and improve free cash flow per share The Veladero mine  located on the San Juan Province of Argentina  contains gold reserves of around 6 7 million ounces  Barrick estimates Veladero to produce 770 000 to 830 000 ounces of gold in 2017  It expects the cost of sales to be about  750 to  800 per ounce and AISC  all in sustaining cost  of  840 to  940 per ounce 
Barrick reported net profit of  425 million or 36 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016  In the year ago quarter  the company incurred a net loss of  2 6 billion or  2 25 per share  Barring one time expenses  the adjusted earnings of the company were 22 cents per share  which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents 
Barrick s shares gained 13 6  in the last three months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry gain of 5 4   Stock gained momentum partly on the back of cost and debt reduction actions taken by the company

204951,426467,GOLD,Templeton Funds And Druckenmiller Get Burned On Barrick,opinion,"As reported on Bloomberg TV   Barrick Gold Corp was back in favor with fund managers last quarter  before the world s biggest bullion producer reported disappointing earnings and rising costs Billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller s Duquense Family Office LLC bought 2 85 million shares in Barrick  in the 1st quarter 
Apparently Templeton and Druckenmiller have not done their home work on mining stocks  Anyone with any knowledge and experience investing in mining stocks knows that companies like Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  and are poorly managed  highly bureaucratic organizations  As such  they are terrible vehicles with which to express a leveraged view on the precious metals market 
Barrick has all kinds of problems that will affect its profitability  including a pile on of class action lawsuits that hit recently  Anyone with experience in this sector already knows this  Rather than investing in the largest mining stocks  the best returns in the sector will be made by investing in the companies that will be acquired by these large caps  A good example is the recent takeover of Exeter Resource Corporation  NYSE XRA  by Goldcorp 

If Stanley Druckenmiller had been a subscriber to the Mining Stock Journal  he would have known to buy XRA in early September  presented in the Sept 1  2016 issue  at  1 16  The stock popped up to  1 80 when XRA and Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  announced the merger  That s a 55  ROR in 7 months  MSJ subscribers were also shown Mariana Resources in the December 22  2016 issue at 82 cents  Mariana agreed to acquired by Sandstorm Gold in a deal valued at  1 41  Because of the heavy stock component  SAND traded lower and Mariana traded up to  1 24  A 51  ROR in four months  The new stock idea presented in mid April is up 19  and has a lot more room to run ",2017-05-16,David I.

204957,426473,GOLD,Kinross  KGC  Declares New Collective Labor Deal At Tasiast,opinion,"Kinross Gold Corporation   NYSE KGC   said that it has reached a three year collective labor agreement  CLA  with unionized employees at its Tasiast mine in Mauritania As stated earlier in its second quarter 2016 earnings release  Kinross and the Government of Mauritania have agreed to a  Mauritanization  plan to increase the number of local workers at Tasiast  a requirement under Mauritanian law  Kinross resolved the expatriate work permit issue with the Government of Mauritania and resumed normal operations at Tasiast in Aug 2016  The new CLA and Mauritanization plan underscore the strong partnership that Kinross has developed with the Government of Mauritania as well as its employees Kinross s shares rose 1 4  to close at  3 63 on Oct 5 KINROSS GOLD Price
    During second quarter 2016  Kinross reported a net loss of  25 million or 2 cents per share  narrower than a net loss of  83 2 million or 7 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The loss was mainly due to a  69 4 million tax expense 
Adjusted loss  excluding one time items  was  9 8 million or a penny per share  compared with adjusted loss of  13 6 million or a penny per share recorded in the year ago quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks were expecting earnings of a penny per share on an average 
Revenues of  876 4 million in the quarter surged around 16  from  755 2 million in the year ago quarter mainly due to increases in gold equivalent ounces sold and the average realized gold price  Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  862 million 
For 2016  Kinross has reaffirmed its previously outlined production guidance  The company anticipates producing about 2 7 2 9 million gold equivalent ounces this year  The overall production cost of sales is expected to be in the range of  675  735 per gold equivalent ounce while all in sustaining cost  AISC  is estimated to be  890  990 per gold equivalent ounce

204958,426474,GOLD,Barrick  ABX  Resumes Normal Operations At Veladero Mine,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   declared that it has resumed normal operations at the Veladero mine in Argentina following approval from San Juan provincial authorities  Barrick had temporarily suspended operations at the Veladero mine from Sep 15  after it noticed that a pipe carrying process solution in the heap leach area was damaged when it was hit by a large block of ice that had rolled down the heap leach valley slope 
A small quantity of solution left the leach pad as a result of this incident  No solution from the damaged pipe reached any water diversion channels or watercourses  Extensive water monitoring in the area has confirmed the incident did not result in any environmental impacts 
The company has completed a number of remedial works required by provincial authorities geared to prevent such an incident from reoccurring  including increasing the height of the perimeter berms that surround the leach pad 
As normal operations resume  the miner will continue to assess the impact of the temporary suspension on Veladero s production for 2016  However  Barrick reiterates its total gold production for 2016 to be in the range of 5 5 5 million ounces at a cost of sales applicable to gold of  5 2  5 5 billion and all in sustaining costs of  750  790 per ounce The company s shares rose 3 4  to close at  15 98 on Oct 5 BARRICK GOLD CP Price
    Production at Veladero decreased 21  year over year to 119 000 ounces in second quarter 2016 at an average all in sustaining cost  AISC  of  744 per ounce  The lower production was primarily due to reduced tons placed on the leach pad and unexpected severe winter weather conditions  Barrick anticipates gold production at the mine to be in the range of 580 000 to 640 000 ounces in 2016

204960,426476,GOLD,Why Trump Will Be Good For Precious Metals And Junior Miners ,opinion,"Gold and silver could once again be ready to rally possibly starting in days or in the beginning of 2017  Investors have been selling precious metals in fear of rising rates and choosing to chase after gains in the stock market or hold a rising US dollar 
This strong US dollar in relation to other collapsing currencies has made it very difficult for miners and explorers over the past few years  The dollar is hitting a 15 year high  making it very hard and expensive for our mining and manufacturing sector  That could change quickly under Trump as he has already committed to taking on other nations who have been devaluing their currencies to gain a competitive edge with trade 

The junior mining sector has been in a bear market due to this rising dollar and QE Taper since 2011 while other nations have been devaluing their currencies  The bear market in precious metals and junior miners appeared to end in the beginning of 2016 but was smacked down as the rise of Trump in the US has even pushed stocks and the US dollar even higher  Meanwhile precious metals and the miners remain dirt cheap  testing major support 
The precious metals are very oversold and ripe for a reversal  I believe Trump will support inflation and infrastructure and should run into even further deficits  I believe the euro is slowly disintegrating  China  India and Russia are crashing their currencies to support their economy through exports  The Middle East Sunni Shiite war is worse than ever  All this uncertainty leads me to want to hold gold and silver  not fiat currencies 
The QE taper and fear of rising rates has caused gold to correct in US dollar terms  Meanwhile though it s soaring in terms of the yen  euro and yuan  However  many are concerned that Central Banks worldwide are secretly suppressing gold and silver prices  manipulating prices lower  Remember it suits the Central Banks to keep the price low as they are some of the largest buyers during this pullback  They don t want the average Joe to pull their cash  burning a hole in their pocket in favor of gold and silver coins 
The victory of Trump for US President caused a huge sell off in precious metals and miners as investors focused on the banks as interest rates soared  There was a huge risk on rally as investors bought stocks and dumped bonds and precious metals  However  that first reaction may be a knee jerk one and cause a blow off move in stocks and the dollar 
Precious metals and mining may even grow greater in favor under President Trump  Trump wants inflation and supports mining and manufacturing which has been almost destroyed over the past eight years by regulations  I like this  The management team includes some of the top mine builders and financiers in the metals business who are well known for building value for shareholders 

They bought a great project from Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  at what could be the bottom of the market  It is an exceptionally high grade resource at over 10 g t where over  40 million was put into exploration drilling by prior operators  Barrick put millions of dollars into this project which includes underground mine development  housing  a tailings pond  paved access roads etc 

This new gold producer is fast tracking production to reach around 50k ounces annually  These profits can then be used to fund discovery of neighboring ore bodies on the huge property  The company just announced from the first exploration holes drilled at a nearby target along with copper and silver  This is when things could really get exciting as they prove to the market the high grade upside potential 

It also could be time to buy some cheap high grade silver miners especially in the Yukon  Between 1921 and 1988  the Keno Hill Silver District in the Yukon was a world class silver producer  with more than 217 million ounces of silver produced at average grades of 44 oz t silver  6 7  lead and 4  zinc  These historical production grades would rank Keno Hill in the top 3  by grade of today s global silver producers 



This  and just made a new high grade discovery within 1 km of a historic 90 million ounce silver mine  I believe silver could continue outperforming gold to the upside and this Canadian silver district which is much higher grade could get a premium as it does not present as much political uncertainty as Mexico or Bolivia 

Keno Hill has been mined for many years so there is existing infrastructure such as power and highway  Another  believe there are more discoveries to be made and has become the second largest land owner in the district  They have four historic producing mines with some of the highest grade historic production in the district  They have a first class exploration team taking historical information and using modern techniques to develop drill targets to hopefully make another new high grade and large silver discovery in the district

204961,426477,GOLD,How Rising Labor Costs Are Impacting World s Largest Gold Miner,opinion,"Something quite interesting has taken place at the world s largest gold miner over the past few years  While certain mining costs  like energy  have declined since the price of oil plummeted from over  100 a barrel in 2013 to an average  43 in 2016  quite the opposite has taken place with the cost of labor 
Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   the world s largest gold miner  is paying a great deal more in labor to produce an ounce of the precious shiny yellow metal than it did just five years ago  How much more  Well  it turns out to be quite a lot 
For example  Barrick Gold only paid  1 5 billion in labor costs to produce 7 8 million ounces  Moz  of gold in 2010  However  this increased significantly in 2015  as Barrick paid  1 86 billion in annual payroll to produce 6 1 Moz of gold  While the labor cost only increased  360 million in 2015 versus 2010  total gold production declined by 1 7 Moz 
I took the annual payroll data from Barrick Gold s Sustainability Reports  shown in the table below 

As we can see in the chart  Barrick s annual payroll has continued to decline since 2012  However  so has its production  So  if we divide Barrick s annual payroll by how many ounces of gold the company produced  we end up with a  Labor Cost per ounce  
Taking the data from Barrick Gold s Sustainability Reports since 2009  we can plainly see how much labor costs have increased per ounce of gold produced 

The DOLLAR image at the bottom of the bars represents the labor cost per ounce  and the GOLD color is the annual price of gold  In 2010  Barrick paid  192 in labor costs per ounce of gold compared to  304 an ounce in 2015  Thus  labor costs per ounce of gold have increased 58  in just five years 
Again  we have to remember  Barrick produced 7 8 Moz of gold in 2010 versus the 6 1 Moz in 2015  So  overall rising labor costs on top of falling economies of scale have put more pressure on Barrick s bottom line 
What is very interesting about the data in the chart above  for each ounce of gold produced in 2010  valued at  1 225   it only took  192 of labor costs  However  this increased significantly to  304 for each gold ounce in 2015  valued at  1 160   Which means  labor costs were only 15 7  of the gold price in 2010 compared to 26 2  in 2015  
Here we can see that more than 25  of the cost to produce gold at Barrick is due to its labor costs alone  It will be interesting to see what this figure will be when Barrick publishes its 2016 Sustainability Report later this year  I would imagine Barrick has continued to lower its overall annual payroll amount  because its gold production declined to 5 5 Moz in 2016 versus 6 1 Moz in 2015  But  the labor cost per ounce will likely increase in 2016 
Regardless  the top gold miners have been hurt considerably due to manipulation of the gold price via the Fed and Central Bank market intervention  I will be publishing a very interesting article next week on how the gold market has been controlled and manipulated since Nixon dropped the Gold Dollar peg in 1971 ",2017-02-20,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-rising-labor-costs-are-impacting-world’s-largest-gold-miner-200176220,200176220

204969,426485,GOLD,Barrick Gold Corp  Tremendous Upside Ahead,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX 
Barrick Gold has been having a great time in the market throughout the year  for the most part  More recently  the stock has been falling  Nonetheless  I see the recent declines in the stock as an opportunity  Today  we ll talk about why I believe that ABX will climb from here 
Understanding What Causes Movement In ABX
Before we get into what I m expecting to see from Barrick Gold  it s important that you understand what traditionally causes movement in the stock  The company has proven itself as a strong company that knows how to capitalize on opportunities  However  as the name would suggest  the company is focused on the production of gold 
As a result  the stock is very exposed to spot market prices  As a result  of this strong relationship with gold  any movement we see in the price of commodity will likely lead to the exact same type of movement in ABX 
Oil News Signals Global Economic Struggles Ahead
One of the most recent factors contributing to my bullish opinions surrounding ABX actually have to do with oil  Recent news shows major concerns in the oil market  First and foremost  on Monday  OPEC released a report showing that it expects for non OPEC production to rise by 180 000 barrels per day in the year 2017 
On top of that  the IEA released data saying that it expects for demand to come in at 800 000 barrels per day in the third quarter  That figure is down 1 5 million barrels per day year over year  With massive declines in demand and increases in supply  things aren t looking good for oil 
While it may seem like this has nothing to do with Barrick Gold  that couldn t be further from the case  At the end of the day  oil is a very important commodity around the world  In fact  most developed countries have a striking dependence on the commodity 
As oil continues back toward crisis mode  economic pressure will likely be added to developed nations  Because gold is a safe haven investment  this will likely lead to increased demand  leading to gains in the value of the precious metal and therefore  ABX 
India Wedding Season
Another major factor that s likely to lead to increased demand is the Indian wedding season  At the end of the day  India is one of the world s largest consumers of gold  In weddings  gold is a key component in the culture  With the Indian wedding season just around the corner  we re likely to see increased demand  leading to further gains in the value of gold 
Economic Conditions Suggest Further Gains
At the end of the day  gold is a safe haven investment  In fact  that s why the precious metal gained in the beginning of the year as the result of global economic concerns  While economic conditions are starting to improve  they are far from perfect  In fact  in some areas  the global economy is declining  Just take a look at what we re seeing with regard to inflation in China  inaction by the European Central Bank  and US jobs growth 
At the end of the day  the global economy isn t out of the woods just yet  Further safe haven demand growth should help gold continue to gain in value  leading to gains in ABX ",2016-09-16,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/barrick-gold-(abx)-stock:-i-see-tremendous-upside-ahead-200153839,200153839
204970,426486,GOLD,Barrick Gold Temporarily Halts Operations At Veladero Mine,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   stated that the Government of San Juan province  Argentina announced a temporary suspension of operations at the Veladero mine pending further inspections of the mine s heap leach area 
Barrick noted that a pipe carrying process solution in the heap leach area was damaged last Thursday when it was hit by a large block of ice that had rolled down the heap leach valley slope  A small quantity of solution left the leach pad as a result of this incident  No solution from the damaged pipe reached any water diversion channels or watercourses 
The affected area in the leach valley has now been remediated  The incident did not harm the health of employees  communities or the environment  Environmental monitoring of surface and sub surface water has been intensified and no irregularity has been detected 
Effective immediately  Barrick will work with provincial authorities to verify the integrity and safety of the heap leach facility  The safety of the employees and the environment remains Barrick s top priority at Veladero  At this time  the company does not expect any material impact to Veladero s  operating guidance for 2016 
Production at Veladero decreased 21  year over year to 119 000 ounces in second quarter 2016 at an average all in sustaining cost  AISC  of  744 per ounce  The lower production was mainly due to reduced tons placed on the leach pad and unexpected severe winter weather conditions  Barrick expects gold production at the mine to be in the range of 580 000 to 640 000 ounces in 2016 
 BARRICK GOLD CP Price   In Jul 2016  Barrick reiterated its overall gold production outlook for 2016  It expects to produce 5 5 5 million ounces of gold at lower AISC of  750  790 per ounce  The company raised its copper production outlook to the range of 380 430 million pounds  The increased production guidance is due to commercial production having started at Jabal Sayid

204981,426497,GOLD,Reversal Ahead For Gold  ETFs In Focus,opinion,"By now  the dazzle in gold this year is known to all  A rush to seek safety for the most part of 1H16 triggered by global growth issues and a major event like Brexit at the end of the second quarter bolstered demand for this safe haven metal  after three muted years 
Gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD    LAGOS GLD   is up over 27  so far this year  as of August 18  2016   However  things have become a little uncertain for the yellow metal lately  read    
On the one hand  strong July job data and New York Fed president William Dudley s gave hints that the  possible  September hike may go against the metal  On the other hand  a few unimpressive U S  economic readings including July retail data  productivity and wholesale prices clear the path of the metal s rise as these mean lower chances of a near term Fed hike 
 expects  growth in the second half of the year that ll be stronger than the first half   so some acceleration in the growth outlook   In fact  he is optimistic about the economy attaining the 2  inflation goal going forward  All these talks may lead to speculation of a sooner than expected Fed rate hike  which has the potential to boost the greenback and weigh on gold as the metal is linked to the U S  dollar  
Is Gold a Sell Even if Fed Doesn t Hike 
Having talked about gold s bull story  the question arises if the yellow metal is overvalued now  At least  billionaire investors George Soros  portfolio gives such cues  In the second quarter  Soros Fund Management offloaded the   in the gold miner and his full stake in mining company Silver Wheaton  according to regulatory filings  
As of June 30  Soros Fund Management had 240 000 shares of GLD  down from 1 05 million shares as of March 31  Soros also reduced his holdings in Barrick Gold   NYSE ABX   to 1 07 million shares from 19 4 million shares  as per   after capitalizing on Barrick s record first half rally 
Barry Rosenstein s Jana Partners also resorted to the same route by cutting its stake in GLD  going by the article published in barrons com  Investors should also note that GLD added about 1 5  in the last one month  as of August 18  2016    not an outstanding performance 
There are analysts who believe that this mad rush in gold will eventually lose pace and that gold will return to by the end of the year  Notably  gold is trading at the  1 350 level currently  read    
Though GLD amassed as much as  12 2 billion in assets in the first half of 2016  the fund shed about  645 9 million in the week ended August 17  2016  indicating a trend reversal  Investors probably started to think that after such a stellar run  gold has become overvalued 
Not Very Impressive Demand Profile  
Though demand for ETFs is driving up gold  the  was one of the worst for Indian gold demand and imports  Jewelry buying plunged 56  year over year in India in Q2  as per GFMS data  read    
China s jewelry industry also witnessed  its worst second quarter performance since 2009  with demand contracting 31   year over year  There was also a significant decline in bar and coin buying in China 
Other Metals on a Tear
Another fact that may steer investors away from gold is the stronger potential in other metals  Other precious metals including silver  palladium and platinum joined the party later on  Plus  unlike gold  other metals like silver  palladium and platinum are likely to perform well if the economy picks up 
This is because silver has increased usage in manufacturing activity while the automobile industry alone is responsible for  of the world s platinum demand  Palladium is also highly used in the auto sector  read    
Gold ETFs in Focus
Investors may thus keep a watch on gold ETFs like GLD  iShares Gold Trust ETF   AX IAU    ETRACS CMCI Gold Total Return ETN   Van Eck Merk Gold Trust ETF   ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF  and PowerShares DB Gold Fund   HN DGL    These funds may come under pressure in the coming days if investors start to dump gold

204983,426499,GOLD,Will The Rally In Barrick Gold Continue ,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  has rallied 185  since the beginning of the year  as Gold prices have climbed above  1300 per ounce due to more dovish monetary policy guidance from the Federal Reserve  and consequently a weakening US Dollar 

The recent rally follows an 88  wipeout in the stock over four years  as gold prices were plummeting and the company also faced several internal problems  Their biggest problem was the fact that they were highly indebted  even more so than other miners  However  through asset sales and dividend cuts  the company has lowered its debt levels from  13 billion to  10 billion in 2015  and is working on further reducing it to  8 billion in 2016 
Nevertheless  the firm still has a significant level of debt on its balance sheet  and the fact that the recent rally has pushed up its Price to Book  P B  ratio from 0 9 to a staggering 3 3 has repelled many investors  Especially given the fact that the average P B ratio for the industry overall is only 1 9 
The indebted gold mining industry in general has had to cut mining and production activity in order to remain solvent  For example  Barrick Gold themselves reduced production from 6 25 million ounces to 6 12 million ounces in 2015  and is forecasted to further reduce production to at least 5 1 million ounces by 2018  Hence the fall in supply will also support gold prices higher 
However  whilst supply cuts would push up gold prices  lower production volume may limit Barrick Gold s ability to fully benefit from this price increase  and may miss the chance to enhance its profit margins even higher to reward long  term shareholders  As a result  it may potentially end up losing shareholder interest to miners that are expanding production during the gold bull market  which could undermine the ABX stock rally going further 
On the other hand  Barrick Gold holds a considerable strength over other miners  which is the high efficiency of its mines  reinforcing its ability to produce free cash flow  In fact  even if gold falls to  1000 per ounce  the company would still be able to produce a positive cash flow  Its Price to Cash Flow ratio is currently 8 4  which is well below the industry average of 13 5  and also lower than the ratio of the S P 500 at 9 6  Hence  from this perspective the gold miner still seems attractively valued 
Technical Indicators
The Put Call ratio for ABX is currently at 0 56  which indicates the fact that investors are more bullish than bearish on the stock  as open interest in call options is higher than in put options  This reflects the positive market sentiment for the stock even after the recent price rally 
However  the Stoch RSI indicator has reached 90 96  A reading between 80 and 100 signals overbought conditions  hence the current level makes the stock seem too expensive for traders to enter now 
Though on the other hand  the recent 10  pullback in the stock has resulted in the Relative Strength Index reaching 47 08  as shown in the chart below  which makes the stock appear less overbought 

Whilst both fundamental and technical indicators show a mixed picture  the ultimate driver of ABX will be the price of gold  Whilst the stock may seem overvalued from certain fundamental perspectives  a surprisingly hawkish Federal Reserve may temporarily pull back the price of gold  which may bring the stock back to more desirable valuations  Traders and investors should stay ready grab any such opportunity to buy  because the long  term trend of gold is upwards 
 When loose global monetary policy eventually augments inflation levels back higher  gold will be the main asset used as a hedging instrument  In fact  gold has declined for four years between 2011 and 2015  so at this point a bullish bet is considered wiser than a bearish bet  Therefore  long positions in gold miners such as Barrick Gold should pay off in the longer run ",2016-08-19,Sankalp Soni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-rally-in-barrick-gold-continue-200148935,200148935

204989,426505,GOLD,5 High Flying Stocks With More Gain In Store  ,opinion,Betting on a stock near its 52 week high  an investor is confronted with one of the oldest and trickiest dilemmas of trading  can it surge higher or is it time to book profits  The camps are also divided on this dilemma  with one side cautioning investors against 52 week high stocks and the other spurring them on to take a quick ride Some of the sliest tricks of successful investing are hidden in plain sight which is often disregarded  Though betting on 52 week high stocks without a clear investment blueprint is outright dangerous  even na ve  clubbing it with the correct parameters can really turn the tide in investors  favor  We are presenting two arguments in favor of 52 week high stocks  which when clubbed with our other parameters  should help investors earn substantial returns Why 52 Week High is a Good IndicatorThe 52 week high investment strategy is largely based on the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  principle  This principle suggests that investors generally use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor  The fear of an impending price crash and a notion about the stock s overvaluation often lead a nervous troop of investors to sell them  Their psychological bias cripples their judgment and they are reluctant to add positions on this stock However  a select few discover the purple patch and churn profits from it  as they recognize that under reaction on the part of investors might have left the stocks undervalued In other words  stock price appreciation is basically fueled by fundamental news pertaining to robust sales  surging profitability  bullish earnings prospects  strategic acquisitions and the like  It might so happen that the stocks have the fundamental strength to climb even higher  but are prevented from reaching that level due to the psychological resistance of investors However  when persistent positive news about such stocks finally gets absorbed by the market  investors adjust their expectations accordingly  Renewed investor interest might easily shatter the 52 week high resistance helping stocks to surge higher  The trick is to get in before investors realize it The Momentum AngleLooking from another angle  we can say that investing in stocks near their 52 week high is akin to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the understanding that once a trend is established it is most likely to continue  Market pundits believe that current price levels reflect a stock s momentum better than past changes  This implies that if a stock is trading close to its 52 week high  chances are that it will perform better in subsequent periods Sifting the Correct ParametersWe will screen for stocks which are close to their 52 week highs  but still have strong prospects relative to their respective industries  In addition  we ve made sure these stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales With positive momentum in the stock price  blended with strong earnings growth expectations and great value metrics  we believe these stocks will continue their uptrend for quite some time to come Current Price 52 Week High     80 This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading only within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week threshold soon    Change Price   4 Weeks   0 It ensures that the price of the stock has moved north over the past four weeks    Change Price   12 Weeks   0 This metric ensures that the stock has continued its upward price momentum over the past three months as well  Price Sales    XIndMed Lower the ratio  the higher is the benefit for investors as they have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company   P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMed This metric measures the amount that an investor will invest in a company to obtain one dollar of that company s earnings  This metric narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers  One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMed This metric will help in zeroing in on stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism  Zacks Rank   1 No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  Current Price    5This

204991,426507,GOLD,Gold Ends Lower Ahead Of Fed,opinion,"Ahead of the Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled later today  the yellow metal eased from its previous gains as the greenback and global stocks remained steady  As the investors remained cautious  gold could remain even lower in the coming sessions 
One of the key factors in the decline of the yellow metal was the strength of the greenback these past few sessions  The appreciating currency makes it costly for the foreign buyers to buy the dollar denominated commodities  Recently  the U S  dollar soared as the market awaited for the Fed meeting and after the string U S  housing sector data 
A member of the treasury team of National Bank of Fujairah said that gold prices fell as the dollar firmed and a recovery in risk appetite supported world stock markets near nine month highs ahead of central bank meetings in  the  US and Japan  Bank of Japan is having a meeting on Friday 
Federal Reserve
Prior to the meeting  a commodities research analyst explained that the gold market had become too complacent with US monetary policy  expecting a further postponement for interest rate hikes  If the U S  economic data turn out to be positive  the central bank might pursue the rate hike  which has been on their table even before Britain decided to leave the European Union 
High interest rate would be one of the factors which can make growth difficult for the yellow metal  Also  the impact of Brexit in the financial markets and in the whole European economy could drive the yellow metal lower as investors choose to do risk aversion  The equity markets was relatively high and the bond yields skid  thus  market players may refer investments with lower risks 
Meanwhile  the Fed will likely keep the interest rate unchanged as the labor market received mixed data from the recent employment report  The central bank noted from its statement last month that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed  There has been an addition of 196 000 jobs from January to March  however  it went down to 147 000 jobs from April to June 
The Federal Open Market Committee confirmed last month that the group closely monitors inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments  While the FOMC thoroughly watch any sign of growth in the economy  Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart claimed that the financial market turbulence they ve seen does not seem to have caused direct harm to the country s economy 
Gold Futures
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantil Exchange  the yellow metal lost 0 18 percent and market experts expect the commodity to fall  1  300 per ounce soon  However  the yellow metal is fairly supported by the stable demand from China  India and Hong Kong 
Moreover  the recent discoveries of gold can strengthen the value of the precious metal  A report came lately that gold mining companies may consider increasing their respective budgets fro gold exploration  The gold team claimed that it would take them around 12 years to discover a hole and to have the first gold pour

204992,426508,GOLD,After Barrick  ABX  Earnings  Which Gold Mining Stocks Are Best Right Now  ,opinion,"Shares of Barrick Gold Corp    NYSE ABX    one of the largest gold mining companies in the world  are down about 2 15  in morning trading Thursday after the company failed to meet revenue expectations in its second quarter earnings report 
After the closing bell Wednesday  Barrick announced earnings of 14 cents per share  which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  however  the company s quarterly revenues of  2 01 billion just missed our estimate of  2 04 billion 
Gold has rode the wave of economic uncertainty throughout 2016  and many gold mining companies have benefitted from increased prices this year  We are right in the thick of a busy second quarter earnings season  and with Barrick disappointing  the spotlight is firmly on the rest of the industry 
There s still a plethora of gold miners still preparing to report  but for those investors looking to make a play in this area after Barrick s announcement  check out these three stocks 
1        New Gold Inc    TO NGD     Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy 
New Gold is one of the miners which has already announced its most recent earnings data  and its report impressed  The company s EPS of 3 cents came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate  which called for break even earnings  With an  A  grade in the Growth category of our Style Scores system  New Gold has proved its ability to post near highs for earnings growth this year 
 
2        Franco Nevada Corp     TO FNV     Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy 
Franco Nevada is getting set to report on August 8  and its estimate revision activity is looking favorable heading into the announcement  In the last 30 days  we have seen four positive revisions for the company s second quarter earnings  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is now a penny higher than it was last month  After an earnings beat of over 30  last quarter  Franco Nevada will hope to continue its solid run 
 
3        Sandstorm Gold    NYSE SAND     Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy 
Sandstorm is also preparing for an earnings announcement  and we expect the company to report on August 4  This quarter  Sandstorm could be in store for earnings growth of over 100  year over year  The company also has a positive Earnings ESP of 100   With a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank  investors should feel more comfortable about an earnings beat  Speaking of earnings beats  Sandstorm also posted a surprise beat last quarter and smashed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 500  
 
Bottom Line
While Barrick s report may have disappointed some investors  it s important to consider that ABX isn t the only option in the mining industry  In fact  gold mining is an extremely hot industry  falling into the top 3  of the Zacks Industry Rank  These Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks stick out  but there are over 20 companies with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  or higher in the industry right now ",2016-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/after-barrick-(abx)-earnings,-which-gold-mining-stocks-are-best-right-now-200144825",200144825

204998,426514,GOLD,Hot Gold Stock  ABX  VGZ  EGO,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX    Vista Gold Corporation  NYSE VGZ    Eldorado Gold Corporation  NYSE EGO 
The market has been a rough place to be this year  It seems like every time we turn around  we re giving up any chance of gains we were going to see this year  Nonetheless  any time there s a rough time in the market  we can expect that at least some stocks will be seeing gain  This time around  those stocks are gold stocks  Companies like Barrick Gold  Vista Gold  and Eldorado Gold  the declines in the market overall are actually a good thing  In fact  ABX  VGZ  and EGO have all been experiencing strong gains  Today  we ll talk about why these stocks are climbing  and why these gains are likely to continue for some time 
Why ABX  VGZ  And EGO Are Climbing In Value
As mentioned above  while the market remains incredibly concerning  Barrick Gold  Vista Gold  and Eldorado Gold are doing incredibly well  So  why are these stocks climbing in value while others continue to struggle  The answer is simple 
As the names of all of these companies would suggest  their flagship product is gold  Every one of these companies is focused on mining for  preparing  and selling the precious metal  As a result  when gains in gold are realized  ABX  VGZ  and EGO all see stronger profits from their flagship products  Adversely  when gold prices are down  these companies watch their profits shrink 
Gold Is Gaining Big
Throughout the year 2016  gold s price has been skyrocketing  and for good reason  At the end of the day  gold is a safe haven investment  The commodity was one of the first ever currencies  Not to mention  throughout history  gold has been proven to be the strongest currency ever made  This fact is likely to help ABX  VGZ  and EGO in a big way moving forward 
At the moment  economic conditions are incredibly concerning  Around the world  banks are devaluing their currencies  Not to mention the mess that s going on in the UK and Europe as a result of the Brexit  The truth is that when conditions like these are happening  investors and consumers use gold as a way to protect their assets  This leads to incredible gains in demand  and ultimately gains in the price of the precious metal 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from Barrick Gold  Vista Gold  and Eldorado Gold alike  The reality is that given current economic and market conditions  gold is likely to continue climbing in value  As this trend continues  all three of these companies become more profitable  Let s face it  what do investors like more than profits    nothing 
With all of that said  it would be foolish to expect to see declines in ABX  VGZ  or EGO  The issues the world s economy faces are not short term issues  In fact  I wouldn t be surprised to see these issues continue for a year or more  As a result  these stocks will only keep climbing

205009,426525,GOLD,What Billionaires Are Doing With Gold While You re Not Watching,opinion,"With each passing day  systemic risks in the financial system become greater  Smart money insiders and billionaire investors are taking note   and taking defensive actions 
Mega billionaire Carl Icahn  whose long term track record is unrivaled  recently  that  there will be a day of reckoning unless we get fiscal stimulus   Icahn s hedge fund is betting on a day of reckoning scenario  He has gone 150  net short the stock market while holding commodity related positions to the long side 
International currency speculator and leftist financier  has slashed his fund s overall equity holdings by 25   Like him or not  Soros is no dummy when it comes to the financial system  He is an establishment insider who apparently sees turbulent times ahead  He owns a not insignificant amount of gold  and his largest single equity holding now is Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   a major gold mining company 
 The system itself is at risk   warns bond market wizard Bill Gross  In his latest market   Gross cites  artificially high asset prices and a distortion of future risk relative to potential return  
Prices for financial assets such as stocks  bonds  and real estate investment trusts are artificially high because interest rates are artificially low  Thanks  of course  to the Federal Reserve  Markets are floating on a sea of leverage made possible by eight years of ultra accommodative monetary policy and the widespread belief that the Fed will step in as a buyer of last resort to support asset prices 
Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan helped fuel a stock market bubble in the late 1990s and handed off a burgeoning housing bubble to his successor Ben Bernanke  Ironically  Greenspan has since sought to position himself as something of an elder statesman for fiscal responsibility  To his credit  he now recognizes that the biggest  most dangerous bubble today is that of runaway government debt ahead of a looming Baby Boomer retirement entitlement crisis  and he has turned quite bullish on gold 
 We should be running federal surpluses right now not deficits  This is something we could have anticipated twenty five years ago and in fact we did  but nobody s done anything about it  This is the crisis which has come upon us   Greenspan said in a recent    We re running to a state of disaster unless we turn this around  
With some  200 trillion in projected unfunded liabilities  the federal government will have to default on some of its promises directly or by inflating away the value of those promises  That s the big picture  The next cyclical downturn and potential crash could be triggered by a more immediate event in the economy or in the over leveraged financial markets 
Triggering Event  Economic Recession
The front page of the May 30th Barron s features the headline   The Stock Market Won t Crash   Yet   Author Gene Epstein argues that stocks won t crash in the near future  because  the odds of a recession are now quite low   Not just  low   mind you  but  quite low  
If the real world economic data could respond  it would beg to differ  Manufacturing activity recently suffered its biggest drop since 2009  The New York Purchasing Managers Index swooned in May to suffer its biggest monthly drop in nine years 
And the Labor Department s most recent jobs report  released on June 3rd  revealed that employers hired the fewest new workers in nearly six years  Corporate profit margins peaked several months ago and are turning down 
These are exactly the types of conditions that presage a recession  That  in turn  could trigger massive new fiscal and monetary stimulus measures that weaken the dollar and drive safety minded investors into precious metals 
But the same Wall Street establishment publication that tells investors recession risk is  quite low  also ran a gold bearish headline in its January 4  2016 issue   Gold Likely to Stay Tarnished   Barron s proclaimed 
To that  I respond  Get real  Gold never tarnishes  and its price has advanced nearly 20  since Barron s scared investors out of precious metals with facile predictions of Fed rate hikes 
Triggering Event  Rising Interest Rates
Interest rates will at some point have to go up  Escalating credit concerns and inflation fears could cause markets to drive up bond yields  regardless of whether the Fed hikes its benchmark rate 
Even just a 1 percentage point rise in bond yields from their current low levels would cause  1 trillion in capital losses  according to a Goldman Sachs analysis  Rising interest rates are disastrous for bondholders and hazardous to all financial assets 
To the extent that they are associated with rising inflation expectations  however  rising interest are bullish for hard assets  This has been proven during past rising rates cycles  the last major one being during the late 1970s 
Triggering Event  Derivatives Blow up
By one estimate  the derivatives market has exploded to a mind boggling  1 5 quadrillion  more than double the dizzying heights of 2007 
Of course  these aren t actual assets  Total world GDP is a mere  78 trillion   1 5 quadrillion in wealth does not exist  Derivatives represent layers of speculative bets and hedges on actual assets 
The size of the derivatives market shows just how ridiculously leveraged the system has become  The gold market is a case in point  Physical gold now represents just a tiny fraction of the  gold  that gets traded in futures markets  Earlier this year  leverage exploded to more than 500 to 1

205011,426527,GOLD,4 Gold Mining Stocks That Surged More Than 50  This Year,opinion,"Gold has regained its luster this year after a tumultuous 2015  manifested by a roughly 25  surge in its value in the first half  The yellow metal s bull run is a function of a combination of factors  notably the U S  Federal Reserve s move to keep interest rates steady in its June meeting and strong tailwind from Britain s historic decision to leave the European Union  EU  The upward momentum for gold is expected to continue moving forward as the conditions for the metal s recent gains remain very much at play Why Gold Is on Fire Gold prices catapulted to cross the  1 300 per troy ounce threshold last month  reaching as high as  1 358 an ounce  after Britain voted to exit the EU  sending global stock markets into a tailspin  The market rattling move sparked as much as around 8  surge in the yellow metal s price to trade at levels last seen in Jul 2014 Outcome from the EU referendum  which saw the  Leave  side winning 52  of the vote  fueled safe haven buying as investors fret that  Brexit  would bring political and financial instability to Europe and could have serious consequences for the global economy  The Brexit induced chaos in the global markets spurred investors  demand for safe havens  triggering a strong rally in gold prices Gold prices also traded near two year high yesterday as spooked investors continued to seek the metal amid a turbulent global political environment and growing expectations that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus in the wake of Brexit The U S  Federal Reserve s dovish stance is another major factor behind the shiny metal s upsurge this year  The Fed left benchmark interest rates steady  in the band of 0 25  0 50   last month citing a sharp drop in U S  hiring in May that raised doubts about the strength of the labor market as well as the health of the U S  economy The central bank gave no clues on timing of the next hike and stated that it needs a clearer economic picture before increasing rates again  A delay in raising interest rates elevates demand for gold  which produces no income but relies on price appreciation to lure investors Other factors that also contributed to gold s upturn this year include volatility in equities  a weaker greenback  slowdown in China and introduction of negative interest rates by several of the world s central banks The Momentum Likely to ContinueThe intense market uncertainty brought forth by Brexit is expected to continue to drive investors  appetite for safe haven assets  particularly gold  in the coming days  Some analysts feel that gold s northern march will continue and prices could even touch the  1 500 an ounce level later this year given the profound impact of Brexit on the global financial markets  macroeconomic uncertainties and concerns about global economic growth  Typically  gold gains from negative vibes in the economy and is considered a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical tensions 
The current global economic uncertainties stirred up by Brexit is also likely to prompt the Fed to hold off on raising interest rates for now  A low interest rate environment augurs well for gold Gold prices should also find support from retail demand in the latter part of 2016  which is seasonally strong for top consumers like India and China  A good monsoon season in India will also bring the prospects for a bigger harvest  which in turn is expected to boost purchasing power of gold among farmers and support gold demand  The farming community accounts for bulk of gold purchases in India 4 High Flying Gold StocksThe spurt in gold prices has also led to a surge in the share prices of many gold miners this year  We ve listed four gold mining stocks which have gained more than 50  year to date  These stocks have also witnessed upward estimate revisions over the past few weeks Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX  Based in Toronto  Canada  Barrick Gold is the largest gold mining company in the world  The company has many advanced exploration and development projects located across five continents Barrick has seen its shares shoot up roughly 201  year to date  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved north over the past 60 days for 2016  The stock has expected earnings growth of around 64  for the current year Yamana Gold  Inc    NYSE AUY      Headquartered in Toronto  Canada  Yamana Gold engages in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing  and reclamation  The company has precious metal properties and land positions in the Americas This company has delivered a solid year to date return of 195   Earnings estimate for 2016 has witnessed positive revisions over the last 60 days  The stock has expected earnings growth of around 224  for the current year IAMGOLD Corp    TO IAG               Toronto based IAMGOLD is engaged in the exploration  development and operation of gold mining properties  It also explores for copper and silver  The company holds interests in four operating gold mines  as well as exploration and development projects located in Africa  South America and Canada This stock has gained roughly 215  year to date  Earnings estimate for the current year have witnessed positive revisions over the last 60 days  The company has expected earnings growth of around 66  for 2016 B2Gold Corp    NYSE BTG               Vancouver  Canada based B2Gold explores and develops mineral properties in Nicaragua  the Philippines  Namibia  Burkina Faso and Chile  The company primarily explores for gold  silver and copper B2Gold has seen its shares surge around 175  so far this year  Its earnings estimate for 2016 has witnessed upward revisions over the past 60 days  The stock has expected earnings growth of a whopping 800  for the current year Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-07-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-gold-mining-stocks-that-surged-more-than-50-this-year-200140076,200140076
205012,426528,GOLD,Barrick Gold  This Stock Is Explosive,opinion,"The investing landscape has been a very interesting one this year  Unfortunately  we ve seen incredible volatility  which has made picking profitable stocks a bit more complex  Nonetheless  even in highly volatile markets  we find incredible opportunities  One of those opportunities is Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   Lately  the stock has been skyrocketing  and if history is any indication  the gains are going to continue  Today  we ll talk about why ABX is climbing and why the gains are likely to continue for quite some time 
Why ABX Is Climbing In Value
The reason Barrick Gold is climbing in value is relatively simple  You see  the company is the world s largest gold mining company  As a result  the company is really in the right market at the right time  At the end of the day  when gold gains in value  profits at ABX get larger  and gold is going to grow 
Gold  like any other commodity  is largely dependent on the law of supply and demand  Low supplies and high demand ultimately lead to gains in value  Also  gold is a safe haven investment  which makes gauging price movements a bit more complex 
As a safe haven investment  the demand for gold tends to climb when economic or market conditions are called into question  The truth is that  for the first half of the year  there have been more questions about the global economy and global market than there have been answers  So  we re seeing big gains in the demand for gold  and  therefore  the value of gold  The fact that the price of gold has climbed by 25  through the first half of the year has supported an incredible bull run on ABX  In fact  gains are continuing today  Currently  the stock is trading at  23 14 per share after a gain of  0 74 per share  or 3 30   as of yesterday 
We ve Only Seen The Tip Of The Iceberg
If you think Barrick Gold is likely to start seeing declines  you might want to think again  The truth is that the stock is gearing up for more gains  and big gains at that 
As mentioned above  gold is a safe haven investment  and when gold climbs  so  too  does ABX  At the moment  there are major uncertainties revolving around the global economy  Recently  the British people voted to leave the EU in a move that is being called Brexit  This action has tremendous economic implications for the world 
With the UK now leaving the EU  we are likely to see economic hardships in both regions as they move through the transition  Because these are two of the top five economies in the world  the effects of the Brexit are likely to radiate globally  The UK will need to renegotiate trade agreements with the world while the EU s economic instability will only get worse 
While this happens  we re likely to see more volatility in the global market  As conditions grow more and more concerning  the world s largest indices will continue to see increasing numbers of trading sessions in the red  All of this will happen while investors turn to gold as a way to protect their financial assets  At the end of the day  this will lead to continued growth in demand for and the price of gold  as well as continued growth in the value of ABX ",2016-07-07,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/barrick-gold-(abx)-stock:-this-one-is-explosive!-200140374,200140374
205015,426531,GOLD,The Metals Complex Is On The Edge Again,opinion,"For weeks  the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  has been on the edge of a break out  while showing signs of the corrective pullback we would rather see first 
But  as I have said many  many times  when the metals finally turn bullish  retracements often are VERY shallow  as they do not let the masses into the market  Rather  the pullbacks are often so shallow that most market participants have to chase the market  And  it makes it very hard for the average investor to get into the market  if they did not buy at the absolute lows 
If you remember back in the last quarter of 2015  I wrote repeatedly about how I was moving into a FOMO  Fear Of Missing Out  perspective  since I understood very well how the metals move  For this reason  I continually reiterated that I was following the long term plan I laid out years ago  and bought metals and miners heavily at the end of 2015 into early 2016  as we were striking our long term  BUY BUY BUY  box targets 
In fact  we rolled out our EWT Miners Portfolio in September of 2015 in our expectation of imminently striking the long term bottom in the complex  Our initial buys were on 9 16  which included Seabridge Gold Inc   NYSE SA  at 5 81  now at 13 50  and Richmont Mines Inc   NYSE RIC  at 2 59  now at 8 50   and then added more on 10 23  including Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  at 7 64  now at 18 40   While we have seen tremendous gains in many mining stocks we have owned  we plan to rotate our holdings within the safest miners we track to those with the most potential  as we move out of those that strike the targets we set 
And  as many of you know our methodology  we have appropriate suggested stops on all positions to lock in a significant majority of the profit we have earned to date  Moreover  due to our conservative perspective  until the long term bottom is confirmed with a rally through 28 in the GDX  we have not allocated any funds to the junior miners in a meaningful way yet  But  once we do see a confirmed bottom signal  then we will begin rotating to a number of the junior miners we have been tracking  which will likely super charge our returns even more  but doing so only once the risk of lower lows has significantly passed  since a bottom will have then been confirmed with an 80  probability 
On the micro level  I still believe that we can see a further decline  but I have a very tight leash upon that expectation  The micro set up suggests that Monday  should  see a gap down in the GDX in a c wave towards at least the 22 region in the GDX  However  if  instead  we see a break out over 25  with strong follow through over 25 40  then we may be seeing the initial confirmation that wave 2 of wave iii  as noted in yellow  has completed in extremely shallow fashion  and we may be on our way over 30 sooner than expected 
The downside micro pattern suggests that the past week developed a b wave flat  with a c wave down to be seen early in the upcoming week  But  again  that means the market must maintain below resistance  However  if the market decides to continue higher  and breaks out over 25 40  then we will be riding our current holdings until we see a strong break out through 28  which will then suggest that we are in the heart of wave 3 of iii  with a minimum target of 33 60  but  will more likely take us up towards the 35 region  likely before June has ended should the immediate break out scenario take hold  I do want to note that a number of the mining stocks we track indicate that they are already in wave 3 of iii  so we have to maintain a healthy respect for the potential for the market to continue higher  But  until a break out over resistance is seen  my preference is for a pullback to take hold in the coming week 
There is one more modification I have made to the daily chart of the GDX  Our EWT Miners Portfolio management team meets every two weeks  and also on an ad hoc basis when needed  depending upon the price action seen in the market  We met this past week  and many of the miners we reviewed suggested that any drop we see in the coming week may be all we get before the complex continues to much higher levels  So  for now  I am modifying my primary count to the next drop being wave 2 of iii  and will add an alternative of the bigger wave ii again should the rally from that low only take shape correctively  This means that we are suggesting investors buy at the bottom of the next 5 wave drop in the GDX  and our target will be between the 20 22 region  depending upon how strongly the decline takes shape 
As for silver  amazingly  we have held our support at 16 90 this past week  and as long as we do not see a sustained breakdown below that level  the current rally may continue as well  with the next upside target being 18 50  However  the more ideal scenario would be a pullback towards the 16 16 20 region  also representing wave 2 of wave iii  similar to the set up in the GDX 
As far as SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   I truly do not have a highly reliable micro count with which to point  But  as long as it remains below 122 40  we have a micro pattern that suggests downside continuation  So  that is the level I will be watching early in the coming week for our next indications and will update you should that pattern invalidate for downside follow through  Ultimately  I would still need to see a strong move through 124 50  the 1 618 extension off the recent low around 120  as well as the prior high  to view this as a strong break out potential 
Finally  I would like to address two issues that are constantly brought up to my attention  First  as you know  I have been expecting a rally in the US dollar  And  many have suggested that this expected rally should certainly cause the metals to drop  However  for those that have followed me for some time know  such thinking does not sway me  In fact  it was back at the end of 2015 when I was expecting a rally in the dollar along with gold  many took the same perspective that it simply would not happen  Well  the dollar and gold both rallied over 10  together  So  simply because I see the potential for a dollar rally does not suggest that the metals and miners cannot break out  In fact  they have been quite strong during the recent rally in the USD  So  I will simply continue to follow the price patterns  rather than make assumptions 
Second  I would like to address the Commitment of Traders report  Many have suggested that simply because one segment of the market is shorting the market it means that the market MUST decline  As for me  simply because a segment of the market is shorting the market does not mean that segment cannot be wrong  We have seen many times in the past where this segment of the market has been caught on the wrong side of the market  So  consider what the short covering will do if this segment gets caught on the wrong side of the market this time  Remember  this perspective is truly a double edged sword  and can have just as significant an impact on the long side of the market if they do get caught on the wrong side of price  Therefore  I suggest you follow the price action more so than your fears or general assumptions ",2016-05-18,Avi Gilburt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-metals-complex-is-on-the-edge-again-200130557,200130557
205016,426532,GOLD,Gold  How High Will We Fly ,opinion,"Our risk free short was stopped out for minimal gains  and unfortunately price did not behave as we expected in our April 18th article to test the breakout so we can join the bulls at a cheaper price  Since then price had been pushing to the upside  testing the key  1 300 level as speculation was ripe that Feds was not going to be able to raise rate anytime soon  given the global economic slowdown 

The CME FedWatch indicates only a 15  chance of a rate hike this June  30  in July  38  in September  39  in November and 42  in December  All of which expecting a 25 basis points increase  Recent Feds comments about market underestimating the strength of the US economy  has waved some dollar bulls back in and push the price of the precious metal to close lower for the past two weeks  This also has caused some profits taking as we see speculators reduced their net long by 4  for the first time since March 15th 
A further look at the US Dollar Index futures for June delivery  showed that speculators further reduced their net long by more than 14   from 13 849 to 12 117 contracts  since our last article

205018,426534,GOLD,What Does Backwardation Mean For The Gold Market Now ,opinion,"We have already said that negative GOFO  gold forward offer rate  means backwardation in gold  What causes the backwardation and what does it imply for the gold market  Before we answer these questions  let s get a better grasp of the subject 
Backwardation in gold is a situation in which futures prices are lower than the spot price of the same good  or futures prices are lower in succeeding delivery months   It is the opposite of contango in gold  which is a normal situation for non perishable commodities which have a cost of carry  This is because people are eager to pay more for a commodity at some point in the future than the actual expected price of the commodity to avoid paying the costs of storage and carry costs of buying the commodity today  This contrasts with backwardation which means that people are willing to pay more for immediate delivery than in the future 
This is the case with perishable commodities  for example  it is definitely worth paying more for immediate delivery of fresh eggs rather than waiting 3 months for them  Backwardation is also logical for commodities produced seasonally  like agricultural products  For example  it makes perfect sense that a bushel of wheat is more expensive in the middle of winter as opposed to late summer  after the harvest when product is abundant  In other words  backwardation suggests supply shortages in the spot market 
However  such a situation should not occur in the gold market  given the large above ground stock of the shiny metal ready to meet demand  The available inventory of gold is so large that the idea of supply shortages in the gold market seems ridiculous  What does explain the backwardation in gold  then 
Some analysts say the gold outflows into China  so there is a shortage in the Comex or London gold market  Others argue that gold backwardation means the lack of trust in future delivery  i e  investors do not believe that gold futures will be honored by delivery of gold   which signals a financial crisis 
What is the truth  First  let s analyze the history of gold backwardation 
Chart 1  The 1 month GOFO  red line  in    and 12 months GOFO  orange line  in    from July 1989 to 2009 

As one can see in the chart above  between July 1989 and 2009 the gold backwardation  reflected by negative GOFO  was very rare  Additionally  within that period it was very small  and with exception of 1999 limited to 1 month GOFO  and short lived 
It first occurred on November 29th  1995  lasted a day  and was probably caused by a hedge buy back by Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   The next  2 day backwardation in the gold market took place in September 29 30  1999  It probably resulted from the Washington Agreement on Gold  Its announcement led to a price surge and a mad rush for physical gold to cover short positions 
For the third time it bracketed a weekend in March 9 12  2001  when the end of the previous month s bear market caused a short term gold bullion shortage  The last GOFO happened in November 2008  and continued for three days   probably due to the flight to gold during the global financial crisis 
Chart 2  The 1 month GOFO  red line  in    and 12 months GOFO  orange line  in    from 2008 to January 2015 

After the 2008 financial crisis the cases of backwardation in gold reiterated  Starting in 2009  the GOFO rates were lowering and often flirted with negative values  Since 2013  backwardation has become a new norm in the gold market  Until 2009  gold was in backwardation for just a total of eight days  while in 2013 and 2014 it persisted for weeks and months  What has changed 
The answer lies in the Fed s zero interest rate policies  ZIRP   As one can see in the chart below  the GOFO generally tracks the LIBOR  which makes sense since the GOFO is the swap rate for a gold to U S  dollar exchange  while the LIBOR is the dollar s interest rate  Therefore  when the Fed s ZIRP pushed down LIBOR near zero in late 2008  the GOFO followed 
Chart 3  The 1 month GOFO  red line  in    and the 1 month LIBOR  blue line  in    from July 1989 to January 2015 

The bottom line is that during the backwardation in gold  the gold futures prices are lower than the spot price  Normally  when interest rates were significantly higher than zero  backwardation in the gold market was an unusual situation reflecting the short lived imbalance between supply and demand 
However  with LIBOR near zero  the negative GOFO are not strange or meaningful  Therefore  the backwardation in the gold market does not reflect the imminent default of the Western paper gold market and the supply shortage due to bullion outflows to Asia  but it is all about an all time low LIBOR  Thus  in the zero interest rate environment  gold investors should not consider a backwardation in gold as a bullish indicator of supply shortage  at least not without looking at the LIBOR ",2016-06-01,Arkadiusz Sieron,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-does-backwardation-mean-for-the-gold-market-200133204,200133204
205019,426535,GOLD,How to Invest Alongside Bearish Billionaires,opinion,"There is a conscious effort among stock market bulls to ignore growling stock market bears such as well known bond fund managers Bill Gross and Jeffrey Gundlach   the latter of whom called the U S  stock market  dead money  
But now the rumbling from other bears has grown even louder and cannot be ignored  It is coming from investors who have literally made billions by being the  smartest guys in the room  
This list of bearish billionaires is growing  and now includes the likes of   Sam Zell  and Carl Icahn 
But one man stands out as the most fascinating of these hungry money makers 
George Soros 
The Bear Is Back
For readers unfamiliar with Soros   he has made roughly  25 billion by consistently reading the market right 
Most famously  in 1992  he  broke  the Bank of England  He bet  10 billion worth  through a short sale  that the British pound would have to leave the European Exchange Rate Mechanism  ERM   So when England did leave the ERM  Soros quickly pocketed a cool  1 45 billion 
Here is where it gets even more interesting 
In recent years  Soros has been semi retired and the trading at his firm has been run by his colleagues  But suddenly  the 85 year old Soros spotted something  and earlier this year he became much more engaged and is now quite actively again managing the investments at his firm 
To say Soros is bearish is an understatement  His concerns and interests over his decades long career have spanned many markets   including central bank policies  China  Europe  the Brexit  and the overvaluation of U S  stocks 
The last time Soros the Bear emerged and took his place at the head of his firm s trading was in 2007  just before the 2008 financial crisis  Soros pocketed more than  1 billion in gains between 2008 and 2009 
Clearly  his next move will be one to watch 
Should You Be Worried 
The very fact that Soros is once again so engaged should grab the attention of every investor   big or small  But it s just as important to know the players in the game as it is to see where he moves his pieces 
Because Soros is a macro trader  my article  is a must read for anyone with a buck in the game  This comprehensive list discusses seven macro areas that have and continue to play crucial roles in the 2016 market 
My own personal warning alarm went off this past week as the CNBC talking heads could not stop yammering on about the TINA trade 
TINA stands for  There Is No Alternative  to U S  stocks   due to negative interest rates  My years of market experience tell me that we only see such hubris before a fall 
The TINA reference seems to be very similar to the promise   This time it s different  
This seemingly harmless phrase is often heard near market peaks  and legendary investor  referred to these as the  four most expensive words in the English language  
Unlike other stock markets  on a global scale  U S  stocks are currently richly valued on a historical price to earnings basis  This is in addition to the fact that we ve had an earnings decline for five consecutive quarters  which is cause for concern 
Yet  the current consensus of the Wall Street macro trade is long S P 500 and short 10 Year Treasuries 
But  don t forget my oft repeated warning   a crowded trade usually turns into a bad trade 
Betting on the Billionaires
Without the prowess and financial stronghold of a billionaire  it s often hard to know how to follow what Soros and others are doing with their investments  But it s not impossible 
First  many bearish billionaires   including Soros   are going big on gold and gold stocks  My favorite play on gold is the VanEck Merk Gold Trust  NYSE OUNZ   This fund offers its holders the option of converting their holdings into gold bullion or gold coins 
Soros himself owns Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   and for broader exposure to the sector  there is also the opportunity to invest in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  
There are also a number of inverse exchange traded funds  ETFs  that allow investors to place a trade in the expectation that the stock market will go down  Included in these are leveraged ETFs 
Instead  here s a list of some of the most liquid  and easily tradable  straight up inverse ETFs  ProShares Short S P500  NYSE SH   ProShares Short Russell2000  NYSE RWM   and ProShares Short QQQ  NYSE PSQ   The latter is a short on the Nasdaq 100 Index 
Overall  I urge investors to steer clear of dangerous derivatives loaded funds 
For investors who don t agree with the foretelling that the market is headed lower  but that volatility will increase  instead  ProShares VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE VIXY  is a solid ETF option 
Keep in mind that these types of ETFs are NOT long term investments  but are short term trading vehicles that can be used to protect an investor s overall portfolio  The VIX ETFs in particular are extremely volatile and must be carefully watched 
Before going bearish  it is crucial to do due diligence  There is only one George Soros  but that doesn t mean we can t take a hint when he gets to growling

205036,426552,GOLD,The Last 2 Times This Happened  Gold Miners Got Crushed,opinion,"The gold miners  Market Vectors Gold Miners  N GDX   rallied for a 6th consecutive trading session yesterday  making for a 14 5  gain since last Tuesday s all time low at  12 40 
GDX  Daily 

Over the last few years  a six session winning streak in GDX has happened only twice  August 2014 and May 2015  and both times turned out to be major tops with price quickly tumbling lower over the next few months 
GDX  2014 2016 

There s a few key differences between the current six session winning streak and the last two 
The current win streak is coming off an all time low while the last two came at the end of multi week rallies
Upside volume is much stronger in the current rally
There are several individual gold mining stocks that have broken out from bullish bottoming patterns  Barrick Gold  N ABX  for example 

H S bottoming pattern with breakout from extended cup   handle   strong volume on the breakout with measured move target of  11 and open gap up at  11 41 
GDX certainly doesn t have a good track record following 6 session winning streaks  however  there is ample evidence to suggest that conditions are much different now than they were the last couple of times ",2016-01-28,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-last-couple-of-times-this-happened-the-gold-miners-got-crushed-381986,381986
205037,426553,GOLD,Gold Is Up 16 5  YTD  So Where Are The Stock Investors ,opinion,"The last time gold had a quarter this strong  Ronald Reagan was a year into his second term as president  the Soviet Union was taking its final gasp and the U S  was still reeling from the Challenger explosion  In the first quarter  the yellow metal rose 16 5 percent  its best three month performance since 1986  mostly on fears of negative interest rates and other global central bank policies 
Bloomberg writes that the current gold rally has  Before now  a gold bear market persisted not because the metal had lost its status necessarily  but because of the strong U S  dollar and  more significantly  positive real interest rates  According to Pierre Lassonde  cofounder of Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   gold is the fourth most liquid asset in the world 
As I ve mentioned many times before  gold has historically performed best when real rates turned negative  We were one of the earliest to discuss this important relationship on a regular basis  and now I m starting to see it covered frequently in the mainstream media 
To get the real rate  you subtract the current consumer price index  CPI  reading  or inflation  from the government bond yield  When yields are low or negative  as they are now it encourages smart investors to seek other stores of value  including gold 
Below  you can see that when gold prices peaked at  1 900 per ounce in August 2011  real interest rates were close to negative 4 percent  A 5 Year Treasury bond yielded only 0 9 percent and that s before inflation took 3 8 percent   Decades ago  when I was a young analyst in Canada  we would compare everything to the 5 year government bond yield   But as real rates rose  gold prices fell  Now the reverse is happening 

Double the Gold Returns Under Negative Real Rates 
Most investors look only at nominal interest rates  This is only the tip of the iceberg  The British author and playwright Oscar Wilde wrote   Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing   Along those lines  smart investors know that money flows to the highest real interest rate  I call this the Fear Trade 
 When real rates are negative  gold returns tend to be twice as high as the long term average   the  writes its latest report   Even if real rates are positive and as long as they are not significantly high  4 percent in our study   average gold returns remain positive  
Negative rates erode confidence in fiat currencies  which typically has benefited gold  A currency itself  gold is  the only one that is not targeted directly by  and doesn t respond negatively to  expansionary monetary policies   the WGC writes 
The chart below shows the difference in the nominal and real yield curves for government bonds in a number of advanced economies  When you factor in inflation  investors of shorter term government debt are actually paying the government to hold their money  a proposition that s hard to swallow 
The WGC points out that about 30 percent of global sovereign debt is now trading with subzero yields  That s  8 trillion  A further 40 percent has yields below 1 percent 
This is just the latest reason why investors have been losing faith in central banks  In its most recent quarterly report  the  notes that investors   confidence in central banks  healing powers has probably for the first time been faltering   as it becomes more and more clear that room for additional policymaking is narrowing  If asset buying programs  helicopter drops of money and negative interest rate policies fail to reverse the economic slowdown  what more is there 
These conditions have led to a surge in gold coin and bullion sales around the world  American Eagle consumers bought 83 500 ounces of the coin in February  a 351 percent increase from the 18 500 ounces sold in the previous February  The Perth Mint in Australia is also reporting huge sales volumes 
Retail Investors Missing out on the Gold Rush
Interest in gold bullion  however  hasn t seemed to translate fully into renewed interest in gold miners  So far this year  inflows into the SPDR Gold Trust Fund  NYSE GLD   which invests in physical bullion  have accelerated as investors chase the rally  
At the other end is the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDXJ   which holds junior gold equities such as Northern Star  OceanaGold and Evolution Mining  Despite an increase in share price  we ve seen a net decrease in shares outstanding 
Year to date  outflows have totaled  84 million  Flows out of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX   which holds senior gold stocks  have been even more dramatic  at  94 million 
This could be explained by investors taking profits off the table  unease with the volatile swings in the gold market lately or mistrust in mining stocks  In any case  many investors could be missing out on one of the most impressive gold rallies in a generation  Since the start of the year  Goldcorp  NYSE GG  has gained 38 percent  Randgold  NASDAQ GOLD  45 percent  Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  84 percent  Harmony Gold  NYSE HMY  300 percent 
Good News  Global Manufacturing Turns Up
Another concern investors have right now is over the health of the global economy  Since February 2014  we ve seen the J P Morgan Global Manfacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  trend steadily downward 
For March  however  the PMI came in at 50 3  a slight improvement from the neutral February reading of 50  The monthly reading also rose above the three month moving average  a bullish signal 
We use PMI data as a gauge for commodity price movements three and six months out  and I write about PMI often  The U S  Manufacturing ISM the American version of PMI showed improvement  rising from 49 5 in February to 51 8 in March  the first time it expanded in seven months  New Orders strengthened in particular  gaining 6 8 percentage points to register 58 3 last month  Meanwhile  the Markit Eurozone Manufacturing PMI edged up slightly to 51 6  from 51 2 in February 
China  on the other hand  continues to exhibit deterioration  Although the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI rose to 49 7 in March from 48 in February  the reading is still below the key 50 benchmark that separates contraction and expansion

205042,426558,GOLD,Fed Rate Hike Translates To Commodity Price Buoyancy Late In Week ,opinion,"With perhaps the most important decision for commodity prices for some time having been actioned on Wednesday with the Federal Reserve lifting its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade  commodity prices witnessed subsequent pricing volatility  and strengthened on Friday  Such market vacillation will ultimately demonstrate whether Split Enz s assertions of  History Never Repeating  are correct for the country s new rate rising cycle 
In its decision  the Fed cited what it believed to be a resilient recovery of the U S  economy following the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis  In the end  the rate hike seemed a mere formality following mostly robust domestic macroeconomic data  despite continued turmoil in overseas markets in Europe in particular 
The immediate reaction to the rate hike was surprisingly muted  with gold in particular remaining steady around the  1 070 per ounce level for most of the day  However  despite a negative day for commodities on Thursday  gold finished at  1 065 per ounce on Friday  while silver  platinum and palladium finished at  14 09   859 and  558 per ounce respectively  Copper and nickel prices were also initially subdued immediate following the announcement  but enjoyed a Friday rally to finish up at  2 11 and  3 96 per pound Friday 
Major US indices responded with a delayed negative reaction to the news  and on Thursday and Friday traded down with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 17 129  while the S P 500 Index closed down at 2 006

205048,426564,GOLD,Here s Why Fed Will Hike In September,opinion,"Whether US equities are in a bear market or not is debatable  Regardless  I think there s now a 60  chance that Janet Yellen will hike rates on September 17 
If global stock markets stabilize and rally over the next week or so  Janet will be even more likely to take action 

That s the quarterly bars T bond chart  T bonds have almost quadrupled  since bottoming in 1981 in the 44 area 
They are trading in the upper part of the trend line channel now  and technically  due  to decline to the lower demand line 

That s the weekly T bond bars chart  It looks horrible  Clearly  the technical situation of the T bond market suggests rate hikes are imminent 

A rate hike could also harm the US stock market  That s a quarterly bars chart of the Dow and it looks ominous  Since the 2009 lows  the Dow almost tripled  but volume has steadily declined 
Since it lost upside momentum in late 2014  volume has begun to rise again  From a technical standpoint  this is a very dangerous situation  It s possible that a September rate hike could be the catalyst for a 1929 style crash in the US stock market 
I bought the Dow in 2008 and early 2009  and sold about 18 months later  for roughly a 100  overall gain  I m not greedy  and I would not re enter the US stock market unless the Dow declines to the 14 200 area 
If Janet hikes rates and the market begins crashing  investors who bought near the 2014 highs would probably panic  and that could create a crash in both stocks and bonds  In that situation  gold and fiat cash would likely be viewed as safe havens 

Chinese exports declined in August  according to CNBC news 
I would ask the Western gold community to remember that China s official government policy is to transition the economy away from exports  and towards domestic consumption 
On that note  domestic car sales at leading companies in China rose in August  Barron s writer Shuli Ren quotes several top economists who believe Chinese exporters may be under invoicing their customers in the short term  That makes the export numbers look weaker than they really are 
While I wouldn t touch the US stock market unless the Dow declines to 14 200  I m very comfortable buying the stock market indexes of China and India at the current time  and I m doing so 

That s the daily gold chart  A week ago  I suggested gold could decline to about  1110  and do so as the US jobs report was released 
It went to about  1115  Note the position of my 14 7 7 series Stochastics oscillator now  at the bottom of the chart  There s still room for gold to decline  but only slightly  before a bigger rally unfolds 
Gold often declines in the days ahead of the US jobs report  and then rallies significantly in the days weeks following the release of that report  This time  the situation is more complex  because of the key September 17 FOMC meeting 
That meeting could mark the end of the bond bull market that began in 1981  about 34 years ago  For gold price discovery in the immediate term  the jobs report is simply not as important as the FOMC meeting 

Gold feels quite solid ahead of that meeting  Yesterday  China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange  SAFE  released their statistics for the month of August 
Interestingly  foreign currency reserves declined  yet gold reserves  IMF reserves and SDR reserves were all increased modestly  BullionVault reports that China added about 16 tonnes of gold to its reserves 
I predicted that China s central bank would begin a modest and transparent buy program in 2015  and now it is here  I realize that some gold price enthusiasts had hoped that China was secretly accumulating thousands of tonnes of gold  They hoped there would be a dramatic event or announcement that would create a parabola move to the upside for the price 
The reality of Chinese buying is probably much more mundane  but it s still great news for gold investors  There is a buy program in place now  The monthly purchases appear to be in the 15   30 tons range  That is very supportive for gold especially given the apparent peak in mine supply that is occurring this year 
As more sizable Chindian players commit to long term gold buy programs  I think India s central bank will also do it soon   Western gold community investors should feel very comfortable buying modest amounts of gold and related items on any price sale 

That s the CRB Index quarterly bars chart  I like to use the 14 10 10 series Stochastics oscillator on most of my quarterly charts  It s reached the oversold area  and enormous rallies have consistently begun from there  The index itself is near massive buy side HSR  horizontal support   resistance   That extends back to about 1975  Institutional investors with a value orientation are likely buyers of commodity funds now  and that s also supportive for gold 

That s the daily chart for Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   It could be argued that the recent price breakdown means gold will also trade at a new low  but note the very bullish positive divergence been shown by the RSI indicator at the top of the chart  The 14 7 7 Stochastics series also looks ready to turn higher  Gold has a remarkable history of rallying after the Fed hikes rates  I think the next rate hike could be the catalyst for a major gold stock rally  and it s likely to start on September 17 
Thanks 
Cheers

205049,426565,GOLD,Gold s Primary Trend Still Bearish,opinion,"On Friday  the TRIPLE THREE safe havens  the yen  bonds and gold  all got a boost  with the Bonds being the standout performer as can be expected 
Gold  while moving higher  is also being weighed down by falling commodity prices with weakness in this sector a reason why many traders are selling into its rally 

On the short term chart  the metal has run to a band of overhead resistance near  1142  1140  That region is attracting a fair amount of selling 
The spike in volume that occurred late in Thursday s session was a surge of short covering by weaker handed shorts who were blindsided by the extent of dovishness coming out of the FOMC and the Yellen presser 
However  much as is the case with crude oil and the many other commodities  especially copper  that same dovishness is being construed to support fears of slowing economic growth  especially in emerging markets 
We have seen what a deflationary sentiment does to the gold price and it is never pretty  While the dollar has been derailed by the FOMC s dovishness  it is currently seeing some buying coming back in with many traders feeling its downside reaction was overdone 
After all  Draghi and company are not going to stand for a soaring euro nor are Abe and company going to tolerate a soaring yen  I am looking for Draghi to sound a very dovish tune ahead of the ECB s next policy meeting and I fully expect an effort to talk down the euro from that quarter 

Meanwhile  gold has had a nice little pop  but unless it can extend through the resistance zone noted  shorts will become emboldened and begin to press it  especially if the dollar stabilizes 
Once again  the fly in the ointment when it comes to gold is the lackluster performance of the mining shares  Though they had a high on the Friday session early  after that they did nothing but fade  I remain extremely skeptical of the sector 

On Friday  there was a note by investment bank RBC that the possibility of a credit rating downgrade could hit Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  if gold prices linger near the  1100 level 
The price action in the ARCA Gold BUGS Index  HUI  has been decidedly choppy over the last 6 weeks with the index currently moving back and forth in a wide trading range  It is not unexpected that the shares are getting a bit of a bid  after all  we are talking about a sector that has performed so miserably that it has managed to wipe out THIRTEEN YEARS of price action  Yet for all that  the lack of buying enthusiasm remains palpable 
I wish to repeat my warning from earlier this month   the gold cult is screaming once again about gold shortages at the Comex  Remember  since gold entered its current bear market some years ago when it broke down below  1530 and never regained that level  this crowd has conjured up one wild theory after another to support their reckless and subsequently proven to have been false claims that gold was ready to rocket  any day now  
Backwardation  JP Morgan cornering gold on the long side  negative GOFO rates  surging Chinese and or Indian demand  Bank bail ins  Russian Ukranian invasions  Chinese stock market worries  Greece exiting the euro  and on and on and on and on and on  Blah  blah and more blah 
Every single one of these utterly useless and worthless claims have done nothing except leave those who subscribed to them all the more poorer for paying the least bit of heed 
The gold cult has no shame and it also believes the rest of us have no memories  Do not let this group claim you as a victim  Respect the price action on the charts and let that be your guide  Your wallet will thank you in the weeks and years ahead 
if gold ever does manage to somehow become a bull market once more  the chart will show it  Until then  the primary trend in gold remains a bear  That means you sell rallies until the market price action tells you to do otherwise 

Here is a look at the reason   this is the intermediate term or weekly chart  Notice that for all the hoopla being raised by the gold cult about gold shortages at the Comex  the price remains well below its starting level of this year  Not only that  it has barely managed to scratch and claw its way back to broken support  which is the horizontal line drawn off the November 2014 spike low  It also remains BELOW the broken support line just above  1150 which is the bottom of that shaded rectangle that I have drawn in 
What I see when I look at this chart  is a market in the midst of DOWNSLOPING PRICE CHANNEL and thus one that is grinding relentlessly lower 

Maybe that will change and the market will finally start a trend higher but it has an awful lot of work to do on the technical price charts before one can say with any objectivity that the worst is over for gold 
Personally  I do not think the true bottom is in yet  I am keeping an open mind but at the first sign of any possibility of a Fed interest rate hike  gold is headed lower again and it may very well do that even before then  if commodity prices start tumbling any further 
Note how the RSI on the weekly chart cannot even make it to the 60 level  That is how weak this market is  If that level ever does get taken out and the technical posture on this intermediate term chart changes for the better  I will shift with it  Until it does  ignore the gold cult  they will end up ruining you financially 
While they huff and puff and bluster and fluster about this or that as being wildly bullish for gold  remember  remember  remember  how many wild claims they have made for the last 3 4 years and how much lower and lower gold and the shares have gone  Their financial net worth has been devastated  whereas those who objectively stuck with the advice of the price charts only  have managed to prosper  After all  that is what trading investing is really about   making money   not to sing songs from the same choir book and console oneself while one s net worth is going up in smoke ",2015-09-21,Dan Norcini,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-rally-in-gold-:-the-bottom-is-in--265631,265631
205050,426566,GOLD,Fed Refuses To Raise Rates On Slowing Economy Boosting Gold  Miners,opinion,"For smart investors watching the gold Dow ratio rather than mainstream media headlines  this is an exciting time to be a precious metals investor  The world seems to be conspiring to push the price of gold higher  with continued zero interest rates  Chinese stock market volatility and more unrest in the Middle East  In this interview with   Gold Stock Trades Editor Jeb Handwerger lays out his short list of junior mining companies that have been actively adding value  and that will be in demand when all eyes are on the sector 

The Gold Report  In your last interview with   you said that a Federal Reserve interest rate hike would be the best thing for gold  As we now know  the board decided to keep rates at almost zero  How does that impact your projections for precious metals 
Jeb Handwerger  It was almost a done deal that the Fed was going to raise interest rates in September  but then the Chinese market began to crash and just the threat of raising interest rates caused a price decline in the S P 500  the likes of which we haven t seen in a long time  It was a record drop  breaking a major four year uptrend and forming a technical bearish pattern  The Fed announced on Sept  17  when it was expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006  that it is uncertain about the economy  that the equity markets are too volatile  and that there are too many dangers of another recession  Now the Fed is doing whatever it can to prevent a recession 

The global stock markets are beginning to roll over  something I predicted in that same interview  due to fear of a rate increase before the end of 2015  The reality is we have a slowing global economy with the threat of higher interest rates  and that sparked a rally in the precious metals  The gold Dow ratio is now beginning to turn in favor of precious metals  which are once again seen as a safe haven to preserve capital and protect against markets that are completely overinflated and experiencing record volatility  That is why I have always advocated for a diversified portfolio  including precious metals commodities and high quality junior mining equities  I would not be surprised to see gold at  1 600 ounce   1 600 oz  and the S P500 at around 1 600 before the end of the first half of 2016 
The bottoming process for the juniors could be taking place now  after a seven year decline  All of these factors make this a phenomenal time to find assets not correlated to the stock market  the bond market and the U S  dollar  The best assets inversely correlated to those things are precious metals commodities and junior miners 
Now  the junior miners are even cheaper than they were in the late 1990s  when gold was below  275 oz  This could be a once in a lifetime value proposition that may not last much longer  The safest havens during these periods of deleveraging are assets trading near their intrinsic values or at liquidation levels  which we ve seen  Many of these miners are trading even below their cash values 
 Integra Gold Corp  TO ICG  would be an attractive takeover target  it s only a matter of time before a major wants to add this high grade asset to its portfolio  
The U S  stock market and the U S  Treasury markets went straight up for more than four years  boosted artificially by record low rates  They could be due for a possible 30 50  decline  The recent decline was just about 10   Any rally may be short lived until the markets return to realistic levels  As soon as that uptrend in equities is broken  we will see a massive rotation into the inversely correlated sectors  which include precious metals commodities and the gold juniors 
TGR  You re not the only one saying this  J P  Morgan just called a bottom for gold  Are you watching the same indicators as the big investment banks 
JH  I m not a fan of big house reports  I usually look at them as a contrary indicator  but this could mean that the upturn has just become undeniable 
The key indicator I watch is the gold Dow ratio  That is evidence that the trend may be changing  Investors need to look at the relationship between stocks and gold  When that ratio breaks down  it s better to be in precious metals 
I also look at the cycles  The decline really began in 2007  This is one of the longer declines  even factoring the bounce after the credit crisis between 2009 and 2011  Over this seven year period  a drastic reduction in mineral exploration and development due to capital chasing social media and biotech stocks has caused a major shortage of mineral supplies  The recent volatility and increase in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Index  VIX  will send investors back to the junior miners as a way to diversify out of overvalued stocks and bonds  That is why a portfolio of choice junior mining investments is more valuable than a statement might show today 
TGR  What kind of junior mining company can do well in this upward turning environment you re describing 
 Pershing Gold Corp  NASDAQ PGLC  is positioned for outperformance in the coming new bull market  
JH  I look for companies actively drilling  I don t waste my time with companies that don t really have a game plan for building fundamentals and creating value for shareholders  You have to know the management team  and it has to have clear  set goals with news flow and guidelines 
TGR  What are some top stocks you re watching that fit those criteria 
JH  Integra Gold Corp   ICG TSX V  ICGQF OTCQX  recently announced a major  14 million   14M  investment from Eldorado Gold Corporation  NYSE EGO   TO ELD   Integra is getting impressive  high grade results from its current drill program  It is getting validation from a major mining company and major investors during a bear market  That s exciting 
TGR  Could Integra be a takeout target 
JH  The validation from Eldorado  plus the increased funds to advance this project and continue making discoveries  makes me think Integra would be an attractive takeover target  As this company develops  it s only a matter of time before a major wants to add this high grade asset to its portfolio to get rid of some of the crap causing problems to the bottom line  We re already seeing a number of major mining companies doing that  They re getting rid of their uneconomic projects in risky jurisdictions and they re looking for lower capital expenditure  high grade  extremely economic  robust projects like Integra and Pershing Gold Corp  NASDAQ PGLC  
TGR  What makes Pershing attractive to a major 
JH  Pershing is continuing to drill at a record pace  It has a huge  strong treasury  It is fast tracking a great project that is continuing to build value in Nevada  This is an exciting time because this state has been ignored due to the strength of the dollar  Most investors like the Canadian assets because they can get better margins if their costs are in Canadian dollars and their sales are in U S  dollars  People thought the dollar was going to go higher if the Fed raised interest rates  Now that the dollar is beginning to turn over  that might reignite interest in Nevada gold mining 
Pershing Gold has a fully permitted mine and mill at Relief Canyon  It is getting exceptional results with four drills currently on the property  It has a great shareholder base  The largest shareholder is the billionaire Dr  Phillip Frost  Pershing has a strong treasury  and has newly uplisted to the NASDAQ with a share rollback  It has a clean balance sheet and an excellent share structure  It is positioned for outperformance in the coming new bull market 
 Red Eagle Mining Corporation  TO RD  is in construction of an extremely high grade  underground and robust economic mine  
Another Nevada company  Corvus Gold Inc  TO KOR   just received a  2M investment from Resource Capital Fund VI L P  in a tough market  That tells you something about the credibility of exploration at the North Bullfrog project  located an hour s drive from Las Vegas  Management came out with a preliminary economic assessment showing impressive numbers  but it s trading at an all time low  Corvus has Tocqueville Gold Fund Anglogold Ashanti Ltd  NYSE AU  and Van Eck Associates Corp  as major shareholders  That is a lot of institutional capital in this company  which is led by Jeff Pontius  who has decades and decades of exploration experience leading AngloGold Ashanti s gold exploration team in North America 
Staying in Nevada  Nulegacy Gold Corporation  TO NUG  has earned into the Iceberg project with Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   It is right next to Barrick s Goldrush discovery  NuLegacy has hit some impressive holes over the past few months  Barrick will have to decide by the end of the year whether to take this forward or stay a minority partner  Barrick has had a lot of problems in other areas  Its best mines are in the Cortez Trend in Nevada  where NuLegacy is  I think the best move is to secure those assets before a midtier swoops down and picks up that position  That s an exciting project that has seen some results in Nevada 
TGR  Is there another company that is well positioned 
JH  Red Eagle Mining Corp   RD TSX V  owns the Santa Rosa deposit near Medellin  it is the first mine that s been permitted in Colombia in over 20 years  a significant announcement  Red Eagle is in construction of an extremely high grade  underground and robust economic mine that is coming into production over the next 12 18 months  That is an exciting project that should be on the radar of investors 
TGR  Is the market taking notice of that announcement 
JH  Red Eagle has outperformed the juniors  It s still holding up there near its 52 week highs  but it hasn t broken out  Nothing in the entire sector on the development side has been breaking out yet  But this is one to watch 
TGR  Can you leave us with one more name to put on our radar 
JH  Carlisle Goldfields Limited  TO CGJ  just announced an exciting discovery at the Lynn Lake gold camp in Manitoba  Carlisle is partnered with Alamos Gold Inc   AGI TSX  to develop a feasibility study  Alamos may consider Carlisle a takeout target  especially as the junior mining sector turns around  One of the things that I like about Carlisle is very few juniors have a major company like Alamos operating and funding exploration and development and drilling  It is kind of getting a ride on the development from Alamos  which took over AuRico Metals Inc  TO AMI   I expect to see more progress in the next few months 
TGR  Based on the macro picture you have painted for us  how are you adjusting your portfolio for the rest of 2015  What is your strategy 
JH  I m continuing to build positions in high quality companies  I think now is an excellent time  especially when companies are offering three  to five year warrants and financings  For accredited investors who haven t yet had exposure to the junior mining sectors  that is an opportunity to diversify out of stocks and bonds and general equities 
We are already beginning to see the beginning of a bottoming process in the junior miners and a breakdown of the stocks  If you have a three  to five year window  there could be an exceptional amount of wealth created

205051,426567,GOLD,Junior Gold Miners On Verge Of Major Breakout ,opinion,"Junior gold miners  Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  N GDXJ   may be on the verge of a major breakout  passing three month highs after The Federal Reserve continues to push back interest rate increases  There is a stealth rally underway for junior miners as gold tests resistance after bouncing off its lows in late July 
Investors appear to be rotating from the Dow into precious metals as investors may be anticipating even greater easing efforts globally due to China s recent weakness and yuan devaluation  This could continue to push precious metals  the large miners such as Barrick Gold  N ABX  and mid tiers such as Alamos Gold  N AGI  higher  The fear of rate increases that push precious metals down is decreasing  The recent rally in precious metals and junior miners may be just beginning as I expect to see increased mergers and acquisitions off of these depressed low prices 

A company I have highlighted since the beginning of 2015 is   TO CGJ or OTC CGJCF  which traded as much as 40  higher on record volume as they released news that they are in  discussions concerning a potential commercial transaction   Carlisle is currently partnered with NYSE Producer Alamos Gold  N AGI  on Lynn Lake up in Manitoba  Canada  It is one of the top open pit gold projects in Canada 
  TO NUG  or OTC NULGF  was up 22  Tuesday after they released news that they completed the 70  earn in with Barrick Gold  ABX   The Iceberg Deposit is adjacent to three of Barrick s huge gold deposits that are the most profitable and safest in the world  NuLegacy spent  5 million USD to earn the 70  interest which is quite impressive in this tough market  Barrick has 90 days to elect to earn back in by spending  15 million USD on the property over 5 years or remain a minority 30  partner 
  TO KOR or OTC CORVF  has doubled since the beginning of October  They released an impressive video of the project and a 3D video of the Yellowjacket Discovery  See the new video highlighting the project   Corvus closed on a  deal with no warrants with a deep pocketed major Private Equity Firm  Resource Capital Fund  in early September and then  on the untested eastern side of North Bullfrog  Jeff Pontius  Corvus Gold CEO stated 

 The detection of gold and silver mineralization in the large East Bullfrog target area has the potential to be a game changer for the property as the area is nearly three times the size of the area hosting our current deposits we believe that Corvus Gold is uniquely positioned in the junior sector to make a major value impact in the coming months

205060,426576,GOLD,Gold Cracks Supports And Plunges To New Lows,opinion,"Gold cracked support and plunged to new lows since the last update  which came as no surprise to us  So what now  We are seeing signs that a recovery rally is about to begin  but it probably won t get all that far before a new downleg gets underway that sees gold make new lows again 
It s not just gold prices that are suffering   the entire commodity complex is in ragged retreat  with steep falls also in copper and oil  Why is this  The reason is that the gathering forces of deflation are starting to wreak havoc  and they are not going to be stopped by more QE   even if they print another  10 trillion to throw at the problem  The reason is that the debt mountain dwarfs whatever QE can be generated  and the deflation will continue until this debt is purged  Governments are like greedy short sighted children   they are not interested in doing what is right and behaving with restraint and propriety  if they were  they would have taken control of the debt crisis long ago  They are only interested in short term expediency  which is why we have had all this extend and pretend of recent years  involving QE and suppressing interest rates  Since they refuse to do their job properly  the markets are going to take over and do it for them  and the results are going to be very ugly indeed  Soon  the rot will extend from commodities to stock markets 
It was certainly an interesting two weeks in the gold and silver space since the last update  The plunge in the PM sector didn t surprise us  on the contrary  we welcomed it because we were short the sector  Our NYSE DUST ETF doubled  Now though  we are seeing signs of an imminent bounce 
On gold s 6 month chart  we can see the nasty plunge that followed failure of support at the March lows  but after one big down day  there was little follow through  and on Friday  after making new lows intraday  gold closed back up again  leaving behind a bull hammer on its chart  with the heavy volume confirming that this was very probably at least a short term reversal 


The 1 year chart for gold is also very interesting and useful as it makes plain the importance of the support failure  which dates back not just to the March low  but also to the November low  The failure of this support was a terrible shock for remaining gold longs  many of whom were running around like headless chickens  and dumping gold and silver stocks willy nilly for whatever they could get for them  We ll come to this later when we take a brief look at the chart for ARCA GDX 


Gold s long term 8 year chart puts things into more perspective  On this chart  we can see that although gold appears to be starting to break down into the C leg of the bearmarket that is expected to take it below  1000  it is hanging on by the tips of its fingernails to the bottom boundary of the recent 2 year long downsloping consolidation  at which point the short term bullish action on Friday across the sector developed  This  coupled with the latest COTs  which are positive  is what makes us think that a rally is now imminent  but it will likely get no further than the upper boundary of the channel shown on this chart  meaning not higher than about  1170 maximum  A possible scenario is shown 


The latest COT chart shown below is the most positive I can recall seeing  which is a big reason to take profits in short positions  and is what we are doing  Commercial short positions have all but vanished   and you can bet these guys have booked huge profits   while the hapless large Specs have  thrown in the towel  and all but quit gold  Of course  there is nothing to say that gold won t eventually continue lower and the Commercials go long  while the Large Specs go short  which has never happened in recent years 


The longer term Hedgers chart shows readings at one of their most positive levels ever   you certainly wouldn t want to overstay your welcome on the short side with readings at these levels   better to wait for them to calm down some before considering shorting the sector again 


The Gold Optix continues to look quite strongly bullish and suggests that  while gold s bearmarket is believed to have some way to run  we should be on the lookout for a final low before too much longer 


Both these sentimentrader charts go back to early 2011  in order to show the entire period from the bull market high of April   May 2011 
What about the all important dollar  A scenario that dovetails with our outlook for gold  and silver   which is for a significant bounce to be followed by renewed decline  is shown on the dollar s 14 month chart below  On this chart for the dollar index we can see that although it broke upside out of its recent Triangle  which is believed to be a consolidation pattern  it has lacked follow through so far and looks rather frail  What we therefore suspect may happen here is that the dollar pulls back to test support near to the apex of the Triangle  before a more determined advance into the next major upleg gets going  as shown on the chart 


Another factor suggesting that a rally of sorts is about to start across the PM sector is the all out pandemonium that broke out amongst surviving gold stock aficionados when gold broke lower  which is shown clearly by the huge volume on the GDX at the time  This smacks of capitulation   they simply couldn t take any more  The declines in stocks like Barrick  NYSE ABX  and some others were amazing 


Finally  it is worth digressing a little to point out a couple of developments that appear to have gone largely unheeded by investors in the broad US stockmarkets  The first is that commodity markets started to cave in in July of 2008  several months before US stock markets tanked in the fall of that year  The second is the recent collapse in the Chinese stock market  To most investors in the US market  the stock markets of mainland China might as well be on Mars  or that newly discovered Earth like planet  yet  it s worth recalling that the Chinese stock market crashed in 2008  just ahead of the US stock market crash  Below are presented two charts for a 27 month month timeframe for the S P 500 index  one that embraces the 2008 market crash  and the other leading up to now  with the Chinese stock market and the Commodity index overlaid at the top and bottom of the chart  This ought to get you thinking about what may be coming down the pipe for the US stock market  and other stock markets  




There is an argument that the US stock markets will be the beneficiary of  funk money  fleeing the growing chaos in Europe and elsewhere  and so hold up or even rally  and while this could happen  it may be wishful thinking  as when big global markets cave in  they like company  and in the writer s experience they are like a flock of sheep and they all go together when they go  Observe how the S P 500 index is rounding over gradually beneath a giant menacing Distribution Dome  the point of origin of this Dome is a peak in October 2011  off the chart    once this thing goes  no one can ever say that it didn t give plenty of warning first  It s a dream setup for traders as you establish short positions when the index is close to the Dome boundary  and have a general stop above the Dome boundary  If you are right  you are rolling in loot when it finally breaks down and caves in  If you are wrong and it goes on to break out upside  you are out for a minor loss   as a trading setup  what more could you want ",2015-07-27,Clive Maund,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-market-update-259544,259544
205061,426577,GOLD,Pershing Gold  Relief Canyon Mine History Will Drive The Future,opinion,"A stock that I have been following already for some years is a miner called Pershing Gold  NASDAQ PGLC   First  I thought it s an obscure stock hidden on the OTC markets  So I really didn t have the mood to look further into this particular miner  
But things change  and sometimes it s a good investment strategy to look forward  On July 6  2015 the company  that they were going to trade on the NASDAQ 
Damn  an uplisting I was thinking  What the heck 
Finally  something is happening 
An uplisting is great news for a company but also for investors because it also gives institutional guys the chance to buy shares 
The company had the following to say about it 

This up listing represents a key milestone for Pershing Gold  We believe that trading on the NASDAQ will provide us increased visibility in the market place  greater access to capital  a broader investor base and ultimately help us implement our growth initiatives and enhance shareholder value   stated Stephen D  Alfers  Pershing Gold President  CEO  and Executive Chairman   We likewise believe the additional exposure and credibility that Pershing Gold will receive from the investment community as a NASDAQ listed company will generate broader analyst  media and industry awareness for the Company 

Okay  but what is happening right now 
For investors not familiar with Pershing
Pershing Gold is a junior gold producer that is restarting the Relief Canyon Mine in Nevada  A mine that has already proven itself in the past 
According to information on the company s  and press releases 

The mine includes three open pit mines and a state of the art  fully permitted and constructed heap leach processing facility  Pershing Gold is currently permitted to resume mining at Relief Canyon under the existing Plan of Operations 

Pershing Gold s landholdings cover approximately 25 000 acres that include the Relief Canyon Mine asset and lands surrounding the mine in all directions  This land package provides Pershing Gold with the opportunity to expand the Relief Canyon Mine deposit and to explore and make new discoveries on nearby lands HistoryBefore you put your money where your mouth is  let s look for some background information  In this case  let s do a history tour  I read the following  to have a better understanding of its past 
The Relief Canyon Mine is located in Northwestern Nevada  along the southern edge of the Humboldt Range  It is located 110 miles northeast of Reno and 16 miles east northeast of Pershing County s Lovelock Mining for gold and silver in the Pershing County region started since the 1860s  Originally  the mine was called the Batavia and Pacific Mine  In 1869 high grade silver was discovered and mined in the Antelope Springs District  1 5 miles northeast of Relief Canyon  
More than 100 years later  in 1979  gold was found on the Relief Canyon and the years to come the mine was producing considerable quantities of gold  The mine was sold to Pershing Gold in August 2011  see picture below The mine s history presents an appealing investment opportunity for patient investors  The history has shown impressive results  with much more to come  We certainly can say the potential is enormous 
Some institutional investors think the same Junior  But FrostedPershing is a junior miner and hasn t yet sold one dime of gold because it is still not in the production phase  But things are heating up if the gold price recovers the Relief Canyon Mine is up and running 
Mr  Frost has been busy acquiring shares in Pershing  Dr  Phillip Frost made his fortune selling drug manufacturer Ivax to Teva Pharmaceuticals for  7 6 billion in 2005  Frost is an active trader and holds stakes in several public companies  Source  
Profitable investing in a junior is highly dependent upon a wide range of factors including which shareholders are buying 
Now that we know the mine s history  but also Pershing s biggest institutional shareholder  let s have a look to the company s investor presentation PresentationI have to confess I was impressed by the firm s investor   Especially  the growth story  and their resource estimate growth 
One thing that also got my attention was the fact that there is zero debt  Where Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX   has a Total Debt to Equity of 1 27  Pershing has none 
I know for capital intensive sectors it is a fair ratio  but in the current commodity climate the cost of debt financing may outweigh the return that a miner generates on the debt through investment and gold sales  In the end  this could lead to negative surprises for investors 
Finally  CAPEX seems to be under control because of the mine s history 
Actionable Idea
Just a while ago the gold price hit a 5 5 year low  despite that reports continue to show that demand for physical gold from individual investors has significantly increased around the world  A stock that clearly could benefit from a rebound in the gold price is Pershing Gold 
The miner is just waiting that the storm is over  before they start to produce 
PGLC data by LessonsHistory always repeats itself  so when the Relief Canyon starts producing it will be at higher gold prices than now  The current weakness in the gold market will be beneficial for its investors ",2015-08-05,Dutch Trader,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/pershing-gold,-the-mine's-history-will-drive-the-future-260695",260695
205062,426578,GOLD,Barrick Plans For  900 Gold,opinion,"Shares of Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  slid after the gold miner  the world s largest in terms of output  cut its dividend by 60  despite reporting a narrower second quarter loss 
Barrick s market value is down 50  over the last three months and is now worth some  8 billion in New York 
That compares to a  64 billion capitalization when gold was at  1 900 in 2011 
Barrick cuts its gold production forecast to between 6 1m   6 4m ounces as it disposes of assets including 50  of its Zaldivar copper mine in Chile for  1 billion  the Cowal mine in Australia for  550 million in cash and  298 million for its Porgera mine to tackle its crippling debt load of more than  13 billion 
The company announced additional disposals on Wednesday announcing that in the next few weeks  it will start a process to sell its Bald Mountain  Round Mountain  Spring Valley  Ruby Hill  Hilltop and Golden Sunlight assets in Nevada and Montana 
Other notable features of the quarter and outlook include further cost and capex cuts  but the  250 million debt reduction is some way off Mr  Thornton s target of  3 billion in 2015 

Company reported a net loss of  9 million   0 01 per share  in the second quarter  adjusted net earnings were  60 million  0 05 per share  
Free cash flow was  26 million and operating cash flow was  525 million 
Production in the second quarter was 1 45 million ounces of gold at all in sustaining costs  AISC  of  895 per ounce 
Full year gold production is now expected to be 6 1 6 4 million ounces  reflecting the impact of asset sales 
All in sustaining cost guidance for 2015 has been reduced to  840  880 per ounce 
Total debt reduced by approximately  250 million in first half 
 2 45 billion in asset sales and joint ventures announced to date 
Targeting  2 billion in reduced expenditures across the company by the end of 2016 
Capital and other expenditures reduced by  240 million in the second quarter 
Lowered quarterly dividend to two cents per share 
Scenario planning completed for gold prices down to  900 per ounce 
On track to achieve approximately  50 million in G A cost savings in 2015  exceeding original  30 million target for the year  Targeting  90 million in annualized savings in 2016  up from original target of  70 million 
Completed Preliminary Economic Assessments on projects with the potential to significantly extend mine life at Lagunas Norte and Pueblo Viejo 

The scenario planning for a  200 an ounce fall in the price of gold include even more divestments and these strategies 

Adjust life of mine plans to maximize short term free cash flow
Place higher cost operations on temporary care and maintenance
Defer stripping activities
Close or divest mines that do not meet capital allocation objectives
Increase cut off grades
Reduce mining processing rates
Further reduce G A and exploration
Further reduce sustaining capital
Process higher grade stockpiles",2015-08-06,Frik Els,https://www.investing.com/analysis/barrick-making-plans-for-$900-an-ounce-gold-price-260826,260826
205068,426584,GOLD,ABX Potentially Bullish Chart Pattern Defies Earnings Results,opinion,Despite a disappointing earnings report  Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  has ignored past performance  and apparently is looking ahead  as the stock recovers from an earnings reaction low at 12 40 to an intraday high so far at 13 41 More importantly  is that ABX is pushing up against the resistance plateau atop a 6 month base accumulation pattern  which  if hurdled and sustained  13 35 40   will trigger upside potential into the 14 80 15 00 area  and thereafter  to the 16 10 30 area From a big picture chart pattern perspective  only a failure to break out to the upside  followed by a break below 12 50 40 support  will compromise the timing of the expected next upleg ,2015-04-29,Mike Paulenoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abx-potentially-bullish-chart-pattern-defies-disappointing-earnings-resu-249984,249984

What stands out is that during the entire timeframe  both Spot GOLD and Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  exhibited significant relative  and counter intuitive  strength during the sharp climb in USD

205075,426591,GOLD,Barrick Gold  Forming Head And Shoulders Bottom,opinion,"We have highlighted many head   shoulders bottom patterns during the past few months as oil and precious metals stocks have bottomed and begun to turn higher  I want to go into a bit more detail explaining the H S bottom pattern  some of the theory and psychology behind it  and more importantly how to trade it 
The H S bottom is one of the stronger bottoming patterns with 74  of H S bottom breakouts meeting their measured move price targets according to Bulkowski  Here is an excerpt from stockcharts com on the H S bottom 
 The price action forming both Head and Shoulders Top and Head and Shoulders Bottom patterns remains roughly the same  but reversed  The role of volume marks the biggest difference between the two  Generally speaking  volume plays a larger role in bottom formations than top formations  While an increase in volume on the neckline breakout for a Head and Shoulders Top is welcomed  it is absolutely required for a bottom  
So volume is key to indicating the quality of the breakout above the neckline  I would also add that signs of accumulation  higher volume up days  on the right shoulder and in the days leading up to the breakout also makes a H S bottom breakout setup stronger  The symmetry of the H S bottom pattern is also important  I am not a huge advocate of slanted necklines or H S bottoms that do not have symmetry 
There is a H S bottom pattern that is currently forming on a well known senior gold producer  Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  


This pattern is virtually symmetrical  the pattern is mature  roughly 4 months in the making   and the neckline is clearly defined   13 20  13 40   The theory is that a breakout above the neckline in the next couple of weeks should lead to a further rally to  15  
The H S bottom neckline also excellently illustrates the fundamental technical analysis concept of previous support turning into resistance  Notice that support from October near  13 30 has turned into resistance  This concept is easy to understand  previous buyers who had 20   losses just last month now have an opportunity to exit their positions at break even 
Markets have a strong tendency to move toward pockets of supply as they move higher  Once the supply is gobbled up around the neckline of the H S bottom pattern  the buying inertia should take price to the next pocket of supply  This is the theory and the theory has worked very well in practice  However  one must remember that not all H S bottoms are made equally and the volume during the breakout is a crucial ingredient 
We will follow this setup in ABX closely over the coming days and update readers accordingly ",2015-02-26,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/technical-analysis-101:-head---shoulders-bottom-243266,243266
205076,426592,GOLD,Mega Gold Producer Finally Poised For A Turnaround,opinion,"After suffering through what have arguably been the most challenging few years in the company s history  Barrick  NYSE ABX  investors may finally be ready to profit from a sustainable turnaround in the company s fortunes  ABX has right sized its cost structure and begun to focus on its largest and most profitable mines   the result can be summed up by the following two slides from the company s  
ABX is now the lowest cost senior gold producer

Barrick also has the largest and highest grade gold reserves

Investors have also been paying attention to Barrick s recent transformation  ABX shares have outperformed the rest of the gold mining space  via Market Vectors Gold Miners  ARCA GDX   by a factor of more than 3 1 during 2015 

Technically speaking  after a powerful rally during the last week  ABX is consolidating just below an area of major resistance  between  13 00 and  13 25 

A break out from the multi month head   shoulders bottom pattern would target at least another 15  of upside    15 50  ",2015-04-09,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-mega-gold-producer-is-finally-poised-for-a-turnaround-247781,247781
205087,426603,GOLD,Gold Breaks Below Crucial  1 200 Level,opinion,"Gold broke below  1 200 today   a level it hasn t breached since 2010 
If gold rallies back up in the next few days  it will form a classic triple bottom  This is a bullish indicator signaling that there s substantial support from buyers 
In my last article  I explained the best way to own bullion in an easily tradable manner  Now  if gold rallies  you should be looking for much higher returns 
And there s one company in particular that holds all the cards should gold blast higher   Hint  It s not what you expect

The chart below shows how gold has hit bottom twice already   and is poised to drop to  1 200 once more 

It s possible that gold could blow through  1 200 and reach  1 150  That s not such a bad thing  if the price immediately bounces back above  1 200 
In either case  a  stand  at  1 200 or a rally is your signal to start accumulating gold and gold stocks 
Once the price movements play out  you should be taking aim at a gold royalty company that s fared much better than any type of mining company 
Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  will rally in a much stronger fashion than any senior miner when gold prices start to rise again 
The reason isn t complicated 
Franco Nevada makes money from collecting royalties on every ounce of gold that s mined for the company under a contract 
It doesn t do the mining  and it doesn t have the expenses associated with a mining operation or with starting one up  Instead  it lends mining companies cash   or it invests in them for a stream of royalties on each ounce produced according to its agreement 
Most importantly  Franco Nevada has zero debt  This means it can survive without resorting to diluting its shares to raise capital just for operations 
Over the past 12 months  Franco Nevada s shares have been performing better than any senior mining company  despite falling revenue  That might seem odd  But it s not if you look at things on a relative basis  not an absolute basis 
Franco Nevada s revenue growth has been minus 2 6  over the last year  If you compare it to a major miner like Barrick Corp   NYSE ABX   which has seen its shares fall by almost 40   versus around 18  for Franco Nevada   the reasoning becomes clearer 
Barrick is experiencing negative revenue growth to the tune of 22   while its debt to equity ratio is over 80   Barrick set a 52 week high in February  Franco Nevada hit its high in August 
So even when gold prices were rallying  Barrick was unable to make a new high  That s a very important  tell  
Winning the Game vs  the Hand
Gold mining is a very capital intensive business  and it can take years to develop a mine and bring the metal to market 
Companies with strong balance sheets can weather the downturns  But companies with no debt can do even better 
Though gold is weak right now  it s not a permanent condition 
With that said  short term factors like seasonal demand for the Indian wedding season or a correction in the stock market aren t reasons to buy 
The reason to buy is for the longer term supply and demand picture 
Demand is not abating  and supplies aren t growing as quickly  Heck  they may even shrink as the cost of developing and operating mines go even higher 
If gold does break down  you ll want to take the opportunity to invest in a play that won t just outperform during a recovery  but will also be cushioned during a time of underperformance 
Franco Nevada fits the bill  If gold s technical picture plays out like I described above  it s definitely the company to buy during a rebound in gold prices 
And  the chase  continues

As a general rule  the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information
As part of his plan to prevent a run on the dollar  stabilize the US economy  and decrease US unemployment and inflation rates  on August 15  1971  U S  President Richard Nixon directed Treasury Secretary Connally to  among other things  suspend with certain exceptions the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets and ordered the gold window to be closed so that foreign governments could no longer exchange their dollars for gold 
For the very first time in our history  all money  all currencies  were fiat   the US dollar use to be gold backed and it was the rock all the worlds currencies were anchored to   when the US dollar became fiat  all the worlds currencies became fiat 
Hindsight  Inflation v  Gold
When a currency loses value it s called inflation   prices seem inflated as each dollar is able to buy less and less 
If in 1971 I purchased an item for US 1 00 then in 2014 purchased that very same item it would cost  5 87 a cumulative rate of inflation of 487 3  
Gold has gone from  35 00 an ounce  when Nixon closed the window  to  at the time I m writing this   1240 50  And was as high as  1900 00 oz for a short period 
My hindsight is 20 20 so I can clearly see that holding gold was a better move  over the  71 2014 time period then owning dollars 
Foresight   U S    s Future
Fact  The global economy  and that includes the U S  s  is dependent on life support in the form of exceptionally low interest rates 
Fact  We now have is a global wide QE happening  every central bank is now creating  or will soon be creating money as fast as they can and buying assets denominated in dollars  Every country is beggaring their neighbor by printing its own currency in a bid to keep their exports cheaper than their competitors  It s a race to not just worth less but to worthless 
Q  What do you think is going to happen when the U S  rejoins the race to worthless  the Fed restarts the printing presses and doesn t raise interest rates 
Hint   Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 the U S  dollar has lost more than 95 percent of its purchasing power 
Worrisome Things
In our immediate future there are a lot of serious issues including  currency devaluation  continual war  deteriorating geo politics  religious genocide  China and its faltering relations with other China Sea stakeholders  Ebola  resource nationalism  climate change  possible bond market implosion  social unrest  very weak global macroeconomic data  resource wars  scarcity of fresh water for drinking  sanitary purposes and irrigation 
Investors need to own some precious metal bullion and the shares of gold silver exploration development companies 
Country Risk
One of the most serious and unpredictable risks facing mining operations and investor interests is  country risk    where the political and economic stability of the host country is questionable and abrupt changes in the business environment could adversely affect profits or the value of the company s assets 
Many countries might come to mind as places where shareholders could  without warning  receive news that their operations have been taken over by the government and or its friends  or that permits are suddenly suffering delays or have been cancelled outright 
There s not a lot of country risk in Nevada  U S A  And that s good because Nevada produces more gold then South Africa and Chile combined   the state of Nevada accounts for six percent of global gold production 
Barrick  NYSE ABX  Gold Corp 
Barrick Gold Corp   the world s largest gold miner  knows all about Nevada 
And perhaps that s why Barrick is  coming home  to the state that helped make the company  Nevada is home to some of Barrick s largest operations  including its massive Goldstrike and Cortez mines 
According to many of Barrick s senior officers Nevada is the most prospective place on earth to explore for gold  Strange that much of the company s attention  to its great detriment  has been globally focused in recent years 
But now Barrick is shuffling management  cutting costs  for 2013  Barrick produced 7 2 million ounces of gold at all in sustaining costs of US  915 ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of  1 92 pound and refocusing its operations This renewed focus comes following billions in impairment charges in 2013  and half a billion more in early 2014  related to the value of many of its  not in Nevada  projects 
In an effort to cut costs  the company has sold its portfolio of mines down to 19 compared to the 27 it had in 2012 
Spring Valley
Yet in Nevada Barrick is advancing its South Arturo project  extending the ore body at Cortez Hills and expanding its Turquoise Ridge mine  It s also fact tracking its Spring Valley joint venture  JV  with Midway Gold 

2014 Updated Spring Valley Resource Estimate
Barrick is coming home to Nevada  Top company executives have repeatedly said Nevada is the primary focus of the company s gold mining ventures 
Barrick completed its 70 percent earn in on the Spring Valley project by spending US 38 million a year ahead of schedule 
After Midway opted to be carried to production  will pay back its share of development capital from production  Barrick raised its interest in Spring Valley to 75 percent 
Barricks going to spend US 17 4 million on Spring Valley in 2014   twice the amount that was spent in 2013 
Barrick has publicly stated that Spring Valley  could potentially be a new stand alone gold mine  
Barrick even highlighted the project in the company s most recent investor presentation 

After reading all of the above you d have to think Barrick  the world s largest gold miner  is pretty serious about fast tracking development of the Spring Valley project 
Terraco Gold Corp   TO TEN    TEN
Terraco owns a gold net smelter return  NSR  royalty suite of assets on almost all of the Spring Valley deposit 

Terraco s NSR includes three separate components 
An option to acquire up to a three percent NSR royalty  by December 2016  on claims covering the majority of the currently outlined Spring Valley gold deposit   Outlined in RED hatching on map above 
A total of up to a one percent NSR royalty on the remaining portion of the currently outlined Spring Valley gold deposit as well as areas to the north of the currently outlined NI 43 101 gold resource   Outlined in GREEN hatching on map above  Terraco currently has direct ownership of 0 5 percent NSR royalty plus an option  by December 2016  to purchase an additional 0 5 percent NSR royalty for a total of up to one percent NSR royalty 
Terraco has a Right of First Refusal  ROFR  for a one percent NSR royalty on claims within a one half  1 2  mile perimeter area of interest around the claims in RED 
Ian Gordon  President of Longwave Analytics  kindly breaks down  do it yourself here  the numbers for us as to what the Spring Valley deposit NSR royalty might possibly be worth to Terraco s shareholders     1  Contained gold   327 857 ounces for 14 years and 220 002 ounces in year 15 
2  Expected gold recovery   80  298 286 produced or payable ounces per annum for 14 years and 176 002 ounces in year 15 
3  Mine life   15 years 
4  Anticipated gold price for the life of the mine    1 500 00  U S   per ounce 
5  Approximately 75  of the ore body lies within Terraco s 3  royalty and 22  within the 1  royalty  On the basis of the anticipated annual gold production this equates to net proceeds to Terraco of  129 607 778  U S   over the 15 year life of the mine   By applying a reasonable 5  discount rate to each year of the royalty proceeds  the net present value of the 16 year total royalty payments of  129 607 778  U S   paid to Terraco equals  70 528 067  U S    From this amount  16 083 000  U S   is deducted  which is the amount that Terraco must pay to exercise on the remaining royalty option  This leaves a net present value of Terraco s royalty on the Spring Valley project of  55 940 312  U S    Terraco Gold has 134 797 151 shares outstanding  which when divided into the net present value of the royalty is equal to a value  0 415 per share  
Oct  16th 2014  Terraco closed at  175 
Midway Gold Corp   AMEX MDW  owns 25 percent of the Spring Valley Project and is carried  free  to production  Midway gets to keep ten percent of its share of production profits  the rest  90 percent  goes to Barrick to pay them back for Midway s share of production costs  Once Barrick is paid back for the carry Midway will receive it s full 25 percent 
There s a total NSR royalty on the deposit of seven percent  We know three percent belongs to TEN s shareholders  another three percent belongs to an entity I will keep nameless and one percent is locked into a family trust and will never be sold 
Barrick s Spring Valley gold deposit  the one it seems so keen to fast track  has a 25 percent carried partner and a seven percent NSR royalty 
Story Time
In 1985  Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV  paid US 2 000 000 00 for a royalty interest in a small Nevada mine called Goldstrike  At the time Goldstrike had just 30 000 oz  of gold 
One year later Barrick purchases the property and starts exploring 
The Goldstrike Property produced 892 000 ounces of gold in 2013 at all in sustaining costs of  901 per ounce  Goldstrike s proven and probable mineral reserves as at December 31  2013  were 10 7 million ounces of gold 
Franco Nevada has gotten an NSR royalty payment on every ounce of gold that has ever come out of Barrick s Goldstrike mine and will continue to do so for the life of the mine 
Here s what David Harquail  President and CEO of Franco Nevada   the company that in the mid 1980 s pioneered the use of royalties   has to say about the royalty business 
 It s the best business because you don t have to do the risky exploration  but you still can get the upside of a great discovery  
No kidding  Either way  keeping the royalty or selling it would be huge for Terraco shareholders 

Moonlight
There s more to the Terraco Nevada story than  just  an NSR royalty on a 75 percent Barrick owned fast tracked gold project 
Terraco also controls the over 35 sq km Moonlight Project  a contiguous land package connected to the north side of the Spring Valley project  The Moonlight Project is one of the largest early stage properties remaining on the Humboldt Trend and the company has been quietly consolidating and increasing its land position over the last several years 
Barrick s drilling confirms the Spring Valley deposits gold mineralization is open to the north  towards Moonlight  and at depth 
So there is evidence to suggest that Moonlight could be the next mineralized event in a string of deposits on the Humboldt Trend ranging from Relief Canyon at the south end  north through Nevada Packard  Rochester  Spring Valley and Moonlight 
As if Terraco s Nevada story wasn t already interesting enough another of the world s major miners walked into Terraco s Nevada story  the following is from TEN s website 
 Southern Humboldt Range New Entrant   Sumitomo
Regional Southern Humboldt Range activity  in addition to the above noted Spring Valley developments  includes a new entrant along trend adjoining Terraco s Moonlight Project to the North  Renaissance Gold Inc    Renaissance   has signed an exploration agreement with Sumitomo Corporation s U S  subsidiary  Summit Mining Exploration II  Inc   to earn up to a 70  interest in the Fourth of July project that is along strike  to the north  from the Rochester Mine  Barrick s Spring Valley and Terraco s Moonlight Project  Terraco s Moonlight Project now sits between two major mining companies in Barrick and Sumitomo  
Almaden
In addition to the Spring Valley Royalty and it s Moonlight Project  Terraco has an advanced stage gold project in Idaho  the Nutmeg Mountain   Almaden Project  which hosts a National Instrument 43 101 compliant gold resource of almost one million ounces  This advanced stage project has excellent access and infrastructure and has over 66 140 meters of drilling in 903 drill holes 
The project is host to a low sulphidation  epithermal gold deposit that sits on the side of Nutmeg Mountain  you would push material down to end up on a leach pad  there s no stripping ratio to speak of and there s already landslide material at the bottom   the inferred resource of 84 000 ozs of gold 
Conclusion
There are a whole lot of reasons  and all of them spring from having an excellent management team  for investors to have Terraco Gold Corp  TSX V   TEN on their radar screen 
Have you got Terraco on your screen 
If not  maybe you should

205098,426614,GOLD,Econ 101  Rising Demand  Falling Supply Equals Higher Metals Prices,opinion,"Juniors can t fund their projects  which means that the majors  reserves will continue to shrink  Rick Mills argues that this process can have but one result  higher metals prices across the board  In this interview with The Mining Report  the owner and host of Ahead of the Herd com highlights a half dozen gold  silver  copper and nickel companies that will leverage these high prices  and introduces us to a Canadian company s unique cobalt project in Russia 
The Mining Report  Last month  the price of gold rose over 3  in one day  Can we ascribe this to the conflicts in Ukraine and Iraq or the unraveling of Chinese commodity financing deals 
Rick Mills  I don t think those things had anything to do with it  The unraveling of Chinese commodity financing deals was mostly about copper  While the situation in the Middle East is certainly affecting the price of oil  I believe that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has more to do with the price of gold than anything else going on in the world today 
TMR  You re referring to her press conference of June 18 
RM  Yes  She confirmed that the tapering of bond buying will continue  but more important was her announcement that the Fed s zero interest rate policy will continue  Real interest rates are going to remain low for a while yet  that news caused gold s price to increase  Below is a chart created by U S  Investors  It shows in stark clarity the relationship between real interest rates and gold s price 

TMR  Many goldbugs believe gold and silver prices are manipulated downward by central banks  Do you agree 
RM  No  I don t  I almost wish it were true  If it were  I could sit back and play the markets knowing exactly what was going to happen next  This claim of manipulation is just an excuse for being constantly wrong  It s a business model to sell gold off your website and expensive newsletter subscriptions  Learning about sector rotation and macro events will make you a much better investor than clinging to conspiracy theories 
TMR  Do you have any thoughts on where the prices of gold and silver will go in the second half of 2014 
RM  Higher sooner rather than later  That goes for copper  nickel  tin  zinc and pretty much any mineral  It s a question of supply and demand  Junior resource companies own the world s future deposits  They buy claims from prospectors  work the projects and advance them to where they are bought by larger companies  And these mining juniors cannot get funding  So how will the majors replace their reserves  The answer is that they can t  It s just a matter of time before metals prices react to physical shortages  Think about it  when was the last time you heard of a major mining company making a discovery 
TMR  You ve written at length about rising global scarcity of resources  What effects will this have on metals prices 
RM  We live on a planet with a finite resource base with a growing population  We reached 7 billion people in October 2011  The United Nations says we can probably expect upward of 10 billion people by 2050  Other reports claim that world population will reach 11 4 billion by the 2060s  Norman Borlaug  the father of the green revolution  said if we do everything that he has shown us  and there are no black swans  the earth could support 10 billion people at most 
Ecological overshoot is coming  Our freshwater aquifers  probably our most important treasure  are being sucked dry by industry and unsustainable drybelt agriculture  and poisoned at the same time through fracking  We re rushing headlong into shortages of resources and the resulting conflicts over them  The low hanging mineral fruit has been picked  Metallurgy is becoming more complicated  energy is becoming more expensive  and labor shortages loom  The baby boomers are starting to retire en masse  and the resource orientated talent pool is thinning out 
At the same time  massive urbanization is ongoing in Asia and Africa  As people there move into the cities  they climb the protein ladder and eat more dairy products and chicken and beef  They get cell phones and maybe a washer and dryer  air conditioning and a motorcycle  All this puts an enormous strain on supply  Metals are going to get much scarcer  and prices are going to get very dear 
TMR  You ve also written about the return of economic imperialism  Do you foresee superpowers invading countries to secure resources  or will they apply pressure indirectly 
RM  I like Lenin s take on the morphing of early 19th century imperialism that he called monopoly capitalism an alliance between big business and banking capital that dominates the state to gain exclusive control of raw materials and control of foreign markets  And both direct and indirect pressure are being applied  Russia has applied force directly in the Crimea and is applying it directly and indirectly in Ukraine  Look at what China is doing to the other stakeholders in the China Seas and what the U S  did in Libya for control of both water and oil  Countries need to access secure sources of minerals  energy and just basic materials  If they don t  we can expect more Arab Springs  even in developed countries 
TMR  When we last spoke  you noted the significantly higher cost of new nickel and copper projects  Where do we stand a year later 
RM  Things have gotten worse  We have not seen the demand destruction that would facilitate a drop in prices  and we re not going to 

Even after the unraveling of Chinese commodity financing deals  copper is still over  3 a pound  If you re searching for new copper deposits  you must go farther and farther afield into dangerous country 
Nickel is the same  Indonesia  one of the biggest suppliers  has decided to stop exporting raw ore  Nickel comes increasingly from laterites  and the metallurgy just doesn t seem to work on them  As a result  cost overruns are ballooning out of control 
TMR  Which nickel projects are your favorites 
RM  As far as I m concerned there s only one  North American Nickel Inc  s  TO NAN  Maniitsoq project in Greenland  This is not a laterite project  it s nickel sulfide  And it s close to year round shipping from deep sea fjords 
North American Nickel closed a  9 4 million   9 4M  financing in May and announced a  9M  greenfields exploration program June 19  The company is doing geophysics  sampling and drilling  We ll have news flow coming soon  and that will continue into early winter 
TMR  When will we know whether Maniitsoq is economic 
RM  I think we ll know by the time we get the drill results this year  In the meantime  here s something to think about  North American Nickel  owns the entire Greenland Norite Belt  all 70 odd kilometers of it  This is a potential new Sudbury  and North American Nickel owns 100  of it  This is the play  Nobody else is spending up to  10M this year 

TMR  What is the relationship between North American Nickel and VMS Ventures Inc   TO VMS  
RM  They re two separate companies  but there is a lot of synergy  Mark Fedikow is the CEO of North American Nickel and also VP Exploration at VMS  John Roozendaal runs VMS now and is on the board of North American Nickel  VMS owns 22  of North American Nickel  The Sentient Group  a  2  billion resource fund  owns close to 50   I don t think that VMS really affects North American Nickel  it s the other way around  VMS stands on its own  I don t know too many companies out there right now that have 30  of a high grade copper mine a commercially operating copper mine by the way and 22  of Maniitsoq  what could be the greatest Canadian exploration story since Voisey s Bay 
TMR  Do you worry that environmentalists could attempt to fence off Greenland as  the world s last great unspoiled wilderness  
RM  You should talk to the people of Greenland and ask them what they want  That sort of talk more amuses me than anything else  It s easy to preach about freezing somebody else s economic development when you already enjoy a high standard of living  I think most Greenlanders understand that when you have natural resources  you need to exploit them responsibly for the betterment of all 
Greenland has one of the world s best reporting and permitting systems  Work is going ahead 
TMR  You mentioned that VMS owns 30  of the Reed copper project in Manitoba  Tell us more about that 
RM   HudBay Minerals Inc   NYSE HBM   which owns 70   has formally declared commercial production at Reed  Right now  100  of the cash flow that VMS would normally get is going back to pay the no interest loan that HudBay made to carry it to production 
VMS has something like  5M in the treasury now  It is looking for an acquisition  a close to mining scenario  VMS is going to be doing some exploration work on its 100  owned properties  but VMS needs to conserve cash until the Reed money starts flowing in  I know John Roozendaal  He s a miner and as solid as they come 
TMR  When will VMS start getting its share of the cash flow from Reed  and how much will that be 
RM  Initial estimates will be a year and very substantial monies flowing to VMS  Let s get a couple quarters of production under our belt and talk then 
TMR  Richard Mark resigned as CEO and chairman of VMS June 16  Is this significant 
RM  I don t think so 
TMR  Which gold juniors do you like 
RM  I like two  I ll start with Cangold Ltd   TO CLD  Bob Archer is CEO of Great Panther Silver Ltd   AMEX GPL  and Cangold  Cangold just closed a  750 000 financing  It was oversubscribed by  100 000  so now the company has  850 000  in its treasury  That s enough for the summer and fall program at Guadalupe de los Reyes in Mexico 
TMR  What are Cangold s plans there 
RM  The company is going to get geos out to the site and structurally map the high grade system  Cangold is going to re log the drill core  send it out for assays  do a bunch of sampling and remodel the whole thing  There are 428 holes in the property  48 are core holes  The rest would be reverse circulation 
Guadalupe is a quartz vein system with visible gold  It was mined as far back as the 1770s  Cangold has an option to acquire 100  of it from Vista Gold Corp   AMEX VGZ   Vista has put a half million ounces through a scoping study  and Cangold will pay  5M in staged payments over the next three years to acquire 70   with  3M to buy the last 30  
TMR  How valuable is Bob Archer s track record to Cangold 
RM  I got into Great Panther at  0 38 share a decade ago and watched it rise to 10 times that  Bob and his team have 10 years of operational experience in Mexico  They took on Guadalupe because of the 500 000 ounces  500 Koz  of gold there  plus 10 million ounces  10 Moz  of silver  It s open pit now  but because of their experience at Guanajuato and Topia they think they can do a combination of open pit and underground 
Tetra Tech completed a preliminary economic assessment in March 2013 that contemplated a 35 Koz gold producer from open pit only  I think Cangold can bump that up to maybe as high as 50 Koz gold equivalent annually  That would be equal to Great Panther s production level  Cangold has a tight share structure  and I think it s got a hell of an upside when gold starts to rise 
TMR  What s the second gold junior you like 
RM   Terraco Gold Corp   TO TEN  
TMR  Could you explain this company s relationship with Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX   Midway Gold Corp   AMEX MDW  and the Spring Valley gold project in Nevada 
RM  This is a project that has just gotten a lot more interesting  Spring Valley is a joint venture between Barrick and Midway  Barrick s the operator with 70  interest and Midway has 30   Barrick is fast tracking this and being extremely aggressive in advancing it to prefeasibility  It is going to spend  8 3M in 2014 for project development and  5M for further exploration  This is a resource of 2 16 Moz gold Measured and Indicated and 1 97 Moz Inferred for a total of 4 13 Moz gold  Terraco has bought a net smelter return  NSR  of up to 3  on claims covering the vast majority of the currently outlined Spring Valley deposit 

TMR  Does Barrick s spending of that much money suggest confidence that the deposit can be expanded 
RM  Yes  it does  which makes Terraco s NSR worth even more  But that s not all  Terraco owns a project called Moonlight  which is located at the north end of the Spring Valley project  North of Moonlight is Renaissance Gold Inc  s  TO REN  Fourth of July project  Renaissance just signed an exploration agreement with Sumitomo Corp  s  TOKYO 8053  U S  subsidiary Summit Mining Exploration to earn up to 70   If you picture it on a line  on strike  you ve got the Rochester mine  Spring Valley  Terraco s Moonlight and Fourth of July  So what we have is Terraco s Moonlight property sandwiched right in between Barrick and Sumitomo  Plus Terraco has the royalty on Barrick  and 864 Koz gold at its Almaden project in Idaho  You can see why I m pretty excited about Terraco 
TMR  Turning to silver  do you still like Great Panther 
RM  Yes  I do  The company is producing from two mines in Mexico  Guanajuato and Topia  This gives it upside to a rising silver price  as well as lead and zinc  Great Panther has an advanced project  another production story  at San Ignacio and exploration projects at El Horcon and Santa Rosa  You ve got pretty much the whole works with Great Panther 
TMR  How are its production costs looking 
RM  Going to get better  There is additional ore coming from San Ignacio  the company forecasts about 250 tonnes a day by the end of 2014  This increases throughput at Guanajuato with no further capital expenditures  The updated San Ignacio resource estimate was 121 grams per ton  121 g t  silver and 2 28 g t gold  Great Panther s leverage to a rising silver price is hard to beat 
TMR  What effect has the new royalty tax regime had on miners in Mexico 
RM  The cost of doing business  mining  in Mexico has risen  there s no doubt about that  So much will depend on what happens to the price of silver 
TMR  Is there a silver explorer you re keen on 
RM   Kootenay Silver Inc   TO KTN   It has 76 million shares fully diluted  Its Promontorio project in Mexico has a Measured and Indicated silver equivalent resource of 92 4 Moz  there s a very large gold component to the resource  Its Inferred resource is 26 8 Moz for a silver equivalent total of 119 2 Moz  Considering its share structure  you re actually buying 1 5 silver equivalent ounces for  0 30  That s about as good as it gets when you re talking about leverage to a rising silver and gold price 
Promontorio is currently one open pit  with Kootenay still drilling and trying to increase the size of the deposit  On the same piece of property Kootenay has a very exciting early stage silver exploration project called La Negra  It s an open pittable heap leach  It s a breccia  which is a diatreme pipe  and it forms a very prominent hill with some 120 to 130 meters of relief  The bedrock has been exposed and mapped  Kootenay flew geophysics over  and results suggest that it is at least twice the size of what is actually exposed  The results are pretty damn impressive it s got some size and it s right on surface 
TMR  What s Kootenay s path to production at Promontorio 
RM  Kootenay is doing a  2 5M financing for more development work and drilling  Kootenay is at its low  You d buy because you believe silver and gold are going to turn around  This is contrarian investing  You re supposed to buy low and sell high  right 
TMR  Which so called critical or strategic metal is most interesting to you 
RM  Right now  cobalt  I think a lot of attention is being focused on this metal  and rightly so  with Tesla s  Gigafactory  talk  There s no cobalt production in the U S   and I personally don t believe there will be any  Investors will have to start looking farther afield  In Russia  for instance 
TMR  What s the cobalt company you like there 
RM  Global Cobalt Corp   TO GCO   which will complete the resource report for its Karakul cobalt project  It is going to come up with an NI 43 101 complaint resource estimate that the Western media is going to accept  That s pretty exciting  I think we re going to see an upward revision in its share price now 
TMR  It s quite rare to hear about a Canadian mining company operating in Russia 
RM  It s special  all right  It s actually in the Altai Republic  which is about as far from Moscow as your big toe is from your heart  Global Cobalt has the full cooperation of the Republic s government  The World Bank is in there  It has Chinese backing  and the Japanese are there  too  Panasonic  China is signing the offtake agreements for this  There are not a lot of companies in China or Russia I would invest in  but this is certainly one of them 
TMR  Junior miners saw a big surge in share prices last winter  Then there was a big fall off  Might we see another surge this year 
RM  We re not going to stop using metal  we re not going to suddenly stop valuing gold and silver as precious  Majors do not find the worlds mines  juniors do  Juniors  share prices have to go up  the sector has to revive for majors to replace mined reserves

205099,426615,GOLD,Why Gold Is The Only Thing I Can Find To  Buy Low  Now,opinion,"The tally as of this morning 
The stock market is up 2 4  so far in 2014 as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average  while gold bullion is up 8 1  for the year 
 As an investor  do I get into gold or stocks at this point in the year  
Well  if you ve been reading my articles for a while  you know I m not a fan of stocks right now  I simply believe the stock market has become a Federal Reserve induced bubble 
And while there has been a lot written about price manipulation in the gold market  and while mighty Goldman Sachs still says the metal is headed lower in price  investors should look at gold bullion right now that s both old gold investors  so they can average down their cost  and new gold investors taking their first position 
Here are my reasons why 
In 2013  the Indian central bank and government imposed tariffs and restrictions on the importation of gold bullion into India  as they believed the demand for gold bullion in the country was hurting its national accounts  In the first quarter of this year  India started to ease its gold importation restrictions  and bang  last month  gold bullion imports into the country increased by 65  over June of last year   Source  Bloomberg  July 16  2014   Demand for gold bullion in China  which I ve documented in these pages  is also very strong 
Inflation  what gold bullion acts as a hedge against  is starting to gain momentum  The Producer Price Index  which tracks changes in the prices producers pay  increased by 0 4  in June from the previous month  that s an annualized rate of 4 8    Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics web site  last accessed July 16  2014  
And import prices are rising  too  In the first half of 2014  import prices increased by 1 9  the first increase since 2011   Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics web site  last accessed July 16  2014  
The demand supply situation for gold bullion is becoming more imbalanced as demand rises and supply declines  After gold bullion prices took a big tumble in 2013  gold miners cut back on their exploration budgets and shut down mines that were not profitable at  1 200 an ounce gold  This stunted supply  while demand for gold bullion from central banks and investors remained strong 
Finally  the geopolitical events happening in the East  Russia and Ukraine  Israel and Palestine  are deteriorating  not improving 
The prices of major gold stocks  like Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG   Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   and the widely followed gold exchange traded fund  ETF   Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDX   are trading at five year lows  But gold bullion is up about 50  over the same time 
I m a cautious investor  not a speculator  I might get the same return speculators have gotten the past couple of years with the stock market  especially the tech stocks   but I can t afford the risk 
I ve always been a  buy low  sell high  type of guy  My biggest problem has been finding something to buy low  I think I ve found it this summer of 2014 with gold related investments

205100,426616,GOLD,Junior Miners Holding Long Term Support,opinion,"Despite the shorts in precious metals reaching record heights  the junior gold miners  Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ   continue to find support at the 200 day moving average  a critical area of long term support   This may be signaling to investors that gold may soon bottom around  1200 and that the major miners may start looking for economic deposits to replace current resources that are being exhausted 

If you find quality gold properties near majors with top notch management with track records then you have a good shot to make a profit even through this historic bear market 
For instance  about a month ago I sent out  that the  Smart money is looking at the Cortez Trend  
I highlighted a small junior called Nulegacy Gold  TO NUG  partnered with Barrick  NYSE ABX  which I visited only six weeks ago   Nulegacy may be at just the beginning of discovering a gold deposit on trend with Barrick s three multi million ounce deposits  These massive deposits are some of the lowest cost and most profitable mines for Barrick in the entire world 
Nulegacy s deposit is next to Barrick s Goldrush Deposit which is one of the best greenfield discoveries in the world with over 14 million ounces of gold   Recently a major billion dollar private equity fund has taken a 19 9  in Nulegacy  which will help Nulegacy expand exploration and earn in to the deal with Barrick   This deal provides financial security for the company and is a significant development in Nulegacy s history 

In addition  Nulegacy has significantly strengthened its board with the addition of Alex Davidson who was the former VP of exploration for Barrick during its major growth years   He was instrumental in Barrick acquiring those profitable Cortex Mines from Placer Dome   He retired from Barrick in 2009 but is still recognized in the mining exploration circle 

In conclusion  I was early highlighting this story more than a year ago at under a dime and you may have not believed me when I told you that Nulegacy owns prime real estate in the Cortez Trend   Its understandable at that point to be a little skeptical with an early stage explorer in Nevada   However  after seeing a major private equity firm become a 19 9  strategic partner and seeing old time famous veterans from Barrick such as Alex Davidson joining the board  an investor should be more confident that this is a first class exploration target with the potential to become a major resource for Barrick   Take a look at Nulegacy before the potential breakout as two drill rigs are 
Disclosure  I am a Nulegacy shareholder and the company is a website sponsor   Conflicts of interest apply and one should do their own due diligence ",2014-09-17,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/junior-miners-holding-long-term-support-226136,226136
205106,426622,GOLD,Chris Ecclestone  What M A Deals Reveal About Management,opinion, Obvious  or  huh what   these are the two types of merger and acquisition deals  according to Hallgarten   Co  Principal Analyst Chris Ecclestone  In this wide ranging interview with The Metals Report  Ecclestone discusses the anatomy of a mining deal  a few strategic metals stories flying under the radar and Soros Fund s latest maneuver in the metals market  Along the way  he skewers management teams that cut costs everywhere except the corner office while spending billions on mega mines with no future   The Metals Report  In the 2013 Review of global trends in the mining industry  PwC describes the  crisis of confidence  in the mining sector  Does that analysis apply to the specialty metal miners  Are there opportunities in this small sector that might be missed   Chris Ecclestone  Every metal and mineral has a different story  At this moment  some precious metals   like gold and silver   are in a crisis  but platinum and palladium are not  A big brush approach to these markets can lead to errors  For example  if iron is weak  to conclude that coal is weak would be wrong  That might be true for metallurgical coal  but not for coal used for energy generation  Mid month  the lead price got above  1 per pound   1 lb   which was a significant recovery from its lows  The zinc price has been creeping up again  The copper price is not bad at levels about  3 lb  But the iron ore price totally plunged  So there isn t just one thing going on here   In the specialty metals  it s all about the market conditions for each particular metal  You can have a situation where a primary metal is out of favor  but the alloying specialty metal is not if the specialty metal is in temporary short supply or under political export pressure  Another example of each metal having its own story is the major base metals   lead  zinc  nickel   they were already kicked in the teeth a long time ago  Zinc is nowhere near its 2008 highs  neither is lead  and nickel peaked years before that  It s invalid to lump them all together  they need to be analyzed separately   Reviewing the rare earth element  REE  metals situation is instructive  What looked to be a situation of mixed shortage and surplus among this large group of metals was turned into a big drama  Enormous expectations developed  as did  certainties  of shortages for some REEs  and that sent some of the prices through the roof  The trouble with REEs is you can t divide the pack  You have to take the whole suite the good  the bad and the ugly  That s what sabotaged the story for the REEs  Lanthanum and cerium  which were the two biggest components of any REE mix  were in oversupply  So again each metal has a story   TMR  What is the most compelling specialty metals story right now   CE  Antimony  though it s technically a metalloid  The antimony market has seen little investment for years because of waning China dominance  Now  new applications for antimony are shaking out the old producers and changing the market dynamic  Most Western mines closed down decades ago  but recently  a few Western mines have reopened  although not enough to make up for reduced Chinese exports  As a result  I expect antimony to be strong  A similar situation exists with other metals like gallium  germanium  selenium and some REEs   TMR  What is the new application driving demand   CE  Antimony s biggest rising usage is as a flame retardant in plastics used by the auto industry  After years of having the price of antimony at  2 000   2K    3K and  4K per ton  now it s at  10K ton and it was as high as  15K ton  That s a good example of a new technology but not a sexy technology  like the REEs used in cell phones  By comparison  antimony is boring but absolutely vital   TMR  How can an investor get exposure to antimony   CE  There are a couple of options  One is Toronto listed Mandalay Resources Corp   MND TSX   It s a gold antimony mine in Australia  Another option is the South African company Village Main Reef Ltd   VIL JSE   which has the Consolidated Murchison  Cons Murch  gold antimony mine in South Africa  Gold deposits often are associated with antimony  so it has a double whammy positive effect because both elements have high value  Given the choice between a gold deposit and a gold antimony deposit  I would take the latter   TMR  Lately  you ve written a lot about mergers and acquisitions  M A   You categorize M A deals as either  obvious  or  huh what   You dubbed the potential deal between HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM TSX  HBM NYSE  and Thompson Creek Metals Co  Inc   TCM TSX  TC NYSE   obvious   How did you come to that conclusion   CE  That s a good example of a deal that makes sense to everybody except current management  The companies  managements say  no  no  no  because it theoretically means someone is going to lose their seat at the table  They don t want to fall into the funeral procession of some of their colleagues they used to hang out with at PDAC  Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada  conference with their ancient whiskeys and big cigars  There are other deals that could make sense  Lundin Mining Corp   LUN TSX  and HudBay  which was a deal proposed back in 2008 and didn t happen  Or Mercator Minerals Ltd   ML TSX  and First Quantum Minerals Ltd   FM TSX  FQM LSE   However  First Quantum is currently digesting the acquisition of Inmet Mining Corp   IMN TSX    Instead of buying a company  Capstone Mining Corp   CS TSX  bought a mine by purchasing Pinto Valley from BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK   The market thought the deal was expensive  but to Capstone  and to us   it made a lot of sense  The purchase turned Capstone in a multi mine copper company  There are other examples of sensible and obvious M A examples in the gold sector  More interesting to me is when mid sized diversified miners join together and create companies that have the critical mass to become majors   Costs are the talk of the industry right now energy  labor  etc  Yet costs at head offices are much less discussed  If you combine two head offices  it s like 1 1 1 because you only have one management team surviving  You don t need to have two investor relations people  You don t need all the flimflam  One head office gets the chop  and that saves money  In some cases  you cannot save more money at the mine  but you can save money at the head office  There are an awful lot of overpriced  overpaid midtier mining people  When you put two companies together  you can make economies of scale   Good deals also diversify companies across metals  A company can be all zinc and if zinc goes bad  you re really done for  Merging a copper mid tier with a zinc or nickel producer makes sense for a lot of reasons  You get geographic and product diversification  Geographic concentration brings risks  A good example of that is Centamin Plc  CEE TSX  CNT ASX  CEY LSE   which operates in Egypt and saw its market cap wilt from  3 5 billion   3 5B  down to  600 million   600M   It is easy to find examples of companies that are down 80   but not many  3 5B companies are down 80   Another example of a company that has had issues due to geographic concentration is Centerra Gold Inc   CG TSX  CADGF OTCPK   Centerra has had problems with its main mine  Kumtor  which is in the Kyrgyz Republic  If you run into problems and you only have one mine  you have a big problem  There is no other story to tell investors  The pattern is a familiar one and has happened in all sorts of different places   TMR  Of the potential mergers you mention  most have geographic diversity as well as a mix of nonferrous base metals  Is that a theme for you going forward   CE  If there is an economic recovery  you have to bet on base metals  If risk goes down  the appetite for gold goes down  With recovery  the chance of Quantitative Easing  QE  being extended goes down  The inflation fears abate  It s not looking good for gold  though it may have a floor   TMR  Is the current financing climate putting the brakes on bad or high risk mergers   CE  It s the bad past examples more than the financial crisis that has curbed high risk mergers  If we hadn t had these bad examples  companies would be out there doing the same dumb deals  Many potential acquiring companies have cash  Some of the worst companies have piles of cash  They might have had big write offs of what they bought in the past and since then  they ve generated a lot more new spending money  Many mining executives seem to think a  7B property is a great bargain  But why not buy three diversified  million ounce properties for  50M each  rather than buy one 3 million ounce  3 Moz  mega mine property for  2B  Same amount of ounces  big difference in price  The trouble is many majors would rather pay  1B to buy a 3 Moz mine that s in one location  This gigantism has now come back to haunt them  The Seabridge Gold Inc   SEA TSX  SA NYSE A  KSM project  Novagold s Galore Creek and Barrick Gold s  ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  Pascua Lama project will all be in the history books  No one is going to do a  10B  20 year project even in the mid term future in the gold mining sector   TMR  Do you have any examples of recent good deals   CE  New Gold Inc   NGD TSX  NGD NYSE MKT  recently made a really great deal  but the market slapped the stock down because the market says any deal is a bad deal  Capstone got slapped down when it did Pinto Valley  I think that after a few weeks  they recover  But a bad deal is obvious  Everyone just looks at it and says   huh what   Those mining companies are the ones whose CEOs are gone a few months later if they haven t already bit the dust  The surviving group has been getting smaller and smaller   TMR  In your most recent monthly letter  you describe rotations  Most investors rotate from hot sectors into perceived growth opportunities looking for the next big thing  You re proposing investors outside the mining sector are going to look at this beaten up sector as an opportunity  Are new investors rotating into the mining sector soon   CE  I don t think the rotation is coming  I think it is here  People look at the U S  equity market and feel skittish  Between inflation and index changes  the market hasn t gone anywhere since 2008  But  at the same time  people like to be moving  Brokers don t make money by investors hanging on to stocks  They make money out of persuading clients to rotate  It becomes a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy  There is something for each member of the financial community  the brokers  the strategists and the hedge funds guys  For example  the hedge fund guys get itchy fingers if they re sitting at the desk and haven t done a trade for half an hour   But they don t want to be buying just more of the same old Apple or index fund  They want to be buying something novel  They want to be seen to be doing something  That s why there will be a rotation  The rotation should mean that the largest miners will see stronger share prices  They ll benefit because they re in indexes  Ask your average hedge fund manager who s never done mining   name me a mining company   and he ll say   Barrick  or  BHP   Ask your average hedge fund manager about Agnico Eagle  and the response will be  What  Is that a brand of Swiss watch   He won t know what that stock is unless he s been there  done that in the past   It is interesting that Soros Fund s reduced heavily their expsoure to physical gold ETFs  It s quite clear that the physical gold exchange traded funds  ETFs  are suffering  Soros bought options on the Gold Miners ETF  GDX   Buying options on GDX is an interesting trade because the ETF operator is not actually buying the underlying stocks  Someone else is taking the risk  whoever the option writer is  As we know  many mining stocks are now illiquid  If George Soros ever goes to exercise his options and they have to deliver him ETF shares  then they have to go to the ETF manager  which is Van Eck  Van Eck would then have to race out into the market and start buying all the stocks that make up the ETF so that it can create the units that it would then deliver  Soros could create a squeeze and remember  George Soros  middle name is  Squeeze  and really blow that whole dead zone of the ETFs out of the water  Whoever wrote those options is crazy because they are on the wrong side of George Soros in a small market  There is a trade there for a smart fund manager   TMR  Are there any other strategic minerals investors should take a look at   CE  Fluorspar is nice  It s not in exceptionally short supply  but there are very few companies exploring for or mining it  Canada Fluorspar Inc   CFI TSX V  is still moving forward  though not as fast as many people would like  The financing is tough  The only way to do most of these projects is with an offtake agreement  Canada Fluorspar has one  An offtake agreement is not the solution to everything  but it is a big step in the right direction   TMR  Any strategic minerals to watch   CE  There are lots of other interesting materials like tellurium  selenium  gallium and germanium  Gallium and germanium are both high tech elements that the Chinese have a total headlock on at the moment and have had for a long time  Very few Western companies are making any effort to get out there and find those minerals   TMR  They re generally byproducts of zinc refining   CE  Some of them are  but you can find primary mines  Many gold deposits contain a little antimony  a bit of bismuth and whatever else  The minor metals weren t really considered much  With tellurium  for example  there are no primary tellurium mines  but there are gold deposits with tellurium byproduct  I would focus not on pure gold deposits now  I would focus on gold deposits where you get something else in the mix  A polymetallic deposit is a safety net  I d rather have a silver zinc mine than a pure silver mine   TMR  What is the single most important theme for metals investors at this point in the strategic metals space   CE  The idea is to be cheap  Look for companies that buy assets cheap  It s as simple as that  I think many of the managements of the big miners wouldn t know cheap if they fell over it  They ve been overpaying for deposits and overpaying themselves in the process  Avoid companies where  cheap  isn t in their vocabulary  Avoid management with a track record of blowing away your capital while they blow away their credibility  It is an unfortunately common pattern in the mining industry   TMR  It has been interesting and entertaining to speak with you  We look

205113,426629,GOLD,Gold  Who s Selling  Who s Buying  Who s Lying ,opinion,Although the Pharisees of paper money successfully forced down the price of gold  like those who lobbied Pontius Pilate to crucify Jesus  the consequences of their actions will backfire beyond their wildest imagination    The decision of the paper money cabal to force down the price of gold is akin to Japan s decision to attack Pearl Harbor  Although the attack was successful  the eventual consequences were not what Japan had envisioned  Recently  an article  The Gold Correction  What s the Big Deal   posted the following chart  However  measured from its September 2011 high of  1901 35  gold s fall is 28    a drop remarkable similar to its 2008 correction of 27 7    THE 2008 CORRECTION AND OR MANIPULATION The 2008 correction of gold occurred during a period of extreme financial and systemic distress  Global markets were in disarray  Wall Street banks were collapsing and trillions of dollars of Fed money was necessary to protect the bonuses of investment bankers whose bad bets had caused the collapse just the environment when gold would be expected to rise  Instead  gold fell  In 2008  as today  the same hands were on the scale forcing the price of gold lower  In the fall of 2007  gold had rise from  680 to  1 033  An astounding 51 9   increase  This is exactly what the paper money cabal feared most  a concomitant rise in the price of gold during a period of extreme financial stress  If gold quickly rose during a period of heightened investor fear  it would signal to fearful investors that although paper assets were at risk  gold offered not only a safe haven but outsized gains as well  and the investors  subsequent fear fueled greed would easily dismiss any resistance the paper money cabal might offer  To counter the allure of gold in such heightened circumstances  in my article   posted March 18  2009  I wrote  When gold made its run in the fall of 2007 from  680 to  1 033 in spring 2008  the Swiss National Bank sold 22 tons of gold to cap gold s rise One year later  after the collapse of global stock markets in the fall of 2008   gold made another run at  1 000  but this time when gold hit  1 009 on February 20th  2009    LeMetropole reported central banks sold 220 tons of gold to force gold below  900  In 2009  the paper money cabal had also pushed gold lease rates into negative territory to prevent gold from rising above  1 000  On March 17  2009  in his article    Patrick Heller wrote  On Friday  March 6  gold lease rates turned negative for the day  What that means is that anyone who wanted to lease gold would actually be paid a fee in addition to getting a free gold loan  No sane person would choose to lose money loaning physical gold  in addition to the risk of never getting the gold back from the other party  However  if someone  such as the U S  government  wanted to suppress the price of gold  this is one tactic to try to accomplish that purpose  I can come to no other conclusion than that a large quantity of physical gold surreptitiously appeared on the market on March 6 with the sole purpose to drive down the price of gold  The quantities were large enough that they almost certainly could not come from private parties  With most of the world s central banks now being net buyers of gold reserves  they would not be the source of this gold  By process of elimination  the suspicion falls upon the U S  government as the ultimate party responsible for this blatant action to manipulate the price of gold  Of course  the U S  government would not want to be identified as the cause of this leasing anomaly  Instead  such manipulation was almost certainly conducted by multiple trading partners of the U S  government  This sledge hammer tactic worked at driving the price of gold further away from the  1 000 level   at least temporarily  Mr  Heller need look no further than Alan Greenspan for confirmation that central banks in collusion with bullion banks were  in fact  manipulating gold with lease rates  Eleven years before  on July 24  1998  before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had testified  Central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise   Although Greenspan was to fail as an economist  he excelled as a politician  and as disingenuous as Alan Greenspan s tenure was  Greenspan s testimony as to the readiness of central banks to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise is an admission sufficient to quiet those who would still believe otherwise  Regarding the central bank leasing of gold  in The Gold Market  Seen Through A Glass Darkly  I wrote  After gold s explosive ascent in 1980  central bankers began seriously  manage  the price of gold  A lower price of gold would indicate not only an abatement of monetary problems but investors would be less inclined to trade their paper banknotes for the safety of gold when they could more profitably leverage their paper banknotes in the bankers  paper markets    Since the early 1980s  supplies of newly mined gold have constantly fallen short of market demand for gold  but notwithstanding supply and demand fundamentals  gold prices nonetheless fell for 20 straight years  In 1980  the average price of gold was  615  By 2001  it was only  271  Clearly  the free market price of gold was being distorted by  outside  forces     The real question is not whether the fed is manipulating gold but where the gold is coming from  There has been conjecture that gold stolen by Japan from China prior and during WWII is the source of the supply of gold coming onto the market  In 2012  GATA s Chris Powell discounted that possibility in his post    While I concur with Powell that if the US had access to such gold in 1968  they would have employed it to prevent the collapse of the London Gold Pool  It is my belief  however  that such gold did exist but  in 1968   Yamashita s gold   i e  China s stolen gold  was still a tightly held secret of the US government privy to only the top echelons of the CIA and a few others  More importantly  however  in the 1960s China s stolen gold  i e   Yamashita s gold   had not yet been laundered into the international banking system  The laundering of the illicit horde of gold was not to happen until the 1980s  the decade when  not coincidentally  American Barrick  a junior oil and gas producer  was to become Barrick Gold  No less than the esteemed Professor Antal E  Fekete recognized the possibility of gold laundering by Barrick when he questioned Barrick s inexplicable and self defeating strategy of unhedged forward selling of gold at prices far below the market  In his August 2006 article    Professor Fekete suggested Barricks strategy could  in fact  be an operation to cover up the laundering of gold  The professor wrote  Is Barrick a front to cover up gold laundering    unless Barrick was a front to cover up gold laundering by governments  in which case unilateral forward selling was not a mistake but a deliberate policy The suspicion that Barrick is a front to cover up a gigantic gold laundering operation  presumably on behalf of a government  or governments  that need more time to complete a gold acquisition program in the order of thousands of tons of gold  is hard to escape  In my book    I quote from EP Heidner s  which confirms what Professor Fekete had surmised but Barrick wasn t laundering gold to complete a gold acquisition program as believed by Professor Fekete Barrick was  in fact  laundering China s stolen gold to bring it into the international banking system  US Intelligence operations had been siphoning off the gold  China s stolen gold  for three decades  However in 1986 Vice President George Bush took over the gold from Marcos and the gold was removed to a series of banks  notably Citibank  Chase Manhattan  Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation  UBS and Banker s Trust  and held in a depository in Kloten  Switzerland  In 1992  George Bush  former Director of the CIA  served on the Advisory Board of Barrick Gold  The Barrick operation would create billions of dollars of paper gold by creating  gold derivatives    and  would become an investment for nearly every gold bullion bank associated with the Marcos gold recovery  China s stolen gold   These banks would loan gold to Barrick  which would then sell the borrowed gold as derivatives  with the promise of replacing the borrowed gold with their gold mining operation    Barrick  which has no mining operations in Europe  used two refineries in Switzerland  MKS Finance S A  and Argor Heraeus S A    both on the Italian border near Milan  a few hours away from the gold depository in Zurich The question that Barrick and other banks needed to avoid answering is  what gold was Barrick refining in Switzerland  as they have no mines in that region    Barrick would become a quiet gold producing partner for a number of major banks  and its activities became subject to an FBI investigation into gold price fixing  The records on this investigation were kept in the FBI office on the 23rd floor of the North Tower which was destroyed by bomb blasts shortly before the Tower collapsed  p  11  Collateral Damage  US Covert Operations and the Terrorist Attacks on September 11  2001  EP Heidner  2008  CONJECTURE  CONJURING AND CONFIDENCE GAMES The drop in the price of gold has ignited a frenzy of gold buying around the world  It is my belief that the gold being sold is not China s stolen gold  but gold purloined from the central banks of countries still vulnerable to the considerable pressure of Western central banks  In 2012  India s central bank  the Royal Bank of India  received a High Court notice to explain gold deposits currently with the Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements in Basel  Switzerland  India s central bank is required by law to keep 85  of its gold reserves in India yet 47  of India s gold is deposited with the Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements  see  It is likely that India s gold has been leased by the Bank of England in order to suppress the price of gold  India is a former crown colony and its imperial shackles have not yet been completely removed  The international monetary system based on credit and debt is  in truth  a confidence game in which gold was once a critical component  But when ties between paper money and gold were severed in 1971  confidence in the bankers  paper money began to falter  and  today we are witness to what happens when confidence in a global confidence game begins to evaporate  In my current youtube video    I discuss the on going economic collapse  It isn t over yet  When it is  then and only then  will we be free of the bankers  dream of eternal debt  Buy gold  buy silver  have faith ,2013-05-08,Darryl Robert

205115,426631,GOLD,Sprott s Michael Kosowan Asks  Are You Swayed Or Afraid ,opinion,Many investors are wondering if the words  gold  and  opportunity  can coexist in the same sentence  Michael Kosowan of Sprott Global Resource Investments answers with a resounding  yes   He believes in the Pareto Principle 80  of the gain is derived from 20  of the stocks and that contrarians will be rewarded in this  wonderfully miserable market   To find that 20   Kosowan outlines the criteria he uses when sizing up a junior mining company  Watching gold prices these days has been an  exercise for the eyeballs   similar to watching a rubber ball bounce around a concrete room  At times the price moves unnaturally  in fits and starts  according to broad economic policy statements in the marketplace and seemingly harmless comments right out of the Fed chairman s office  How do we uncover opportunity amidst so much volatility in the marketplace  Excellent gold stock opportunities are still available in this wonderfully miserable market  Gold stocks represent excellent opportunities to create wealth  Most readers will fall into three categories  those who want to know how gold stocks and the word opportunity can coexist in the same sentence  those who have been swayed or afraid to invest in gold and are wondering what to do with their current portfolio  and those who recognize that they can be a contrarian or a victim in these markets and believe that there may be a turn in the market that can lead to wealth  The history of this sector shows that there have been critical times to invest to produce life changing wealth  Not surprisingly  this has typically coincided with times when public sentiment has been at all time lows  At times like these the media tends to highlight the risk while ignoring the returns  Today s market is similar to a replay of a movie that we ve all seen before  The low sentiment toward gold and gold stocks was also very prevalent in 1999  when I  Michael Kosowan  moved from the mining engineering side of the business to become a stock broker  At that time  like today  you were able to buy reality at a discount  The 1999 market gave rise to such success stories as Southwestern Resources Corp   International Uranium Corp  and AngloGold  all increasing tenfold or more  Going back to the gold market in the 1970s  the price of gold moved up from  35 ounce   35 oz  in 1970 to  200 oz by 1975  In the midst of that bull run on gold  the price suffered a 50  retracement and moved back to  100 oz by August 1976 this was a cyclical retracement in a secular bull market  It was painful  but not debilitating to the bull market thesis  During this tumultuous time the media had its own part to play  In August 1976  Time magazine proclaimed that  gold lately has had about as much luster as a rusty tin can   Expectations were set very high on the initial run up and the interim weakness was enough for the analysts of the time to discredit the entire gold thesis  Those swayed by the media were shaken out of that market and then missed the subsequent move from  100 oz in 1976 to  800 oz four years later  Time magazine was a very expensive subscription that year  to say the least  The investors who were swayed by the media missed astounding returns on gold as it moved through its bullish cycle  So what do opportunities for gold look like now and how do I find them  A mine is a depleting asset  every day that goes by while it is in production reduces the size of the business  The recent landslide at Rio Tinto Plc  RIO  Kennecott Utah Copper Bingham Canyon mine  located not too far from Salt Lake City  Utah  highlights this issue  This is the second biggest copper mine in the U S  and one of the oldest it started production in 1906  This mine as 107 years old and has been producing 200 000 tons of copper  300 000 ounces gold  3 million ounces  3 Moz  silver and 13 000 tons of molybdenum per year truly massive  Although it is very impressive to be pumping out this kind of tonnage at its age  Bingham Canyon is telling us legacy assets are becoming strained and long of tooth  They are dwindling  which spells supply disruptions  and therein lies the opportunity  The costs associated with keeping mines in production are increasing and supply disruptions to such important assets are becoming more common place  The estimate for Bingham is that it may very well be off line for the next two years  Our dwindling legacy mines are in urgent need of being replaced by new discoveries  So  where are they  This chart depicts the 3  Moz discoveries over the last 21 years The chart dramatically shows that this industry has seen an acute lack of significant discoveries in the recent past  Meanwhile  the industry is chugging through more than 80 Moz gold  680 Moz silver  15 million tonnes of copper and 90 million pounds of uranium annually  These depleted reserves need replenishment  And  in today s challenging economic environment  the quality needs to be higher Discoveries made in the mid  to late 1990s are largely due to the increased financing activity that took place 10 years earlier  Funding comes 10 years ahead of discovery activity  The poor discovery rate of today is relative to the poor market conditions and lack of funding we suffered in early 2000s Since that time  funding has ramped up  notably between 2005 and 2007  If this cycle holds true let s call it the circadian rhythm of mining then we may be directly in front of a renewed exploration and discovery cycle Here is a checklist for success with four factors The first factor is balance sheets  They can be intimidating for some investors  but they don t need to be  Investors should look for whether the company has sufficient cash to cover its projected expenses for the next two years  Two years is important because finance continues to be tough in this market  If the capital raise is significant it will spell out heavy dilution and water down future positive price moves if there are any  Small financings at these levels could be a warning of desperation as the company fights to cover incidental costs while adding no benefit to the exploration venture  These small raises could be going toward covering working capital deficits and salaries basically keeping the lights on  Be wary of both large and small financings You don t want a junior miner that has debt or high property payments in the near term  A company s cash balance needs to be sufficient to take it to its next technical milestone  Companies add value by answering unanswered questions  How far will the company get to answering that critical question regarding its exploration program before needing to raise capital yet again The second factor is management  When it comes to junior mining stocks  management is key and that can t be stressed enough  Good management can make a lesser property viable  Make sure the people running the junior miner have a ton of experience  ideally directly related to the same commodity involved in the project at hand In an ideal world  management and or the company s geologists will have made significant discoveries in the past  bringing some of those deposits to production  Experienced management will also know how to navigate legal  political and financial issues and  especially important in many North American jurisdictions  the permitting process  Also  look for companies where the key people have plenty of  skin in the game   ensuring their shares and stock options align their interests with those of shareholders The third factor is low capital costs  Capital cost is simply the total cost to put the mine into production  This is commonly found in the feasibility studies for the project The current challenging financial scene has made it difficult to access capital  This has been a barrier for the big  high tonnage deposits  Recent high profile projects that have gone way over budget have poisoned the well of large scale finance  While it was not that long ago that companies were being rewarded for big projects  this is not the case today and financiers are being far more selective The final factor is high margins  High grade equals high margin  And in this market  that s crucial  The Holy Grail for many of the juniors is to be acquired by a senior  They must show that they have the high grade to offer or the takeover won t happen  From my perspective the seniors have developed an inward looking focus  They are attempting to develop low grade ounces in a rising cost environment  Their older mines are getting deeper and more costly  This is known in the industry as  extend and pretend   Production expansion is coming at a much higher price  at some point this will prove a losing battle  Going forward  high return deposits will be key  The seniors have not spent money on exploration  leaving them with only one place to turn     the juniors These criteria form the  must haves  when choosing gold shares that will yield the best returns  Now more than ever they are crucial to the success of your investment  These criteria represent the tip of the iceberg  This is really just the beginning of your homework assignment in making your stock selection  Understand that the performance of this sector is really dependent on only a handful of stocks  The outstanding returns of the few derive benefit to the many The Pareto Principle is firmly at work here 80  of the gain is derived from 20  of the stocks  Finding that 20  is key There is real opportunity in this market to buy the all stars of this industry at a discount  This is truly a wonderful set of circumstances for speculators names like Ross Beaty  Bob Quartermain  Lukas Lundin  Robert Friedland proven veterans of the mining sector who are now able to get their hands on some of the best projects they ve ever seen Take advantage of this wonderfully miserable market we find ourselves in and find those fantastic opportunities that are out there This article was adapted from the talk Michael Kosowan gave at Cambridge House s  in Vancouver on May 27  2013    Michael Kosowan

205117,426633,GOLD,Gold And Silver Prices  Been Here Before But This Time Is Different ,opinion,Gold and Silver have seen dramatic sell offs before  although the primary difference between previous precious metal declines and the recent drop is the current shortage of physical metal    It is also worth considering how well commercial bullion traders are positioned for a rally after this recent run of sharply dropping prices  especially when the latest price drop came on top of a physical market signaling tightness  The Developing Physical Gold and Silver Shortage and Goldman s Sell off Signal Major dealers in North America and the EU seem to be out of physical Gold and Silver stock across the board  This physical shortage had been developing for some time  in contrast to the 2008 drop   In terms of the supply fundamentals  the loss of Kennecott s Bingham Canyon mine last week  in addition to further postponements for Barrick Gold s big Pascua Lama Project were as bullish as can be   Goldman was also openly signaling the rest of the market by notably revising their gold price forecast lower just ahead of the big down move  followed by more major banks revising their price forecasts lower  Gold and Silver Price and Positions Gold and Silver prices have now been falling overall or range bound for almost two years  Compare the current situation with the historical September 2010 to April 2011 period  when 30 percent down moves occurred after a short covering rally as a speculative pile on ensued   This time  the physical demand has been surging just before paper price declines led by the manipulated futures market  Hedge funds have also been piling in to short the market to a historic degree based on the negative technical picture   J  P  Morgan Chase et al have been slowly exiting or reducing their notable precious metal short position over the last month without a drop in the market s open interest  Normally  heavy downside direction in price tends to be accompanied by a reduction in open interest   The Economic Backdrop There have been record highs in equities recently  despite persistently soft economic data that misses one week after another virtually across the board  Complacency and universal bullishness seem to prevail  despite data indicating that little if any real economic recovery is underway   Another notable occurrence has been the persistent referencing of CPI and employment numbers by authorities  and the mainstream media despite the obvious disconnect of this data from the reality faced by most people   The last straw was the blatant early release of FOMC Meeting Minutes so that the markets could react when Gold and Silver sentiment was already horrible  Nevertheless  the world s stock of fiat money is not contracting  quite the opposite  in fact  Japan has just launched another round of monetary stimulus  which will see the developed world s most indebted economy create a proposed  1 4 trillion in Yen in a bid to break the country free from depression and the perceived threat of deflation   Gold and Silver Price Patterns and Key Retracement Levels The same price pattern seems to be emerging  A massive dump in early overnight trading  followed by a margin increase pulls the rug out from under Gold and Silver support as the market approaches key technical levels   The market moves much farther down than statistical or historical norms would suggest seems probable This latest sharp decline  led by the Asian session  resulted in the biggest two day decline in the price of gold seen over the past thirty years   From a technical perspective  the sharp move down seen a few days ago broke below the 38 2 percent retracement level of the big post 2008 gold rally from 681 40 to 1920 75  prompting traders to shoot for the 50 percent retracement level at 1301 07   This 50 percent Fibo level now seems to offer the market both a target and a rallying point  The substantial bounce already seen from the recent 1321 09 low just ahead of this objective indicates that the market s desire to sell may well already have been satisfied   Interestingly  it often seems to be the case that when market sentiment is apparently beyond repair  the seeds for a new Gold and Silver rally are quietly being sown ,2013-04-19,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-silver-prices:-been-here-before-but-this-time-is-different-163755,163755
205118,426634,GOLD,Junior Gold Producers May Be Safer Than The Senior Miners  ,opinion,Barrick Gold  ABX   the largest gold miner in the world  came out with earnings that were better than most analysts expected  The market was obviously happy as the large gold miner says it may suspend its high cost projects in questionable jurisdictions  Instead  I have suggested in many articles that Barrick should focus on their Nevada projects which are continuing to support the company with a large amount of positive cash flow  Nevada is the jurisdiction  which made them successful On the other hand their  8 5 billion Pascua Lama Project has been a disaster with soaring costs and jurisdictional disagreements  It is an albatross and Barrick must cut their losses  They should look to invest in Nevada where their properties especially in the Cortez Trend have some of the highest margins in the business  Over the past year  Barrick s risky moves into questionable projects and jurisdictions have hammered down its share price  Sometimes well managed juniors may actually be safer than some of the majors Remember there are smaller but more efficient junior producers who could compete with the clumsy larger players in terms of its ability to expand their gold and silver production and at the same time reduce costs  Comstock Mining  LODE  is one of the few junior gold miners that is producing gold and generating positive cash flow in a very turbulent and volatile marketplace The company is well capitalized to explore and expand the resource around the historic Comstock Lode  In a recent technical report  Comstock Mining announced the discovery of the  Chute Zone  which is similar to the historical bonanza grades found by the old time miners over a 100 years ago  This discovery is very exciting as it could really boost the growth of Comstock Mining  which has been producing gold now for about 8 months  They hope to eventually produce 150 000 ounces of gold per year in 2015   Comstock is comparing the Chute Zone to the Woodville Bonananza which was mined in the 1870 s  Having a strong management team  shareholder base and positive cash flow to explore the eastern slope of the Virginia Range near Reno  Nevada is very exciting   Comstock Mining has expanded the resource to 2 7 million ounces of gold and close to 27 million ounces of silver  Still  the company believes they are just scratching the surface of the potential in this historic mining district  It is still trading near multi year lows  Current production and positive cash flow could internally fund exploration operations providing less dilution risk to current shareholders  The company has recently stated a near term target of 20k ounces of gold and is looking to expand that over the next few years as additional deposits come online Finding a growing gold and silver producer that could internally fund resource growth  in a mining friendly jurisdiction  with quality management and strong shareholder support  with the potential to make bonanza style discoveries is not easy to find in today s market environment Listen to my recent interview with CEO Corrado DeGasperis from Comstock Mining  LODE   Corrado has over 25 years of manufacturing  mining and capital markets experience  He was the CEO of Barzel Industries and CFO of Graftech International  a global manufacturer of industrial graphite Disclosure  Author and interviewer owns Comstock Mining and the company is a sponsor on my website Below you may find the video ,2013-04-26,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/junior-gold-producers-may-be-safer-than-the-senior-miners-164580,164580

205131,426647,GOLD,Global Silver Mining Trends,opinion,Over the course of silver s secular bull  the miners have steadily increased production in order to meet fast growing demand  And in 2012 mine production exceeded 24k metric tons  770m  ounces   an all time production high and 28  increase over 2001  As an investor interested in silver s structural fundamentals  this rapid growth begs a question  Where in the world is this silver coming from In our modern information age we can ask questions like this and easily find the answer  And we need look no farther than the data provided by the U S  Geological Survey  The USGS is a global authority in collecting  analyzing  and disseminating information on both domestic and international mineral supply and demand  And for silver it dutifully provides annual detailed country level mine production data My preferred way to distill data like this is visually  via crafting a custom chart to paint a clear picture  And in the chart below I plot the bull to date global silver mining trends for the world s top dozen silver producers using the USGS s initial 2012 estimates that were released just this week  With production volume scattered across such a wide spectrum  I indexed each country s output at 100 beginning in 2001  the first year of silver s secular bull   If a country is at 125  its silver mine production is up 25   And inversely if it s at 75  it is down 25   Indexing ultimately allows us to easily compare the production trends of the top producers on a single chart   Also included in this chart is the raw production data of the world s top silver miners  And it is important to note that these 12 countries are responsible for the lion s share of mined supply  their combined total accounting for 90   21 4k mt   Interestingly  12 Canada produces nearly twice as much as the next closest country  In fact  only 5 countries outside the top dozen actually produce greater than 100 mt of silver annually   Starting at the top  you ll notice that silver mine production is dominated by three countries  And Mexico  China  and Peru have long been the three headed monster of the silver market  Back when silver s bull began in 2001 these three countries were the leaders  accounting for about one third of the global mined supply  And as a result of strong growth from each over the last decade  they remain the leaders while accounting for now nearly half of the mined supply   Mexico comfortably sits atop the silver mining world  This country is host to massive silver belts  including the illustrious Sierra Madre belt that flanks the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range  Silver has long been one of Mexico s major exports  dating as far back as the 16th century when the Spanish colonials shipped it back to their homeland via large galleons   It is believed that about one third of all silver mined in the history of the world has come from Mexico  But even with such rich history  this country s silver mineralization is nowhere near depleted  The miners continue to make big discoveries  And these discoveries have great economics as seen by 50   production growth over the last decade   Mexico s prominence is also apparent in its continued attractiveness to the juniors  In my latest round of research focused on junior silver explorers  I found Mexico to be the top destination for these companies  With Mexico s plush geology and friendly mining laws  about half of all silver juniors own a project in Mexico   In the  2 spot we find China  And per the USGS s latest update to 2011 s numbers that increased Chinese production and lowered Peruvian production  it turns out that 2012 was China s second year in a row as runner up to Mexico  This is quite notable  as China had never before cracked the top two  With Mexico and Peru holding the top two spots from 1999 to 2010  this is certainly a big shuffle at the top  China is no longer the third wheel   China s journey to  2 is the result of massive production growth  mainly via byproduct production from primary base metals mines  Over the last 11 years its silver production has doubled  with the addition of 1 9k mt  61m ounces  to its annual output  By volume this growth is unmatched by any other country  And China s silver production is expected to continue to rise  eventually giving Mexico a run for its money   Rounding out the big three is Peru  where most of its silver is found high in the Andes Mountains  And Peru is certainly no slouch considering it had a recent stint as the world s  1 silver producer  edging out Mexico from 2002 to 2009  Silver has long been engrained in Peru s culture  In fact  the ancient Incans were so enthralled by this soft white metal that they referred to it as the  tears of the moon    Peru s production is up 34  since 2001  And though its output has trended down a bit over the last few years  the mining companies have had great success renewing their reserves and making new discoveries  With the world s largest reserve base  120k mt   by far  Peru is highly likely to revisit its 2009 all time production high in the near future   Next up is Australia  And as you can see by its production trend  this country has been quite consistent over the last decade or so  Interestingly over half of Australia s output comes from a single mine  And this massive Cannington mine owned by BHP Billiton ranks as the largest silver and lead mine in the world   Russia has been one of the top performers by percentage growth over the course of silver s bull  And considering this country s huge geographical and geological potential  it sure ought to be among the top producers  Attributing to Russia s nearly 300  bump in production is the restart of the massive Dukat mine and an increase in byproduct output from its large gold mines   The South American country of Bolivia has grown to become a silver powerhouse over the last decade or so  And this is actually quite surprising considering its geopolitical issues over this same span  Large operations like Sumitomo s San Cristobal mine and Coeur d Alene s San Bartolome mine successfully navigated their ways around Bolivia s challenges to account for a big chunk of this country s 200   growth since 2001   Poland is another country where the bulk of its silver comes to market as a byproduct of primary base metals mines  And nearly the entirety of its output comes from three massive copper mines that are owned by KGHM Polska  Poland s flat production from an isolated source is a sign of consistency  yet also a clear display of fruitless exploration and or new development   Chile s silver output has also been fairly consistent over the years  with much of its 16  decline coming just last year  A big chunk of Chile s silver is a byproduct of its large copper and gold mines  however there are a handful of primary silver mines that do make material contributions   Chile has struggled a bit with water  energy  and labor challenges  but these are typical Latin American growing pains that will work themselves out  Looking forward Chile will see a big boost in production in the near future once Barrick Gold finally gets its massive Pascua Lama gold silver mine online   In the  9 spot is the United States  And as you see by its downward trend  the US has experienced quite a fall from silver prominence  Since 2001 US silver output is down an appalling 40   And if you go back to its peak levels in the 1990s  things are even worse with a decline of well over 50    Provocatively prior to the turn of the 21st century silver s big three were Mexico  Peru  and the US  China was not in the picture yet  In fact  as recently as 1997 the US was the world s  2 silver producer  responsible for nearly 14  of the global mined supply that year   It really is amazing that one of the world s top silver producers could tumble in such epic fashion during one of the most powerful bull markets this metal has ever seen  Factoring into this decline is large mine depletion  pinched economics for harder to access ore  regulatory burdens  and a lack of new discovery   Though the US has several historic primary silver districts  the most prolific being in Idaho  Montana  and Colorado   they were the first to shut down during the bear market years of the 1980s and 1990s  And as a result  the majority of the US s silver these days is a byproduct of copper and gold mining  Making matters worse  the US s production of both of these metals is also way down in recent years   In stark contrast from the US  Argentina has seen incredible production growth over the last decade or so  Amazingly in 1998 it ranked as the world s 27th largest silver producer  with output of only 36 mt  It really has come out of nowhere to join the world s elite   Argentina has actually long been known to host robust mineralized systems  Unfortunately as a result of antiquated mining laws it took awhile for the miners to realize the resources held within these systems  Thankfully Argentina s decades long lag behind its Latin American cohorts finally started to burn away following some big reforms in the 1990s  And when the miners finally got on the ground they found a wide range of mineral deposits  including several large ones that were primary silver   Interestingly primary silver deposits are quite rare since this mineral is usually subservient to higher concentrations of accompanying base metals and or gold  Less than a third of global mined silver actually comes from primary silver mines  Argentina is a geological exception though  with well over half its output coming from primary silver mines owned by such companies as Silver Standard  Pan American  and Hochschild   Moving to Kazakhstan we see a material decline in production over the course of silver s bull  Like Poland  the vast majority of Kazakhstan s silver output comes from byproduct base metals production from a single large company  Kazakymys   This massive country has great silver potential  but lacks attractiveness due to its precarious political environment   Rounding out the top 12 is Canada  And like the US  Canada s silver story tells of a fall from greatness  Mining historians will recall the great Cobalt Silver Rush early in the 20th century that made Canada a global silver powerhouse  And even as recently as 2002  the Great White North still held its head high as the world s  5 silver producer   Unfortunately many of the same things that plagued the US also hit Canada hard  And with primary silver mines now all but extinct  the exception being the recently revived Keno Hill camp  coupled with declines in byproduct output  Canada has seen a staggering 60  plunge in silver production   Overall silver s global mining trends are quite revealing in the grand scheme of this metal s structural fundamentals  There have been some great growth stories  and some pretty alarming declines  And as investors the information we get by drilling down into country level dynamics can certainly assist in our trading decisions   Since geographical logistics don t matter much when it comes to investing in the physical metal  the trading I m referring to involves the mining stocks  And believe me  mining companies are very sensitive to where in the world they seek to explore develop produce their silver   One major takeaway we can gather from this information is that total output and or growth rates don t necessarily translate to opportunity for the miners  Some of these countries are host to geopolitical situations that all but block foreign investment  And some are producing silver solely as a byproduct  ultimately lacking geologically favorable primary silver deposits  These situations are not conducive to mining companies looking to directly leverage silver   Another takeaway is that Latin America is definitely a silver hot spot these days  Some of the best growth trends are coming from this part of the world  This observation is further supported by the fact that in 2012 half the production from the top dozen came from Latin American countries  Back in 2001 they were only responsible for 43    One other observation I can add is somewhat counterintuitive to what the trends are showing  But per my recent research looking at the universe of silver juniors  I found there to be a lot of exploration activity in the countries that are the two biggest losers over the course of this bull  Nearly a third of all juniors have a project in the US  with nearly a third also having a project in Canada   While the silver mining industry in these upper North American countries is struggling  they both have a distinct advantage when it comes to exploration  The miners know where the silver is  The US and Canada both hold historic silver mining districts that were shut down due to economics  These districts have plenty of resources remaining  And with higher prices and better technology  the juniors are finding great success in their exploration endeavors  I suspect we ll see a US and Canada silver revival in the coming years that will finally turn around their decade long downward trends   The bottom line is global silver mine production is on the rise  And it is certainly interesting to see where in the world the silver is coming from  Just this week the USGS released its 2012 country level production estimates  and these latest numbers tack onto some fascinating trends over the course of silver s bull   We are seeing a big shuffle at the top with China making a move  And the Latin American countries are continuing to show their force  now collectively responsible for over half of the world s mined silver production  Drilling down on these country level dynamics really helps us to better understand a big component of silver s structural fundamentals  And with this knowledge we are better equipped to invest in this growing sector ,2013-02-03,Scott Wright,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-silver-mining-trends-153585,153585
205132,426648,GOLD,A Promising Future In Precious Metals Mining Markets   But Choose Wisely,opinion,Two industry experts recently shared their views on the precious metals markets and the mining sector  Both believe that there are ample fundamental reasons to support the prediction that we are on the verge of a major move up in the mining sector  especially in the gold and silver markets  and that it s an excellent time to invest but only in certain companies  In a recent phone interview with Rick Rule  founder and chairman of    Mr  Rule laid out his views on the current financial situation and its influence on the gold and silver markets  Involved in the security markets since 1974  Mr  Rule is a specialist in the mining and precious metals markets  INTEREST RATESMr  Rule believes that current interest rates are too low   I don t believe the yields offered in debt markets  including government debt  are anywhere near sufficient to accommodate the risk  particularly when you are looking at absolutely negative real yields   He believes that rates have to move higher  although it might take two or three years for rates to climb    I think higher interest rates are a mixed blessing to the precious metals markets   Mr  Rule said  Rising rates will increase the cost of holding precious metals  but if interest rates rise because they are being pulled by the market  as they were in the 1970s  and are not pulling the market  then  that would be extremely good for precious metals   Mr  Rule sees this as a  Time of transition from older  more sclerotic markets  which I would call less free  places like Western Europe  the United States  and Japan  and frontier and emerging markets that are becoming slightly more free   Mr  Rule finds it ironic that countries that had credit concerns in the 1990s now have the better balance sheets  Such a situation is not because such nations were necessarily better run  but simply because they couldn t access world credit markets to borrow and run up debt  He mentioned Russia  Chile and Indonesia as examples  As a consequence  they are less indebted than the United States and Western Europe  which had access to the credit markets and could borrow  Since these smaller markets are less debt laden  they will probably recover first  However  recovery in these smaller markets is not as important to the global market as recovery in Western Europe or larger markets   But it s very  very  very good for the natural resources space   Rule said over the phone   because as poor people get richer  the type of stuff they spend their money on is made of stuff  As Americans get richer  they buy services  I think the outlook is going to be mixed  but I think it s going to be very good for commodities   Mr  Rule said   I love bear markets  In my experience  I ve learned that what a bear market really is  is a sale   He pointed out that in consumer markets  when people go to buy a car  a can of soda or a sofa  they love things that are on sale  but such is not the case in financial investments   By definition you can t buy goods on sale in a bull market  you have to buy them during a bear market   One sector that is in the midst of a bear market is the mining sector  Mining Stocks  We believe this soft market  in mining stocks  will continue for a reasonably long period of time  certainly at least a year or two years   Mr  Rule said  He argued that some of the better junior mining company stocks have already bottomed out  However  it won t seem like the bottom because so many of the juniors still have so far to fall  He stressed that stock selection is more crucial now in order to achieve profits  than by trying to increase equity by counting on a general market rebound  Picking mining stocks that will lead to a nice return may be harder than it appears  Mr  Rule told me that he estimates that 60  to 70  of the companies that occupy the junior mining space are worthless  He stressed that the excesses from the 2002 2010 bull market  with the exception of 2008 s bear market  need to be worked out of the market  before a bottom is reached  The problem  he said  is that  Good companies and bad companies rose in the bull market  Both have fallen in the bear market  Success depends on being able to differentiate between the good and the bad   But in a bear market  can even a good company prosper in mining  Last year  a down year  Mr  Rule said  when mining companies executed and showed deposits or exciting information  the market responded well  He mentioned Africa Gold Group  which went from 80 cents to 10 dollars and Goldquest  which went from 6 cents to 2 dollars as examples   This is not a market that won t reward success   Mr  Rule stressed the difference between picking a good stock with potential versus counting on a broad  market rise   I think investors who are looking for a rise in the overall market are going to be disappointed for the next year or two   Mr  Rule said   Speculators who are willing to do the work  the qualitative work  to differentiate between the good and the bad  the good goods are on sale   How to Pick a Small Mining Company To pick a small mining company stock  Mr  Rule said that he would look at the preliminary economic assessment in the pre feasibility stage of a developmental junior that could be the subject of a takeover by a mid size or major company in the future   Such companies are selling at the greatest discount to the net asset values that I ve seen in my career   Mr  Rule said  He suggested looking for companies with higher grade  low capital intensity and higher rates of return  which should do well in the next 18 months  He stressed   When you see some of them start to go  there s going to be a real feeding frenzy   He also sees mergers and consolidation in the future  Middle and large tier companies have spent maybe two thirds of their market cap just maintaining their production  he said  Mr  Rule sees maybe 15 or 20 financially accretive transactions possible  instead of mergers and consolidation merely to increase production  He said there are about 80 companies worldwide that produce less than 200 000 ounces of metals a year  most of which are ripe for consolidation  In terms of management teams  he stressed the need for a team s skill set to be specific to their type of company  type of mine  geographic area  scale  etc  A management team with experience and success operating a gold mine in Northern Quebec is probably going to have trouble making a success of an open pit tin mine in Chile  Small Companies  Big Futures  One company that exemplifies Mr  Rule s emphasis on smaller companies with little or no debt  relatively small capital requirements  high grade resources in the ground  and experienced management teams with expertise in their specific area  is Bullfrog Gold Corp   Bullfrog Gold Corp  is a mining company with little or no debt  excellent prospects for gold in the ground  and an experienced management team  Bullfrog Gold Corp   BFGC  is a new  2011  US based gold and silver exploration company with a development project in a region of Arizona with a long history of proven gold production  The region within 25 miles of the project has produced 1 2 million ounces of gold and 1 million ounces of silver     We ve got three solid assets  We ve also got our ear to the ground and are looking for additional opportunities  We ve got the management  so we ve got all the ingredients to build a mining company  I think we ve got a long way to run in terms of market share appreciation and market cap   The Gold is There  The Price is Right  was significantly developed in the early 1990s  but was abandoned by the previous owner when gold prices languished below  400 per ounce  production was not cost effective  Now with gold above  1 600  the project shows great promise with a shallow mineral inventory of 235 000 ounces of gold and 3 4 million ounces of silver   These figures do not include wide spaced drilling along the strike  which could significantly expand those numbers  Even more promising  there are potential high grade feeder targets at depth and the company is planning to test drill other mineralized structures that have been discovered on the surrounding land   The new drilling is planned to be completed by April 2013  when the company will update its estimate of its mineral resources  which should lead to a jump in the firm s value     The Newsboy Project is 45 miles northwest of Phoenix with good infrastructure available  making it less costly to extract the gold  The project encompasses 90 federal lode claims  12 placer claims and three state exploration permits   The company just completed drilling five holes with what Beling called   Good drill results   They will now drill more holes and explore new areas  Based on studies done 20 years ago by a previous owner  the company has a large data base already  which shows great promise  A Promising Exploration Project in a Gold Rich Region Even with just the Newsboy project  Bullfrog would be a promising gold company as an investment opportunity  but the firm also has an exploration project adjacent to a major producing mine   is in a district that has produced 3 4 million ounces of gold  Next door to the Bullfrog Project  Barrick Gold Corporation s  ABX  Montgomery Shoshone open pit mine has extracted 220 000 ounces of gold  while the underground mine  which closed in 1911  produced about 94 000 ounces of gold  In the 1980s and 1990s  Barrick Gold and its predecessors also extracted about 3 million ounces of gold from two open pit mines in the area  Just 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas  the Bullfrog project is close to infrastructure to ease the cost of extraction and encompasses 79 claims and 2 patented properties  An Experienced  Proven Leadership Team Besides gold in the ground in two promising projects  Colorado based Bullfrog is led by experienced executive and technical teams  which have proven track records acquiring  discovering and operating gold mines in the United States  Alan Lindsay  Chairman of the Board  has founded mining companies before  and David Beling  President  CEO and Director  has almost 50 years of experience in the precious metal  base metal and energy mineral sectors  Beling has been involved with 84 underground mines  127 open pits and 163 mineral processing plants  Besides being a professional mining engineer  he has been a director and senior executive with nine junior mining companies  He knows the mining business from mine to executive suite  The Time is Now Bullfrog Corp  is just two years old and with the Newsboy project moving rapidly toward production and a promising future for the Bullfrog project  it is an excellent time to invest  With fewer than 35 million shares issued and outstanding  the upside potential for this stock is significant  In February of last year  the stock traded as high as  80  but is now sitting around  45  Volume is gradually increasing from a few thousand shares traded in its first year to more than 100 000 changing hands in a given day last month  With two great projects  an experienced leadership team and the price of gold sitting where it is with little to no sign of a significant decline in the near future  Bullfrog is poised to break out   Bullfrog also owns a third project  called Klondike in central Nevada  The company believes it has the potential for shallow  high grade silver  In a district first mined in the 1870s  the project is at the early exploration stage  The project encompasses 232 claims with relatively high grade silver within 30 and 50 feet of the surface  Between the three projects  Bullfrog  Newsboy and Klondike  Mr  Beling said   We have three solid prospects for our company  and we want to get all three of our horses running  Newsboy is off and running  In December we got a  4 2 million debt authority from a subsidiary of Rand Merchant Bank  which is a strong endorsement of the assets   Listen to the interview here   A Fine Time to Enter the Mining Markets But Choose Wisely With two industry experts in agreement  it seems like an excellent time to enter the precious metals market  In terms of mining stocks  picking strong firms with low debt  gold in the ground  and experienced management teams may require the help of a specialized advisor to pick the right stock that will rise and be bought by a larger mining company for a nice return on investment instead of languishing at the bottom of the market ,2013-02-12,Patrick MontesDeOca,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-promising-future-in-precious-metals-mining-markets-–-but-choose-wisely-154942,154942

205137,426653,GOLD,Gold Carpet Treatment Promised For Miners In The Dominican Republic,opinion,The Gold Report caught up with Alexander Medina  the newly appointed director of mining for the Dominican Republic  With gold discoveries popping up all over Hispaniola the country shares the metal rich island with Haiti Medina is a very busy government minister  But he was happy to spare a little time to talk to The Gold Report about what his office is doing to ensure that mining companies get the gold carpet treatment under the new administration  The Gold Report  What is the main job of the director of mining management  Alexander Medina  I oversee all the mining policies of the Dominican Republic  And I am in charge of granting mining permits and licenses to explore for precious and base metals and minerals  TGR  What experience do you bring to this job  AM  I have worked in mining operations  mineral processing and management for 35 years  As a chemical engineer  my background is in precious minerals and metals  I worked in the nickel business here in the Dominican Republic  first with Falconbridge then Xstrata Plc  XTA LSE  when it took over Falconbridge  TGR  Does the new administration of the Dominican Republic support responsible exploration and mining development  AM  Investors and explorers in the Dominican Republic have the full support of the Dominican government  Actually  we are currently improving our processing methods in order to speed up the permitting of mining ventures  I am intent that exploration permits be granted within a few months of application  instead of a couple of years  as has often been the case  unfortunately  TGR  Will it be easier for junior mining companies to get permits to conduct exploration and then to open up mining operations  AM  It will be easier for exploration permits  The new president of our country  Danilo Medina  has instructed my office to speed up the permitting process for exploration  But licensing a mine for production can be much more complicated than exploring for resources  An environmental permit is required for going onto production  and that can take some time  There are many complex issues involved in making sure that the mines are environmentally safe and sound  TGR  Can you briefly explain the permitting process  and what a firm has to do to be permitted to explore for metals and minerals  AM  According to Dominican law  all foreign companies must have a local representative  an arrangement with a local company  And that local company can take charge of meeting with mining officials and submit a request for mining exploration license  providing the information necessary to obtain a permit from the government  We go over all of the data presented before determining if the project is a fit  Under Mining Law 146  the terms of the formal arrangement between the foreign company and the local company must be legally registered with our office  because the venture is subject to taxation  In order to get the concession  the principals in the venture must declare what kind of minerals and metals they are searching for  They must describe in detail the geological features of the geographical area that they wish to explore  That s about it  TGR  It is estimated that the Dominican Republic has  58 billion  B  in metal and mineral reserves  Can you talk about what firms are leading the way to develop this resource  AM  The largest mining operation in the country today is Barrick Gold Corp  s  ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  Pueblo Viejo deposit  It s an investment of  4B  It s a world class deposit containing more than 24 million ounces  Moz  gold  It s a polymetallic deposit  Pueblo Viejo includes gold  silver  zinc and copper  All of these metals are going to be recovered in the life span of the mine  In addition to the proven reserves  it has now been inferred that there is another 10 Moz gold in the Pueblo Viejo deposit  which needs to be confirmed  That means that the operational life span of the mine could easily increase from 25 to 35 years  The second largest operation is Xstrata s nickel property  It s a 40 year old mine  It can produce 30 000 tons of ferronickel  It may be old  but it still has enough in proven reserves to operate for 20 years or more  The third largest property is Perilya Ltd  s  PEM ASX  Cerro de Maim n mine  This operation has 10 years of reserves and produces copper  gold and silver  The fourth largest property is PanTerra Gold Ltd  s  PGI ASX  Las Lagunas mine  This operation recovers gold by processing tailings  It will take about seven years to recover 75 000 ounces of gold and 0 5 Moz of silver  There is also a very promising exploration project run by GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC TSX V   That is the Romero project in the southwest of the country in San Juan Province  Unigold Inc   UGD TSX V  has a very promising exploration project too  located in the northwest of the country  And Everton Resources  EVR TSX V  ERV FSE  EVRRF OTCQX  is doing successful exploration in an area close to the Pueblo Viejo mine  In addition to these metal mining ventures  the Dominican Republic has an excellent deposit of bauxite  This mineral can be exported to China or the United States  dependent upon market prices and the terms of the sales contract  TGR  Do these mining firms have all of the permits that they need  AM  They already have all the permits and licenses that they need for exploration  TGR  What happens when they are ready to go into production  AM  My office will support them to get any permit they need in order to advance their projects  An application for an exploitation license should be submitted  including a feasibility study proving economics and feasible and proven operations for the proposed project  TGR  Are there environmental issues  Some local groups are objecting to problems that occurred with Barrick s operation at Pueblo Viejo  How are you dealing with those issues  AM  All of the environmental issues at the Pueblo Viejo deposit have been addressed by the new operation  The operation is now on the right path  TGR  What is the difference between the previous administration and the new administration regarding mining  AM  The largest difference is the interest that the new president has in providing full support to investors  We wish to have a transparent permitting and licensing process so that foreign firms and their local partners receive all the help and cooperation from the mining department that they need  TGR  Are there any new rules and regulations for mining waiting in the wings  AM  There are no new regulations up to now  just a clear attitude to help investors  TGR  Given some of the historical problems with natural and manmade mining disasters  why should foreign investors feel safe putting their money into firms working in your country  AM  First of all  the Dominican Republic is a very quiet and peaceful country  It is very well organized politically and economically  It has proven time and again that it s a safe place to invest  The Dominican government is very conscientious about protecting foreign investments  We will provide full support to any investor putting capital into the mining sector  or tourism or any other economic area  TGR  Does the government take a cut of the mining proceeds  AM  We partner with mining firms when the deposits are government owned  But there is no interest from the Dominican government to partner with investment in the private mining sector  We believe in free enterprise and we have mining laws

205146,426662,GOLD,Charles Gibson Unearths Hidden Mining Gems In Africa,opinion,Charles Gibson  from his vantage point in London  has a unique view of mining companies in Africa  Gibson is the head of mining for Edison Investment Research  which writes unbundled investment research on a range of companies from its offices across Europe  New Zealand and Australia  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Gibson talks about some hidden mining gems in Africa  The Gold Report  We have a scenario where the price of gold has held up and is trading at about  1 775 ounce  oz   but the share prices of large caps aren t comparable  What is the reason behind that  Charles Gibson  Typically  large companies are valued in relation to their margin  the difference between the price they sell gold and the cost at which they mine it  There was a period of margin expansion from about 2009 to 2011 where  by and large  the share prices of big producers did very well  The gold price was rising and costs were under control  In late 2011  however  this dynamic reversed and the gold price started to tail off at the same time as costs began to pick up  Then there was a period of margin contraction  That s what s caused the share prices of the majors to fall  TGR  Would you factor in the general malaise in the stock market  CG  Commodities can dance to a very different tune than the broader economy as a whole and the broader stock market  There s been margin expansion and margin contraction  It won t go on forever  There is a very close correlation between revenue per ton and costs per ton for mining companies and there are lots of different ways to explain that  But if the commodity price moves  the likelihood is that the cost base will move at some point  That works both downward as well as upward  Commodity price and cost base don t work exactly in time with each other  but by and large the broad direction is similar  That tends to temper the upside  but it also saves a little bit on the downside as well  TGR  Given the unremarkable performance in some of the large caps  should investors be looking at small to mid caps for value and growth  CG  It s not a question of being small  mid or large cap necessarily  The key question for investors at the moment is  Which companies have costs under control  Perhaps that is due to the jurisdiction they re in or because of a particular cost basis  If companies have access to hydroelectric power  for example  that often acts as a buffer against rising prices  When costs are under control  margins are under control and companies can benefit from rising commodity prices  TGR  What s your view on precious metals prices going forward  CG  There s a very strong correlation since 1959 between the U S  monetary base and the price of gold for fundamental reasons  After the first two rounds of quantitative easing  QE   the implied gold price from that correlation was  1 350 oz  That s where we were until about a fortnight ago when Ben Bernanke announced QE3  which at the moment is open ended  Our long term gold price of  1 657 oz goes through 2013  If QE3 continues to 2014  you re looking at  1 887 oz and by 2015 it s more than  2 000 oz  I stress that this is not a day to day trading price  It is the fundamental long term price  To paraphrase John Maynard Keynes   Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent   TGR  It ll be interesting to see what happens in November with relation to QE3  Let s talk about some names that you re following in Africa  CG  Pan African Resources Plc  PAF AIM  PAN JSE  is a stock worth looking at with an asset in Barberton  South Africa  However  this is greenstone gold not conventional South African Witwatersrand gold in this case  with a 10 year life  It has had a 10 year life for the last 100 years  roughly speaking  It s a very tight little management structure  It produces about 100 000 oz  100 Koz  every year and has done that for as long as anyone can remember  Pan African announced its full year results last week showing earnings nearly doubling compared to the prior year and more than doubling compared to the half year stage  That is strongly suggestive of a cost base that is well under control  It also just made a major acquisition of Evander Gold Mines Ltd   which it is buying from Harmony Gold Mining Co   HMY NYSE   this time in the Witwatersrand Basin  Pan African s management has good prior knowledge of operations of Evander  A lot of the board has worked there  Pan African has been able to buy it at a low price  It will be very accretive  The mining plan indicates that it could double Pan African s earnings in the short term  TGR  I m looking at Pan African s stock chart right now  It s trading near its 52 week high  There aren t many North American based gold producers that could say that  CG  Pan African s share price is a testament to the tightness of the management structure and the fact that the company has been able to deliver on its promises half year in  half year out  It has supportive shareholders  There are few substitutes for a good track record in mining circles and Pan African has a very good track record  I d like to talk about Aurizon Mines Ltd   ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE MKT   too  Casa Berardi on the Cadillac Fault in Qu bec is the major asset  Its management has an exceptional track record of delivery  It has roughly 160 Koz year of production and  with very few exceptions  it hits that  It usually hits its quarterly guidance as well  There are also relatively few shocks on the cost side  Costs have suffered recently as the mine has moved to lower levels  The costs per ton are moving up  but that s really a one off effect  Even after that  it s still producing gold at about  640 oz  At the moment Casa Berardi has a mine life to 2020  but it s looking to expand that  In particular  there have been some remarkable intersections made by underground exploration drilling at Zone 123  If confirmed and continuous  it may be that not only will Casa Berardi s underground mine life be extended  but it may turn out to be one of those Canadian mines where the grade gets higher as you get deeper  Also  because this zone is off the main Cadillac break  it will require less ground support and therefore the additional costs of being further from the shaft will be offset both by higher grades and lower costs  TGR  The gift that keeps on giving  It also has exploration potential beyond Berardi with Joanna and other assets  CG  Joanna is split into the Hosco and Heva sectors  Hosco has a prefeasibility study that came out all right  It is refractory ore  which means there were a lot of additional capital expenditures related to autoclaves etc  Management stuck it on the backburner  The area is very prospective  but it s clear that the mineralization changes to non refractory moving west  which means that it should be much less costly to develop  It pleases me the way that management tackled this  Rather than chasing that very obvious goal of getting Joanna into production  the company said   Let s just wait a minute  Let s see if we can improve this   It went from a feasibility study back to exploration  But now there is the potential for a much bigger dividend at the end than might otherwise have been the case  TGR  David Hall is not the chief executive officer  CEO  anymore  but he s probably the man behind a lot of those decisions  CG  The new CEO is George Paspalas  who is an Australian with a very long pedigree in underground mining  He managed the South Deep extension of the Western Areas gold mine in South Africa for Placer Dome  now Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE    He s also a chemical engineer with extremely good experience with refractory ore so  in short  he knows about the two things that he really needs to know about at Aurizon  TGR  I m interested in hearing a little bit about Cluff Gold Plc  CFG TSX  CFG LSE   I just met the management group of this company at the Denver Gold Forum  They seem very keen to introduce this company in a more proactive way to the market  CG  Cluff Gold has also literally just changed its name to Amara Mining  That aside  its assets  which are in Sierra Leone  Burkina Faso  and C te d Ivoire  run the gamut from exploration to production  The Burkina Faso asset is Kalsaka  which is a nice  relatively small scale mining operation that produces about 70 Koz year at about  900 oz  It is providing the cash flow and the profitability to fund the rest of the company s operations  The flagship asset is Baomahun in Sierra Leone  I m expecting a resource upgrade to be announced this quarter followed by a full feasibility study  It will have 130 Koz or more of production from 2015 onward  Its exploration asset is Yaoure in C te d Ivoire  Now  this is an interesting asset in that it has been mined in the past  It has been known to be very prospective  Cluff has done a lot of drilling there  Our best estimate of the resource is roughly 2 Moz  It could turn out to a very significant asset indeed  Kalsaka generates the money and some of that is used in exploration in Baomahun and Yaoure  Cluff assumed until recently that it would need an equity raising to fund the capital expenditures of Baomahun  However  management has recently said that  given where its equity price is  it s not happy with the level of dilution  The company is looking at non traditional forms of finance  Reading between the lines  what we re probably looking at is some sort of debt instrument with a coupon that s connected to the gold price  That route is a much more efficient way of funding as far as existing equity shareholders are concerned  I think that s part of the reason that the share price has performed very well over the last couple of months  Nonetheless  it is not valued at much more than the implied value of Baomahun  Investors are getting Kalsaka and Yaoure for free  And the company is already generating profits and cash flow  TGR  It s interesting  Its small producing mine is funding the exploration  Sega  Cluff s add on acquisition to Kalsaka  should have a preliminary economic assessment soon and then there is the blue sky of Yaoure  Cluff announced a strategic alliance with Samsung  Tell me about that  CG  It is part of its non traditional funding  Samsung made a  20M credit facility available to Cluff  That is more than enough for the company in the short to medium term  It is looking in the longer term toward a cornerstone funding arrangement to bring the Baomahun project into production  TGR  I have not seen any mining company entering into an agreement with Samsung  Are we talking about the same Samsung that is the electronics manufacturer  CG  It is  This is an example of the increasing scenario where dollars are held in Asia and they re looking for a home  One of the very obvious places to invest  if you re long dollars  is in gold  In this particular instance  you re merely looking at the first derivative of that investment strategy  i e   gold equities  It s not wholly unknown though for Asian industrial companies to get involved in mining  The one that leaps to my mind is Mitsubishi  TGR  We re also seeing a lot of that in the minor metals and specialty metals space right now  too  CG  I think that  in general  those investments are aimed toward a guaranteed offtake they have an industrial logic whereas I suspect that the Cluff deal is more of a pure investment  TGR  Cluff seems like a very ripe cherry for a company that would want an African asset  CG  It s difficult to comment about where mergers and acquisition activity will fall  I think it s true to say that there is a keen focus on West Africa and there is an assumption in the market that there are more mergers and acquisitions to come in that particular part of the world  TGR  What can you tell me about Mwana Africa Plc  MWA LSE   CG  Mwana is an interesting company to talk about because its assets are located in such an interesting part of the world Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC   It has a very nice little gold mining operation  Freda Rebecca  which produces about 70 Koz year for about  850 oz  People hear Zimbabwe and think it sounds like a difficult place to operate  Historically  it has been  But I visited the mine recently and it is operating in good order  The plant is pretty rugged  There are no concessions made to luxury at all but in its own way it does work very well  It s an amazing ore body  The mine has been open pitted in the past  but now it s moving underground  If you go underground  the size of the voids  because of the competence of the rock  is absolutely unbelievable  The voids are easily the size of a church  It is the perfect engineer s mine  Freda Rebecca is funding Mwana  It has a majority interest in another complex  Bindura Nickel Corp   BNC ZSE   a bulk massive nickel sulfide ore body  It has been on care and maintenance for several years  Mwana just got an agreement with creditors to raise money via a rights issue in order to restart the operation  Bindura Nickel is underground  Various assets actually have been open pitted in the past and could be open pitted again in the future  There are not many assets like this in the world when the rest of the world is shifting from nickel sulfides to nickel laterites  And the entire infrastructure is sitting there in very good order  The first part of the restart is to get the Trojan underground mine into operation and to produce a concentrate  In due course  with material from other assets and potentially third party material as well  the idea will be to smelt and refine the concentrate to a pure nickel product  Bindura Nickel has a history going back to the 1950s when it was developed by Anglo American Plc  AAL LON   It ran very solidly and profitably for most of its existence  It s an exciting time for Mwana  TGR  I noticed that it had a fairly dramatic jump in its share price this month  What was that about  CG  That was the closure of the Bindura rights issue  When the announcement came out that an agreement had been reached  the money had been raised and that it was closed  it moved Bindura from an asset that is on care and maintenance and costing the best part of  1M a month currently  to one that should instead be cash flow positive situation within the space of a couple of years  TGR  Mwana is a multi commodity company  What else is it mining  CG  It has two other major assets in the DRC one copper and one gold  The first is Zani Kodo in northeast DRC  It is an exploration asset with about 2 million ounces  Moz  gold proved up  It s located between AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  s  AU NYSE  Mongbwalu and Randgold Resources Ltd  s  GOLD NASDAQ  Kibali prospects  It s probably some of the easiest exploration that I ve ever seen  The company expects to be able to increase its resource by 50  a year for the next couple of years  At that point  it will be a very significant resource on a global scale  The other asset is SEMHKAT in the DRC s copper belt  It is a vast area that has shown indications of copper mineralization  However  it is almost an asset too far for Mwana  It gets the least attention  At any other company  it would have probably been a lead asset  but in Mwana it has had to queue up behind Freda Rebecca  Bindura Nickel and Zani Kodo for attention  The company has done a couple of joint ventures at SEMHKAT  It has an original joint venture with Anglo American and a joint venture with Chinese company Zhejiang Hailiang Co  Ltd   which it announced in August  Hailiang will put about  25 40M into the ground and take a majority interest  Mwana will be left with a non dilutable 38  interest  As a result  SEMHKAT has moved from an asset that was very difficult to value because it was just prospectivity in the ground  to suddenly an asset that can be valued in pounds  shillings and pence  TGR  It certainly has a lot for only having a  100M market cap  I m blown away at the possibilities there  CG  This management team has a track record of working in these sorts of jurisdictions  Look at Freda Rebecca in Zimbabwe  where the company got a mine it rehabilitated back into profitable production with 70 Koz year  TGR  Now they re doing it again  CG  That s the idea  A track record like that is worth a lot  TGR  Let s leave Africa and talk about Minera IRL Ltd   IRL TSX  MIRL LSE  MIRL BVL   CG  While developing and operating a mine in Argentina does currently present some challenges  the Don Nicolas project is in a very mine friendly province and Minera is halfway through the permitting process  The company also appears to have the support of local communities by recently signing a 10 year surface rights agreement  I don t believe there will be nationalization of junior mining companies in Argentina  The government needs foreign investment and is probably not interested in owning and operating mines  More likely  they will do what governments do best and simply take its cut in the form of taxes and royalties  As for Minera as an investment vehicle  the company has an excellent management team with a proven track record and some fantastic assets within mine friendly locations  TGR  Do you have any wisdom for investors on how to navigate the precious metal equity space  CG  With commodities  you always have a choice in which commodity you re going to invest  It s worth being aware of the macroeconomic qualities and profile that those commodities have  There is a spectrum  If you looked in the  90s  someone would probably think that all commodities dance to the same tune  We re not in that macroeconomic environment at the moment  The environment we re in at the moment is one of stagflation  where the economy is struggling to grow and where there are question marks over the value of paper currency  I would strongly recommend that investors be weighted toward the precious end of that spectrum at the current time  The other thing is to spread risk  particularly with the juniors  Be aware of the risk profile of companies  there s no substitute for research and don t buy just two or three stocks  That s fine if you re investing in the majors  but you need to diversify more than that if you re speculating in the junior space  TGR  Well  Charlie  thank you so much  We certainly gleaned a lot of intelligence   is the head of mining for Edison Investment

205155,426671,GOLD,Bring Home Profits From Nevada  David Sidders,opinion,Investors do not need to travel the world to make money in gold mining stocks  Nevada has world class geology  infrastructure and a mine friendly legal system without the substantial risks of international resource development  In this exclusive Gold Report interview  David Sidders  founder of Xeitel Capital Management  discusses how to keep investments simple by staying close to home  The Gold Report  What is your overall strategy for gold related investments at this time  David Sidders  As with any sector in the market right now  everybody is a bit cautious  There s risk in everything and around every corner  We have problems in Europe  We have problems in the U S  Investors are pulling in the reins  and money is tight  In this environment  I strongly prefer domestic operations in well known  proven  mining friendly jurisdictions  I don t need the additional political risk from overseas investing  The strategy is simple stick with domestics  If you want something exotic  go order a Mai Tai at the bar  Investors aren t compensated for the risks involved in exotic mining investments at this time  Investors have been chasing rainbows in Africa and windmills in South America and lots of other fantasies when they could be focusing on domestic projects that are crushing rock  pouring dore and making profits in Nevada  TGR  Do you have a preference between exploration development and production  DS  I like two scenarios here  I like smaller companies that are defining an ore body and building reserves  I also like producers that are increasing production and containing costs  Clearly  the companies that are looking to build mines they already have this magnificent resource and now they need to come up with financing are finding that the input costs and the capital expeditures  capex  are exploding  Even the majors are seeing cost pressure  some pretty big majors have dropped out of large capex projects  When you read Barrick Gold Corp  s  ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  financial statements  it is clear that costs are escalating  One strategy to deal with cost escalation is for the major to re examine existing operations and see how it can run them better  perhaps on a smaller scale while adding to reserves  Another strategy would be to buy new blue sky opportunities in proven jurisdictions  Not far off places like Ecuador or Mauritania  but somewhere closer to home  somewhere the company may have nearby operations  TGR  That brings us to Nevada  which you like  but Nevada is already a huge gold producer  Most of the majors are there and have been there for over 20 years  producing a lot of gold  Has all the low hanging fruit already been picked  Could there be that much exploration upside  DS  In Nevada  something like 24 metal mines and 24 industrial mines currently are in operation  So that s four dozen mines  and all the majors are there companies like Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE  and Barrick Gold  There are more holes in Nevada than there are on a dartboard  That is not bad it indicates that the ground is good  Many of those holes were drilled long ago  the technology has improved and gold prices are higher  Today s industry is different from 15 years ago  What is new in Nevada  One example of an area that is getting a second look is the Bullfrog Mining District  where Barrick produced 2 3 million ounces  Moz  during the 1990s  We re seeing some juniors working there now  One of the juniors    has a resource of greater than 1 Moz Indicated and Inferred in the Bullfrog Hills  It s about a half dozen miles from the old Barrick open pit mine  There is still exploration opportunity because the technology and the economics have improved dramatically since Barrick first mined the area  The improvements are in addition to the well known advantages that Nevada already has low cost surface mining  ores that can be processed by chemical leaching and a favorable legal and tax system  There is a reason that Nevada produces 80 85  of all the gold in the U S  TGR  The Nevada gold fields are concentrated in several trends  Battle Mountain Trend  Getchell Trend  Walker Trend and so on  The Bullfrog district is in the latter  Is it possible that some of these trends are relatively underexplored  DS  I think so  Barrick closed down its operation at Bullfrog in 1999  If it would have stayed in production  it could have done a little more exploration  but the gold price was much lower  The economics have completely changed since then  The capex of new mines in this area is low  For example  Corvus expects to spend around  70 million in capex on its North Bullfrog project  That is a bargain compared to other projects in far flung jurisdictions  TGR  Nevada is a good jurisdiction for your investment model  Are there any other companies that you are watching  DS  Another company that I like is Bullfrog Gold Corp   BFGC OTCBB   The company has three projects  its prime Nevada project is adjacent to Barrick s former surface mines  Bullfrog s second project  Newsboy  is in Arizona  That state is another jurisdiction that is extremely friendly for mining and has excellent infrastructure  Bullfrog completed two drill programs at Newsboy during the past eight months  The historical mineral resource was a few hundred thousand ounces  Koz   Bullfrog has confirmed much of the old drilling and intersected a higher grade zone in the basement rocks  The geologic potential appears to be approximately 800 900 Koz  Bullfrog also acquired a third project in Nevada that has strong potential for silver with base metal credits  Bullfrog s projects are located in areas that offer low political risk  straightforward permitting  good metallurgy  with a good local workforce that will get the job done  The management team is led by a mining engineer and has built many mines  It will be interesting to watch for the drill results from the second drill program recently completed at Newsboy as well as a third program scheduled later this year  Over the next months  Corvus and Bullfrog will be generating lots of excitement in the Bullfrog Hills area  It could become an area play  Maybe we ll see a staking rush  If so  that would be exciting  TGR  What is your exit strategy for these types of investments  Could it be M A or mine building  DS  Mine building can be expensive  but it is one option  A faster  and probably better  exit strategy is to sell to a major that is already operating in the area and needs to replace reserves  The goal of the junior is to create value by proving up a great ore body and selling it to a major at a revalued price  TGR  Are there other domestic or North American areas that you re interested in  DS  I like Canada  and specifically Timmins  Everybody likes Timmins  It s another jurisdiction with a 100 year history  In Timmins  I like a company called Brigus Gold Corp   BRD TSX  BRD NYSE A   All of the majors are up in Timmins  Goldcorp  Rio Tinto  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX   Xstrata Plc  XTA LSE  and a whole string of juniors  Brigus is producing  I think this year it s on target to do 85 Koz and is projecting over 100 Koz next year  This is a situation where you have a company that s already built the mine  Brigus is working on cost containment and increasing production  There may be a role for a major to play by coming in and taking production to the next level using its expertise and economy of scale  And there s your exit strategy  To summarize  I like the blue sky opportunities where we re drilling to prove up a resource for a smaller producer  At the same time  if the efficiency can be improved  a major might become interested and ideally become a bidder  TGR  Another district with a long domestic history is the Carolina gold belt  The most advanced project there is the Haile mine for Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX   Is that one that you follow as well  DS  The Haile mine was  I believe  used to finance the Civil War  That s a project where the company has gone into a historic district  used the data  drilled it out  twinned it and now has expanded the resource base  We did well with Romarco on the run up as it proved the resource  Lately  it has unfortunately run into some permitting problems because part of the proposed mine is on wetlands  Romarco is dealing with the Army Corps of Engineers to find a solution  Once those issues are resolved  Romarco has to raise the funds to build the mine  The Romarco story was terrific  It ran to  2 share  and then it ran into these problems  All the majors  everybody  can be subjected to the difficulties of trying to get a mine off the ground  to raise the money and to get it going  That s when it s really difficult  TGR  Is there money out there to finance permitted mines with a defined resource  DS  Sure there is  That money will come from the majors who want it  Once reserves have been defined  they have lots of cash  If the majors are passing on big projects  they still need to replace their reserves  If a major passes on advancing a Donlin Creek sized project  that s a lot of money that can be reallocated to something that s already running or a resource that s a little closer and a little simpler to bring to fruition  TGR  Are there any other specific regions  jurisdictions or companies you want to talk about  DS  Those are my three favorites right now  I love Corvus  I love Bullfrog because of the two projects it has and the exploration upside near Barrick s former mines  And I love Brigus because of its potential efficiency improvements  additional production and because it is a takeover target  All three of those companies are operating in these terrific mining friendly jurisdictions where there s no political risk they re almost lay ups  TGR  Over the past couple of years  there have been a lot of investors who thought they had lay ups  But the junior sector moved sideways or down  How do you deal with the investing psychology in the junior sector when the stocks trend sideways or down for what seems like forever  DS  You have to remember  last year things got very low  and they bounced  The conditions are  again  where we re getting oversold here  People are nervous and people are throwing out value  and they re doing it almost irrationally and for comfort  But at some point  we ll start to see a little M A  We ve already seen some companies try to merge with one another to keep things going  We ve seen some acquisitions  and I think that will increase as we go into the fall  Once the risk appetite returns  we re going to definitely see first these domestic companies take off and then  later on  the companies operating in far flung jurisdictions should get a bid as well  Prices are getting so cheap  Hecla Mining Co   HL NYSE  the other day made a bid for U S  Silver Corp   USA TSX V  USSIF OTCQX   It just said  hey  what the hell  It s next door and cheap here is the cash  TGR  It feels as if we re in a holding pattern macroeconomically as well as in the sector  It could be the summer doldrums  Maybe things will get a little bit more exciting in the fall  DS  There s an election coming up  There are problems with Europe  If there is a convincing victory in the election in the U S   money is going to come back into the market  Equities are cheap  and these gold equities are cheap  They re trading for  35 40 ounce in the ground  At some point  everything becomes so cheap that they become acquisition targets  TGR  Do you have any closing thoughts  DS  Keep it simple  Just keep it simple for the next little while  Stay domestic  Avoid unnecessary risk  You don t need Nigeria or New

205160,426676,GOLD,Where s The Beef For Gold Equities ,opinion,Gold bulls have plenty of room to graze in the stockyard these days as the investing herd migrated to other assets during the market s steep climb in 2012  For the fourth time in the past year  gold bears outnumbered the bulls in Bloomberg s weekly Gold Bull Bear Sentiment Survey  In fact  the bears had the bulls outnumbered by almost 2 to 1  Today s growing sloth of gold bears is a  buy  signal for contrarian investors like us at U S  Global  Research from the gold team at Canaccord Genuity found that gold rallied about 10 percent on average during the month following each of these sentiment  cross overs   This historical increase means that gold could potentially rally to the  high  1 700 s per ounce   which Canaccord believes  would breathe some new life into the gold equities   After a year of neglect from investors who favored bullion  gold equities need resuscitation  Going back to April of last year  gold stocks have been undervalued compared to bullion  I discussed this disconnect back in June 2011    and again in August     This trend has been accelerating recently  At the end of March  the spread between the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index and gold bullion was at the same extreme level it was during the 2008 credit crisis despite a much rosier global economic outlook  Going back the full decade of gold s bull run  this is quite a rare event  It hasn t been a complete drought for gold equity investors though  as there have been occasional spurts of relief over the past year  From the beginning of 2011 through the middle of the year  the S P TSX Global Gold Index declined by 14 percent  The index then quickly reversed course upward during the market s volatile period last fall  Now  the index has been declining for four months now  dropping 28 percent  while gold bullion has only fallen 9 percent over that same time period  says Canaccord    Believe it or not  the four month selloff is a bullish sign for gold stocks  If you expand your time horizon  you ll see each dip has been a turning point for gold stocks  Canaccord says that   sector weakness  less than one year  in the gold equities over the last six years has typically ended with  V  shaped corrections to the upside   Gold investors must be quick to  buy on the dips  since these sharp V shaped corrections have been frequent  The Stampede to Buy Undervalued Gold Miners If you plan on shopping for bargains in the gold miner department  you re going to have to fight a crowd  Numerous global investors have been pounding the table for gold stocks  including Dr  Marc Faber who said  gold shares have become extremely oversold and could rebound in the next few days  in his April market commentary and Global Portfolio Strategist Don Coxe  who reiterated that gold equities are undervalued compared to the precious metal on his weekly conference call last Friday Another big buyer has been the miners themselves  Mergers and acquisitions in the mining sector have been at an all time high over the past two years  Large gold miners such as Barrick  Goldcorp and Kinross have been taking advantage of these cheap valuations by snatching up small miners with proven deposits  And they ve been willing to pay a premium too  According to Desjardins Capital Markets  over 2010 and 2011  a total of 26 mergers and acquisitions have taken place to the tune of more than  30 billion  In this time period  the buyout or purchasing premium has averaged more than 40 percent    Desjardins says the M A trend in the gold sector should continue  given  growing cash hoards and a lack of new discoveries  of the precious metal  As one example of this ongoing worldwide trend  Bloomberg News reported that   Chinese gold producers are vying for domestic and overseas mining resources   with two companies competing for two different gold mining companies located in the eastern province of Shandong  Big miners have historically purchased the known assets of their rivals as a way to increase reserves rather than deal with the heartache and headache of drilling core samples and filling out permit applications  Large scale gold production is a complex and costly process involving digging  transporting  crushing and chemically treating massive quantities of rock to get at small amounts of gold  In fact  a commercially viable deposit could contain just a tiny fraction of an ounce of gold for every ton of mined rock   With the signals there for a bounce and stocks undervalued  what s stopping investors from buying gold equities  One reason could be margin pressure  Rising energy costs  reduced supply and currency swings can quickly erase a gold company s margin  It takes a great deal of diesel fuel to run the shovels and dump trucks that haul ore to the mill for processing and rising energy costs can affect the profitability of a mine substantially  These variables are the project s cash costs  or how much capital must be spent to pull an ounce of gold out of the ground  From the first quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2011  the global average cash cost has been rising for miners at a rate of about 8 percent year over year  Desjardins says costs will  likely remain under pressure  especially on the energy and labor fronts   However  as Desjardins points out  at the level that gold is at now   most producers will be generating significant cash flow and earnings   using this cash to fund takeovers  build out development pipelines and pay higher dividends  Another barrier for investors could be perceived volatility  On Bloomberg Radio  I explained to host Kathleen Hays how gold s 12 month rolling volatility is very different from the way it s perceived  While the normal volatility for the S P 500 Index is up or down 19 percent over a 12 month period  it s only 13 percent for gold bullion  My friend and CIBC analyst  Barry Cooper heard my Bloomberg interview and emailed me the chart below showing how the TSX Global Gold Index ETF Gold Price Ratio has historically been negatively correlated with gold s volatility  Two times over the past four years  when gold price volatility was falling  it was generally associated with rising valuations of the TSX Global Gold Index ETF  Today it s a different story  Gold s volatility and value are both going down  According to Barry   either we are in a totally new regime for gold shares or something has to give     The cold shoulder from investors has also given way to a promising trend in the gold space growing dividend payouts  We believe this is one can t miss trend  We ve been paying close attention to this as it has developed over the past few years  because through monthly or quarterly dividends  investors can receive income while they wait for share prices to appreciate  To capture the income potential  we ve adjusted the portfolios of USERX and UNWPX to hold some of these dividend payers  Many of these holdings pay a monthly dividend that is higher than the two year government note  have rich balance sheets and receive royalties from all over the world on their gold mines  We encourage investors to think contrarian  Eat up all you can while the pasture is wide open  because as the chart above shows  when gold equities reverse  it happens quickly  Disclosure and Disclaimer

205161,426677,GOLD,Mining Equity Bargains Abound  But Buy with Care  Ivan Lo,opinion,It may look as if almost any mining stock you see these days is a bargain just waiting to be plucked  While most stocks have seen major drops from their highs and some are showing significant price turns  others have more downside left and a few just won t make it to the next market peak  Ivan Lo  publisher of The Equedia Weekly Letter  takes both a macro view of market and economic conditions and then carefully studies the specifics of each stock he decides to follow or acquire  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Lo talks about the critical factors that can separate a mega winner from a rollback candidate and talks about some of his favorite names    The Gold Report  Your newsletter  The Equedia Weekly Letter  talks mainly about Canadian companies you actively own  Why did you begin writing this newsletter and how do you choose the companies you invest in    Ivan Lo  I ve always been interested in the capital markets because they are the source of the world s growth  Without them there wouldn t be Google  Microsoft or Apple  My father was editor in chief of a prominent global newspaper  so I guess that s where I combined the two ideas  There are some extremely able men in our industry and I get to have some great discussions about investment philosophies  strategies and market outlook  We often trade ideas and go through what works and what doesn t    These brilliant men don t think like the average person  their thought processes are often beyond that of the average investor  That s how The Equedia Weekly Letter got started  I wanted to bridge that gap and turn complicated investment philosophies into something simple that everyone could understand  from macroeconomics to mining 101  My job is to make it simple and start with macroeconomics  the big picture  For example  I believe the precious metal sector is undervalued right now    First  I ll look at the project  Does it have value or is it just a crapshoot  When it comes to mining  drill results alone aren t enough  A company can drill spectacular numbers but if it is drilling in the middle of nowhere  those drill results are just shareholder dollars turned into geological numbers for reference  The likelihood of that project doing anything anytime soon is very slim  But if it is drilling great numbers near an already producing mine  its chance of success becomes a lot higher    Then come the people behind it  If a project isn t managed by great people  I won t invest in it  I ve been burned before by finding great projects only to have the management team destroy it because they didn t understand the capital markets  They raise a few million here and a few million there  They get excited  They spend it all and yet produce no shareholder value  Good drill results alone don t mean it s a success unless it brings shareholder value with the money that is spent    After that comes the capital structure  Who owns the paper and at what price  The last thing a lot of people don t consider is management s marketing ability  If a company is public  management needs to market it  The shares are only as good as what The Street says they are worth  At the end of the day  someone has to buy your shares from you at a higher price for you to profit  That s how the stock market works  If no one knows about the company  no one will buy it and your shares are worthless    TGR  Unfortunately  just because you get competent geologists running a company doesn t necessarily mean they know what they re doing when it comes to running a public company    IL  Yes  I ve seen it time and again  especially in the past couple of years where we had a bull market for about a year and all these geologists went out and spent all their money yet created no shareholder value    TGR  So  what s your assessment of the current precious metals markets  It s been pretty frustrating for a while  What is it going to take for gold and silver to turn around and take the mining shares with them    IL  I get asked that question a lot by our readers  Gold and silver are still much undervalued given the world s current economic situation  Prices are on hold because politics and bankers are controlling its price action    Despite what they may say now  they will be printing more money sooner rather than later  As I mentioned in one of my recent weekly letters  currencies are ultimately an epic failure  which means gold will remain king  Central banks are now purchasing back the gold they sold earlier  Yet people remain skeptical and talk about the big drop from  1 900 ounce  oz  all the way to  1 500 oz    Investments rarely move in a straight line and gold is no exception  While we could see some downward pressure near term  I think a rally will happen  Throughout history  times of great inflation have always occurred when both money and debt levels rose during the natural deflation that occurred after inflationary peaks were reached  We re there right now  Leading up to 2008  prices were skyrocketing  Prices are trending back down now  Real estate  oil and wages are all heading on a downtrend  Right now  people don t want to believe we re in a state of deflation  and the Federal Reserve is worried about that  But when we get out  inflation will be apparent  After that  hyperinflation becomes more plausible    When gold hits close to that  2 000 oz mark again  I think the mining shares will finally follow  Until investors realize that gold hasn t even come close to its peak  most mining shares will remain where they are right now  which is the best time to buy them  when nobody else wants them    TGR  There are so many bargains out there now that it seems almost anything you buy could produce a nice profit  assuming the company can obtain financing without diluting itself into oblivion  What do you look for now in a potential mega winner    IL  That s true  but just because something is beat up doesn t mean it is a bargain  A lot of the stocks out there are still junk  As for a potential mega winner  I go back to my investment philosophy  I look for a battered stock with a strong project and a management team capable of marketing its story to the world  I m also looking for a company that is a potential takeover target    It would have to be near a producing mine or be on the verge of some very significant milestones  Grades are important  People think that because you drill 100 meters and get 1 gram ton that it s an amazing grade  It s not  High grade is the most important thing for projects nowadays  because the cost of exploration and production are rising like crazy    A few weeks ago I sat down with MAG Silver Corp   MAG TSX  MVG NYSE  CEO  Dan MacInnis  He s a brilliant man and we talked about how grade affects projects around the world because so many mines are being shut down and projects are being shelved  We talked about Tye Burt  CEO of Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE   and how the spot price for one of the new tires on his 250 ton trucks used to be  40 000  Today the same tire costs  100 000  That s more than double the cost in 18 months and that s what s going on right now  So  if the grades aren t there you aren t going to have a project  But  if the grades are there  everything will take care of itself    TGR  Lots of stocks are trading between a dime and a quarter  Some are going to survive and could become a ten or twentybagger  Other ones are probably going to be one for ten rollback candidates  How can investors figure out which are really alive and which ones are going to be dead    IL  It s funny you ask that question because I actually see a lot of these juniors being forced to roll back and many juniors going bankrupt or getting delisted  Investors need to know a company s actual cash position and burn rate  How much of its cash is allocated and already committed for spending  Companies shouldn t just stop their drill programs because the market stinks  But  they need to be more conservative with their spending and know when and how to cut back  That s why they should focus on what will bring them results instead of drilling blind to see how far the mineralization extends  Management s primary goal is to maximize shareholder value and know when to cut back  If a company has a staff of geologists on the payroll that aren t doing much  I can bet you it will be a candidate for a rollback in this market    TGR  Unlike many years ago  when most work was done on a contract and project basis  a lot of these companies have built in overhead that doesn t go away very easily    IL  That s why you need to know exactly how much of a company s cash is being allocated or if it has already been committed to these drill programs  Does the company have to go out and finance in this market    TGR  So  it s important to not just get all excited about new drill results but to know how a company will finance the rest of its operations    IL  Especially in this market    TGR  So  talking about gold  a year ago it was around  1 550 oz  Now it s about the same  give or take a couple percent  Silver  on the other hand  has come down quite a bit from  36 oz to around the  27 oz range now  which is down about 25   Do you think there is better upside leverage in silver at this point  Or has it lost some of its appeal to speculators    IL  You make a great point  Silver has always been in gold s shadow and always will be  But  I m a huge fan of silver and silver projects  The space is so small that you re going to have some volatility  but that also means you re going to have more upside when things turn  Silver will reach  50 oz long before gold reaches  3 000 oz  But I think you should own both    TGR  You mentioned MAG Silver earlier  Do you want to expand on that a little in the silver mining area and on any other companies you think are worth considering    IL  I really like MAG Silver as an undeveloped project  It has a 44  interest in Juanicipio  which is probably the highest grade undeveloped silver project in the world  And  it s smack dab in the middle of the world s largest primary silver producer s backyard  MAG s grades are phenomenal  I m pretty confident that MAG either will go into production or be bought out very soon  It just came out with a revised preliminary economic assessment on Juanicipio that clearly shows that  despite dramatically rising costs  it is an amazingly robust and economic project    And  that s not all  MAG has 100  interest in another project called Cinco de Mayo  It s another high grade silver system with strong base metal credits  You re hearing it here first  but I think Cinco de Mayo will be a world class silver project  And  based on the results I ve already seen  it will get very big  very soon  I think MAG is on to something massive with Cinco de Mayo and the market just doesn t realize it yet    As far as mini producers  I like Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE   The company has done everything right from the get go  It has increased resources  received permitting and commenced production from two mines  both on time and on budget  This is a rare feat in this industry  and it still has further exploration upside  So  these are the two companies that I like in the silver space right now    TGR  Who do you think will be the potential buyer for MAG Silver  Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE  or another company    IL  Fresnillo already owns 56  of the Juanicipio project  It has a mine shaft and a mill a few kilometers away  So  it just doesn t make sense for Fresnillo to not take over MAG  But  there are other majors out there that would have a big interest in MAG right now    TGR  Looking at gold now  there are certainly a lot of beaten down gold stocks out there  What are some of your favorites in the gold area these days    IL  I like a lot of the big guys that have been beaten down as well  I own Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  simply because it s a bellwether stock for the sector  If we get the mania that we expect  Barrick will be one of the first ones to rocket out of the gates  I also like Eldorado Gold Corp   ELD TSX  EGO NYSE   Detour Gold Corp   DGC TSX  and Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE     Among the smaller producers  Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd   BGM TSX V  is looking promising at these levels  The company just received all necessary approvals for mining and milling at the Bonanza Ledge mine and the QR mill  It still has upside and the grades are pretty great  I ve had it on my radar since earlier this month and it is already up 70  since then  I think it still has more room for growth    As far as a non producer in the junior space  I like Balmoral Resources Ltd   BAR TSX V  BAMLF OTCQX   The team at Balmoral  led by Darin Wagner  has a time tested business model with a really high probability of leading to major rewards    Less than two years ago these guys sold West Timmins Mining to Lake Shore Gold Corp   LSG TSX  and gave investors an amazing return  Back in 2008  when times were tough  management continued to do exactly what they re doing right now and deployed my investment strategy  bang on  They had a great project and managed their treasury just right at a time when the world was screaming death in 2008  They also continued to market when no one else would  As a result  West Timmins was one of the first companies to come out of the gate with a bang in 2008  It went from  0 13 to  3 00 in less than 12 months  That s a return over 2 200     I think Balmoral is a second chance for investors who missed West Timmins  It currently controls one of the largest land positions in the Abitibi  which is home to the second largest accumulation of gold in the world  It continues to hit high grades everywhere along the properties with a greater than 75  success rate  Not only does it have one of the largest land packages in the Abitibi  it s right beside what will become Canada s largest gold mine next year Detour Gold s 15 6 million ounce Detour Lake mine  As I said before  I m looking for potential takeover targets companies like MAG and Balmoral  Both of these companies are smack dab in the middle of what s either a producing mine or one that s going to be the biggest producing mine in Canada  That means Balmoral has the ingredients to be a prime takeover target  It just needs some more drill results to blend it all together    Detour has already publicly stated that its strategy is to focus on high grade mineralization within a 50 kilometer radius of its processing plant  and Balmoral fits right in  Last year Detour Gold also said it wouldn t be looking to acquire other companies until production began in 2013  Then  last September  it went out and acquired Trade Wind Ventures  So  it s not its first takeover and I can guarantee you it won t be its last  If you re Detour and you re about to become Canada s largest gold miner  what would you do  I think Balmoral  especially at these prices  looks very interesting    TGR  What about some other companies offshore  not in North America  that you think are interesting    IL  There are quite a few of them  But  for now I m looking mainly at North America  because of the way things are now in the rest of the world  with wars and political changes  If you re a Canadian company operating in Canada  you avoid a lot of those issues    TGR  So  can you give us a little wrap up and summarize what our readers should be doing or not doing at this point to try to make money and avoid losing money in this market    IL  The big one for most people is trying not to lose money  If you want to play it safe you buy the big names  the Cokes  the Apples  the Barricks of the world and  of course  straight bullion  But  if you re looking for the best bang for your buck  I would continue to look at the beat up junior market and follow my investment philosophy  Focus on management  takeover candidates  capital structure and marketing ability  A lot of these juniors still have some downtrend  But  many will be trading a lot higher two years from now  or even sooner    An easy way to start filtering them is to look for the ones that have already bounced from their 52 week lows on good volume  Those are a good start because it shows they re in an uptrend  If you re going to invest in juniors  you have to have the stomach for it  No risk  no reward  None of us invest in juniors to make a few bucks here and there  We invest to change our lives  If you have the patience and the guts  the junior market is going to give you the best bang for your buck    TGR
