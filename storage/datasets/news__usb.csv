Jennifer Thompson    Director of Investor RelationsThank you  James and good morning to everyone who has joined our call  Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review US Bancorp s

release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank com I would like to remind you that any forward looking statements made during today s call are subject to risks and uncertainties  Factors that could materially change our current forward looking assumptions are described on page two of today s presentation  in our press release and in our Form 10 K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC I ll now turn the call over to Mr  Andy Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jen and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call  Following our prepared remarks  Terry and I will take your questions I ll begin on slide three  We reported earnings per share of  0 90  which included  0 18 per share of notable items which Terry will discuss in more detail in a few moments  Excluding these notable items  we reported earnings per share of  1 08 for the quarter  Loan growth was driven by new client wins and deepening relationships across all our loan portfolios and we delivered a very strong deposit growth  We continue to see strong account and volume growth across our key businesses  Credit quality was stable and our book value per share increased 6 7  from a year ago  In November  we received approval from the Federal Reserve for an incremental share repurchase plan  authorizing repurchases up to  2 5 million of common stock in addition to our existing authorization of  3 billion  In the fourth quarter  we returned  2 9 billion of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks As indicated on slide four  digital uptake trends remained strong  We are significantly ramping up the launch of our DIY digital experiences that will continue to drive more and more customer interactions both on and off the mobile app as well as higher additional transactional volume Slide five provides key performance metrics  On a core basis  we delivered an 18 1  return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter  For the full year  our core return on tangible common equity was 18 8  Now I will turn it over to Terry who will provide detail on the quarter as well as forward looking guidance Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Andy  If you turn to slide six  I ll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends  Average loans grew 0 8  on a linked quarter basis and increased 3 9  year over year  Linked quarter growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages  commercial real estate  and credit card loans  In C I  paydown activity muted overall growth in the fourth quarter  primarily reflecting the rate environment and robust capital market conditions  New commercial business activity is healthy  however paydown activity is likely to continue to be a headwind near term albeit a diminishing headwind assuming that the interest rate environment is stable Turning to slide seven  Deposits increased 1 9  on a linked quarter basis and grew 6 6  year over year  Notably  average savings deposits grew by 11 1   driven by across the board growth in wealth management  investment services  consumer banking  and commercial banking Turning to slide eight  Credit quality was stable in the fourth quarter  On a dollar basis  non performing assets declined approximately 15  on both a linked quarter and a year over year basis  The ratio of non performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned also improved linked quarter and year over year  The new accounting standard related to credit losses  commonly known as CECL became effective January 1st and has no impact on our 2019 results  We estimate that the adoption of CECL will result in a  1 5 billion cumulative effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses compared with December 31st 2019  which is in line with our previous guidance Slide nine highlights fourth quarter earnings results  We reported earnings per share of  0 90  which included several notable items  which reduced earnings by  0 18 per share  Excluding these notable items  we reported earnings of  1 08 per share Slide 10 lists the notable items that affected earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019  Fourth quarter 2019 notable items included restructuring charges including severance and certain asset impairments and an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the company  As a reminder  we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of 2018  including a gain on the sale of our ATM servicing business and the sale of a majority of the company s covered loans as well as charges related to severance  asset impairments and an accrual for certain legal matters  Along with a favorable impact deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform  the net impact of notable items in 2018 was an increase of  0 03 per share  My remarks through the remainder of the call will be referencing results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 Turning to slide 11  Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 3  year over year  in line with our expectations as the impact of loan growth and higher yields on reinvestment of securities was more than offset by the impact of our flatter yield curve and deposit funding mix  Our net interest margin declined by 10 basis points versus the third quarter  About 4 basis points of the decline was due to higher premium amortization expense in the investment securities portfolio  The remainder of the pressure can be attributed to the yield curve compression and earning asset mix  partly offset by lower deposit costs  We expect the net interest margin to be stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter Slide 12 highlights trends in non interest income  On a year over year basis  we saw a good growth in merchants acquiring revenue driven by account and volume improvement  As expected  credit and debit card revenue declined 1  year over year due to two  Phonetic  processing days in the fourth quarter of 2019  We look for credit and debit card revenue to return to a mid single digit growth pace in 2020  Corporate payment products revenue declined 3 1   driven by lower commercial business sales volumes  However  in the past few weeks  sales volume growth has returned to a mid single digit growth rate  Trust and investment management growth reflected business growth and favorable market conditions  Deposit service charges were impacted by the sale of the company s ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018  The decline in treasury management fees from a year ago reflected the impact of changes in earnings credits  a residual effect of the rising rate environment in 2018  Notably  treasury management fees increased on a linked quarter basis  reflective of their recent interest rate declines in the third and fourth quarters of 2019  Mortgage banking revenue increased 42 7  year over year on strong origination and sales revenue growth  Compared with the fourth quarter of 2018  mortgage production volume increased by 92 3  and mortgage application volume increased by 83 8   Refinancing activity represented approximately  Technical Issues  in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to about 40  in the linked quarter  Refinancings represented 52  of applications in the fourth quarter  As of November  our digital mortgage app was being utilized by about 86  of all mortgage applications Turning to slide 13  The 3 1  year over year increase in non interest expense reflected increased personnel expense  higher technology and communication expense  and higher net occupancy and equipment expense  reflecting actions to support business growth Slide 14 highlights our capital position  At December 31st  our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9 1  I will now provide some forward looking guidance  For the first quarter of 2020  we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline at a low single digit pace year over year  but to be relatively flat linked quarter normalized for day count  We expect mid single digit growth in fee revenue year over year  We expect low single digit growth in non interest expenses on a year over year basis  Credit quality in the first quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the fourth quarter and we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20  on a full year basis I ll hand it back to Andy for closing comments Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Terry  We are operating in a dynamic environment and this quarter s results reflected the challenging interest rate environment facing the entire industry as well as the impact of actions we took to better position our company for the future  However  as our core financial metrics indicate  we ended the year on a solid note and we are in a strong position as we head into 2020  We view the interest rate environment as a manageable headwind and we are confident in our ability to prudently grow our balance sheet and gain market share in our fee businesses  Fee growth was negatively impacted by several headwinds in 2019  As Terry discussed  we expect the return to normalized growth in credit and debit card revenue this year  In a more stable interest rate environment  as a refi driven market shifts to purchase driven market  the investments we made in our mortgage business over the past several years will become increasingly evident in the form of market share gains We are proud of our strong and consistent financial track record  but we are always looking for ways to improve  That means we are changing the way we think  the way we work and the way we do business  As we move into 2020 and beyond  we will continue to increase workflow agility and speed to market for our products and services while at the same time optimizing our core operation to fund investment for the future  Our ability to leverage the combined dollar of our rapidly improving digital capabilities and our complete payment ecosystem will lead to higher staff customer satisfaction  stronger revenue growth and efficiencies and ultimately  improved returns In summary  we remain focused on managing this company for the long term while delivering at a pathway to the future  I d like to thank our employees for all we accomplished this year  supported by their hard work and commitment to creating value for all our customers We will now open up the call for Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  And your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore  Go ahead please  Your line is open John Pancari    Evercore Partners Inc     AnalystGood morning Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  John John Pancari    Evercore Partners Inc     AnalystJust want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage expectation  I mean we got your comments around the quarter  but for full year  20  I know you had previously indicated that it could be a challenge to attain positive operating leverage for the full year given the rate backdrop  etc  Wanted to get your updated thoughts on that if you see that there is a chance you can get    you could see positive operating leverage and what type of magnitude will that    could you see Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  John  thanks  And as a reminder  we had a goal of achieving positive operating leverage in 2019  We did that on a core basis for the full year  When we think about 2020  our objective is to target positive operating leverage and we expect our expense growth to continue to remain in those low single digits  So I think we have a number of levers that we continue to look at and pull in terms of optimization  continue with our physical assets  optimization of the branch system  our back office activities and a number of different things  So that s our goal  that s our objective at this particular point in time  Now that said  as you said in your question  2020 is more difficult year  simply because of the revenue outlook  And I think part of being able to achieve it is going to be really based upon what happens with respect to interest rates etc  So that s kind of how we re thinking about it John Pancari    Evercore Partners Inc     AnalystOkay  great  Thanks  And then in terms of your    some of the headwinds that had impacted your fee progression  I know there was the accounting change that impacted as well as there is couple of other items  Can you just talk about where do you expect underlying momentum to build in the fee businesses as you look at 2020 Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So when we end up looking at fee income  I think there s a number of different things that we end up looking at  I think the credit card revenue is stronger  again mid single digits as we think about next year and that particular line item was impacted by both an accounting item in 2018 as well as pretty slow first quarter in which we had talked about  I think merchant acquiring continues to accelerate and get strong and we expect mid single digits there and then the CPS revenue  While we saw a decline in the fourth quarter because of a little slower commercial spending  that has come back in the first several weeks of the year and so our expectation in that category is kind of mid single digits as well  Deposit service charges has been a drag this year because of the sale of the ATM business in 2018  Also that kind of normalizes at least flat in 2020  I think treasury management revenue is another area that we would expect  it s kind of hit an inflection point  So while it s down on a year over year basis  it is up on a linked quarter basis and we would expect that to be better than 2020  So I think there s a number of different things  I think the offset to that is    and if you think about mortgage  when you talk about mortgage  market has been particularly strong in the last couple of quarters  but in 2019 it was also quite a bit of a drag in the first several quarters  So again  dependent on what happens with interest rates  but in the current environment  I think that continues to be a positive story  So I mean  I think there s a number of different areas John Pancari    Evercore Partners Inc     AnalystOkay Terry  that s helpful  Thank you OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America  Go ahead please  Your line is open Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYes  good morning Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey Erika  how are you doing this morning Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood  Thank you  I heard you loud and clear on your expense growth  and I m wondering though if the increased severance charges that we ve seen could lead to a different geography in terms of expense growth and I guess I m just looking back at your headcount  which seems to have risen sort of along  coincident with the Consent Order  And I m wondering part of the initial statement upfront Andy  in terms of continuing to transform the business is trying to take some of the compensation growth that you experienced over the last three years and really putting that back in technology  Is that sort of how we should expect the geography could change underneath that low single digit expense growth that you re expecting for  20 Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think that s not an unfair description  Erika  It s not just technology  but it s people and technology  but it s optimizing the way we re doing business to continue to invest in the future and our expense growth was higher during the Consent Order periods  but as you know  it s been in the low single digits in the last couple of years and mutually  Phonetic  notable items 2 4  year over year in 2019 and that includes optimization and expense takeout while at the same time investing in technology and people for the future and I would expect that to continue into 2020 Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnd I guess I m wondering if this    our takeaway from that is because that seems like it s behind you  And again  it feels like the severance charges are setting up for further optimization and rationalization that you re accelerating the amount of dollars that you re putting into the future so to speak whether it s headcount related to that or technology itself Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think that s a fair comment  Erika  Again  I think the shift is optimizing what I would call the back office and the branch network which are being impacted by customer behaviors as we transition to more of a digital environment  but at the same time we re reinvesting that in technology spend to support that digital transformation and so maybe a little bit of a shift from compensation to technology type of cost  but our expectation when we think about 2020 is to continue to make the investments in the business that we have been making over the last couple of years Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you  And just one more if I could squeeze it in  Deposit costs were down 15 basis points quarter over quarter  And I m wondering underneath the 1Q NII outlook  will you expect for deposit cost trends for the first quarter and also if the curve outlook continues to be stable from here  could net interest margin for the rest of the year stabilize or potentially increase from 1Q levels Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Well  certainly if the rate environment continues where it is today  our expectation is that 2020 net interest margin would be pretty flat to the fourth quarter with some possible positive bias dependent upon what happens on the long end of the curve  but that s kind of our thought process  And the reason for that is the premium amortization we ve experienced in the third and fourth quarter is stabilizing at this particular point in time  When we think about deposit cost  deposit pricing  we have been pretty responsive on the institutional deposits in terms of bringing those repricing those down as rates have come down and I think from here on out  deposit pricing will be a function of both competition and what happens on the short end of the curve Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Thank you Operator Operator Instructions  And our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler  Go ahead please  Your line is open Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Scott R  Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning guys  Hi  Thanks for taking the question  Just curious if you might be able to offer any just top level comments on the overall kind of pace of loan growth and overall demand  If you look at the HA data  it s definitely been held up or supported by the consumer side  but it s been a little surprising to see the slowdown of growth on the commercial side however  So I m just curious given the breadth of you guys franchise and different types of customers you look at  what you re seeing at a very top level Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  At a very high level again I think economically  we feel pretty optimistic in terms of what the outlook there is  If you end up looking at the components of loan growth  I think we saw pretty strong and good growth with respect to consumer lending  The area that was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter was really our C I  our corporate sort of lending and that s principally while we saw production and the pipeline continuing to be reasonably strong  we saw a pretty significant paydowns that were taking place in that space  driven by capital markets activities and that s a function of the long end of the curve coming down in the third and probably fourth quarter  With that stabilizing  while we would expect some of the paydowns to continue into the first quarter  I think that will moderate R  Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank you  And then just any additional updates on ramification from the LCR rules  I think you guys have been talking about  11 billion to  15 billion of liquidity free up  Any updated thoughts on how you re thinking about that dynamic Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That s in the ballpark in terms of the amount of how    what the impact is with respect to LCR  We re continuing to look at different alternatives and part of it is thinking about extending duration a little bit  possibly investing a little bit more in agency mortgage backed securities  which would provide a little bit better yield  but I think it will be on the margin and it won t be anything dramatic R  Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  All right  That s perfect  Thank you very much OperatorAnd there are no further questions in queue at this time  I d like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Thompson for closing remarks  It looks like we did get one question  We do have a question from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan Chase  Go ahead please  Your line is open Vivek Juneja    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystThank you  Hi  Andy  Hi  Terry  Just wanted to clarify on credit debit card fees  What was the impact from two fewer processing days  What does that do and is there a reversal in 2020 Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Good question  There was an impact of two days that ended up really taking our fee income from kind of that low to middle single digits to the negative 1  in the fourth quarter  There is one extra day in 2020 relative to 2019  but let me just kind of dissect it a little bit because I think that is may be helpful  When you end up looking at the growth rate for 2019  it was really impacted by three different things  One is that there was an accounting change that occurred in the first quarter of 2018 that because of the lapping effect ended up depressing growth rates in 2019  In addition  if you remember the consumer spend level in the first quarter was significantly lower and it s kind of at an unusually low level and of course as the concerns around the economy stabilize  that consumer spend has come up  That has been in the mid single digits in the second  third and kind of fourth quarter in terms of sales volumes  And then as you know getting back to the processing days  quarterly results can be lumpy  but when we think about 2020 in terms of on a full year basis  we really think that mid single digits is a good target for us and a good estimate for us  Our sales volumes over the last several quarters have been kind of in that range and when you think about it on a day adjusted basis  it s been pretty consistent from quarter to quarter  So in 2020  there is one more day and that will help a little bit  but mid single digits for 2020 I think is a good estimate  Again  quarterly results will be a little bit lumpy  but when we think about the year  that s kind of how we re thinking about it Vivek Juneja    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystAnd then when I look back over the prior couple of years  you would have had    this line item was growing at sort of more like 9  to 9 5  when you look at   17 to  18  Has there been    going to the mid single digits  has there been any reduction in pricing  a shift in the kind of contracts or is this higher rewards expense  What Terry is driving that slowdown from that high single digit level to the mid single digit run rate Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  The growth rates in 2017 2018 were influenced in some respect because of some portfolios that we were acquiring during that sort of time frame  more so than other factors  And so when we think about pricing  there hasn t been a lot of compression with respect to pricing  We feel pretty good about that Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd rewards has been relatively flat  but actually that isn t a factors  so that mid single digit numbers are good way to think about in the next 12 months Vivek Juneja    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystOkay  And as you think about from    in terms of other fee revenues Andy  you said    and Terry  treasury management should be good  Corporate card fees  when I look at that  that was also a little bit softer this quarter and it s actually down year on year  Any color on that  because I know the  yeah  I will just let you answer that Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Vivek  the impact of that is because we saw in the last half of the fourth quarter  corporate spend activity slowed  That had been running in the mid single digits little bit higher in the first few quarters  Fourth quarter saw a slowdown to almost flat and as Terry mentioned in his prepared remarks  we did see a pickup in the first two weeks of January back to the mid single digits  So that was attributable to that slowdown  but it seems to have come back Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think that one of the reasons for that is  if you think about where the yield curve  how rates were moving  there was concerns about recession  people were uncertain with respect to economic data and then you had the hangover of tariffs  I think the sentiment on a corporate side appears to be looking better  We re going to be signing a trade agreement with China today I believe in terms of Phase 1 and the US  Mexico  Canada agreement is well on its way  So I think that some of that uncertainty that might have been impacting discretionary spend in the commercial side of the equation has been alleviated  So we feel pretty good Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I want to confirm one last thing  CECL day two  Could you talk a little bit about what do you see that doing to your provision expense Andy  Terry Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We ve talked about certainly day one and day two as part of Investor Day  The provision will increase  We think that in terms of loan growth  providing basically that kind of that 2  level versus 1 5  is kind of how we re thinking about  but there is going to be more volatility related to CECL  And I think one of the things we ll end up looking at is just what is the stability in the overall portfolio and what our net charge off is doing on a quarter to quarter basis Vivek Juneja    JPMorgan Chase    AnalystAll right  thank you OperatorAnd we do have another question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies  Go ahead please  Your line is open Amanda Larsen    Jefferies   Co     AnalystHi  everyone  This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey Amanda  how are you doing Amanda Larsen    Jefferies   Co     AnalystGreat  Thanks  I think it s understood that 2020 will likely be an aberration versus the long term trends that you set out at Investor Day related to revenue growth headwind  but that you will still strive to achieve positive operating leverage in  20  but I m wondering how negative could negative operating leverage be in  20 before you do take actions related to slowing the pace of investment spend or creating more sales Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo as Terry mentioned  again earlier we expect and target positive operating leverage for 2020  We have a number of levers that we continue to pull to optimize the current organization structure to continue to invest in the future  So Amanda  the way we think about it is a balance of optimizing today and investing in the future while always targeting that positive operating leverage and that s how we re managing the company Amanda Larsen    Jefferies   Co     AnalystOkay  great  Then  can you guys talk about the capability add of Sage Pay and how you see US Bank s position evolving in the e commerce payment arena over the medium term  Thanks Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We re very excited about Sage Pay  It is a leader in the e commerce space within the UK and Ireland  and we also have the opportunity to be able to extend that into the rest of Europe  We have a pretty big footprint across Europe  so pretty excited about that as we think about next year  We ended up rolling out sort of similar e commerce capabilities over the course of the last 12 to 18 months here domestically and so we believe that that gives us more capabilities in terms of being able to take advantage of e commerce in the future Amanda Larsen    Jefferies   Co     AnalystAwesome  Thanks Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Amanda Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous  Go ahead  please  your line is open John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystHey guys  Sorry  I jumped on a little bit late  Did you give an update on the Charlotte expansion  Andy  and how that s going and whether you re targeting new areas for this year to expand on the retail side Andrew Cecere    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  John  Charlotte is going well  We opened the branch about three months ago  We ve had new customer acquisition growth in current customers  Employees are fired up  We are targeting a number of new branches to be opening up this year and still targeting that number of 10  We re learning a lot from that investment  We continue to track that and measure our activity and I would expect us to continue to expand in new markets  but our first focus is expanding to our target number in Charlotte John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystGot you  OK  Then Terry  just a couple clean up things on NII  I think you mentioned the amortization kind of stabilizes early this year  Is that right  Then the roll off rates  like where the tenure is today  are those kind of breakeven or slightly accretable where you re putting new money to work in the bond portfolio today relative to what s rolling off Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So addressing kind of your second question first  The reinvestment with respect to securities is still about 15 basis points or so accretive  So we would expect that based upon where rates are today  The premium amortization does stabilize in the first quarter  So when we think about net interest margin for the year  we think it s going to be relatively flat  maybe a little bit of positive bias relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  So the down NII for the year is just the tough comps of where you started last year  I guess from a sequential standpoint  though  sales relatively stable Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYes John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  Thank you Terrance R  Dolan    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerThanks John OperatorAnd with that  there are no further questions in queue  I d like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Thompson for closing remarks Jennifer Thompson    Director of

reported in the prior year quarter For full year 2019  the company reported net income of  6 91 billion or  4 16 compared with  7 1 billion or  4 14 in 2018 Revenues Fall  Costs   Provisions RiseU S  Bancorp s net revenues came in at  5 67 billion in the fourth quarter  down 2 8  year over year  Decrease in net interest and non interest income led to this downside  The top line figure also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 79 billion For 2019  the company reported net revenues of  23 billion  which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  the top line jumped 1 5  from the prior year quarter figure U S  Bancorp s tax equivalent net interest income totaled  3 23 billion in the reported quarter  down 3  from the prior year quarter  This decline mainly stemmed from a flatter yield curve  deposit pricing and shift in funding mix  along with lower rates Average earning assets were up 4 6  year over year supported by growth in average total loans  average investment securities and average other earning assets  Furthermore  net interest margin of 2 92  shrunk 23 basis points year over year U S  Bancorp s non interest income fell around 2 5  on a year over year basis to  2 43 billion  This fall can be attributed to lower deposit service charges  treasury management fees and other income Provision for credit losses increased 7 3  year over year to  395 million in the December ended quarter U S  Bancorp s average total loans inched up nearly 1  sequentially to  294 9 billion  This stemmed from a rise in commercial loans  residential mortgages  credit card and commercial real estate loans Average total deposits were up 1 9  from the previous quarter to  356 5 billion  This upside resulted from growth in interest bearing deposits Non interest expenses jumped 3 7  year over year to  3 4 billion  This was due to upsurge in mostly all components of non interest expenses Efficiency ratio came in at 60 3   improving from the year ago quarter s 56 5   An increase in the ratio indicates lower profitability Credit Quality  A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U S  Bancorp remained mixed in the December ended quarter  Net charge offs came in at  385

the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 11 9  as of Dec 31  2019  up from 11 8  All regulatory ratios of U S  Bancorp continued to be in excess of well capitalized requirements  In addition  based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach  tangible common equity to risk weighted assets ratio was estimated at 9 3  as of Dec 31  2019  compared with 9 4  witnessed at the end of the year ago quarter The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7 5   down from 7 8  U S  Bancorp recorded an improvement in book value per share  which increased to  29 9 as of

earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks ConclusionU S  Bancorp put up a decent show during the fourth quarter  Improvement in commercial lending scenario and higher deposits balance was a key positive factor  Also  strong capital position keeps it well poised for growth However  decline in revenues  on account of lower interest and fee income  remains a headwind

194030,415546,USB,A 17 6  Dividend  36  Upside And A 2020 Investing Strategy You Won t Believe,opinion,"Right now  with 2020 just hours out  is the perfect time to show you my two step dividend strategy for the year ahead 
We ll also dive into four specific stocks and funds to buy  They ll hand you 6   dividends now and set you on the path to unreal payouts of 17 6   down the road 
How Powell Crushed Savers
First  if you re disappointed in the dividend options out there today  you can blame one man  Jay Powell   Actually  you ll have to get in line to dump your frustrations on the poor fellow s head  
We all know that Powell s clumsy  pivot  from rate hikes to rate cuts at the start of 2019 sent stocks soaring  and dividend yields plunging as you calculate yield by dividing a company s annual dividend payout into is current share price  
Powell s lurch also sent the yield on the 10 year Treasury note  in orange below  crashing 
Traditional Income Plays Shrivel






Buying either of these two options sets you up for an income stream that s actually less than inflation this year and of course  with stocks near all time highs  the skimpy yields that are available are no bargains  either 
That makes what I m going to show you now even more important  Let s start with  
Step 1  Get Cheap 7   Dividends Here
First  we re not going to let a shortage of bargains in regular stocks stop us  because there are still plenty of deals to be had in other  less traveled corners of the market 
Like one of my favorite vehicles    They re the cure for lousy yields  my  service  for example  holds nine CEFs yielding 7  on average  not including the fact that the payouts on our  are tax free for most Americans  
The highest payer is throwing off a gaudy 9 2  payout which it delivers every month  no less 
Here s where the bargains come in  unlike other types of funds  CEFs  share counts are mostly fixed after their IPOs  As a result  investors can bid their shares totally out of whack with the value of the fund s portfolio otherwise known as its net asset value  or NAV 
The upshot  We only buy when CEFs are trading at a discount to NAV  We ll collect our dividends while these  discount windows  slam shut  pushing our shares higher 

You can see this in action with the PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Fund  NYSE PCI   which I recommended in  on May 6  2016  when it traded at a 9 3  discount  Since then  PCI s discount has flipped to an 11 4  premium 
That s right investors are willing to pay  1 11 for every  1 of the fund s assets  And every time PCI s discount has shrunk along the way  it s pulled the market price up with it 
PCI s Shrinking Discount Yanks Its Price Up






If you throw in PCI s outsized dividend  an 8 3  yield currently  paid out every month   the 36 5  price gain shown above transforms into an incredible 102  total return with most of that in safe dividend cash 
Dividends Boost PCI s Return 2 8X






But with PCI now boasting a premium  I no longer recommend it for new money  though its 8 3  yield makes it a great fund to hang on to if you already own it  
If you re hunting for cheap CEFs to buy now  here are three that are more than worthy of your attention  All of them tick three boxes I insist on before buying a CEF 
A 6    dividend yieldA discount to NAV7   annualized returns on NAV over the long term 3 More Bargain CEFs You Can Buy Now  Ranked by Discount 
Now let s move on to our next strategy for building your income stream  and the size of your nest egg  in 2020 and beyond  It s an  automatic  dividend machine that s even simpler than buying CEFs 
Step 2  Start  Stair Stepping  Your Way to a Steady 17 6  Yield in 2020
In fact  there s really only one step here  buy dividend growers  But not just any dividend growers if we want to pump up our yield fast  we need payouts that are accelerating 
You can see this in action with CubeSmart  CUBE   a REIT in the self storage space a business so boring it would make even the most conservative investor sleepy  But the company s dividend story is anything but 
CUBE pays a 4 2  dividend  That s more than double what the typical stock pays  But check out the incredible 1 220  payout growth CUBE delivered in the last decade 
1 220  Payout Drives a 17 6  Dividend 






In other words  if you d bought in late 2009  you d be yielding 17 6  on your buy today  But as you can see above  CUBE s payout growth is petering out  meaning it will likely take us longer than 10 years to hit a 17 6  payout if we buy CUBE now 
But I don t think that will be the case with US Bancorp  NYSE USB   Check out how the firm s dividend has taken off up 71  in the last five years  with the bulk of that growth coming in just the last two years 
USB s Dividend Takes Flight






Funny thing is  investors haven t taken notice and bid up the share price in orange above at the same rate as the payout has risen   It s common for shareholders to take a while to notice a sprouting payout  that delay is usually a great time to buy  
In USB s case  this lag has given us the chance to start our  automatic  dividend machine with a yield not too far off its 10 year high 
Investors Miss the Memo on USB s Payout Growth






How do we know USB s dividend will keep accelerating  For one  the bank pays out a measly 32 6  of cash flow as dividends  well below my  safety margin  of 50   Meantime  USB is overcoming lower interest rates through loan growth  helping power earnings per share higher  up 7 2  in the third quarter  
Finally  we can grab USB at a reasonable 12 6 times free cash flow  So if you re looking to fill out your finance holdings  this would be a good time to buy 
An Easy Way to Grab  40 000 in CASH in 2020 and Every Year Forever
This strategy which delivers high yields now and dividend growth to boost your nest egg  and dividends  down the road is how every investor should approach retirement 
Problem is  most folks have no idea how to find the high  safe dividends  and fast payout growth  they need to make it happen  That s exactly why I wrote the article you just read  And now I m going to go further and share with you my new    
This sturdy collection of investments gives you the best of both worlds  big cash payouts now  steady growth in your income stream and one other thing investors tell me they want all the time 
Dividends paid out monthly  so they match up perfectly with their bills 
This unique portfolio comes to you fully stocked with high yielding stocks  real estate investment trusts  REITs  and  yes  CEFs 
All told  it hands you  8 000 in yearly dividend cash for every  100K invested 
So if you invest  say  a  500K nest egg  you ll get back  40 000 a year in income  And with that cash dropping into your account every month   3 333 a month  to be precise   you won t have to lift a finger 
Your cash will come in  your expenses will go out and you could be left with a nice surplus  on the side   which you can spend however you like  or reinvest  building your income stream further

194038,415554,USB,U S  returns  505 million to victims of giant payday lending scheme,news,"By Jonathan Stempel  Reuters    U S  authorities said on Thursday they were mailing more than  505 million of refund checks to nearly 1 18 million people who were victimized in a massive payday lending scheme run by former race car driver and convicted racketeer Scott Tucker  The payout announced by the Federal Trade Commission  which is working with the Department of Justice  stemmed from a  1 27 billion civil judgment that the FTC won in September 2016 against Tucker  who ran AMG Services Inc  and some of his companies  The money will go to consumers who obtained loans from seven portfolios once serviced by AMG  Advantage Cash Services  Ameriloan  500FastCash  OneClickCash  Star Cash Processing  UnitedCashLoans and USFastCash  Tucker  56  of Overland Park  Kansas  is appealing his October 2017 conviction on racketeering and other charges  and his 16 year  eight month prison sentence  His case arose from a federal crackdown on people who exploit cash strapped consumers by charging exorbitant interest rates and fees on short term loans  some of which could tide over borrowers from paycheck to paycheck  Prosecutors said Tucker s companies routinely charged interest rates as high as 700 percent  and took advantage of more than 4 million consumers from 1997 to 2013  Tucker is arguing in his appeal that the trial judge gave flawed jury instructions  and wrongly prevented him from offering proof to support his view that state interest rate caps did not apply to his loans  The  1 27 billion judgment is the largest litigated judgment won by the FTC  A lawyer who defended AMG in the early stages of that case  Andrew Smith  is now director of the FTC consumer protection bureau

194039,415555,USB,Bank Stocks Offer Stability For The Patient Investor,opinion,"Bank stocks have put on an impressive rally of late and have enjoyed a solid 2019 overall  This performance makes some of them good enough to buy into provided you re patient about when to buy and equally patient about how long to hold 

The KBW Bank Index was up 18 8  for the year as of Tuesday  and some stocks  like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   have recently hit 52 week highs  But while consumer spending has been growing nicely and unemployment is at record low levels  bank stocks are vulnerable to market volatility 





They were hit hard during the ugly market slump in the fall of 2018 that saw the KBW Bank Index ending the year down 18   At the same time  JP Morgan dropped 14 7   U S  Bancorp  NYSE USB  fell 14 7   and SunTrust  NYSE STI  was off nearly 22   The slump may have helped propel SunTrust s pending  66 billion merger with BB T Corp   NYSE BBT  that will create the nation s sixth largest bank 

Still  banks are facing some tricky headwinds just now  The knottiest  currently  may be dealing with the U S  China trade fight and concerns about economic growth in Europe and elsewhere 
That s pushed interest rates down dramatically this year  pressuring the bottom lines of every financial company   Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  recently said it was laying off 600 workers because profits are getting squeezed  As well  the 10 year Treasury is still yielding less than 2  

A second headwind is longer term  what if a Democrat defeats Donald Trump next year 
Since coming into office  the Trump administration has been loosening many banking regulations  especially rules that boost consumer protections  But most of the Democratic candidates have been critical of the banking industry  especially Sen  Elizabeth Warren  D Ma   who helped set up the Obama administration s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  and Sen  Bernie Sanders  D Vt   who proposed breaking up the biggest banks during his 2016 campaign 

A last headwind is lingering memories of the great financial crisis  For good reason  the KBW Bank index fell nearly 80  between its January 2007 peak and March 2009 bottom  Hundreds of institutions were bailed out or merged into others 

At the same time  while consumer borrowing is back to all time highs  there is some caution  the American Banker has reported  Homeowners take out home equity loans to finance improvements  And consumers proved in the financial crisis they still pay off their car loans 

Banks  however  can t be dismissed for yet another reason  They are essential cogs in any modern economy 
Which is why their stocks are attractive for long term holders  years  not months   especially those who count on dividends  Most big bank stocks have dividend yields in the 3  range 

Two additional factors also work in banks  favor 
The institutions that bet aggressively on speculative and risky loans are mostly gone  And really bad behavior  like fraudulently opening accounts customers didn t know anything about  is getting cleaned out 
A business friendly Trump administration wants to lighten the regulatory load for banks  Good for the bottom line  at least for now  though critics worry many rule easings could encourage mismanagement and hurt customers 

Obviously  a great time to buy any stock is when it s slumping  Investors played this out fairly aggressively with financial stocks  Share gains this year make them a bit pricey  so letting them drop may make sense 
Some bank stocks to consider 

JPMorgan Chase  The biggest U S  bank by assets  Financially strong and able to take over troubled competitors and even clean up its own messes 

Truist Financial  This is the name chosen for the merged SunTrust and BB T  expected to close by year end  Both are well capitalized and profitable and operate primarily in the South and Southeast 
Each of their stocks has been on a tear  But mergers are expensive and more complex than managements like to admit  Especially a merger that creates the sixth largest U S  finacial entity by assets  A post merger pullback may create a buying opportunity  But then be patient for the ultimate payoff 

U S  Bancorp  The regional giant has operations from the Midwest to the Pacific Northwest  including a strong position in Oregon and Washington 

SVB Financial Group  NASDAQ SIVB   The parent of Silicon Valley Bank  which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area but has offices around the world  It is a player in the venture capital private equity markets

194121,415637,USB,What Caused Huge Outflows In Regional Bank ETFs In November,opinion,"Flattening of the yield curve and the struggling housing markets are acting as headwinds to the regional banks ETFs  Of late  banks have come under pressure as investors worry that rising rates might slow down lending and raise the amount the banks need to pay customers as interest 
In November  SPDR S P Regional Banking  NYSE KRE  ETF   CO KRE   saw their largest monthly outflows since January 2015 with investors withdrawing about  547 million  This happened to be the second straight month of net withdrawals  Also  SPDR S P Bank  NYSE KBE  ETF   targeting a broader swath of banks including regional ones  saw net outflows of more than  213 million  This was KBE s biggest outflow since the month of May and the seventh month of outflows in the last eight months  In November  iShares U S  Regional Banks ETF   LON IAT   and Invesco KBW Regional Banking ETF  saw net outflows of  25 8 million and  10 4 million  respectively 
On Dec 3  the gap between the two year and 10 year Treasury yields narrowed to its lowest level in a decade  s  In general  investors usually demand higher yields to commit money for long periods of time  But when the short term yields approach long term yields  it may imply doubts with regard to the immediate future 
An inverted yield curve has preceded past recessions  In fact  the gap between three and five year Treasury yield already fell to negative 0 01 percentage point on Dec 3  This has happened for the first time since 2007  Dallas Federal Reserve bank president Robert Kaplan said on Dec 3 that the narrowing of the spread between two year and 10 year Treasuries mirrors expectations of sluggish global growth  read    
So far  banks haven t made changes to their lending policies in response to the flattening of the yield curve  As per the recent Fed loan officer s survey  there could be tightening up in the lending standards if the short term rates move above the long term counterparts  Per the survey  a major number of banks responded that they would become less profitable and more risk averse  in an inverse yield curve scenario 
The housing markets are also anxious with labor and land shortages  rising mortgage rates and tighter inventories  This is curbing potential buyers  appetite to avail loans for purchasing homes 
However  things are not so gloomy for the banks  Banks performed really well in the stress tests conducted in summer    aggressive policy interventions have helped the health of banks to a large extent  Also  favorable GDP growth  tax cuts and a rising rate scenario have driven the banking industry s growth  Against this backdrop  we highlight the above mentioned ETFs in detail  see

194130,415646,USB,Wells Fargo  WFC  Might Divest Retirement Plan Services Unit,opinion,"Wells Fargo   Company  NYSE WFC    NYSE C   is mulling over the divesture of its retirement plan services unit  expecting it to generate proceeds of about  1 billion  The news was reported by Bloomberg 
Through the unit in question  Wells Fargo provides record keeping  trust  custody and other retirement plan services to corporations  It is part of its wealth and investment management segment 
Per people familiar with the matter  planning is presently at just the initial level  In fact  they feel that the company might altogether drop the plan to sell  
Since the breakout of unfair retail sales practices matter in 2016  Wells Fargo has undergone a lot of restructuring  including employee layoffs  Per the article  the company has agreed to divest branches in three Midwestern states along with businesses including its Puerto Rico auto lender and a payroll services unit 
Development in Improper Home Foreclosures Probe
Recently  Wells Fargo identified another 145 customers whose homes were foreclosed due to an apparent technical glitch  after it extended its review period to April 2018  In August 2018  the company had reported that only 645 eligible borrowers were denied changes they were eligible for  of which  400 lost their homes 
Per the internal review  attorney fee related  calculation error  caused by a mortgage underwriting tool is accountable for the mishap  Accounts that were undergoing foreclosure process in the period between April 2010 and October 2015 were majorly impacted 
Our Take
It seems difficult for Wells Fargo to steer clear of problems lately  It continues to be involved in several legal issues  However  the bank s cost control plan for 2018 might help deal with the pressure on costs  Also  its efforts to improve image among customers and improving economic backdrop might support growth in the near term 
Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 11 7  year to date compared with 6  decline recorded by the  it belongs to

194132,415648,USB,Fed On Course For December Rate Hike  5 Bank Picks ,opinion,As was widely expected  the Fed kept interest rates unchanged at the end of its latest two day policy meeting  However  it indicated that gradual increases are in store in the near future  It also expressed confidence in the economy while noting that business investment has slowed somewhat  However  it refrained from sounding alarmist on issues like recent market volatility and the slowdown in housing Market watchers think the central bank s latest policy statement clearly indicates that a rate hike is nearly certain in December  Further  three more rate hikes are likely in 2019  An increase in rates widens the yield spread for banks  which in turn boosts their margins  Adding banking stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point Rate Increase Likely After Next MeetingAt the end of its two day policy meeting  the Federal Reserve opted to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 2 to 2 25   However  it stated that  further gradual increases  would be needed given the current pace of economic growth  strong labor market conditions and the Fed s inflation target of 2  Most investors put chances of the Fed hiking rates by 0 25  in December at 80   This inference is being drawn from the central bank s September dot plot  Per this forecast of interest rate projections  most Fed officials predict that the funds rate will be 0 25  higher by the end of 2018  The central bank has already hiked rates thrice this year The absence of any change in stance in the latest policy statement also indicates that the Fed still wishes to hike rates thrice in 2019  However  markets expect a more dovish approach  with the CME Group s Fed Watch tool predicting only two hikes next year Fed Upbeat on Economy  Labor MarketThe Fed also struck an upbeat note on the economy and the labor market  The central bank observed that economic expansion has been proceeding at a  strong rate   This is a reference to the fact that GDP has increased at an average rate of 3 3  for the first three quarters and that it is likely to come in at around 3  for the year s final quarter Further  the central bank noted that jobs additions have been robust recently while unemployment has declined  In October  the unemployment rate remained flat at 3 7   the lowest since December 1969  The only negative note that it struck in the statement was to note that business investment had  moderated  recently There was little indication as to which factors were responsible for the downturn in investment  However  third quarter earnings indicate that trade tensions may have forced companies to cut down on investment outlays  At the same time there were no references to the recent equity market turmoil or the current slowdown in housing Our ChoicesMarket watchers think that the Fed s latest policy statement makes it amply clear that a rate hike is inevitable in December  A minimum of three further increases are likely to occur next year  At the same time  the central bank thinks that the U S  economy and labor market are robust Adding banking stocks to your portfolio looks like a profitable option at this time  This is because these are likely to benefit from the widening of the yield spread  We have narrowed our search to the following

194136,415652,USB,Banks to launch new tool to fight hackers  WSJ,news," Reuters    A group of cybersecurity firms funded by big banks plan to launch a platform that will allow financial companies to communicate faster about potential cyber breaches  the Wall Street Journal reported 
The move follows cybersecurity attacks on some big banks last month  where JPMorgan Chase   Co s computer systems were hacked exposing the contact details of 73 million households and 7 million small businesses 
The group gathered funds from 16 banks including JPMorgan  Citigroup Inc   BB T Corp and U S  Bancorp  to help lead the effort  the newspaper said 
The product  called  Soltra Edge   is being launched by Financial Services Information Sharing Analysis Center  FS ISAC  and the Depository Trust   Clearing Corp  DTCC   It has been in works for more than a year and is expected to be out next month  the report said 
Earlier this year  JP Morgan said it expects to spend more than  250 million on cyber security  with about 1 000 people working on that area  after being warned by U S  regulators about the threat of rising cyber attacks on bank machines 
A pilot version of Soltra was used in spreading the information received by FS ISAC from JPMorgan after the breach  the Journal said  citing sources 
Soltra  which offers a free edition as well as a paid one  will help track threat information within seconds  a spokesman for Soltra told Reuters 

FS ISAC and DTCC could not be reached immediately for comments outside regular U S  business hours

194146,415662,USB,Why Is U S  Bancorp  USB  Up 2  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB    Shares have added about 2  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is USB due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts U S  Bancorp s Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues UpU S  Bancorp s first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  The figure came ahead of the prior year quarter earnings of 82 cents The company s top line benefitted from rise in net interest income on the back of easing margin pressure and higher fee income  Further  elevated average loans and deposit balances were tailwinds  However  escalating expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues remained major drags After considering impacts of notable items  net income was  1 68 billion  up 13 7  year over year Revenues  Loans   Deposits Rise  Costs IncreaseU S  Bancorp s net revenues came in at around  5 5 billion in the quarter  up 3 4  year over year  The increase in net interest income and non interest income contributed to higher revenues U S  Bancorp s tax equivalent net interest income totaled  3 2 billion in the quarter  up 5 5  from the prior year quarter  The rise was mainly due to loan growth and rising interest rates  partially offset by deposit and funding mix Average earning assets climbed 3 1  year over year  supported by growth in average total loans and average investment securities  along with elevated average other earning assets  Furthermore  net interest margin of 3 13  was up 7 basis points  bps  year over year  driven by higher interest rates  Higher funding costs  loan mix and elevated cash balances partially mitigated the rise in margins U S  Bancorp s non interest income increased slightly on a year over year basis to  2 3 billion  The rise was primarily due to higher payment services revenues  trust and investment management fees and deposit service charges  partially offset by lower mortgage banking and commercial products revenues Provision for credit losses decreased 1 2  year over year to  341 million in the reported quarter U S  Bancorp s average total loans climbed 2 3  year over year to  279 4 billion  The growth was backed by a rise in commercial loans  residential mortgages  credit card lending  total other retail and retail leasing  These increases were partially offset by a drop in commercial real estate Average total deposits were up 1 9  from the prior year quarter to  334 6 billion  The rise was due to growth in interest bearing deposits  partly offset by lower non interest bearing deposits Non interest expenses rose 5  year over year to  3 1 billion  primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expenses  technology investment and seasonal marketing and development expenses  partially offset by lower professional services and other expenses Credit Quality  A Mixed BagCredit metrics at U S  Bancorp deteriorated in the reported quarter  Net charge offs came in at  341 million  up nearly 1 8  year over year  On a year over year basis  the company experienced deterioration  mainly in net charge offs in the credit card segment  Also  total allowance for credit losses was  4 4 billion  up 1 2  However  non performing assets came in at  1 2 billion  down 19 5  year over year Capital PositionDuring the quarter under review  U S  Bancorp maintained a decent capital position  Beginning Jan 1  2018  the regulatory capital requirements fully reflected implementation of Basel III The tier 1 capital ratio came in at 10 4   down 6 bps from the prior year quarter  Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio under the Basel III standardized approach fully implemented was 9  as of Mar 31  2018  compared with 9 5  in the year ago quarter All regulatory ratios of U S  Bancorp continued to be in excess of well capitalized requirements  In addition  based on the Basel III fully implemented advanced approach  the Tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets ratio was estimated at 11 5  as of Mar 31  2018  compared with 11 8  as of Mar 31  2017 The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7 7  as of Mar 31  2018  compared with 7 6  in prior year quarter U S  Bancorp posted an improvement in book value per share  which increased to  26 54 as of Mar 31  2018  from  25 05 recorded at the end of the year earlier quarter Capital Deployment UpdateReflecting the company s capital strength during the first quarter  U S  Bancorp returned 68  of earnings to its shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks OutlookManagement expects the total interest bearing deposit beta following the most

single digit on a year over year basis in second quarter 2018 Management expects fee income to increase at a low single digit on a year over year basis  Notably  fees are seasonally higher in the

basis points year over year  driven by higher interest rates and loan portfolio mix  Higher funding costs and elevated cash balances partially mitigated rise in margins U S  Bancorp s non interest income edged down around 1  on a year over year basis to  2 4 billion  The decline was primarily due to lower merchant processing services  mortgage banking revenues and reduced securities gains Provision for credit losses increased 10 8  year over year to  360 million in the reported quarter U S  Bancorp s average total loans climbed 3  year over year to  277 6 billion  The growth was

194312,415828,USB,FDIC Insured Banks  Q2 Earnings Grow On Higher Revenues,opinion,Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC  insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported second quarter 2016 earnings of  43 6 billion  inching up 1 4  from the prior year quarter  Notably  community banks  constituting roughly 93  of all FDIC insured institutions  reported net income of  5 5 billion  up 9  year over year Banks with assets worth more than  10 billion contributed a major part of the earnings in the said quarter  Though such banks make up for only 1 8  of the total number of U S  banks  they accounted for over 80  of the industry earnings  Some of the leading names in the space are Wells Fargo   Co    NYSE WFC    JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM    Bank of America Corp    NYSE C    Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   and U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB    among others An increase in net interest income driven by loan growth and a slight rise in fee income aided the banks  earnings  However  a weak energy sector which led to a significant rise in provision for loan losses remained an undermining factor  Further  absence of significant legal costs partly supported the expense base  which recorded a marginal rise Banks are consistently striving to reap profits and are consequently boosting productivity  Around 60 1  of all institutions insured by the FDIC recorded quarterly net income improvement  Also  the percentage of institutions reporting net losses for the quarter dropped to 4 5  from 5 8  in the prior year quarter  Notably  the percentage was the lowest recorded since the first quarter of 1998 Steady Revenue Growth  Costs Up SlightlyNet operating revenue was  179 3 billion  up 3 3  on a year over year basis  Improvement in net interest income driven by higher average interest bearing assets along with a marginal rise in non interest income was the driving factor Net interest income was recorded at  113 5 billion  up 4 8  from the year ago quarter  Further  average net interest margin increased 5 basis points  bps  year over year to 3 10  Non interest income inched up nearly 1  year over year to  65 8 billion for the banks  A rise in trading income was partially offset by fall in servicing income Total non interest expenses for the establishments were  104 8 billion in the quarter  up 0 3  on a year over year basis  This marginal increase reflected a rise in salary and employee benefit expenses  which was almost offset by a significant decline in non recurring charges Notably  eight of the ten largest banks recorded year over year declines in their total non interest expenses  However  for the industry as a whole  only 30  institutions reported a decline in expenses Asset Quality WorsensNet loan and lease charge offs rose on a year over year basis for the third consecutive quarter  Net charge offs  NCOs  increased to  10 1 billion  up 13 1  year over year  reflecting the third yearly rise in the past 22 quarters  Majority of the increase in NCOs was in commercial and industrial  C I  loans  up 100 3   In the quarter under review  loan loss provisions for the institutions came in at  11 8 billion  surging 44 2  year over year  This was the eighth consecutive quarterly rise in loss provisions  with nearly 38 7  banks reporting an increase However  non current loans and leases  90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status  rate of 1 49  was down 9 bps year over year Strong Loan   Deposit GrowthAs of Jun 30  2016  total deposits continued to rise and were recorded at  12 5 trillion  up 5  year over year  Further  total loans and leases came in at  9 1 trillion  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter  All major loan categories witnessed an increase in balances outstanding during the reported quarter As of Jun 30  2016  the Deposit Insurance Fund  DIF  balance increased to  77 9 billion from  67 6 billion as of Jun 30  2015  Interest earned on investment securities and assessment income primarily led to the growth in fund balance The measure for profitability or average return on assets  ROA  edged down to 1 02  from 1 06  in the prior year quarter Less Bank Failures  Shrinking Problem InstitutionsDuring second quarter 2016  two insured institutions failed  while 57 were acquired  As of Jun 30  2016  the number of  problem  banks declined from 165 to 147  reflecting the lowest number in eight years and plunged significantly from 888 recorded in first quarter 2011  Total assets of the  problem  institutions also fell to  29 billion from  30 9 billion Our TakeThough a fall in the number of problem institutions is encouraging  the quarter remained challenging  Though banks were able to improve revenue growth   low interest rate environment continues to hurt financials  Also  credit risk is on the rise related to energy and agriculture loans However  with banks gradually easing their lending standards and trending toward higher fees  the pressure on the top line will reduce  Further  sustained expense control and stable balance sheets should act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitToday you can gain access to long term trades with

194362,415878,USB,Soros Gold Action Speaks Louder Than Trumpeted  Bubble  Words,opinion,Yesterday s AM fix was USD 1 594 75  EUR 1 293 60  and GBP 1 016 74 per ounce Tuesday s AM fix was USD 1 614 50  EUR 1 305 60 and GBP 1 028 34 per ounce Gold dropped  8 70 or 0 54  in New York Tuesday and closed at  1 599 60 oz  Silver climbed higher before retreating to  27 64  but it then rallied back higher to end with a gain of 0 14  Gold was under pressure yesterday despite the likelihood of more QE from the FED  ECB and other central banks and despite the very uncertain and poor macroeconomic outlook Positive US data  retail sales grew for the first time in 4 months  may have led to gold weakness and scaled back hopes that the US Fed will take action soon On Tuesday  Gold ETF  GLD  interest increased to its highest level in nearly a month at 2 190 583 tonnes showing how investment demand in the gold ETF is far more  sticky  and long term in nature This means that there is a fundamental pillar of support below the gold market which did not exist in the 1970 s An important positive development for the gold market is billionaire financiers George Soros and John Paulson have again increased their allocations to gold as seen in the latest SEC filings  George Soros more than doubled his shares in the SPDR gold trust ETF He increased his position in SPDR Gold to  137 3 million in the second quarter from  52 million previously  SEC filing for the second quarter showed Soros Fund Management more than doubled its investment in the SPDR Gold Trust from 319 550 shares to 884 400 shares at the end of June In September 2010  see chart  below   Soros called gold  the ultimate bubble  and largely dumped his stake in the ETF before gold recorded annual gains in 2010 and 2011 and rose to a nominal high of  1 920 30 per ounce in September  There was speculation at the time that he may have sold the SPDR Trust in order to own far safer allocated gold bars Another billionaire investor respected for his financial acumen is John Paulson  His company  Paulson   Co increased its holdings by 26  by purchasing an additional 4 53 million shares of the SPDR Gold Trust to bring the company s entire holding to 21 8 million shares  It was the first time Paulson   Co had increased its position in the SPDR Gold Trust since the first quarter of 2009  when the investment firm initially acquired 31 5 million shares  It means that Paulson s  21 billion hedge fund now has more than 44  of the company s assets allocated to gold Paulson  who became a billionaire in 2007 by betting against the US subprime mortgage market  lost 23  in his gold fund through July as lower bullion prices and slumping mining stocks led to losses The increased allocation by Paulson shows that he has much confidence that his allocation to gold will pay off in the long term  According to Bloomberg  Vinik Asset Management  the Boston based hedge fund founded by Jeffrey Vinik  who formerly ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund  FMAGX   cut its entire stake in the gold ETF  On March 30  the fund held 2 3 million shares  SEC data show  Eric Mindich s Eton Park Capital also sold all of its 739 117 shares last quarter  a filing showed Moore Capital Management LP acquired 120 000 shares of SPDR Gold Trust in the second quarter  a filing showed yesterday  The hedge fund held no shares in the gold fund as of March 31  Moore was also aggressive in selling financial and bank shares such as JP Morgan  JPM   Wells Fargo and US Bancorp Gold fell 4  in Q2 but the increased allocations show that some of the smartest money in the world continues to see gold as a buying opportunity  With the Fed having bought  2 3 trillion of debt in two rounds of  quantitative easing  and all major central banks keeping borrowing costs at a record low gold s fundamentals remain very sound  Soros  recent renewed allocation to gold has been far less trumpeted than his gold  bubble  remark and much trumpeted liquidation of gold holdings in May 2011  Some have suggested that Soros was misinterpreted regarding his gold bubble remark and may have meant that gold will in time become the  ultimate bubble  Alternatively  Soros wishes to accumulate a large position in gold prior to prices rising even further and was happy to help dissuade the retail public from entering the gold market until he owns a significant amount of gold  Some hedge fund managers have been known to talk down an investment while in the process of accumulating It could simply be that Soros has changed his opinion regarding gold and does not now view it as a  not safe    ultimate bubble   This seems likely as he has warned that there is a real risk of a euro break up and is on record regarding having deep concerns regarding the US fiscal situation   both of which are of course bullish for gold Paulson told clients in February that gold is his best long term bet  serving as protection against currency debasement  rising inflation and a possible breakup of the euro  Given Soros awareness of financial risk it is likely that he also owns physical bullion and not just the more high risk shares in the very public SPDR trust Other highly respected managers such as Kyle Bass  Greenlight Capital s David Einhorn and Third Point LLC s Daniel Loeb are on record as favouring more discrete ownership of actual physical gold bullion bars   in an allocated format in a secure vault We advise our clients   retail  pension and institutional   to do likewise and own physical gold bullion in the safest way possible
