34327,255842,CBSH,Lower Interest Rates To Hurt State Street  STT  Q4 Earnings,opinion,State Street   NYSE STT   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2019 results on Jan 17  before the market opens  While its revenues are expected to have declined in the quarter  earnings are likely to have witnessed year over year improvement In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results benefited from new investment servicing wins and growth in assets under management  AUM   partly offset by lower revenues State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  The company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters  with a positive surprise of 4 3   on average State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Moreover  its activities in the fourth quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings of  1 70 for the quarter has been raised 3 7  over the past 30 days  Also  the figure indicates rise of 1 2  from the year ago quarter s reported number The consensus estimate for fourth quarter sales is pegged at  2 92 billion  indicating a 2 1  year over year decline Now  let s check the factors that are likely to have impacted State Street s fourth quarter results Key Factors to NoteNet interest income  NII  may not offer support  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets is pegged at  185 1 billion for the fourth quarter  which suggests rise of 2 1  from the prior quarter s reported number  However  overall loan growth remained soft in the quarter  Thus  soft loan growth along with relatively lower interest rates is expected to have hurt the company s NII to some extent in the fourth quarter In fact  management expects NII in the fourth quarter to be down 3 5  sequentially Fee income growth likely to be modest  The fourth quarter witnessed a sequential decline in foreign exchange  FX  trading volatility and FX volumes  Given this  the company s FX trading revenues are expected to have declined in the quarter While the amount of securities on loans declined in the quarter due to relatively lower equity trading volumes  the spread between the three month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate expanded  Thus  State Street s securities finance revenues are likely to have been sequentially stable in the fourth quarter Nonetheless  supported by strong equity market performance  servicing and management fees are expected to have increased in the to be reported quarter Notably  the company expects servicing fees to be stable sequentially in the fourth quarter  while management fees are projected to be up 1 2  Total fee revenues are expected to increase 1 2  from the prior quarter  driven by seasonality related to the Charles River Development  CRD  buyout Expenses not of much help  State Street s expenses have remained elevated over the past few quarters mainly due to higher compensation and employee benefit costs as well as acquisition and restructuring costs While the company s expense saving program is expected to result in  400 million in cost savings in 2019 through workforce reduction  overall expenses are expected to have remained elevated in the fourth quarter  Moreover  management expects fourth quarter operating expenses  non GAAP basis  to remain flat sequentially Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model  it cannot be conclusively predicted whether State Street will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the

34334,255849,CBSH,Credit Card Strength To Aid Capital One s  COF  Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Capital One   NYSE COF   is slated to report fourth quarter and 2019 results on Jan 21  after market close  Quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have improved year over year In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results benefited from rise in non interest income and strength in card business  partly offset by higher costs and provisions  and decline in net interest income Further  Capital One has an impressive earnings surprise history  Its earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  the positive surprise being 5   on average Capital One Financial Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Despite improving consumer sentiments and decent lending scenario  lower interest rates remain a major concern for Capital One  Thus  the analysts seem to have a neutral stance on the stock The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged at  2 38 per share over the past seven days  Nonetheless  it indicates a jump of 27 3  from the year ago reported figure  The consensus estimate for revenues of  7 36 billion suggests 5  rise Factors at PlayMuted growth in net interest income  NII   Per the Fed s latest   consumer loans  specifically credit card loans recorded muted growth in the fourth quarter  This  along with lower interest rates  is likely to have had an adverse impact on Capital One s NII growth Nonetheless  Capital One s efforts to strengthen its card operations might have supported NII to some extent  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  350 7 billion suggests a 4 8  rise from the prior quarter reported figure  Thus  growth in NII is likely to have been weak Rise in fee income  As the quarter might have witnessed an increase in card usage  mainly attributable to holiday season   interchange fees  major part of its fee income  are likely to have risen  Thus  Capital One might have recorded an increase in fee income in the to be reported quarter Increase in expenses  Operating expenses are likely to have trended upward in the to be reported quarter  mainly due to the company s inorganic growth efforts and technology upgrades  Specifically  marketing expenses might have increased  given the rising loan growth opportunities With the momentum in domestic cards and retail deposits  management expects marketing costs for 2019 to be modestly high year over year  Further  it expects operating efficiency ratio  net of adjustments  to improve slightly in 2019  excluding the one time Walmart  NYSE WMT  launch and integration expenses Further  the data breach incident is likely to have had an unfavorable impact on Capital One s expense base in the to be reported quarter  Apart from additional costs related to notifying customers  the company s legal provisions might have increased Walmart partnership impact  In September 2019  Capital One launched the new Walmart co brand and private label cards  On Oct 11  it closed the acquisition of the existing Walmart card portfolio  with on boarding of  8 1 billion in loans Per management  due to the revenue and loss sharing provisions  the acquired Walmart portfolio is expected to affect the Domestic Card division s metrics  The acquired portfolio will reduce the division s revenue margin by nearly 35 basis points  bps  in the to be reported quarter Further  the portfolio is projected to lower the division s charge off rate by about 25 bps  while at the same time anticipate to increase its delinquency rate by roughly the same number  Also  Capital One had expected initial allowance build of roughly  85 million  which will be part of fourth quarter 2019 allowance Worsening asset quality  While improvement in card loans is leading to an increase in interest income  Capital One is expected to have witnessed a rise in credit card delinquency rates  Also  charge off rate in auto finance business might have increased The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net charge offs of  1 66 billion indicates 2 9  year over year rise Redemption of preferred shares  As the company redeemed outstanding preferred Series C and D stocks in December  it will result in a one time charge that will lead to nearly  30 million decline in net income available to common shareholders in the fourth quarter Now  let s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts Chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus

34335,255850,CBSH,Dismal Lending  Low Rates To Hurt Zions  ZION  In Q4 Earnings,opinion,Zions Bancorporation  National Association   NASDAQ ZION   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2019 results on Jan 21  after the market closes  Per the Fed s latest   the fourth quarter witnessed a decline in commercial and industrial loans  constituting a large part of the company s loan portfolio   In fact  growth in overall loans remained soft Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets is pegged at  65 2 billion for the fourth quarter  suggesting a marginal decline from the previous quarter s reported number Thus  due to soft loan growth along with decline in interest rates  Zions  net interest income  NII   which is its major revenue component  is expected to have been negatively impacted in the quarter The consensus estimate for NII for the fourth quarter is pegged at  559 million  indicating a decline of 1 4  sequentially  Moreover  the company expects NII to decrease marginally due to a slight decline in securities portfolio balances Management also anticipates net interest margin  NIM  to decline  owing to lower rates Now  let s check out some of the other factors that are likely to have influenced Zions  performance in the fourth quarter Other Factors to NoteFee revenues may not offer much support  The Federal Reserve s accommodative monetary policy and lower mortgage rates during the fourth quarter drove mortgage origination volumes and refinancing activities  Hence  the company s loan sales and servicing income are likely to have improved in the quarter Moreover  the consensus estimate for card fees of  25 million indicates rise of 4 2  sequentially However  while fixed income trading activities were good in the fourth quarter  foreign exchange trading volumes and volatility declined  Thus  Zions  capital markets and foreign exchange fees are not expected to have benefited in the quarter  The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at  21 75 million  which indicates a decline of 5 4  from the previous quarter s reported figure Also  the consensus estimate for commercial account fees of  30 50 million suggests a 1 6  decline sequentially The Zacks Consensus Estimate for wealth management and trust fees of  16 million indicates no change from the previous quarter s reported number Thus  total customer related fee is not expected to have improved in the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  139 million  which indicates a decline of nearly 1  sequentially Given the expectation of a decline in total customer related fees  accounting for more than 95  of total fee revenues   total fee revenues are likely to have been negatively impacted The consensus estimate for total non interest income for the fourth quarter is pegged at  145 million  which indicates a marginal decline from the prior quarter s reported number Expenses likely to rise modestly

Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Bank of America   NYSE BAC    PNC Financial   NYSE PNC    Commerce Bancshares  Inc    NASDAQ CBSH   and Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc    NYSE CFR   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Are Bank Stocks Worth Betting on After the Rate Cut In one of the most expected moves  the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 at the end of two day FOMC meeting  Now  the key interest rate stands in the 2 00 2 25  range following a cut of 25 basis points  bps  Though the move was in sync with expectations  it was not cheered by investors  The major exchanges   S P 500  Nasdaq and the Dow   all ended the day in red A slightly hawkish language was used by the officials in the statement  The FOMC statement said   As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate  it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  Later in the press conference  Chairman Jerome Powell  said   When you think about rate cutting cycles  they go on for a long time and the committee s not seeing that  Not seeing us in that place  You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot  That s not what we re seeing  Notably  heading in to the meeting  federal funds futures markets projected a 79 1  chance of 25 bps rate cut and a 20 1  chance of a 50 bps cut  Therefore  fears that this could be just a one off event and less aggressive rate cut stance seem to have sparked bearish investor sentiments Where Do Bank Stocks Stand Now Banks thrive in the rising rate environment  Hence  cut in interest rates put banks in a disadvantageous position  Almost all the banks  big and small  including JPMorgan  Bank of America and PNC Financial will be adversely impacted by lower interest rates Banks seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  As interest rates decline  they will earn less on lending  This compresses net interest margin  NIM    the main indicator of a bank s

34476,255991,CBSH,Fed Interest Rate Cut On The Horizon  What It Means For Banks,opinion,The Federal Reserve seems to be poised for the first interest rate cut since 2008  when the financial markets and the U S  economy collapsed  This is a stark change in position for the central bank  which raised rates four times last year and maintained a  patient  stance earlier this year The Fed chair  Jerome Powell  in the news conference at the end of two day FOMC meeting earlier this week  said that a clear picture on whether the economy requires easing monetarypolicy is expected  in the very near term   Markets seem to have already factored in that the Fed will cut rates at its July meeting  Per the CME Group  NASDAQ CME  FedWatch   the odds of a 25 basis point cut in interest rates in July are now almost 72   a jump from nearly 15  a month ago Moreover  a survey of the 17 Fed officials reflect that nearly 50  expect at least one rate cut this year  while seven project two cuts This time  the Fed officials kept the key interest rate in the 2 25 2 50  range  while stating that  uncertainties about this outlook have increased  In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures  the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  Trade WorriesOfficials acknowledged that the country s trade policy is creating significant uncertainties  specially the worsening trade war with China  Since the Fed s last policy meeting in May  trade war concerns have heightened as new tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports were introduced and trade talks collapsed  Though efforts are on to end the impasse  it is expected to take time Further  the Trump administration has plans to impose tariffs on Mexico  and has given Japan and Europe about six months to reach a trade agreement with the United States or face tariffs in the auto sector  All these factors have increased uncertainty among companies  leading to slowdown in factory production and moderating job growth Additionally  in its post meeting statement  Fed officials indicated  that economic activity is rising at a moderate  pace  a downgrade from a  solid  rate that the Fed used at its last meeting statement  Nevertheless  the officials still expect economy to grow at the rate of 2 1  in 2019 and 2  in 2020 Inflation ConcernMuted inflation is another cause of concern for the Fed  The central bank has failed to hit its 2  inflation target for quite a long time and the expectation of rise in inflation has fallen recently  Even the Fed officials have lowered the target to 1 5  from 1 8  in March This is the second time that the inflation target has been lowered  Earlier in March  it was lowered from 1 9  announced in December 2018 In the post meeting statement  Fed officials stated  On a 12 month basis  overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent  Market based measures of inflation compensation have declined  survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed  Impact on BanksBanks thrive in therising rate environment  So  cut in interest rates will place banks in the most disadvantageous position Banks seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  If interest rates decline  they will earn less on lending  This would compress net interest margins and hurt bottom line growth Hence  almost all the banks  big and small  including JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Bank of America   NYSE BAC    BB T Corp    NYSE BBT   and Zions Bancorporation   NASDAQ ZION   will be adversely impacted by lower interest rates Also  yield curve inversion   which has already occurred a few times over the past six months  seen as a warning of an impending economic slowdown or even recession  will hurt banks  financials Banks earn net interest income  NII  by charging borrowers higher long term interest rates while doling out smaller interest rates to depositors  As the yield curve inverts and the spreads between short and long term rates narrows  growth in banks  NII is expected to get hampered Another concern  though not directly related to the Fed rate cut  is slowdown in the global economy  This will hurt loan growth as demand is likely to remain muted Banks  financials  which depend on the health of the economy  will be hurt  So  banks  earnings  which have remained at record levels amid improving economy and higher interest rates  are likely to be affected While big banks might be able to overcome this challenging environment given their global operations and diversified revenue streams  smaller domestic banks like Commerce Bancshares  Inc    NASDAQ CBSH    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated   NASDAQ HBAN    Zions and Cullen Frost Bankers  Inc    NYSE CFR   will likely be more adversely impacted Nonetheless  cost savings and streamlining efforts  conservative loan policy  technology advancement and focus on improving other revenue sources are expected to support banks  financials to some extent  Also  these should aid in overcoming the impending downturn Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8

34486,256001,CBSH,5 Bank Stocks To Gain From A Slightly More Hawkish Fed,opinion,"Although the Fed didn t favor rising rates in November  there are enough reasons to bet on gradual rate hikes starting next month  The encouraging picture of the U S  economy in the third quarter  propelled by a strong job market and increased consumer spending has led the Fed to signal a rate hike next month 
Needless to say  a gradual increase in federal funds rate could boost the banking industry  Therefore this might be the best time to bet on a few solid bank stocks 
Fed Keeps Rates Unchanged in NovemberThe Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  decided to keep interest rates at bay last week  citing moderate growth of business fixed investment compared with significant growth earlier this year  The ongoing U S  China trade conflict could be a major reason behind the decline in business investments 
The Fed has therefore decided to maintain target range for the federal funds rate between 2 2 5   But the Fed sees a near perfect economic environment to gradually keep increasing rates in the near term 
Impressive U S  Economic GrowthStrong consumer spending  which accounts for 70  of the economy  drove the latter in the third quarter to put up its best annual performance in 13 years  The present scenario is indicative of fast growing spending by American households  The country s gross domestic product also grew at an annualized rate of 3 5  against Dow Jones economists  estimation of 3 4  for the same time frame 
Strong job gains and a declining unemployment rate led to substantial contributions as well  with the economy adding 250 000 new jobs in October across major industries  outpacing analysts  estimation of 190 000  The unemployment rate went down to a 48 year low of 3 7  in October 
American labor force participation inched up to 62 9  in October from September s 62 7   pointing to a rise in the number of working age people seeking jobs  The increased labor force participation can be considered as an indicator of candidates  confidence in the country s growing job market 
The Fed also noted that overall inflation and inflation for products excluding food and energy remained near 2  in the past year  The under control inflation therefore doesn t pose any risks to the economy  being roughly balanced 
Fourth Rate Hike Likely in DecemberPer a CNBC report  Fed funds futures market traders are now estimating a 93  probability for a federal funds rate hike in December 
Looking back at the Fed s September meeting  three rate hikes in 2019 are highly likely  As of now  the rate that the Fed pays on excess bank reserves will be maintained at 2 2  
Banking Industry to Benefit From Potential Rate Hike
Higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities 
Therefore  probability of gradual rate hikes from December is bound to increase banks  earnings  leading the banking industry to perform better

Stocks recently featured in the blog include Northern Trust Corp    NASDAQ NTRS    Commerce Bancshares  Inc    NASDAQ CBSH    Synovus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV    Webster Financial Corp    NYSE WBS   and Wintrust Financial Corp    NASDAQ WTFC   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Bet on These 5 Bank Stocks as Fed Grows More HawkishAt the end of the two day FOMC meeting on Wednesday  as expected by the markets  the Fed increased the interest rates to 1 75 2   Notably  the last time interest rate had topped 2  was in September 2008 The central bank s signaling of two more rate hikes this year was the major highlight  This takes the number of expected hikes to four in 2018 from its prior outlook of three In the statement  the Fed said   The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity  strong labor market conditions  and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term  The minor changes in the statement clearly indicated the Fed s more hawkish stance on monetary policy  While increasing the interest rates  the Fed indicated that the economy is growing at a  solid  pace  a change from May 2018 statement of economic growth being  moderate  The changes in the Fed s statement show that its policy will not likely be  accommodative  any longer What Led to the Rise in Number of Rate Hikes You might be wondering what changed in the few months that paved the way for increase in the number of hikes this year Well  the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  after the two day policy meeting said   The decision you see today is another sign that the U S  economy is in great shape  Most people who want to find jobs are finding them  The two key mandates for rising rates   full employment level and inflation of 2    have already been almost fulfilled  The current unemployment rate of 3 8  is close to the full employment level  Also  inflation data  moving toward the Fed s target  supports a further rise in rates Apart from these  a slew of favorable economic data  including increase in household spending  improvement in economic activities  stimulus from the tax cuts  rise in consumer confidence and better than expected GDP numbers  support this hawkish stance Also  the central bank now projects economic growth at the rate of 2 8  for 2018  up from the previous expectation of 2 7   Notably  the growth rate is anticipated to be 2 4  in 2019 and 2 0  in 2020  unchanged from the earlier guidance Further  based on the updated economic projections  the Fed expects inflation to be 2 1  this year  above its target of 2   The unemployment rate in 2018 is predicted to be 3 6   down from the prior forecast of 3 8   Also  it is estimated to decline to 3 5  in both 2019 and 2020  down from the previous projection of 3 6  for both years Banks Benefit from Rising Rate EnvironmentThe banking industry benefits the most from the rising rates  Banks derive benefits from a steep yield curve  widespread between short and long terms rates   A rise in short term rates  to which deposits are tied  helps banks charge more on loans  to which long term rates are tied   if the long term rates are higher than the short term ones  So  banks gain from rising interest rates only if the increase in long term rates is higher than the short term ones Also  rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy  And this implies that the credit quality is

results  Earnings of  1 07 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 14  However  the figure improved 8 1  on a year over year basis Results were hurt by an increase in expenses and lower non interest income along with continued margin pressure  Also  a significant increase in provision for credit losses was a negative factor  However  higher net interest income and stable loan balances were on the positive side Net income available to common shareholders for the reported quarter was  74 4 million  up from  68 6 million registered in the prior year quarter Net Interest Income Improves  Expenses RiseNet revenues of  181 2 million in the reported quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  184 8 million  Also  the figure decreased 1 1  from the prior year quarter Net interest income was  153 2 million  increasing nearly 1  year over year  The rise was primarily due to an increase in income on loans  partially offset by an increase in the average rate on interest bearing deposits and a decrease in loan discount accretion However  net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased 4 basis points  bps  to 3 16  Non interest income declined 9 4  year over year to  27 9 million  This fall was primarily due to lower mortgage income  nonsufficient fund fees  service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income Non interest expenses increased 2 6  year over year to  80 1 million  The rise was due to an increase in salaries and benefits costs  net occupancy and equipment costs along with credit and debit card  data processing and software amortization costs  Also  the company witnessed net loss on sale or write down of other real assets in the reported quarter Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31  2018  total loans were  10 billion

growth  supported by a strong balance sheet position  Also  steady improvement in asset quality should support its profitability  However  continued margin pressure  despite interest rate hikes

34630,256145,CBSH,5 Bank Stocks To Avoid Despite Favorable Rate Environment,opinion,"At present  the Fed interest rate is 1 25  and there is a very high chance of a hike at the end of the two day Federal Reserve Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting tomorrow  The market seems to have already factored in 25 basis points rise to 1 50  Now what matters most is the Fed s forecast for pace of interest rate raise in 2018 and its response to the tax reform bill The current FOMC meeting will be the last one for outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen  and the Fed is likely to keep its interest rate forecast intact  three hikes next year   as lagging inflation  still below 2   remains a concern  Thus  it is less likely that the central bank will pull up any surprises ahead of the transition to Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair in early 2018 But again  big changes are expected next year in the form of expected stimulus from the implementation of tax legislation  Following the massive tax rate cuts  from 35  to 20   for U S  businesses  the unemployment rate is likely to decline further from the present 4 1   driven by the assumption of more job creation Also  the Fed s concern related to low inflation will diminish as new jobs along with higher wage rate growth will likely lead to a rise in inflation rate to more than 2   Given these two favorable factors  there is a chance that the Fed may move the interest rate higher at a faster pace as economic growth improves further Nonetheless  whether it is three interest rates hikes or four  the finance sector as a whole  except REITs  benefits from the rising rates  with banks being the biggest beneficiaries  A steeper yield curve helps banks to increase revenues  Also  rising rates show an improving economy  As the banking industry is largely dependent of the nation s economy  this further supports profitability Bank Stocks to Avoid NowWhile several rate sensitive banks witnessed an uptick in net interest income and net interest margin following the hike in June  another rate hike will modestly support banks  top line growth  which has been under pressure amid a tough operating environment Profitability of banks was challenged by several matters including rising expense base  huge legal costs to resolve legacy issues and investments in technology upgrades   Further  for banks with global exposure  factors like negative interest rates in Japan and continued weakness in emerging markets have contributed to growth concerns Therefore  to overcome these challenges  banks continue to undertake defensive measures like slashing jobs  curtailing unprofitable non core businesses and reducing footprint  They are looking for avenues to diversify revenue sources  However  these are not adequate to generate stable returns in the near term  So  a rate hike is not likely to be enough to mitigate the larger woes in the banking industry Amid such a tough operating backdrop  we suggest avoiding certain banking stocks that don t look attractive even if there is a favorable rate hike environment going forward While it s not easy to select such stocks from the vast banking sector universe  we have taken the help of  to make this task relatively simpler We have shortlisted five banking stocks with a market capitalization of at least  3 billion and a  of D or F  Further  these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  You can see  Little Rock  AR based Bank of the Ozarks   NASDAQ OZRK   currently has a Zacks Rank  4 and VGM Score of D  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has declined marginally for 2017 and 2018  over the last 60 days  Further  so far this year  the stock has lost 12 7  against  s rise of 3 3

34633,256148,CBSH,Prosperity Bancshares  PB  Misses On Q4 Earnings  Stock Up,opinion,Prosperity Bancshares Inc    NYSE PB   released its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results  Adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share for the quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  The figure was in line with the prior year quarter s earnings Results were hurt by an increase in expenses and lower non interest income along with continued margin pressure  However  higher net interest income and improving loan and deposit balances were on the positive side  It is probably due to these favorable factors that shares of the company gained 1 9  following the release After taking into consideration a one time non cash charge of 2 cents per share relating to the Tax Act  net income for the quarter came in at  67 1 million or 97 cents per share For 2017  net income was  272 2 million or  3 92 per share  down from  274 5 million or  3 94 per share registered in 2016 Net Interest Income Improve  Expenses RiseNet revenues of  185 3 million for the reported quarter marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  185 4 million  However  the figure increased 1 1  from the prior year quarter Net revenues for 2017 were  733 5 million  decreasing 2 3  from the prior year  Also  the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  738 million Net interest income was  156 1 million for the quarter  increasing 1 4  year over year  The rise was primarily due to an increase in average balance and yield on interest earning assets  partially offset by an increase in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities However  net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased 6 basis points  bps  to 3 20  Non interest income declined nearly 1  year over year to  29 2 million  This fall was primarily due to lower mortgage income  brokerage income and net gain on sale of assets Non interest expenses increased 2 5  year over year to  81 1 million  The company witnessed net loss on sale or write down of other real assets in the quarter against net gain recognised in the prior year period  which mainly led to the rise in expenses Loans   Deposits IncreaseAs of Dec 31

assets was 1 20   down from 1 26  in the prior year quarter  Similarly  annualized return on common equity was 7 04  compared with 7 58  in the prior year quarter Our ViewpointProsperity Bancshares remains well positioned for organic growth  supported by a strong balance sheet position  Also  steady improvement in asset quality should support the company s profitability  However  continued margin pressure  despite interest rate hikes  remains a major concern  Also  the bank s strategy to grow inorganically may lead to higher merger related charges  resulting in a rise in operating

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which after tying up the second quarter and heading into the Fourth of July Holiday Weekend  sees equities have held up well  but with a first crack in the armor for the QQQ 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate sideways while Crude Oil continues higher short term  The US Dollar Index is weak and looks to continue lower while US Treasuries are also biased lower after a reversal  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with risk that Emerging Markets may continue to consolidate in the short run 
Volatility looks to remain at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts are more mixed than they have been with the QQQ showing some signs of weakness on both timeframes while the SPY and IWM are still strong  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

ETF Watch
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  as the market closes out the quarter and move into October sees the equity markets still looking weak 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its short term uptrend while crude oil consolidates  The US Dollar Index also looks to continue broad consolidation while US Treasuries are biased lower in consolidation  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its consolidation in the downtrend while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside  Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s  NYSE SPY    NYSE IWM  and  NASDAQ QQQ  
Their charts suggest there may be more pain with the SPY looking the worst on the short term basis and the IWM and QQQ possibly catching a break and just consolidating  The longer term all look a bit stronger but nothing to have a party about with more downside risk as well  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

34741,256256,CBSH,Top 5 Stocks With Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,"Earnings are perhaps the most significant metric for an organization  Substantial earnings growth indicates the affluence of a company  Earnings are essentially revenues that the company makes after subtracting cost of production over a given period of time  Upbeat earnings results generally lead to an increase in the share price 
But instead of looking only at the most recent quarter s earnings  one should also focus on earnings acceleration  And why is this so  It s because earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price 
Spotting Future Outperformers
Earnings acceleration is basically incrementally growing earnings per share  EPS  of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period  it can be called earnings acceleration   
Moreover  picking stocks on the basis of earnings growth will lead you to pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  However  earnings acceleration will help you to select stocks that have yet to see significant investor attention and the consequent solid price increase  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 
Increasing the percentage of earnings growth can often be the difference between good stocks and great stocks  It means that the company is basically sound and has been on the right track for a sustained period of time  On the other hand  sideways percentage of earnings growth can potentially signal a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times send prices down 
Hence  investment in stocks having solid earnings acceleration is a profitable strategy 
The Winning Strategy 
Let s look for stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 
EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  
EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  
EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3

34743,256258,CBSH,TCF Financial  TCB  Beats On Q2 Earnings As Revenues Rise,opinion,TCF Financial Corporation   NYSE TCB   delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6 9  in the second quarter of 2016 on the back of higher revenues  Earnings per share of 31 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents  Moreover  the figure reflects a 6 9  rise from the year ago quarter Results benefited from an increase in net interest and non interest income  The company witnessed a continued rise in deposits in the quarter and maintained a strong capital position  However  escalated expenses and provisions along with decreased loan balances were on the downside The company reported net income of  57 7 million  up 10 3  from the prior year quarter  Revenue Rise Exceeded Expense GrowthTotal revenue was  331 million  up 3 6  from the year ago quarter  However  the figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Net interest income rose 3 4  year over year to  213 million  The increase was owing to higher average loan and lease balances in the auto finance and inventory finance portfolios  higher average balances of securities available for sale  and loans and leases held for sale  These were partially pulled down by the run off of consumer real estate first mortgage lien loan balances  overall net margin compression and higher promotional rates paid on certificates of deposit Net interest margin slipped 9 basis points  bps  year over year to 4 4  due to higher rates paid on certificates of deposit and margin compression resulting from the impact of the persistent low interest rate environment Non interest income totaled  118 million  up 4  year over year  The income drivers were a rise in servicing fee income  card revenue  and equipment   lease financing income  other income and absence of net losses on securities  These were  however  partially offset by lower ATM revenue  reduced gains on sales of auto loans as well as consumer real estate loans  and reduced fees and service charges  reflecting changes in consumer behavior  as well as higher average checking account balances per customer Non interest expenses came in at  227 3 million  reflecting an increase of 2  from the prior year quarter  The rise was mainly led by all components  except FDIC insurance and net foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets Credit Quality  A Mixed BagNet charge offs  as a percentage of average loans and leases  plunged 18 bps year over year to 0 2   The decline was mainly attributable to an improved credit quality in the consumer real estate portfolios Moreover  non accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned were  232 3 million  marking an 11 9  decrease year over year  The decline was due to increased sales of consumer real estate and consumer properties  better credit quality trends  and initiative undertaken to actively resolve problem loans in the commercial real estate portfolio However  provisions for credit losses were up 5 8  year over year at  13 3 million  It reflected reserve build tied with growth in the auto finance  leasing and equipment finance and inventory finance portfolios as well as changes in economic outlook  partially offset by decreased net charge offs and improved credit quality in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios Balance Sheet Reflects a Mixed Picture  Capital Ratios StrengthenAs of Jun 30  2016  average deposits totaled  17 2 billion  compared with  16 9 billion as of Mar 31  2016  Average loans and leases amounted to  17 7 billion  down from  17 8 billion as of Mar 31  2016 As of Jun 30  2016  Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10 2   up from 10  at the end of the prior quarter  Total risk based capital ratio was 13 7   compared with 13 6  as of Mar 31  2016  Tier 1 leverage capital ratio came in at 10 4  compared with 10 3  as of Mar 31  2016 Our ViewpointConsistent top line improvement reflects the company s strong standing in the market  At the same time  a strengthening capital position and improving credit quality are expected to favor the company s future growth  Moreover  we believe the company s efforts to reduce balance sheet risk and diversify the loan portfolio will augur well for its earnings in the subsequent quarters  Also  steady improvement in the economy will support the company s future performance However  we remain apprehensive owing to several issues including an expanding cost base  margin pressure and a stringent regulatory landscape  TCF FINL CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   TCF Financial currently
