3593,225108,BVSN,Trading Lessons  The Mountain Top Is Lonely,opinion,"This story is part III of my trading lessons series 
I ve been to the top of what is called  trading nirvana   a place where I thought I would have plenty of company  Back in my early trading days  I thought there was nothing bad that could touch me  As you recall from a previous article where I turned a small sum of 7K into a nice amount over half a million in just a few years  This was  it  for me  and while it was far from a fortune I could live on the rest of my days  I certainly believed it was a great start  Perhaps I was lucky and found a winning lottery ticket and cashed it in 
We could certainly say  right place at the right time   a success if we measure the size of our profit loss  But how do we handle this success  Are we just stubborn  greedy and full of hubris  Do we freeze up and panic at the sign of trouble  or just ignore any warnings   believing we can repel any dangers as if we were made of teflon 
When we get caught in a bubble and make a tremendous amount of money  it is tough to leave that party  Who would ever want to get off that ride  But  unfortunately that choice is not often made voluntarily  For me  the ride started to shake at the start of 2000 and came to a rough ending the following summer 
After barely making it out alive from the Spring of 2000  when the markets cratered  Nasdaq dropped 26  one week in April alone  I was determined to move ahead  This bit of a correction was not going to bother me  after all it took me 3  years to earn a nice fortune   how could I lose it in just a few short weeks  The stock BroadVision  NASDAQ BVSN  was one that I tracked for years  and while I had emptied my tank of all things  dotcom  this one still had my eye 
I amassed a good quantity of stock  about 7000 shares in early 2000 and Broadvision started to move nicely higher  I had only a handful of other names left  and after the carnage in the Spring had about 1 3 of my nice account left  That was enough to get back up in my mind  and Broadvision was going to be the horse I would ride to the finish line  Or so I thought 
Come July  the stock was in the low 50s  I was still on margin with this name but feeling quite confident  One Friday morning  I awoke and turned on my computer only to find this stock down 7 bucks  I was horrified  It had to be some mistake  right  I scoured for news  but could find nothing  It was about 90 minutes before the open  on CNBC all i could see was the symbol  BVSN  going across the ticker losing ground every second  I would beside myself  and with no protection on I started to count the losses in my head   Calm down  Bob   it ll come back just be patient  
I could not soothe myself enough  as the stock opened down nine bucks and sold harder the rest of the day  The news  Broadvision lost a contract to competitor Art Technology Group  That was enough to sink the company 20   I held on  and the pain got worse  I ended up selling all the shares end of day when the stock hit the low  down 13 75 on the session  That was a loss of nearly 100K in one day  in one name  It made for a difficult but reflective weekend 
Lesson learned  Too much exposure to one name  no diversification   trading on margin is a no no at all times  and always have some protection on  The lessons learned from this trading experience have made me a better trader today  even though it was more than fifteen years ago ",2016-04-04,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-lessons:--the-mountain-top-is-lonely-200123804,200123804

on Friday   All of the major averages closed out the trading week with very healthy gains as risk appetite continues to be brisk on Wall Street  Friday s modest rally was driven by an upbeat nonfarm

since December 2008  Major Averages The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 68 points  or 0 47 percent  to a new record close of 14 397   The S P 500 rose 7 points  or 0 47 percent  to 1 551   The Nasdaq Composite gained 12 points  or 0 38 percent  to close at 3 244   Nonfarm Payrolls Positive market sentiment was driven in large part by a strong nonfarm payrolls report on Friday  For February  nonfarm payrolls added 236 000 jobs versus 119 000 jobs added in January  This figure was significantly ahead of consensus expectations of 165 000 jobs gained in the month   The private sector added 246 000 jobs in February versus a gain of 140 000 in January  The consensus had expected private nonfarm payrolls to expand by 178 000 jobs last month   Unemployment Rate The uptick in job creation in February led to a decline in the unemployment rate from 7 9 percent in January to 7 7 percent last month  Consensus estimates called for the unemployment rate to remain unchanged  At 7 7 percent  unemployment is at its lowest level since December 2008    a strong sign for the economy   Hourly Earnings and Average Work Week The good news extended to average hourly earnings and average weekly hours worked  Hourly earnings rose 0 2 percent in February versus a gain of 0 1 percent in January   The average work week went from 34 4 hours in January to 34 5 hours in February  The gain in hours

TLT  had fallen another 1 percent to  114 80  The TLT is now down almost 8 percent in just 3 months  time as investors have been selling bonds amid a stock market rally  The fall in prices caused yields to rise   Although the yield on the 2 Year Note remained steady at 0 25 percent  the yield on the 5 Year Note jumped four basis points to 0 89 percent   The 10 Year Note yield climbed six basis points on the day to 2 06 percent while the 30 Year Bond yield rose five basis points to 3 25 percent   Currencies A sharp rise in the greenback on Friday did not deter investors from buying stocks  Near the close  the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF  UUP   which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of foreign currencies  was up 0 76 percent to  22 56  adding to its recent gains   The closely watched EUR USD pair was last trading down 0 81 percent to  1 3001 as the euro attempts to hold above a key support level  The British Pound also fell 0 61 percent against

3600,225115,BVSN,BroadVision  A Small Cap Trading Way Below Cash Value ,opinion,BroadVision  Inc   BVSN  is a great low risk small cap company in my opinion  Well  as low risk as a small cap can be  While I do not subscribe to fundamental valuations on stocks  I cannot deny this one  The company has over  11 per share   52 million  in cash and is only trading at  8 67 per share  That means it could move as high as  11 00 and still only be trading at cash value  With over  52 million in cash  they are only burning  5 million a year  This means  they have 10 years in cash or ten years to make something big happen  They hold no debt and the float is small  This is a software company that has major potential not only for big deals but also for a possible larger player to scoop them up On the technical side  the company recently traded as high as  11 89  It has since fallen back to its key gap fill  note the chart below   In terms of risk to reward  this has about as much reward with small risk as any small cap  Based on these factors  I bought some in this lower range  looking for a pop back to cash value to sell half  while holding the rest for a move higher Disclosure  Gareth Soloway is long BVSN ,2013-04-03,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broadvision:-a-small-cap-trading-way-below-cash-value-161359,161359
3601,225116,BVSN,Beware Of Parabolic Charts,opinion,Many traders and investors love to see and find a good breakout pattern on the charts  While such patterns are great  we ve got to know when they become parabolic  That s because parabolic charts often signal the time to sell out of the trade Parabolic DefinedA parabolic chart is when a stock price rallies sharply higher in a very steep angle on the charts  Often  when a stock surges sharply higher without pulling back  it can only travel so far before the owner of that equity starts to sell out of the position  Don t Chase Extended Equity For example  the other day First Solar Inc   FSLR  soared after reporting better than expected guidance  Many short sellers were caught off guard causing a short squeeze in the stock  which rallied higher by  14 on the day from around  27 to  41 intra day  That type of surge is what we would call a parabolic intra day move  Now we can only wonder who was buying the stock at  41 after such an enormous intra day bounce  Some of the buyers were short sellers that had to close out their position while others were likely the misinformed retail traders trying to catch the momentum in the stock  Either way  when you see an equity rally in that type of steep formation  it s unsustainable and the equity will pullback  Today  FSLR stock is trading around the  37 level  The idea here is to make sure that you do not chase the equity when it reaches extended levels  Traders should wait for it to pullback and form a pattern that will signal further upside   Another good example that occurred recently is the chart on Bitcoin  the virtual currency that has soared recently from under  10 to more than  200  Many investors and traders are asking why the virtual currency sold off so sharply after trading above the  200 level  The reason is the same as any other equity    it traded in an unsustainable parabolic manner   In March 2012  the same type of pattern occurred in a stock called Broadvision Inc   BVSN   This stock surged from  10 a share to  55 in just two months  That type of pattern is again unsustainable and the traders and investors that caught the move are going to sell out of the position at the highs  That stock plunged from a high of  55 a share back down to  10 in just three months  Watch The Steep Angles The same parabolic patterns repeat over and over throughout history on all time frames  Traders and investors must simply know that it is not prudent to chase an equity when the chart pattern moves up in a very steep angle  Knowing this pattern should help to keep a lot of novice traders and investors out of buying equities that have already made their momentum move ,2013-04-11,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beware-of-parabolic-charts-162654,162654
