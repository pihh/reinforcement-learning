2718,224233,CRAI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  DaVita  Quanta Services  CRA International  NRG Energy And First American Financial,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA    Quanta Services Inc    NYSE PWR    CRA International Inc    NASDAQ CRAI    NRG Energy Inc    NYSE NRG   and First American Financial Corp    NYSE FAF   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Shrug Off Market Gyrations with These Top 5 Value PicksAfter an exponential rise in the first half of November  Wall Street has entered into a correction mode this week following news that trade related negotiations between the United States and China are in danger of hitting an impasse  The much hyped first phase of the U S  China trade deal is reportedly to be delayed to next year instead of it being signed in mid November Following these developments  the three major stock indexes   the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite   declined 0 4   0 4  and 0 5   respectively  on Nov 20  However  the stable economic fundamentals of the United States have raised the possibility that recent stock market volatility may be a transitory phase and markets will continue their long term uptrends once trade issues are solved Markets are likely to remain range bound in the near term  A strong rally is unlikely for as long as this trade conflict continues  However  the downside potential will be limited owing to U S  economic strength  Meanwhile  volatile trading may become a regular phenomenon in Wall Street  At this stage  it makes good sense to buy those stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes Trade Talk is Reportedly in JeopardyOn Nov 20  Reuters reported citing people close to the White House that completion of a  phase one  U S  China trade deal could delayed next year  The Wall Street Journal also reported that the Trump administration s desire to sign a partial trade deal with China may not be fruitful this year citing former administration officials and others sources in White House On Oct 11  President Trump declared that the two countries have reached an  agreement in principle  to sign a partial trade deal by mid November  Meanwhile  on Nov 13  The Wall Street Journal reported that the deadlock in the trade related negotiation continues regarding the withdrawal of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods and China s earlier commitment about purchasing  50 billion agricultural products from the United States The Chinese administration is also resisting requests from the White House to curb forceful transfer of intellectual properties as well as enforcement mechanisms  Meanwhile  on Nov 19  Trump has threatened to hike the existing tariff rate to 30  from 25  on  250 billion Chinese goods and impose tariff of  160 billion on fresh Chinese goods if the trade deal is not signed by mid December Political Conflict in Hong KongOn Nov 19  in a unanimous vote  the U S  Senate passed the legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong   Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act  was passed in Senate following a crackdown by the Chinese government on a pro democracy protest movement in Hong Kong On Nov 20  China s foreign ministry criticized the United States for unanimously passing a bill supporting Hong Kong protesters  China alleges that this bill is interference by the United States in China s democratic affairs  Several economists are concerned that geopolitical issues in Hong Kong may further heighten the ongoing trade conflict Our Top PicksAt this stage  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability  Thus

2765,224280,CRAI,Here s Why You Should Hold FLEETCOR  FLT  In Your Portfolio,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed by tough market conditions 
Here we discuss about FLEETCOR Technologies  Inc    NYSE FLT    a financial transaction services provider  which has had an impressive run on the bourse on a year to date basis  Shares of FLEETCOR have surged 57 3  on a year to date basis compared with the 40 2  rally of the  it belongs to and 18 7  rise of the Zacks S P 500 composite 

 
The company has long term expected earnings per share  three to five years  growth rate of 15 6   Moreover  earnings are expected to register 12 3  growth in 2019 and 15 4  in 2020 
Factors Driving FLEETCOR 
FLEETCOR s top line continues to grow organically driven by increase in both volume and revenues per transaction in some of its payment programs  In second quarter 2019  organic revenue growth was 13   driven by solid double digit growth across the company s product categories   fuel  corporate payments  tolls and lodging 
Its fuel card business was up 9   corporate payments increased 26   toll business grew 17  and lodging business increased 13  organically  Organic revenue growth was 10   9  and 8  respectively in 2018  2017 and 2016  For 2019  the company continues to expect 9 11  organic growth 
The company has also been active on the acquisition front  In 2019 so far  FLEETCOR completed the purchase of SOLE Financial and Nvoicepay  SOLE Financial is expected to extend FLEETCOR s payroll and card portfolios and expand its addressable market  thus enabling it better serve small and medium sized as well as larger businesses  Nvoicepay is expected to expand FLEETCOR s corporate payments business with full disbursement accounts payable cloud platform 
Since 2002  the company has acquired more than 75 companies and commercial account portfolios  It has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies in the United States as well as internationally to expand customer base  headcount and operations and diversify its service offerings across industries 
Effective execution led to cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of  1 49 billion as of Jun 30  2019  with no long term debt to clear off  This significant amount of cash provides FLEETCOR the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and other related investments 
Risks
In spite of significant growth prospects  FLEETCOR is not free from headwinds  Higher interest expense stemming from increase in LIBOR rate and additional borrowings for share repurchase and to fund Cambridge acquisition  completed in 2017  have been weighing on the company s earnings  FLEETCOR s fuel card  workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses are affected by seasonality 
Global presence makes it vulnerable to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  Its policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
FLEETCOR currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Some better ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Huron Consulting   NASDAQ HURN    Charles River Associates   NASDAQ CRAI   and Fiserv   NASDAQ FISV    While Fiserv sports a Zacks Rank  1  Huron Consulting and Charles River Associates carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

2784,224299,CRAI,Is CRA International  CRAI  A Profitable Stock To Pick ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  CRA International   NASDAQ CRAI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CRA International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 40  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 89  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level CRA International puts current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 21 88  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 34  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that CRA International has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 79  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  has a P S ratio of about 0 98  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 44 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CRA International currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CRAI a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too For example  the PEG ratio for CRA International is just 1 37  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 41  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 98  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 16 25  Clearly  CRA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall 
Though CRA International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives CRAI a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while current year estimate has seen three upward and no downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has improved 5 4  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has climbed 13 1  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CRA International Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCRA International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  Top 6  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market  Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2019-12-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cra-international-crai-a-profitable-stock-to-pick-200494072,200494072

2868,224383,CRAI,5 Top Business Services Stocks To Buy As Job Gains Rebound ,opinion,"In March  job additions recovered significantly from a slump encountered in the preceding month  Hiring breezed past estimates  allaying fears that an economic slump was in the works  While some areas of weakness were clearly visible  healthcare and professional and technical services emerged as the leading recruiters With the year s sluggish start behind us  investors can now focus on the positive aspects of the U S  economy  Expansion is indeed taking place at a slower rate and the pace of hiring has also declined But wages continue to rise even as unemployment remains flat at a record low  Investing in business services stocks  among the top hiring sectors in March  looks prudent now Hiring Recovers  Unemployment Flat at 50 Year LowThe U S  economy added 196 000 jobs in March  easily exceeding the consensus estimate of 184 000  February s dismal hiring numbers were revised upward from 20 000 to 33 000  January s job gains were also revised marginally upward to 312 000  These revisions took the first quarter s average job gains to a solid 180 000 The rebound in hiring ensured that the unemployment rate for March was unchanged at a 50 year low of 3 8   The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and those only sporadically looking for jobs  also remained flat at 7 3   This represents a marginal decline from the year ago level of 7 9  Meanwhile  average hourly earnings increased 4 cents to  27 70  The year over year increase in earnings declined from 3 4  to 3 2   But even then  wages continue to increase at their fastest pace in a decade A large swathe of economists thinks yearly wage gains will hit 4  in the near term  This clearly serves to illustrate how tight hiring conditions are at the moment Healthcare  White Collar Firms Lead HiringMarch s gains were largely broad based  Food services and drinking places added 27 000 jobs  in keeping with their average gains over the past 12 months  Employment in construction remained flat at 16 000 However  the sector has added 246 000 jobs over the past 12 months  In February  builders were forced to reduce hiring by the most in 18 months due to extremely cold weather Healthcare  and professional and technical services led jobs gains  Employment in healthcare increased by 49 000 jobs in March and nearly 400 000 in the past 12 months  Professional and technical services added 34 000 jobs last month  The sector has created 311 000 jobs over the past 12 months Last month  employment in computer systems design and related services increased by 12 000  Management and technical consulting services and architectural and engineering services added 6 000 jobs each Our ChoicesMarch s jobs report will go a long way in restoring confidence in the U S  economy  Retail sales and housing data weighed on consumer sentiment recently  though the former metric has registered a revival  Economic conditions look favorable once again and are likely to be aided by the Fed s dovish stance This is why it makes good sense to add business services stocks to your portfolio  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and good VGM Score  You can see  Clean Harbors  Inc    NYSE CLH   is a leading

Incidentally  professional and business services have contributed the highest number of jobs in the past 12 months  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Smallest

Services PicksIn October  the unemployment rate remained flat at a 49 year low  However  job additions widely exceeded expectations  indicating that the economy remains robust late into the expansion  The spurt in job gains came after a disappointing September  during which fierce storms impeded job gains  However  job additions for August were revised significantly upward Meanwhile  wage gains exceeded 3  for the first time since the Great Recession ended in the middle of 2009  Job gains were led by healthcare  manufacturing and transportation and warehousing  However  professional and business services have contributed the largest number of jobs over the past year  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Unemployment Flat at 49 Year LowThough job additions for October widely exceeded expectations  the unemployment rate remained flat at 3 7   the lowest since December 1969  The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and people only sporadically looking for jobs  declined from 7 5  to 7 4  Additionally  the number of employed individuals increased to a record level of 156 6 million  The employment population ratio increased by 0 2  to 60 6   its highest level since December 2008  Also  the labor force participation rate increased by 0 2  to 62 9  Notably  the increase in the labor force participation rate was not accompanied by a jump in the number of unemployed persons  which remained flat at 6 1 million  The number of individuals not considered to be part of the labor force declined by 487 000 to 95 9 million Professional and Business Services Post Highest Yearly GainsThe economy added 250 000 jobs in October  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 193 000  Over the last 12 months  the economy has added 211 000 jobs per month on average  These gains have come despite indications from several quarters that the economy is near full employment In September  job gains plummeted  primarily due to the effect of fierce storms such as Hurricane Florence  The figure was revised further downward from 134 000 to 118 000  However  this was totally offset by the upward revision in the August figure  which has been increased from 270 000 to 286 000 At the forefront of job gains were healthcare  manufacturing  construction and transportation and warehousing  which added 36 000  32 000  30 000 and 25 000 jobs  respectively Professional and business services added 35 000 jobs  Notably  the industry has added 516 000 jobs over the past year  the highest among all those covered by the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Our ChoicesThe significant improvement in job additions for October indicates that the economy remains robust even at such a late point in the expansion  The unemployment rate remains flat at a record low even as the labor force participation rate inches up Overall professional and business services have provided the highest number of job additions over the past 12 months  Adding stocks from this sector looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value

2898,224413,CRAI,5 Top Ranked Small Cap Stocks To Escape Trade Tension,opinion,Wall Street has seen a nasty spell of trading over the past several months  pulling the major indices down for the year  This is because global trade worries  threats of inflation  concerns over speedy tightening of monetary policy  and the ongoing political turmoil in Washington continued to provide resistance On the other hand  macro fundamentals paint a rosy picture given that the U S  economy has entered its second longest expansion since 1785  This is especially thanks to higher consumer spending  rising consumer confidence  low borrowing cost  growing wages  and solid hiring  In particular  consumers were more confident in April  with the consumer confidence index rebounding to an 18 year high  indicating solid economic growth prospects Additionally  President Donald Trump is betting on juicy growth through  1 5 trillion in tax cuts and fresh government spending  If this wasn t enough  strong earnings expectation will provide further lift to the stocks Against such a backdrop  small cap stocks could be an excellent choice for investors seeking a top pick in today s market environment Why Small Caps Small caps are closely tied to the U S  economy and do not have much exposure to the international market  These stocks generally lead the market when the American economy is on a solid footing Small cap stocks are the biggest beneficiaries of the tax cut as these pay higher taxes with a median effective tax rate of 31 9   In comparison  the larger  multi national companies on the S P 500 pay a lower median effective tax rate of 28   while the tax rate for 30 mega cap stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is even low at 23 8  The pint sized stocks are considered safe and better plays if any political issue or economic turmoil creeps into the picture  As such  these could well insulate investors from any trade woes  in particular U S  China trade dispute or NAFTA negotiations  Further  these stocks are poised to benefit from the strength in the greenback  the trend is being seen lately due to rising yields Since these companies are small  they are poised to grow more than their already tapped out large cap counterparts  However  they are extremely volatile and could lead to huge losses compared with large and mid cap counterparts in a short span How to Play As a result  we have chosen those small caps stock that have a top Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Growth Score of A  solid Industry Rank in the top 40   positive earnings estimate revision for fiscal 2018 over the past 30 days and double digit earnings growth for fiscal 2018  All these suggest their continued outperformance in the coming months   You can see  Rocky Brands Inc    NASDAQ RCKY  It is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear and apparel marketed under a portfolio of well recognized brand names including Rocky Outdoor Gear  Georgia Boot  Durango  Lehigh  and the licensed brand  Dickie  The company has seen positive earnings estimate revision of 10 cents for this year over the past month  and has an expected earnings

2900,224415,CRAI,Unemployment Falls To Near 18 Year Low  6 Winning Picks,opinion,In April  the unemployment rate declined to the lowest level witnessed since December 2000  Further  economists indicated that the rate of hiring would likely decline further in the months ahead  Job additions also increased compared to March  though it remained clear that the pace of hiring was undergoing a decline Such a phenomenon is in keeping with a labor market near full employment  Professional and business services led job gains  followed by healthcare and manufacturing  With jobs gains likely to continue in the months ahead  picking stocks from these sectors looks like a prudent option at this point Unemployment Falls to Near 18 Year Low The unemployment rate declined from 4 1  in March to 3 9  in April  the lowest level in nearly 18 years  This pace is also marginally higher than the Federal Reserve s targeted rate of 3 8   This is the first time in six months that the unemployment rate has undergone a decline Incidentally  joblessness has fallen below 4  on very few occasions in the last 70 years  This occurred during the Korean War  the Vietnam War and the dotcom boom in the late sixties  early seventies and in 2000  respectively  In contrast  unemployment had hit 10  in October 2009 when the U S  economy was still recovering from the Great Recession   A section of economists feels that the decline in the unemployment rate was partially attributable to a marginal fall in the labor participation rate  which declined from 62 9  to 62 8   However  most economists expect that the unemployment rate will undergo further declines  Currently  the labor market is increasingly tightening and the Fed has projected a jobless rate of 3 6  for 2019  Professional and Business Services Lead GainsThe economy added 164 000 jobs in April  lower than the consensus estimate of 194 000  However  job additions for March were revised upward from 103 000 to 135 000  During 2018  job additions have registered an average pace of 200 000 jobs per month  higher than last year s average pace of 182 000 At the forefront of job gains were healthcare and manufacturing  Each of these sectors added 24 000 jobs  In the last 12 months  these sectors have added 305 000 and 245 000 jobs  respectively  However  leading the pack was the professional and business services sector which added 54 000 jobs  The sector has added 518 000 jobs in the last 12 months Our ChoicesThe decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened  This is also probably why job additions have declined to a pace lower than those witnessed early this year  However  most economists think job additions will continue and the unemployment rate will decline further Professional and business services  healthcare and manufacturing have been the biggest gainers according to the April jobs report  Adding stocks from these sectors looks like a smart choice at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three

expectations  indicating that the economy remains robust late into the expansion  The spurt in job gains came after a disappointing September  during which fierce storms impeded job gains  However  job additions for August were revised significantly upward Meanwhile  wage gains exceeded 3  for the first time since the Great Recession ended in the middle of 2009  Job gains were led by healthcare  manufacturing and transportation and warehousing  However  professional and business services have contributed the largest number of jobs over the past year  This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this domain to your portfolio Unemployment Flat at 49 Year LowThough job additions for October widely exceeded expectations  the unemployment rate remained flat at 3 7   the lowest since December 1969  The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and people only sporadically looking for jobs  declined from 7 5  to 7 4  Additionally  the number of employed individuals increased to a record level of 156 6 million  The employment population ratio increased by 0 2  to 60 6   its highest level since December 2008  Also  the labor force participation rate increased by 0 2  to 62 9  Notably  the increase in the labor force participation rate was not accompanied by a jump in the number of unemployed persons  which remained flat at 6 1 million  The number of individuals not considered to be part of the labor force declined by 487 000 to 95 9 million Professional and Business Services Post Highest Yearly GainsThe economy added 250 000 jobs in October  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 193 000  Over the last 12 months  the economy has added 211 000 jobs per month on average  These gains have come despite indications from several quarters that the economy is near full employment In September  job gains plummeted  primarily due to the effect of fierce storms such as Hurricane Florence  The figure was revised further downward from 134 000 to 118 000  However  this was totally offset by the upward revision in the August figure  which has been increased from 270 000 to 286 000 At the forefront of job gains were healthcare  manufacturing  construction and transportation and warehousing  which added 36 000  32 000  30 000 and 25 000 jobs  respectively Professional and business services added 35 000 jobs  Notably  the industry has added 516 000 jobs over the past year  the highest among all those covered by the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Our ChoicesThe significant improvement in job additions for October indicates that the economy remains robust even at such a late point in the expansion  The unemployment rate remains flat at a record low even as the labor force participation rate inches up Overall professional and business services have provided the highest number of job additions over the past 12 months  Adding stocks from this sector looks like a smart choice at this point  However

Strong International Business   CDG Acquisition are Key Growth Drivers
The company s ability to bring together damage assessment  accounting  economics  statistics and finance industries under a single umbrella makes it an excellent partner for global clients dealing with international arbitration issues  Further  FTI Consulting continues to pursue opportunities in other areas like   business transformation services  transaction advisory business  retail  construction  data and analytics  cyber business  information governance and international arbitration 
This  in turn  leads to continued revenue growth  We believe FTI Consulting s international expansion remains strong and is likely to continue in the future as well 
Increased regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation are also likely to raise the demand for the company s products  Additionally  structural change has become a necessity in the rapidly evolving global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals  protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M A  divestiture and other restructuring activities  These developments call for FTI Consulting s specialized skill sets and are likely to boost its revenues

Addition of Relativity platform to its portfolio in Asia should help FTI Consulting s clients to easily access RelativityOne and leverage its consulting and services expertise  Clients will be able to easily manage the risk of e discovery and resolve local data privacy issues  with more efficiency and reduced capital expenses 
Notably  FTI Consulting is focused on expanding Relativity technology globally  The company is strengthening its foothold to meete discovery and data governance challenges  To this end  on Aug 14  2017  the company s Technology segment teamed up with kCura to provide clients with the combination of Relativity and its consulting and services  This was followed by the announcement of RelativityOne offering in the United Kingdom on Feb 27  2018 
FTI Technology
FTI Technology is recognized as a leading provider of high quality e discovery consulting and services  The segment provides products  services and consulting to law firms  corporations and government agencies  It also focuses on collection  preservation  review and production of electronically stored information 
The segment accounts for almost 10 12  of the company s total reported yearly revenues  In 2017  it accounted for almost 10  of total revenues  which marks a decline from a contribution of 12  in 2015  Additionally  in fourth quarter 2017  Technology segment revenues decreased by 5 9  from the prior year quarter to  40 9 million  The decrease was primarily due to lower demand for managed review services  Adjusted segment EBITDA also declined to  3 million from  5 6 million in the prior year quarter  This decrease was primarily due to lower revenues

2948,224463,CRAI,5 Top Stocks To Make The Most Of March Madness,opinion,March Madness grips the market again  Ardent fans are gearing up to cheer their favorite basketball team and brackets are made  The annual National Collegiate Athletic Association  NCAA  tournament is quite a challenge for sports analysts when it comes to predicting the winner  Picking the right stocks is equally dicey as investors might either win big or lose all The frenzy of the March Madness hits all  compelling investors to keep an eye on stock market movements  In fact  historically  March Madness tournaments mostly concur with strong stock gains We are also in the middle of a nine year bull run that is backed by business friendly tax cut policies and solid economic growth at home and abroad  Investors have also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump s tariffs plan somewhat eased  while the current ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is nothing but a temporary blip As the broader trend remains positive  it will be prudent to bet on fundamentally sound companies that could make the most of the March Madness March Madness Keeps Sports   Market Analysts on ToesMost of the Americans will agree that March Madness is an electrifying phenomenon that dominates national sports starting the second week of March through the first week of April  March Madness is basically a name given to the NCAA men s and women s basketball tournaments  which determines the national champions of college basketball  Around 68 men s teams and 64 women s teams will be participating  This tournament is so popular that more number of Americans are expected to fill the tournament bracket than those who have voted for President Trump last year March Madness  of course  is a huge revenue generator for the NCAA  As per the American Gaming Association  Americans are expected to gamble a staggering  10 billion on the tournament this year  which almost matches the GDP of countries like Armenia  Malta and Namibia  Most of the bets  however  will happen under the table  Only 3  of the betting is expected to be legal Predicting the tournament is so hard that billionaire Warren Buffett is willing to offer an astronomical prize to any employee who can pick all Sweet 16 teams  The employee will be given a sum of  1 million per year for the rest of his or her life   Thus  the human reasoning used in the tournament s decision making process has many comparisons to that of investing in the stock market  Like sports analysts who seem confident enough to pick the winning team from the NCAA tournament  market pundits claim that they can pick the stocks that will outdo the broader market  In fact  the NCAA tournament  historically  have put Wall Street in a buying mood March Madness Concurs With Solid Stock GainsThe U S  stock market posted encouraging results in the last March Madness  The Dow Jones Industrials Average has risen in nine of the past 12 times  while the S P 500 rallied in 10 of the trailing 12 tournaments  Lest we forget  March rings in more positive returns for the S P 500  The average monthly return in March from 2007 to 2016 has been 2 7   the best monthly performance in a year on an average return basis The tech laden Nasdaq Composite Index has also been up in nine of the past 12 tournaments  while the Russell 2000 index  that represents the smaller companies in the U S  stock market  went up in nine of the past 12 years  To top it  the tournament enters the month of April  which is traditionally the second best performing month of the year      Bull Market Turns 9  Investors Cheer Global Economic GrowthThe broader markets  in the meantime  have scaled new highs on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad  On Mar 9  the U S  stock market celebrated its ninth anniversary of the bull run Trump s polices including tax cuts  repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory Trump s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note  The U S  economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  last year  marking the best growth in two years  Also  Americans are getting fatter paychecks  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decadeBut  there is another major factor behind the strong American growth  It s the global economic growth  with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace  According to the International Monetary Fund  the global economy expanded at a rate of 3 7  last year  the fastest since 2010 March Madness Puts Wall Street on a Buying Spree  5 GainersLike sports analysts are betting on winners from the NCAA tournament  investors are looking for stocks that are likely to scale higher  Hence  it makes sense to invest in some rock solid stocks that could make the most of the market bullishness For that to happen  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks will be the best choice  The stocks also boost a  of A  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth

2949,224464,CRAI,5 Top Ranked Small Cap Stocks To Ride Out Trade War Fears,opinion,Last week  U S  equities suffered their gravest losses in more than two years  Fears of an impending trade war between the United States and China crippled markets  with the Dow suffering its worst week weekly loss since January 2016  These losses underscore the challenges faced by large cap stocks in recent times  a trend that is likely to continue In fact  small cap stocks have posted better performances compared to their larger counterparts over most of this month  Investors have sought out smaller companies for two reasons  First  they are likely to remain relatively insulated from the impact of a trade war  Second  they are expected to benefit appreciably from recent tax cuts  This is why it makes sense to invest in select small cap stocks at this point Small Caps Outperform Larger CounterpartsSince the end of February  the Dow and the S P 500 have lost around 6  and 4 6   respectively  In contrast  the small cap heavy Russell 2000 index has edged 0 2  down  This indicates that investors are keen to snap up small caps for their tax cuts and trade war related advantages Such a tendency has also gained favor among the investing community because large manufacturers are bound to experience a profits squeeze as Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs raise input costs  Further  retaliation from China and the European Commission could weigh on the bottom lines of large companies with multinational operations In such an event  small cap stocks look to be relatively better investments  This is because most of them are domestically focused with negligible foreign exposure  This enables them to gain from recent tax reductions while protecting them from the fallout of a potential trade war Replay of Post Election Surge and Fall Likely One section of investors feels that the current scenario is nearly identical to the situation prevailing immediately after Trump s victory in November 2016  At that time  small cap shares had experienced a tremendous upsurge  buoyed by speculation surrounding tax cuts and protectionist measures As a result  between Election Day and the end of 2016  the Russell 2000 gained 14   easily outperforming the S P 500 s 4 6  increase  Subsequently  however  gains for small caps faded as doubts arose over the Trump administration s ability to implement the President s electoral promises As of now  the overall economic outlook continues to be bright  But the situation could change drastically if a trade war really does happen  With both the Dow and the S P 500 posting their worst weekly losses in more than two years  investors likely feel that such a nightmare may indeed come true  Given this backdrop  it is unlikely that the popularity of small caps will decline in the near term Our ChoicesBlue chip stocks have recently received a hammering at the bourses  This is primarily due to concerns that a trade war could soon break out between the United States and China  Small caps have emerged as relatively safe bets in this scenario  Not only do they stand to gain the most from tax cuts  they are also relatively insulated from the fallout of a trade war Adding small cap stocks to your portfolios looks like a particularly smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and VGM Score of A  You can see CRA International Inc    NASDAQ CRAI   provides legal  regulatory  business consulting and other expert

2978,224493,CRAI,Zacks com Featured Highlights  CRA International  Estee Lauder  Dana  Boeing And Rogers,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 23  2017   Stocks in this week s article include CRA International  Inc   NASDAQ    NASDAQ CRAI        Estee Lauder Companies Inc   NYSE    NYSE EL        Dana Incorporated  NYSE    NYSE DAN        Boeing Company  NYSE    NYSE BA        Rogers Corporation  NYSE    NYSE ROG       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Invest in These 5 Momentum Stocks Using Driehaus StrategyInvestors with a strong risk appetite usually target momentum stocks for attractive returns  In this context  Driehaus Strategy could be used  which Richard Driehaus formulated using the  buy high and sell higher  principle  The success of this investing strategy earned Driehaus a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening ParametersIn order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks   Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5  Positive EPS surprise indicates potential   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend   Momentum Score equal to or less than B Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7 870 stocks to only 23 Here are five of the 23 stocks CRA International  Inc   NASDAQ       is a consulting company  CRA International has a Momentum Score of A and an average four quarter
