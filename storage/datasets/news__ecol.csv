1462,222977,ECOL,Meridian Waste Solutions Stock  An Emerging Growth Opportunity,opinion,"Meridian Waste Solutions Inc  NASDAQ MRDN 
Typically  when a CEO barks that they are not in the business of producing garbage  the connotation is none too friendly  But  for the team at Meridian Waste Solutions  being full of garbage is a rally cry  promoting a sense of pride rather than despair 
Meridian Waste Solutions is not what I would call an under the radar stock  but I would consider MRDN to be both under recognized and undervalued in terms of both operations and enterprise value 
If MRDN was purely an emerging market play  a comparison to industry competitors may not necessarily be in order  However  with Meridian Waste Solutions having an enterprise value of roughly  102 million  revenues of over  63 million  and a positive EBITDA of  13 million  the  3 00 share price does not reflect fair value when compared to others in the industry  And  because MRDN is already producing veteran like numbers  it would be appropriate to value them accordingly Vertically Integrated
MRDN is a vertically integrated provider of non hazardous solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
Collection  Meridian operates approximately 130  trucks with a an average age of 2010  based in St  Louis MO and Richmond  VA marketplaces  consisting of approximately 100 residential trucks and 20 commercial trucks  9 industrial trucks and various other trucks 
Approximately 80  of the company s 118 500 residential customers are municipal contract based 
The company has roughly 27 municipal contracts with terms of 3 to 6 years and a 97  Retention Rate 
The Company has over 5 000 commercial customers and over 16 000 Roll Off Customer with 19  being
Permanent and 81  being Temporary 
Transfer Stations  Meridian currently operates 4 transfer stations
Landfill  Meridian currently owns 3 municipal solid waste landfills  Its Bowling Green  MO location has a 265 acre landfill with an expected 22 000 000 cubic yards   cys   currently in process of being permitted  Its Petersburg  VA location s landfill and transfer station has 1 500 tpd daily permit capacity  Its Lunenburg  VA landfill has 1 000 tpd daily permit capacity 
Recycling  Meridian offers recycling with their municipal contracts and subscription customers  The same residential trucks are utilized to service the recycling routes 
MRDN Valuation
On numerous occasions  I have cited the inefficiencies in how the market is valuing emerging companies  In some sectors  micro cap stocks are being awarded significant blue sky valuation  providing multiples to stocks that are in the hundreds  not single digits  Furthermore  these multiples are being given to companies that have hardly established even a hint of securing a recurring revenue model  On the other hand  stocks like Meridian  which is both revenue producing and EBITDA positive  can t seem to grab the focus of an attention deprived market  And  because the market often fails to recognize emerging players  like MRDN  opportunities to invest in undervalued equities arise 
With MRDN establishing its growth oriented revenue model  and with positive EBITDA already a reality  the multiples being afforded to Meridian Waste Solutions appear to be grossly inadequate compared to industry peers  When comparing enterprise multiples  MRDN is awarded just a 1 6X multiple for revenue  and only a 7 8X multiple from its EBITDA performance  Compared to industry veterans like Waste Management  Waste Connections  and U S  Ecology  the multiples are highly inconsistent 
Waste Management Inc  NYSE WM   with its  70 share price  earns a revenue multiple of 3X and an EBITDA multiple of 10 9X  Waste Connections Inc  NYSE WCN   with its  80 share price  sports a revenue multiple of 6 2X  along with an EBITDA multiple of 19 5X  US Ecology Inc  NASDAQ ECOL   with a  52 share price  enjoys a revenue multiple of 2 9X and an EBITDA multiple of 12 2X  Thus  in comparison to three of the larger and more mature market players  MRDN is being inexcusably mispriced  with almost 50  of industry wide average multiples being scalped from current MRDN values  despite the aggressive growth path of the company 
To hit closer to home  compare a company more similar in size to MRDN  Advanced Disposal Services Inc  NYSE ADSW  has a  22 share price for a  4 billion enterprise value  ADSW is granted a revenue multiple of 3X and an EBITDA multiple of 10 8X  The difference simply lacks rationale 
In evaluating comparables from publicly traded waste service companies  the average multiple on revenue is 3 1X  and the average multiple for EBITAA is 12 4X   I m not just throwing arbitrary numbers at investors  these averages are accurate and the facts show that the valuation for MRDN is not efficient  When additional metrics are thrown into the equation  like MRDN s small outstanding share count of roughly 6 9 million  and their debt of just  81 million  the case that MRDN is undervalued is further magnified Trust  But Verify  MRDN Is A Legitimate Player
Many companies are pitched to investors  and while a great number of them hold potential  few in the emerging company space can offer even a small subset of what MRDN already delivers MRDN currently operates in St  Louis  Missouri and Richmond  Virginia  servicing over 118 000 residential  commercial  industrial  and government customers  the company is supported by a fleet of commercial  residential  and roll off trucks  with additional foundation platforms including four transfer stations  one recycling facility  and three municipal solid waste landfills 
Annual revenue is growing  currently at an annual run rate of  63 million  with a corresponding 27  gross margin  The current and projected run rate is expected to deliver  13 million annual adjusted EBITDA  a number that was highlighted earlier  The  13 million  while technically a projection based on current revenue postings  is far more than a pro forma model of what things  might  look like if all goes well in the future  Because MRDN already has a reliable recurring revenue model in place  management has the ability provide accurate revenue and expense visibility based on proven historical markers 
Organic growth is expected to continue at a 10  pace per year  and to compound that growth  MRDN is in active pursuit for accretive acquisitions  several of which the company has already publicly discussed  Management expects to bolt on tuck in acquisitions and geographical expansion acquisitions to have a national footprint  and deliver improved profitability  Once accomplished  the market may find current valuations hard to ignore  providing MRDN an equitable valuation more reflective of industry norms 
The debt of  80 million  obtained at 9  through its Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Agreement  may be considered a headwind for some investors  However  in an industry that leverages debt to build operations  this debt is being well managed and is not expected to interfere with any growth or acquisition initiatives  With just 6 9 million shares outstanding  MRDN has plenty of arrows in their quiver to attract funding on competitive terms  Insiders are putting capital at work as well  another signal to instill investor confidence  with Chairman and CEO Jeff Cosman recently investing  1 25 million into the company 
MRDN Growth
Couple the solid financial performance with proof that MRDN management is continuing to build the operations side of the business  and you have a solid case for Meridian Waste solutions s continued growth  On February 16th  for instance  MRDN announced that they have completed the planned acquisition of The CFS Group  an accretive deal that will increase services to over 30 000 commercial  industrial  and residential customers in the Richmond  Virginia market  The completed transaction marks the company s first solid waste acquisition outside of the state of Missouri  and creates a vertically integrated market for the company within the Commonwealth of Virginia 
As part of this synergistic deal  the immediate benefit to MRDN delivers revenue generated by CFS of approximately  25 million  along with the addition of over 100 CFS employees who will join the Meridian Waste solutions team  with normal operations expected to be continued in each of the current respective markets  The CFS acquisition will be immediately accretive  with Meridian Waste Solutions expected to increase its annual run rate to over  58 million in combined revenues  The acquisition was financed with  34 1 million of additional capital provided by current senior lenders  as well as funds generated from a recently completed equity offering 
Additional growth was fueled back in January of 2017  when MRDN was awarded contracts for residential solid waste collection in districts within St  Louis County  Missouri  The new contracts expand the company s hometown marketplace footprint by adding approximately 20 000 residential customers to the existing company client base  permitting the company to now serve over 65 000 residential and commercial customers in those markets 
The growth initiatives have been successful in driving service revenue to a base of over 118 500 residential customers and over 5 000 commercial customers  with additional traction expected through acquisition and organic growth  The growth and acquisition strategy will be adequately funded  utilizing an  89 1 million financing facility lead by Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group

No Wasted Management at MRDN
Management at MRDN is strong  bringing well experienced executive talent to facilitate the aggressive  but manageable  growth strategy  The company is lead by Chairman and CEO Jeff Cosman  who brings over ten years of industry experience to the team  Mr  Cosman played an active role during the consolidation of Republic Services  specifically in the accounting consolidation  initial cultural integration and the reporting to Wall Street when they acquired 168 companies in 30 months  going from  500 million in revenue to over  2 1 Billion  Jeff lived and learned the waste management business from his father Jim  who spent 27 years as an Executive at Browning Ferris  BFI  and President and COO of Republic Services 
Wally Hall  President and COO  was one of the three founders of Advanced Disposal Services  Inc   which is now the fourth largest solid waste company in the U S  Mr  Hall was responsible for helping Advanced Disposal Services grow from just two trucks into an operation that grossed over  1 3 billion in annual revenue  employed 5300 workers  and built an enormous waste based infrastructure to manage the business operations from office to landfill  He was instrumental in successfully merging three waste industry companies  Advanced Disposal Services  Veolia  and Interstate Waste 
Driving The Growth
With experienced and driven management in place  the question then becomes  how far and how fast can MRDN grow  In 2016  growth was primarily facilitated through two acquisitions made in 2015  and also from the continued organic growth in MRDN itself  Leveraging off of the prospering revenue growth  management plans to increase the rate of future expansion by increasing the company s presence in the commercial and roll off business  With gross profit improving  despite the pace of acquisition  it exemplifies the fact that management has the ability to effectively manage and improve efficiencies while at the same time increasing scale at an accelerated pace 
Developing a well thought out business plan is the key to operational success  and the tangibles are in place for MRDN to take advantage of the strategic opportunities that are both in place and available to the company  Acquisition will be a preferred strategy of management  and their goal is to identify and act upon current opportunities to not only build greater efficiencies within the Meridian Waste Solutions platform  but to also build a strong culture within MRDN  intending to take advantage of the team s expertise in the industry  While searching for opportunities  management expects to remain nimble in its pursuit to add value at the municipal contract level  looking to constantly take measures to extend the length of existing contracted revenue 
On its acquisition mission  MRDN will focus on tuck in operations centered around existing operations  New markets must be able to be vertically integrated or be disposal neutral markets  and the primary acquisition target will be focused on mid sized companies with a substantial record of long term contracts with municipalities across MRDN s regional platform  The retention rate of current contracts is vital to the evaluation and consideration of any acquisition candidate  Foremost  the revenues must be accretive to MRDN earnings 
Playing Favorites With Waste
The waste industry is tightly knit  and in certain regions of the country  the businesses are comparably small in nature with family ownership at stake  Trust is a huge driver in companies having the ability to acquire others in the industry  Of significant benefit to MRDN  their name is well respected  Taking advantage of their favorable industry reputation  MRDN can close deals by offering valuable upfront consideration to owner operators  providing upfront cash  initial stock positions  and long term employment contracts  MRDN management believes that sellers are attracted to MRDN because of their local appeal  the commitment to retain current employees  customer focus  and the maintaining of local management to facilitate daily operations 
No Waste In The Industry
For investors  no matter the opportunity  investing into a long term proposition is vital  The waste industry is currently estimated to be an  89 billion basic service industry  Compounding that number higher is the approximate  49 billion annual contribution from domestic waste collection and disposal  Regardless of the economy  the business model is recession resistant and has strong and predictable cash flows  which generate respectable and healthy EBITDA margins of between 20    60  for sectors in hauling  transfer station operations  and landfill services 
Putting the pieces together  MRDN is in a position to quickly capitalize from both its organic and acquisitive strategies  With the most recent acquisition resulting in an annual revenue run rate of  63 million  an increase in EBIDTA is certainly expected 
MRDN can further capitalize on their efficiencies through technology and route optimization  providing high levels of customer satisfaction  which corresponds to a high degree of customer retention  Focusing on full service and scalable business platforms  and building upon its growing trend of municipal based solid waste and disposal trends  MRDN is well positioned to capitalize on several industry fronts 
MRDN  as a whole  is well integrated and has an executive team capable of taking advantage of immediate opportunity  having the ability and experience to maintain stable pricing models  build efficient and manageable collection routes  and to face down inherent risks in the industry  such as government regulation and competitive pricing pressures 
With the leadership from the executive team  MRDN has a substantial opportunity to become a powerful regional player in the waste sector  The current value proposition alone suggests investment consideration be given by aggressive value investors  But  when valuation metrics are combined with the strength of management and the availability of substantial funding s through Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Specialty Lending  the potential for MRDN to ultimately be recognized and valued appropriately  with even an  average  industry multiple  may provide shareholders significant upside potential 
For MRDN  having more waste is beneficial to shareholders  And  with the most recent acquisitions demonstrating the teams ability to drive accretive revenue with efficient margins  the opportunity for shareholders to eventually be full of garbage  and profit  is not a consideration to be thrown away Disclaimer   I do not own shares of any stock mentioned herein
