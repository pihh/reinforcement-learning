8047,229562,COLB,5 Bank Stocks To Bet On Despite Fewer Rate Hikes In 2019 ,opinion,"The widely expected interest rate hike was announced at the end of the two day Federal Reserve Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting yesterday  The federal funds rate  increased for the fourth time this year  now stands at 2 25 2 50  Despite this  majority of the finance sector stocks  which usually benefit from higher rates  ended the day in red as broader markets declined  Fears that the central bank s interest rate hike will hurt the economy dragged the S P 500  Nasdaq and the Dow Jones to almost near respective 52 week lows Besides  the S P 500 Financial  sector  and the S P 500 Bank  Industry Group  indexes were down 1 2  and 1 7   respectively  Further  SPDR S P Bank  NYSE KBE  ETF  declined 2 6   the SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF   CO KRE   was down 3  and the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF   fell 1 3  Also  the Fed signaled one less rate hike for 2019 than what it had projected in September  Now  the central bank expects two rate hikes in 2019  one in 2020 and no rate hike in 2021  Perhaps the markets expected further support from the central bank in terms of rate hikes The Fed statement said   The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity  strong labor market conditions  and inflation near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term  The sole change from the November post meeting statement was the addition of  some  to define the trajectory of future rate moves  It now  judges  that rate increases are apt whereas in November s statement it had said it  expects
