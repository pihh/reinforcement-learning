128357,349872,BIIB,Why Biogen Could Become the King of Alzheimer s Disease Treatment,news,"If there is one group that can produce stock gains regardless of the daily market activities  that would be biotechnology and emerging pharmaceuticals  Coming up with a new approach or new way to treat cancers and other major diseases probably doesn t need a strong stock market to produce major interest  Alzheimer s disease is one of the most debilitating diseases of the modern era  and currently there are no cures to chase   no real approved drugs on the market that make a difference on the progression of Alzheimer s Biogen Inc   NASDAQ  BIIB  has an on again off again history with its efforts to treat Alzheimer s  The biotech giant is set to report earnings this week  and the view of the company s Alzheimer s study may be only a portion of the consideration for the coming week and the weeks ahead According to Canaccord Genuity  Biogen may be the best current bet of any major company that has at least a chance of getting further toward an FDA approval around Alzheimer s  Monday s top analyst upgrades and downgrades included Biogen  with Canaccord Genuity upgrading it to Buy from Hold and raising its target price to  360 from  305 div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  While Sumant Kulkarni sees Biogen s aducanumab facing a regulatory saga with much public skepticism  he also sees much potential upside heading into that process  The analyst was surprised by Biogen s sudden revival of aducanumab last October  and he retains a healthy degree of skepticism around the trial data that were presented in December  Despite that skepticism  there is still believed to be a  decent short at FDA approval  for aducanumab  Kulkarni believes that any approval is not baked into the shares now The report comes with some potential pitfalls  including early patent challenges in other drugs  but the potential fear of missing out on the part of investors chasing an Alzheimer s approval is massive  Biogen is also only valued at roughly nine times the expected 2020 earnings  Biogen is also said to have approximately  50 billion of  financial flexibility through 2024  that would allow the company to make acquisitions or have other efforts  And Kulkarni believes that investors are now undervaluing the company s core pipeline outside of aducanumab The largest driver of the target hike and upgrade comes from the chances of aducanumab getting FDA approval now at 50 m up from a prior chance of just 20   Kulkarni s view is that 2020 will see many events around the filing of and the acceptance of the filing  or not  for aducanumab by the FDA  That would then come with Advisory Committee meetings  votes and an ultimate FDA action date With a projected cost of roughly  8 700 per year in the United States and a later launch at a 20  discount in European Union and Japan  the analyst s view is that aducanumab could see as much as  9 9 billion in revenues per year by 2030  That said  other companies  both large and small  are also still chasing their own ambitions of coming up with an approvable treatment for such a debilitating disease like Alzheimer s  That means any approvals or related news from any of those programs could also cause volatility for Biogen shares Again  this analyst upgrade is not a prediction about Biogen s upcoming earnings  Investors should also never just use any single analyst report as a sole basis to buy or sell a stock  Remember that many biotech companies and many of the world s top pharmaceutical companies have bet and lost countless billions of dollars with nothing to show after failing in their quest to treat Alzheimer s disease Biogen shares opened flat at  278 14  but after a lack of news around the coronavirus hurting stocks  its shares were last seen up 0 85  at  280 50 with just over two hours left in Monday s trading session  Biogen has a 52 week range of  215 78 to  338 87  and its consensus analyst target price from Refinitiv was  304 57  Biogen s market cap is currently just above  50 billion  and its annualized revenues are around  14 billion Any drug approval to treat Alzheimer s  even a less than universal approval  would be in line for the blockbuster status of more than  1 billion in annual sales  even if it only is able to delay or minimize the onset stages of the disease According to Alzheimer s News Today  Alzheimer s is growing  and only around one in four people with the disease even get diagnosed  The group estimates that approximately 44 million people worldwide are living with Alzheimer s disease  or related form of dementia  and roughly 5 5 million people in the United States alone have the disease

128359,349874,BIIB,Biogen s Earnings Per Share Jumped 19  in Fourth Quarter,news,"Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  delivered its fourth quarter earnings report on Thursday  showing revenue up 4  year over year to  3 67 billion  Adjusted income of  1 49 billion was up 6  year over year  but on a per share basis  the growth was 19  because the biotech repurchased 23 6 million shares worth  5 87 billion over the course of 2019 
Sales of Biogen s top selling multiple sclerosis drug  Tecfidera  increased 5  year over year in the fourth quarter  while revenues from Tysabri  another multiple sclerosis drug  rose 2   Sales of its older interferon drugs for multiple sclerosis continued their decline of the last few years  falling 14  
Rounding out its major drugs  spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza was the top grower of the quarter with sales up 16   But its growth rate is decelerating    for the year  Spinraza sales were up 22     now that the drug must compete with Novartis  gene therapy Zolgensma  In addition  sales growth outside the U S  has as slowed as the initial momentum from its launch has waned 

For 2020  management expects revenue in a range of  14 0 billion to  14 3 billion  lower than the  14 38 billion Biogen brought in last year  Adjusted earnings per share are expected to fall between  31 50 and  33 50  again slightly lower than the  33 57 per share the drugmaker earned last year 
Biogen is currently in a fight over the patent for Tecfidera  and its guidance assumes no generics for it will be launched in 2020  The guidance also accounts for additional costs associated with the potential launch of its Alzheimer s disease drug aducanumab  assuming it gets approved by the Food and Drug Administration ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp2v6,2072150

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  My name is Carmen  and I will be your conference operator today  At this time  I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Financial Results and Business Update   Operator Instructions Thank you  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr  Joe Mara  Vice President  Investor Relations  You may begin Joe Mara    Vice President  Investor RelationsGood morning  and welcome to Biogen s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  Before we begin  I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of the biogen com to find the earnings release and related financial tables  including a reconciliation of the GAAP to non GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today  Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2  and Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non GAAP financial results  We believe non GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally  We have also posted our slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call I would like to point out that we will be making forward looking statements  which are based on our current expectations and beliefs  These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially  I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail On today s call  I am joined by our Chief Executive Officer  Michel Vounatsos  Dr  Al Sandrock  EVP  Research and Development  and our CFO  Jeff Capello  Now  I will turn the call over to Michel Michel Vounatsos    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us  First  let me start with some financial highlights  Biogen closed 2019 with quarterly revenues of  3 7 billion  an increase of 4  compared to the same period a year ago  For the full year 2019  Biogen generated  14 4 billion in revenues  representing growth of 7  year over year Full year 2019 GAAP earnings were  31 42 a share  a 46  increase versus full year 2018  Full year 2019 non GAAP earnings were  33 57 a share  a 28  increase versus full year 2018  We are pleased with the strong year over year growth  as we continue to execute on our strategy for long term leadership in neuroscience Now  let me review the year  First  full year MS revenue  including OCREVUS royalties  were  9 2 billion  an increase of 2  versus the prior year  The number of patients on our MS products globally increased 3  versus the prior year  driven by strong patients growth in emerging markets  as well as all of the large mature European markets  and our business demonstrated resilience in the US  Our team has executed well  demonstrating our ability to compete in an increasingly crowded market  We launched VUMERITY in the US as an important new oral treatment option  It remains early in the launch  but so far  we are pleased with the level of interest from patients and physicians Second  SPINRAZA generated full year global revenues of  2 1 billion  a 22  increase versus the prior year  This blockbuster performance was driven by strong year over year revenue growth in the US and even greater revenue growth outside the US  Including the expanded access program and clinical trials  over 10 000 patients are now being treated with SPINRAZA Third  full year biosimilars revenue was  738 million  which represents 35  growth year over year  driven primarily by IMRALDI  We estimate that our biosimilars generated approximately EUR1 8 billion of savings to the European healthcare systems in 2019  which we expect will continue to increase in 2020  This is critical as we work to create financial headroom for innovation and contribute to the long term sustainability of the healthcare system We also bolstered our biosimilars business this quarter with a new transaction with Samsung Bioepis  This provides us access to two new potential biosimilars in ophthalmology with a significant market opportunity in major markets worldwide  including  for the first time  in the US  as well as commercialization rights to our anti TNFs biosimilars in China Fourth  this was an historic year for R D organization  We are inspired by what the positive implications of the aducanumab data may mean for patients  physicians and the broader scientific community  who have been waiting decades for a therapy that can reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer s disease  We are actively engaging with the FDA as well as regulators in Europe and Japan  and we look forward to completing a regulatory filing in the US as soon as possible  In addition  there has been important progress related to the redosing study  as we have successfully submitted the protocol to the FDA  and we are currently working with the sites and ethics committees toward study initiation Fifth  beyond aducanumab  we continue to expand and progress our pipeline with approval for VUMERITY in the US  a positive data readout for BIIB059 in lupus  and adding seven new clinical program in MS  ALS  Parkinson s disease  ophthalmology and brain contusion  2019 was one of our most productive years in R D  and we believe we have multiple opportunities for near term value creation  as we prepare for multiple potential launches in the early 2020 Sixth  our cash flow generation remains strong and continue to provide us with significant optionality and flexibility to allocate capital  In 2019  we generated approximately  7 1 billion in cash flow from operations  an increase of approximately 14  versus the prior year  Throughout the year  we repurchased approximately 24 million shares for a total value of approximately  5 9 billion  As we have stated previously  we view share repurchase as an important element of thoughtful and value creating capital allocation  At the same time  we have the financial flexibility and capacity to continue to evaluate potential external business development and M A opportunities  Over the past three  Phonetic  years  we have executed 15 business development transactions  which have contributed to the significant expansion of our pipeline  We executed four deals over the past three months alone  including our proposed transaction with Pfizer for a potential symptomatic therapy with potential application in both Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease As we have demonstrated in the past  we are committed to maximizing returns to our shareholders  while continuing to bring innovative therapies to patients  something that demands a thoughtful approach toward all our investment over both the short and the long term In summary  2019 was a very productive and successful year for Biogen as we executed on our strategy and continued to deliver noticeable progress  Our core MS business continued to demonstrate resilience with growth in both patients and revenues  and we are excited to be launching VUMERITY  SPINRAZA continued to grow in the US and even more so outside of the US  as we continue to expand into new geographies  With over 10 000 patients on therapy and the largest body of clinical data in SMA  SPINRAZA remains a foundation of care in SMA We grew our biosimilars business  and we expanded our portfolio and geographic presence  We are preparing to lead in the fight against Alzheimer s disease as we plan for a US filing for aducanumab  Beyond aducanumab  we expanded and progressed our pipeline with seven new clinical programs and a positive data readout in lupus  And we generated ample cash flow as we focus on strategically allocating capital to maximize shareholder return over the long term I will now turn the call over to Al for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R D Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerThank you  Michel  and good morning  everyone  Before I begin  I would like to welcome back Dr  Maha Radhakrishnan as the new Chief Medical Officer at Biogen  Maha brings more than 16 years of experience across multiple geographies in a broad range of therapeutic areas  She previously worked with us here at Biogen as Vice President  Europe and Canada Medical  and Vice President  US Medical  and subsequently held senior positions in medical affairs at Bioverativ and Sanofi  Maha s extensive background will be crucial as we prepare for future pipeline launches  including the potential launch of aducanumab As Michel discussed  2019 was a historic year for Biogen  In addition to announcing positive results on aducanumab  we made significant progress on building a multi franchise portfolio by receiving approval for VUMERITY  adding seven clinical programs and advancing two programs to Phase III  Reflecting our modality agnostic approach  our neuroscience pipeline now includes small molecules  antibodies  other advanced biologics  antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy Let me now turn to the advances we made in the fourth quarter  starting with Alzheimer s disease and dementia  At the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer s Disease  or CTAD  annual meeting held last month in San Diego  we presented top line results from the Phase III studies of aducanumab in early Alzheimer s disease  Final analysis of these data showed that EMERGE was a positive study with a high dose regimen of aducanumab achieving statistical significance on both the pre specified primary endpoint of CDR Sum of Boxes  as well as on all three pre specified secondary endpoints On the other hand  data from the ENGAGE study did not meet the primary endpoint  although we do believe that data from patients who achieved sufficient exposure to high dose aducanumab in ENGAGE support the findings of EMERGE  Please note that we do not expect to present additional data on aducanumab prior to a regulatory decision by the FDA As Michel said  with the support of the FDA  we are working to initiate the open label Aducanumab redosing study as soon as possible  We have successfully submitted the protocol to the FDA  and we are currently working with the sites and ethics committees toward study initiation  In this study  eligible patients previously enrolled in our clinical studies  including patients previously treated with either aducanumab or placebo  will be titrated to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab infusions every four weeks In addition to aducanumab  we continue to advance a broad Alzheimer s disease portfolio  including the Phase III study of BAN2401  BIIB080  a tau targeted antisense oligonucleotide in Phase I  BIIB076  an anti tau antibody in Phase I  and gosuranemab  a distinct anti tau antibody in Phase II for which we expect data next year As we continue to develop our Alzheimer s portfolio  we aim to expand into even earlier patient populations to potentially prevent the clinical onset of the disease  To that end  our collaboration partner Eisai  along with the Alzheimer s Clinical Trials Consortium  plans to initiate the AHEAD 345  Phonetic   AHEAD 345 is comprised of two studies termed A3 and A45  The A3 study will evaluate low dose BAN2401 versus placebo in cognitively normal individuals who are currently below the threshold for amyloid positivity but are at high risk for further amyloid accumulation  The A45 study will evaluate high dose BAN2401 versus placebo in individuals who are amyloid positive but show little to no cognitive impairment  Together  these studies will evaluate whether administration of BAN2401 can slow amyloid accumulation or cognitive decline in the very early stages of Alzheimer s disease Turning to MS and neuroimmunology  this quarter  we were pleased to announce that VUMERITY  a novel oral fumarate  was approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS  Detailed results from the Phase II EVOLVE MS 2 study  which directly compared patient reported GI tolerability of VUMERITY and TECFIDERA  were presented at the annual meeting of the European Charcot Foundation in November and published in the journal  CNS Drugs  earlier this month Specifically  on the primary endpoint  these data showed that patients treated with VUMERITY self reported 46  fewer days with intensity scores of at least 2 on the IndividualGastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale compared to TECFIDERA  This result was highly statistically significant with a p value of 0 0003  Consistent with these data  the proportionate patients who discontinued the study due to GI adverse events was 0 8  for VUMERITY and 4 8  for TECFIDERA  Together  these data indicate that VUMERITY offers a clinically meaningful improvement in GI tolerability compared with TECFIDERA Across our MS portfolio  we continue to advance BIIB091  an oral BTK inhibitor in Phase I  BIIB061  an oral remyelinating agent in Phase I  and opicinumab  a Phase II anti LINGO antibody for which we expect data in the middle of this year Moving to our progress in immunology  there remains a tremendous unmet medical need for people living with lupus  including both cutaneous and systemic forms  Treatment options for lupus are limited  and new medicines are needed to manage this difficult to treat and chronic disease  Our work in lupus builds on a long history that Biogen has in immunology  including both home grown assets and collaborations We were very excited to report positive data this quarter from the Phase II LILAC study of BIIB059  a potential first in class anti BDCA2 antibody discovered and developed by Biogen  in two forms of lupus that affect a total of approximately 800 000 individuals in the G7  This two part study evaluated BIIB059 versus placebo in individuals with active cutaneous lupusErythematosus  or CLE  with or without systemic manifestations  and in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus  or SLE  with active joint and skin manifestations  With a p value of less than 0 001  the CLE part of the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant response of BIIB059 on the percentage change from baseline in the CLASI A score at week 16  The SLE part of the study also met its primary endpoint of reducing disease activity as measured by change from baseline in the total number of tender or swollen joints at week 24 In this study  patients treated with 450 milligrams of BIIB059 experienced a statistically significant reduction of 3 4 total active joint counts compared to placebo  In addition  improvements in skin disease and overall disease activity were consistently observed across multiple secondary endpoints  The safety and tolerability of BIIB059 support its continued development  and we are planning to move forward to Phase III We believe that the BIIB059 program exemplifies important elements of our broader approach to R D at Biogen  For example  by implementing biomarkers of target engagement and a measure of clinical efficacy early in clinical development  we were able to generate compelling proof of biology data and preliminary proof of concept data in Phase I  which were subsequently confirmed in a well controlled Phase II study  We believe that such de risking strategies may serve to increase the probability of success of other programs across our portfolio In neuromuscular disorders  last month  at the International Symposium on ALS Motor Neuron Disease  Biogen  Ionis Pharmaceuticals and our collaborators were awarded the Healey Center International Prize for Innovation in ALS  Presented by the ALS Center at Massachusetts General Hospital  this award recognized our contributions to the discovery and development of tofersen  our antisense oligonucleotide for SOD1 ALS  At this meeting  we were pleased to present the final data from the Phase I II study of tofersen  which demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CSF SOD1 protein levels and trends toward slowing of clinical decline as assessed by three independent measures compared to placebo Furthermore  treatment with tofersen reduced levels of neurofilament in both plasma and CSF  We are encouraged by the concordance across data sets generated in the study  including target engagement  clinical and neurofilament data  and the broad potential of antisense oligonucleotides to target genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disease  We expect data from the Phase III VALOR study of tofersen next year In addition  we continue to advance the Phase I studies of BIIB078  an ASO for C9orf72 mediated ALS  and BIIB100  a small molecule inhibitor of XPO1 for sporadic ALS Turning to ophthalmology  this quarter  we completed enrollment in the Phase III STAR study of BIIB111 in choroideremia  a rare X linked inherited retinal disorder that inevitably leads to blindness and currently has no approved treatments  Choroideremia affects approximately 15 000 individuals in the G7 and is caused by loss of function mutations in the gene encoding Rab escort protein 1  or REP1  BIIB111 is a gene therapy aimed to address the underlying cause of this disease by expressing an AAV2 packaged REP1 transgene In Phase I II studies  patients treated with BIIB111 demonstrated a higher rate of maintained vision compared to natural history  In addition  a subset of patients treated with BIIB111 in Phase I II studies demonstrated a meaningful improvement in visual activity  as defined    sorry  in visual acuity  as defined by a gain of at least 15 letters corresponding to three lines on the eye chart  Specifically  21  of patients treated with BIIB111 demonstrated an improvement of at least 15 letters at one year  as compared to only 1  observed in the natural history study The Phase I II studies also demonstrated that BIIB111 was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile  We are encouraged by these early signs of efficacy and safety and look forward to data from the Phase III study of BIIB111 toward the end of this year  We are also advancing the Phase II III study of BIIB112 in XLRP with data expected in the middle of next year In stroke  we continue to advance the Phase III study of BIIB093  or IV glibenclamide  for cerebral edema caused by large hemispheric infarction  or LHI  In a Phase II study  treatment with BIIB093 was associated with a 46  reduction in midline shift  an imaging measure of cerebral edema  and reduced mortality by over 50   We look forward to data from the Phase III study of BIIB093 in LHI by the end of next year In addition  the Phase II study of TMS 007 continues to progress  TMS 007 is a small molecule modulator of plasminogen that has the potential to become a best in class thrombolytic drug candidate for patients following an acute ischemic stroke  Data from this study are expected by the end of this year Within movement disorders  we continue to advance cinpanemab  or BIIB054  an anti alpha synuclein antibody for Parkinson s disease  with Phase II data expected in the second half of this year  as well as the Phase I study for BIIB094  an antisense oligonucleotide targeting LRRK2 Last month  we reported top line results from the Phase II PASSPORT study of gosuranemab for PSP  The primary endpoint was not met  and we therefore discontinued the development of gosuranemab for PSP and other primary tauopathies  While we were disappointed in this result  we chose to continue the Phase II study of gosuranemab in early Alzheimer s disease  given the potentially significant differences in disease pathophysiology And in neurocognitive disorders  we continue to advance a Phase II study of BIIB104  an AMPA receptor potentiator for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia  We now expect data from this study in the second half of this year    of next year Finally  we had a productive quarter on the business development front  Building further depth in ophthalmology  last month  we entered into an agreement with Catalyst Biosciences to develop and commercialize pegylated CB 2782 for the potential treatment of geographic atrophy  or GA  GA is an advanced form of dry age related macular degeneration  or AMD  that leads to blindness  has no approved therapies and affects approximately 1 million individuals in the US alone  This molecule is a novel protease that selectively cleaves C3  a genetically validated target in AMD  And we are encouraged by preclinical data demonstrating that a single intravitreal injection of this protease eliminated over 99  of C3 from the vitreous humor for at least 28 days In addition  this quarter  we initiated a collaboration with CAMP4 Therapeutics to leverage their Gene Circuitry Platform to potentially identify a suite of druggable targets in microglial signaling pathways already known to play a causal role in neurological disease And most recently  we announced an agreement to acquire a novel CNS penetrant small molecule inhibitor of casein kinase 1  or CK1  from Pfizer  CK1 is a key regulator of circadian rhythms  which can become dysregulated and contribute to irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder  or ISWRD  in Parkinson s disease  as well as sundowning in Alzheimer s disease  ISWRD is a non motor symptom of Parkinson s disease  characterized by fragmented sleep  severe fatigue and difficulties with activities of daily living  Sundowning affects approximately 20  of AD patients and causes patients to become confused  anxious and agitated later in the day  In a Phase I study    Phase Ia study  this molecule demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and proof of mechanism  Specifically  there was a statistically significant and dose related increase in salivary melatonin concentration  a marker of circadian phase modulation  We believe this may represent an innovative symptomatic treatment for both AD and PD  and we expect to initiate a Phase Ib study by the end of this year  This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  and we expect it to close in the first quarter of 2020 Overall  Biogen R D delivered significant progress in 2019  We believe we are in a strong position today with 27 clinical programs  including six programs in Phase III  12 in Phase II and nine in Phase I  with a deep preclinical pipeline across multiple modalities  With our plan to file aducanumab in the US and multiple additional near term opportunities ahead of us  we believe that no other company is as well positioned to develop potentially breakthrough medicines for patients living with devastating neurological diseases I ll now pass the call over to Jeff Jeffrey Capello    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Al  Good morning  everyone  Let me now provide more detail on our financial performance for 2019 and share with you our guidance for 2020  Let s start with revenues As Michel mentioned earlier  we had a very strong performance in Q4 2019 across all of our core business areas  Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 4  year over year to approximately  3 7 billion and grew 7  for the full year to  14 4 billion Overall  our MS business delivered revenues of  2 4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019  including OCREVUS royalties of approximately  205 million  MS revenues in Q4 2019 decreased 1  versus prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2  including OCREVUS royalties  US MS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from an increase in channel inventory of approximately  135 million compared to an increase of approximately  105 million in Q4 2018  Based on historical results  we typically see a decrease in channel inventory in the first quarter  following year end build of inventory Full year MS revenues were  9 2 billion  including OCREVUS royalties of approximately  688 million  Full year MS revenues decreased 1  versus the prior year without OCREVUS royalties and increased 2  versus the prior year including OCREVUS royalties Global fourth quarter TECFIDERA revenues were  1 2 billion  a 5  increase versus the prior year  This included revenues of  877 million in the US  an increase of 2  versus Q4 2018  and  284 million outside the US  an increase of 12  versus the fourth quarter of 2018  TECFIDERA benefited from an increase in channel inventory in the US of approximately  100 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to an increase of approximately  60 million in Q4 2018  Throughout 2019  we were pleased to see four consecutive quarters of relative stability in our share of total prescriptions for TECFIDERA in the US In addition to strong performance from TECFIDERA  we launched VUMERITY in late Q4 in the US and recorded  5 million of revenue  all of which we attribute to channel loading  Outside the US  TECFIDERA again performed very well in the fourth quarter with strong patient growth in all major European markets and approximately 50  patient growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America versus the prior year For the full year  worldwide TECFIDERA revenues were  4 4 billion  an increase of 4  versus the prior year  This included  3 3 billion in the US and  1 1 billion in sales outside the US Interferon revenues  including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY  were  516 million during the fourth quarter  a decrease of 14  versus Q4 2018 due to a continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies  This included  359 million in the US and  157 million in sales outside the US  Interferon revenues outside the US were negatively impacted by channel dynamics and timing of shipments  Within the US  AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from an increase in channel inventory of approximately  30 million compared to an increase of approximately  35 million in Q4 2018 For the full year  worldwide interferon revenues decreased 11  to  2 1 billion  consisting of  1 4 billion in the US and  675 million in sales outside the US TYSABRI worldwide revenues were  473 million this quarter  an increase of 2  versus the fourth quarter of 2018  This included  270 million in US and  203 million outside the US  In the US  revenues increased 5  versus the prior year  representing the fourth consecutive quarter of improved performance on a year over year basis  Within the US  inventory levels for TYSABRI were relatively stable compared to an increase of approximately  10 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 Throughout 2019  we were pleased to see relative stability in TYSABRI s share of both new and total prescriptions in the US  Outside the US  TYSABRI revenues decreased 2  versus the prior year as revenues were negatively impacted by channel dynamics and timing of shipments  For the full year  worldwide TYSABRI revenues were approximately  1 9 billion  an increase of 2  versus prior year  We recorded US revenues of  1 billion and  850 million internationally Overall  we were very pleased with the performance of our MS business in 2019 and are focused on maintaining the resilience of this franchise in light of new competition entering the market Let me now move on to SPINRAZA  Global fourth quarter SPINRAZA revenues were  543 million  a 16  increase versus the prior year and relatively flat versus the third quarter  In the US  SPINRAZA revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 were  243 million  an increase of 3  versus both Q4 2018 and Q3 2019 The number of patients on therapy in US increased 2  as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019  with growth coming from both the pediatric and adult patient segments  We continue to make strong progress with adults  as more than 50  of the new starts in Q4 were adults  And growth in adults exceeded our overall patient growth  As a reminder  the adult population is the largest segment of the market  We have continued to see an impact from gene therapy within the infant population  which represents approximately 5  of the total SMA market Outside the US  SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 were  300 million  an increase of 28  versus the prior year and a decrease of 3  versus the prior quarter  Outside the US  we saw strong growth in patients across all regions  with broad growth from both existing and newly launched countries  The number of commercial SPINRAZA patients increased approximately 10  versus the third quarter of 2019  Despite strong overall patient growth  fourth quarter ex US SPINRAZA revenues decreased slightly versus the third quarter of this year due to a combination of loading dose dynamics  country mix  the timing of shipments in certain markets and pricing dynamics Overall  we were very pleased with SPINRAZA s performance again this quarter  as we saw continued patient growth across the large mature markets and strong uptake in the emerging markets  Additionally  more than 50  of our revenue came from outside the US  and there remains significant opportunity to reach additional patients  particularly outside the US For the full year  worldwide SPINRAZA revenues increased 22  to  2 1 billion  driven by 9  growth in the US to  933 million and 30  growth outside the US to  1 2 billion Let me now move on to our biosimilars business  which generated revenues of  196 million this quarter  growing 25  versus the prior year  We estimate that we have more than 200 000 patients receiving treatments with our three anti TNF biosimilars  which is a significant increase of approximately 70  versus the prior year BENEPALI is the leading ENBREL biosimilar in Germany  the UK and Italy  FLIXABI is the most prescribed Remicade biosimilar in Italy  And IMRALDI is the leading HUMIRA biosimilar in major markets such as Germany and the UK  For the full year  biosimilars revenues grew 35  to  738 million Turning to our anti CD20 revenues  we recorded  601 million for the fourth quarter  an increase of 12  versus the prior year  primarily driven by OCREVUS royalties  Full year anti CD20 revenues were  2 3 billion  a 16  increase versus 2018  In the fourth quarter  we saw the first entry of a RITUXAN biosimilar  We expect additional biosimilar entrants in 2020  which we expect will put further pressure on RITUXAN revenues  Also as a reminder  our royalty rate on US sales of OCREVUS resets every calendar year Total other revenues were  146 million in the fourth quarter  a decrease of 12  versus the prior year due to the timing of shipments  Other revenues were  708 million for the full year  an increase of 21  versus 2018  As a reminder  other revenues in the first quarter of 2019 benefited from a large one time shipment to Bioverativ  In addition  note that other revenues are variable and difficult to predict Let me now turn to gross margin performance  Q4 2019 gross margin was 88  of revenues versus approximately 86  in the fourth quarter of 2018  The improvement in gross margin was due to slightly lower royalties  as well as lower cost related to our other revenues  Gross margins for the full year 2019 were approximately 86   relatively flat compared to full year 2018 Q4 GAAP and non GAAP R D expense was 19  of revenue or  692 million  Q4 R D expense includes  63 million related to the transaction with Samsung Bioepis  the  45 million opt in payment we made to Ionis related to BIIB080  and  30 million related to our collaboration agreements with CAMP4 Therapeutics and Catalyst Biosciences  Full year GAAP and non GAAP R D expense was 16  of revenue or  2 3 billion Q4 GAAP SG A expense was 18  of revenue or  665 million  Q4 non GAAP SG A expense was 18  of revenue or  662 million  Both GAAP and non GAAP SG A increased versus the prior quarter  primarily due to increased commercial and medical investments  as well as the timing of spend on G A  Full year GAAP SG A was 17  of sales or  2 4 billion  Full year non GAAP SG A was 16  of sales or  2 3 billion GAAP other expense  which includes interest  was  49 million in the fourth quarter  and GAAP other income was  83 million for the full year  Non GAAP other expense was  50 million in the fourth quarter and  110 million for the full year  The difference between these GAAP and non GAAP results is driven primarily by gains on strategic investments  which we classify as GAAP only In the 4th quarter and the full year  our GAAP and non GAAP tax rate was approximately 16   Compared to the prior year  GAAP and non GAAP tax rates for both the full year and the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a non recurring change in the Company s tax profile in 2019 and the sale of the remaining portion of higher tax inventory in 2018 due to inter Company effects  Furthermore  the GAAP rate also benefited from the unfavorable prior year effect of US tax reform in 2018 Our weighted average diluted share count was approximately 178 million for the fourth quarter and 187 million for the full year  Throughout 2019  we repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of approximately  249 for a total value of approximately  5 9 billion  including approximately 7 7 million shares in the fourth quarter for a total value of approximately  2 1 billion  As of the end of the year  we had a total of approximately  6 3 billion in share repurchase authorization outstanding  including the new  5 billion plan approved by the Board in December 2019  which now brings us to our diluted earnings per share In the fourth quarter  we booked GAAP EPS of  8 08  an increase of 71  versus the fourth quarter of 2018  and non GAAP earnings per share of  8 34  a 19  increase versus the prior year  For the full year  GAAP EPS was  31 42  a 46  increase versus 2018  and non GAAP EPS was  33 57  a 28  increase versus 2018 We generated approximately  2 billion in net cash flows from operations in Q4 and approximately  7 1 billion for the full year  marking the final year where cash flows are impacted by payments to Fumapharm  We ended the quarter with approximately  5 9 billion in cash and marketable securities and  6 billion in debt Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2020  We expect revenues of approximately  14 billion to  14 3 billion  We anticipate GAAP and non GAAP R D expense to be between 15  and 16  of revenues  We expect GAAP and non GAAP SG A expense to be approximately 19 5  to 20 5  of revenues  We anticipate our GAAP and non GAAP tax rates for 2020 to be between 18  to 19   And we anticipate full year 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share results of  29 50 to  31 50 and non GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between  31 50 to  33 50 It s important to note that this guidance does not include any impact from potential acquisitions or large business development transactions  as both are hard to predict  This guidance does assume our proposed transaction with Pfizer closes  Our guidance also assumes a stable share count off the fourth quarter of 2019 and no change to foreign exchange rates  Importantly  our guidance also assumes no generic competition in the US for TECFIDERA in 2020 and assumes additional commercial and R D expenses related to aducanumab  This guidance reflects our best assumptions as of now  And as a reminder  we will provide an update mid year on our second quarter earnings call I ll now turn the call back over to Michel for his closing comments Michel Vounatsos    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jeff  We delivered strong performance in 2019 with growth across all of our core business areas  double digit earnings growth versus a year ago and strong execution across each pillar of our strategy  For 2020  we aim to continue our momentum by executing well on our strategic priorities across MS  SMA  biosimilars and our pipeline  with a priority on aducanumab We are actively preparing for the potential launch of aducanumab with an initial focus on the US  This includes implementing a thorough go to market model  hiring the sales force  building out our medical teams and preparing for market access  In addition  we are actively engaging with regulators outside of the US  including Europe and Japan Beyond aducanumab  our pipeline is maturing  We now have six programs in Phase III and 27 clinical programs overall  an increase from 17 just three years ago  We have multiple near term opportunities for value creation  including in Alzheimer s disease  ALS  stroke  lupus  ophthalmology and biosimilars  as we aim to build a multi franchise portfolio  Between now and the end of 2021  we expect 11 mid to late stage data readouts  including Phase III readouts for tofersen in ALS  BIIB111 in choroideremia and BIIB093 in large hemispheric infarction  and eight Phase II readouts across MS  Alzheimer s disease  Parkinson s disease  ophthalmology  schizophrenia  acute neurology and neuropathic pain As the leader in neuroscience  with asymmetric  Phonetic  core capabilities  we believe that no other company is better positioned to continue to deliver breakthrough therapies for diseases of the nervous system to address a significant and growing unmet medical need  We ll continue to execute on our core strategy to build a multi franchise portfolio across our core and emerging growth areas  I want to reiterate our commitment to maximizing returns to our shareholders and bringing innovative therapies to patients over the long term  This demands that we continue to look at capital efficiently  effectively and appropriately  As we have demonstrated in the past  we will always strive to have an optimal capital structure  as well as aim for superior returns from the investment we make I d like to take a moment to discuss how we brought the purpose as an organization as we aim to pioneer science for the betterment of humanity  This includes doing the right thing for patients  our employees  the environment and the community  all of which we believe contributes to a long term sustainable shareholder value  I am proud of what Biogen stands for  and I believe this approach positions us well to be a sustainable organization over the long term  as we remain focused on being the leader in neuroscience to address the tremendous societal needs in this space Finally  I would like to thank our employees around the world  who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients  lives  and all of the physician  caregivers and participants in our clinical development programs  Our past and future achievements could not be realized without their passion and commitment We will now open the call for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with SVB Leerink  Please go ahead Geoffrey Porges    SVB Leerink    AnalystThank you very much  and congratulations on the quarter and the results and all the progress  Just a couple of questions  Jeff  on the guidance  Could you talk about what assumptions are built into your guidance about the effect of the risdiplam imminent launch on SPINRAZA  And also just have you incorporated the full launch costs for aducanumab  Your sales force and everything you mentioned that  but is it fully budgeted in that guidance  Thanks Jeffrey Capello    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo thanks for the questions  Geoff  So with regard to risdiplam  we are assuming that that product does launch  And so we re anticipating  as everyone else is  to kind of see the data and kind of what it means  We d just remind people that we have 10 000 people on therapy today doing very  very well with a very low discontinuation rate  So we ll see kind of what happens on the data and how that product is received  But certainly  there s a lot of growth opportunity for us ahead With regard to aducanumab  we re not going to give specific perspective on numbers in terms of the launch  but I would just point you back to looking at the SG A guidance  which is up quite a bit from a percentage perspective  and you get a sense of the amount we re spending year over year relative to that that we spent last year  And that is I think the prudent thing to do  given the significant opportunity ahead of us  which we re quite excited about OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thanks for taking the question  Maybe just two for me  Just wondering if you can give us any more detail on what s gating to the aducanumab filing  And then  are you expecting a priority review  And then the outlook in terms of the ex US regulatory filings there  do you have a similar level of confidence in filing in both Europe in Japan as you do in the US  Thank you Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerHi  Terence  this is Al  It s basically a matter of putting together documentation  the electronic Common Technical Document  It s an electronic document with hyperlinks  etc  It s a matter of assembling all that and submitting that to the FDA And in terms of the engagement  we ve been engaged with them since last    the first Type C meeting last June  and it s been very constructive  I ve never    this is a unique situation to me  It s pretty unusual  I think  across the industry  But I ll say that it s been    there has been a high level of constructive engagement ever since last June And with respect to the other regions  we have started our engagement with them  but it s still early days  But we do anticipate that we will be filing at some point in those other regions as well at some point OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein  Please go ahead Ronny Gal    Bernstein    AnalystGood morning  Congratulations on the results  and thank you for taking the questions  You mentioned you re beginning to    the redosing trial  I wonder if you can just tell us a little bit about what you re trying to achieve with that trial  Essentially  now that you ve got the protocol  what are the endpoints and when    what is the data that we should see from that And then second on VUMERITY  can you describe a little bit the launch plans here  I guess it didn t really make commercial step yet  Can you talk a little bit about whether you intend to give it the same kind of parity business model to TECFIDERA  Or would there be some things you do with VUMERITY that    in terms of access  support and so forth  that will be better or worse than TECFIDERA Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerHi Ronny  it s Al  The main reason for the redosing study were humanitarian reasons  We had all these patients who had volunteered to be in our clinical studies  They helped us develop aducanumab  We felt we owed something to them  Many of them had expressed a desire to the investigators that they wanted the drug  So that s the primary reason  As I said in my notes that    in my script that it s a single arm study  Basically  every patient gets titrated up to 10 milligrams per kilogram aducanumab  and all patients who were in prior studies  including placebo patients  are eligible  In a single arm study  the main thing you can really look at is safety and tolerability  And we had always envisioned doing a long term extension study  In fact  we had one in place to evaluate long term safety and tolerability  And so that s the primary endpoint of the study In addition  of course  we ll answer    we ll take a look at efficacy as best you can in a single arm study because we would be interested in continued    if there s durable effect  obviously  we ll be looking at amyloid and other biomarkers  and we ll also see whether or not a treatment gap had any effect on these kinds of markers Michel Vounatsos    Chief Executive OfficerSo  Ronny  concerning the second part of your question  with a superior to take  Indecipherable  we have the opportunity with VUMERITY to strengthen the overall fumarate portfolio  But TECFIDERA remains front and center in our promotion  You see the performance  We continue to support  And again  a key metric will be to increase the share of fumarate down the road  We are pleased with the access to date that is superior to what we have seen from competition a few months after launch  and for some competitors  12 months after launch  So we are pleased with the access  We monitor very closely the Start Forms and the grads  Phonetic   We are pleased to see so far that there is more Start Forms being issued ex tech than tech  So this is a    but it s still the beginning  It s a bit too early  We ll come back with more color when we have more data OperatorYour next question is from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company  Please go ahead Phil Nadeau    Cowen and Company    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for taking my question  It s actually on TECFIDERA and the IP  I believe  we are going to get a decision on the IPR next week  Can you remind us in the case where the IP were to fall  what would be the next steps  what is the appeal process there  And then secondarily  what is the status of the court case  Can you give us an update on the timelines there  should the IPR actually go your way next week  Thanks Jeffrey Capello    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so it s Jeff  So there is a    expect a decision  from the IPR perspective  no later than the end of the first week of February  So that will be the first of the three decisions  Depending on how that goes    if it goes in our favor  that s great  If it doesn t  we plan to appeal  and the appeal process typically takes 12 to 18 months Two other cases  West Virginia and Delaware  are expected to read out some point mid year  plus or minus a month or two  Depending on how those go those go    if those go our way  that s great  If not  we plan to appeal those  and the appeal period  again  tends to take 12 to 18 months  So we obviously await kind of the results of that  We do believe we have valid patents  Nonetheless  these outcomes are difficult to predict  There s a number of considerations need to be weighed  There s obviously multiple decisions that we just talked about  There s the appeal periods and then there s handicapping whether or not people    if we re unsuccessful  we ll launch at risk  So it s difficult to predict in the short term  So we ll keep people apprised of kind of the developments as we move our way through the year OperatorYour next question is from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore  Please go ahead Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  thanks so much for taking my questions  Al  I just wanted to focus on Alzheimer s for a minute  if I may  And it s very clear that FDA has a long history of approving CNS drugs  which have failed and or negative trials in the past  However  every time FDA goes down that direction  I find that they pool results across every single thing  So my question is  if you pool results across ENGAGE  EMERGE and Phase Ib  what does that look like  That will be very helpful to understand  And also  how many post hoc analysis were done before you guys arrived at the Protocol Version 4 population  I mostly ask because I m trying to understand how we should think about what should be the p value  given all the splits that theoretically should be thought about before we arrived at the PV4 Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerSo Umer  this is Al Sandrock  We haven t disclosed the results of any other kinds of analyses  including pooling or subsets  So we re not going to do that this morning  But I would say that I would not assume that    I mean  when you look back in the history of approved drugs  I wouldn t say it s always the case that pooling is done  I think that there is    there are exceptions to that  And so I would not assume that here  and let s see Your question    the other question was how many post hoc analyses  We did say it was post hoc  but I don t remember how many there were OperatorYour next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America  Please go ahead Geoff Meacham    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  good morning  guys  Thanks for the question  I just have a few  On SMA  in clinical development  patients on ZOLGENSMA switched back to SPINRAZA  Just curious if you guys have seen evidence that this is occurring in the real world And then Al  bigger picture question on Alzheimer s  So if I assume that A beta antibody is an anchor therapy  when we look down the road at combination approaches  is there sort of a fast path to derisk  In other words  do you feel like FDA    you can look at surrogate markers such as a PET imaging initially  and then down the road  look at cognition  Just wanted to get a sense for looking at post aducanumab  Thanks Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerYeah  So we    your first question was about SMA and ZOLGENSMA  I don t really consider that as switch back  if you will  because if they ve had ZOLGENSMA  arguably that    they re still on it  if you will  They re getting the effect of the gene therapy  So in some ways  it s like a combination of adding SPINRAZA  We have heard about that  It does happen in the real world  And you might want to    you might wonder why people are doing that  I think it s because parents and the physicians feel like there might be more room to improve  and so that s what I hear from    in the real world  And in terms of data from that  we are starting to collect that data  But we have    we don t have any conclusions at this point  But we are    because it s happening in the real world  And since we re very interested in real world evidence  we are starting to collect that data In terms of Alzheimer s and combination  one of the reasons why we built the pipeline the way we did was that we had always envisioned combination therapy  And the first obvious thing to combine aducanumab or BAN2401 with would be an anti tau or a tau ASO  something that affects tau  We were actually pleasantly surprised that aducanumab already affects tau  though  So we ll have to keep that in mind  But nevertheless  I think the most obvious thing to do would be to combine with tau as the next step  and then maybe that there are certain stages of the disease that need the combination more than other stages And in terms of a fast track  yeah  we will employ biomarkers  not only of the toxic proteins that we re trying to reduce  A beta and tau  but also potentially other kinds of biomarkers that look at additive effects in a more expedient way  But ultimately  I anticipate we will need to show some effect of the combination on reducing clinical decline further  I think that will still be important  Unless you can do it  in other words  if you re in an early stage of Alzheimer s where there is no cognitive impairment  you may not be able to do it where biomarkers alone may be the only approach OperatorYour next question is from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies  Please go ahead Michael Yee    Jefferies    AnalystThanks for the question  You had made some comments around preparation for aducanumab  including SG A  Could you just put a little more color around  I guess  the work being done in terms of timing of when you actually expect the sales force to be on  And maybe some comments around what you re hearing from payers and what they would    how they are putting in perspective this type of drug and what type of actions that type of drug would get And then just a quick one also for Al  there is a DIAN TU study reading out  I m sure people will try to make read throughs into what this means for the beta amyloid about    this is maybe just a comment on anything to know or your perspective on that study  I appreciate it Michel Vounatsos    Chief Executive OfficerSo Michael  if I can get started with the launch readiness  actually  the work started more than two years ago with an understanding of the patient journey from origination to diagnosis  the referral dynamics that change from market to market  and even within the US  which is different  understand the different types of markets within the US  it s    the different segments  We have finalized the go to market for the US  This has been approved  and this is funded in our budget  as discussed  And hiring has started  first with the medical affairs  obviously  Engagement with scientific leaders also at the community level is important  And also the biomanufacturing needs to be stepped up and be ready for eventually a large demand with the functional support  OK  to support the increased engagement and team In terms of price  it s still early  even if we are making progress  We engage with stakeholders  because as you can imagine  there is almost no drug cost today  So we engage with patient association  pharmacoeconomics  through leaders and all the customers  mostly in the US and beyond the US  Beyond the price  it s all about the access condition and the affordability  We know that the more we wait  the more transition    that people will transition to full blown assistance and loss of dependence  which costs so much to the society  So basically  we start engaging  and hopefully  we ll have all the incentives in that field in order to further invest in R D  This is our belief  So good progress  step by step  but we engage broadly and we ask for advice and we listen Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerHi Michael  it s Al  DIAN TU    so DIAN is the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network  So obviously  in these patients  amyloid is likely to be causal because most of the dominantly inherited mutations that lead to ultimately  Phonetic  Alzheimer s disease are patients either in APP  the amyloid precursor protein  or enzymes that process it  And so I think that these are very interesting studies  My understanding is that solanizumab and gantenerumab are being tested  If the results are positive  I think that that would lend further support to the amyloid hypothesis  If the results are negative  I d want to see that there is evidence of target engagement and biological changes in the brain before I make any conclusions OperatorYour next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Cory Kasimov    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  Good morning  guys  Thanks for taking my question  I wanted to ask on capital allocation  and given the Company s current portfolio and pipeline  considering prevailing market dynamics  how do you look at the relative attractiveness between continued share repurchases  considering the 6 plus billion in dry powder you have there  and business development opportunities  I guess  do you have enough bandwidth to do both in a meaningful way  And do you    and how much of an appetite do you have on the acquisition front at this time  Thanks Jeffrey Capello    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo Cory  it s Jeff  Thanks for the question  So we re in a good position from that perspective  We have no net debt as of the end of the year  In 2019  we generated  7 billion of cash flow and we expect that we ll have a strong cash flow year again in 2020  So we ve got the financial flexibility to do both  and we have been doing both  Over the last three years  we ve done 15 M A BD type transactions  spending  3 5 billion  And in the last year alone  we bought back 24 million shares for almost  6 billion So our interest is strong in terms of building the pipeline  We ve taken the pipeline from 17 clinical assets to 27  significant increase  And then  of those 27  there s 11 that have important readouts in the next two years  five of which could have a meaningful impact on the Company  So we feel good about that  We d like to continue to add to those assets and build the pipeline  But at the same point  we have  6 3 billion of authorized share repurchase capability as well  So we ll continue to make good decisions that are in the best interest long term of the shareholders and we ll have the capacity to do both OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Matthew Harrison    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  good morning  Thanks for taking the question  I had one for Al on two pipeline program  Al  can you just comment why a LRRK2 ASO could be differentiated from the kinase inhibitors that we see in development  And then maybe just share your views on anti LINGO in MS  Has that changed since you initiated that study or any updated views there  Thanks Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerSo LRRK2 is a wonderful target  we believe  for Parkinson s disease  not only for the patients with familial PD due to LRRK2 mutations  but also potentially even for sporadic Parkinson s disease  And the ASO  it s another approach to    instead of inhibiting the enzyme with a small molecule  you reduce the levels of LRRK2  and it remains to be seen  One thing I ll say about the ASO is that it s CNS  Because we give it intrathecally  it s only going to affect LRRK2 in the central nervous system  whereas a small molecule may have affects on the enzyme in other places  But I would say other than that  it s kind of early days for whether or not these drugs will be effective And in terms of anti LINGO  the Phase II study that we re doing now is different from the first Phase II study in the sense that we selected patients based on advanced imaging to be sure that they actually had demyelination based on MTR and actually had intact exons based on DTI  We also chose the dose that looked the most promising  based on the first Phase II study  And we re combining it with multiple different kinds of immunomodulators  In the first trial  we only combined it with interferon  but now we re combining it with TECFIDERA  TYSABRI as well as interferon to see whether or not the level of inflammatory disease in the brain affects remyelination  And perhaps when you have less inflammation  the oligodendrocyte precursor cells may be able to remyelinate better  So that s the difference  And we ll find out soon whether or not the second trial is positive OperatorYour next question is from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer  Please go ahead Jay Olson    Oppenheimer    AnalystHi  congrats on a successful 2019  and thanks for taking the question  Could you elaborate on the rationale for studying BAN2401 in patients whose amyloid levels fall below the threshold of positivity  And is the goal here to create a complementary positioning for BAN2401 in patient segments that would be distinct from aducanumab Alfred Sandrock  Jr     Executive Vice President  Research   Development and Chief Medical OfficerWell  we do view this    we do view the two drugs as part of a multi drug franchise  and we will use the drugs where they naturally fit the best  and we ll need data for that  Just because they re not positive based on a visual read  that doesn t mean there s no amyloid accumulation  So I think that s the distinction  And in some ways  A345 study looks at    between the two studies  looks at both Stage 1 and Stage 2  both of the    both stages as defined by the FDA guidance document that came out last year on the various stages of Alzheimer s disease  So I would say that those two studies evaluate both Stage 1 and Stage 2  and both are important to study  I believe Joe Mara    Vice President  Investor RelationsThere s probably time for two more questions OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead with your question Evan Seigerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  guys  Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter  I m just looking toward next week with the potential results from the IPR  If they were to not go your way  would you consider reprioritizing your business development priorities versus share repurchases  Or would you have to wait until you kind of see the results of the court cases mid year Michel Vounatsos    Chief Executive OfficerSo thanks for the good question  And we see business development M A opportunities as being independent from what happens next week or what happened six

128382,349897,BIIB,3 Pharma   Biotech Pipeline Areas To Keep An Eye On In 2020,opinion,In 2019  the FDA granted approval to 48 novel drugs  As in the past years  several approvals were for cancer drugs  These apart  the agency s approvals included treatment options for patients living with cystic fibrosis  sickle cell disease and rare muscular disorders  Important approvals of non cancer drugs were for Caplyta for schizophrenia  Nourianz for Parkinson s disease patients experiencing  off  episodes  Vyondys 53 to treat some patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease  among others The last year clearly proved that the FDA is increasingly giving green signal to innovative new products in various therapeutic areas  Though cancer will always be a key area for R D research  here we take a look at three non cancer therapeutic areas that we think will garner a lot of interest in 2020  These areas are marked by extensive research  innovative technologies  and the promise of transforming the way diseases are treated Alzheimer s DiseaseAlzheimer s disease is an area where many companies have tried their luck but with minimal success  Over the last several years  big players like Merck   NYSE MRK    AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN    Lilly   NYSE LLY    Pfizer   NYSE PFE   and J J   NYSE JNJ   have faced setbacks in their quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer s While Pfizer sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Lilly   J J have a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   You can see  Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer s disease treatments include players like Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Lilly  Novartis and Eisai Biogen s aducanumab is a leading candidate for AD  In October last year  Biogen and partner Eisai announced their intention to seek U S  approval for aducanumab  a few months after it halted two late stage studies on the same drug  following a futility analysis  Biogen s decision was based on positive results of a new analysis of larger dataset  which became available after the discontinuation of the studies  The candidate  if approved by the FDA  will become the first medicine to treat Alzheimer s disease A group of analysts believe that the promising new data from two failed studies on aducanumab have revived hopes for approval of this almost written off experimental Alzheimer s therapy  However  another group believes that the FDA may not approve aducanumab  particularly with mixed outcome results across the two studies  Also  the FDA may require additional studies to be conducted to confirm the candidate s benefits  Biogen also has another AD candidate in its portfolio  BAN2401which is in late stage development Although Alzheimer s has historically been a very challenging therapeutic area with quite a few companies stumbling in their efforts to find a treatment  the market is highly lucrative  This is because more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050  Data  Alzheimer s Association   The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales  As a result  several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer s disease treatments Medical MarijuanaAnother segment of the pharma and biotech industry that will be in the limelight this year is medical marijuana  Canada has become the first major economy to legalize recreational pot  with quite a number of U S  states giving green signal to cannabis in some capacity last year The only FDA approved cannabidiol drug  Epidolex  marketed by GW Pharma  has shown strong uptake in sales and new patient enrollments since its launch in November 2018 in the United States  Epidiolex was approved in Europe in September 2019 Epidiolex oral solution is approved to treat seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome  LGS  or Dravet syndrome  A new drug application seeking approval of Epidiolex for a new indication   tuberous sclerosis complex   is expected to be filed in early 2020  A late stage study on Rett Syndrome is ongoing  Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential  GW Pharma has several new formulations of CBD in development including modified oral solution  capsule and intravenous formulationThe industry is expected to grow rapidly with legislators allowing or looking to allow more legal uses of marijuana and marijuana related products  especially in the medical and life sciences industry Zynerba Pharmaceuticals is developing its CBD candidate  Zygel  in pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder  Several Canada based companies like Tilray  Aurora Cannabis  Cronos Group and Canopy Growth Corporation are involved in cultivating  producing and commercial distribution of recreational and medical marijuana We note that there is huge untapped market opportunity for cannabis based products  which can create the next booming industry  We expect legalization of marijuana at the federal level to attract several big pharma companies into development of marijuana based drugs  which can boost sales of cannabis based drugs  Moreover  this will likely create new treatment options for patients if the unsubstantiated claims are proved in clinical studies Rare DiseasesA rare disease is a condition affecting less than 200 000 people in the United States  There are around 7 000 known rare diseases  Though each such disease affects only a few people  25 30 million Americans are living with such diseases  There are numerous types of rare diseases including infectious diseases  CNS disorders  birth defects  and cancers  Though significant progress has been made to diagnose  treat  and even prevent a variety of rare diseases  mainly rare genetic diseases  there are still many such diseases for which no treatments are available  Also  the FDA supports development of drugs for these diseases and there are incentives for drug companies to develop treatments for rare diseases  which also explain increased interest of drug companies in this field  Also  advances in technology  such as gene editing technologies  and improvements in gene therapies  have drawn increased commercial interest to the realm of rare disorders Alexion   NASDAQ ALXN    BioMarin  Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY   and Pfizer are some of the bigger companies making rare disease drugs  Meanwhile  mostly smaller companies have rare disease drugs in their pipelines  which also make them attractive buyout targets for their larger counterparts The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All                 Last year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed

128385,349900,BIIB,Can Biogen  BIIB  Keep The Earnings Streak Alive In Q4 ,opinion,"We expect Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB    to beat expectations when it reports fourth quarter and full  year 2019 results on Jan 30  before market open In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10 88  Biogen s shares have declined 15 7  in the past year compared with the  s decrease of 4 7  in the same time frame Biogen s earnings performance has been strong as it delivered a positive surprise in each of the four trailing quarters with the average being 9 30  Biogen Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderBiogen s third quarter MS revenues  excluding Ocrevus royalties  were almost flat over year and we expect fourth quarter performance to have been similar  Biogen receives royalties on U S  sales of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   newly launched MS drug  Ocrevus which is likely to have contributed significantly to the top line  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ocrevus royalties is  192 million Among the MS drugs  Tecfidera s U S  revenues are likely to have been supported by patient growth  Meanwhile  ex U S  Tecfidera revenues are likely to have benefited from volumes increases in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter  which might have offset the impact of ongoing price decreases in certain European countries  U S  sales of another MS drug  Tysabri may have been hurt by Ocrevus launch The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera in the fourth quarter is pegged at  1 13 billion while that for Tysabri is  466 million Meanwhile  combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  are likely to have declined due to transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Spinraza sales are likely to have been driven by continued patient growth in U S  markets across both mature and new markets and strong performance in established markets such as EU and Japan in ex U S  segment  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Spinraza is  549 million On the third quarter conference call  Biogen had said that it witnessed some negative impact of Novartis  new SMA treatment  Zolgensma s launch on Spinraza s U S  sales in this segment  Zolgensma is approved to treat children under two years old  which represents about 5  of the prevalent market  An update is expected on the fourth quarter conference call Interestingly  biosimilars contributed significantly to Biogen s top line in the first three quarters of 2019 driven mainly by Imraldi s launch  a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of biosimilars is  201 million Importantly  in October  Biogen revealed controversial plans to pursue U S  regulatory approval of aducanumab based on positive results of a new analysis of larger dataset from the discontinued ENGAGE and EMERGE studies  which became available after the studies were ceased In March  Biogen and Eisai had discontinued ENGAGE and EMERGE following a futility analysis  which relied on an earlier and smaller dataset  Biogen  in October  had said that a new analysis of the larger dataset showed a different outcome than the one predicted at the time of the futility analysis  In October  Biogen said it plans to submit a biologics license application  BLA  seeking approval of aducanumab to the FDA in early 2020 Numerous investor questions are expected on Biogen s timeline for filing the regulatory application for aducanumab on the call Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Biogen in the soon to be reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for a likely positive surprise Earnings ESP  Biogens Earnings ESP is  3 95  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 95 is lower than the Most Accurate Estimate of  8 27  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Biogen has a Zacks Rank  3 Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large biotech stocks that also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   with an Earnings ESP of  4 45  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 4  You can see  Alexion   NASDAQ ALXN   has an Earnings ESP of  5 97  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is scheduled to release results on Jan 30 Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2019  while the S P 500 gained and impressive  53 6   five of our strategies returned  65 8    97 1    118 0    175 7  and even  186 7  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2019  while the S P averaged  6 0  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  54 7  per year ",2020-01-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-biogen-biib-keep-the-earnings-streak-alive-in-q4-200501745,200501745

128389,349904,BIIB,Better Buy  Gilead Sciences vs  Biogen,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  are two cheap stocks for healthcare investors to consider today  Neither stock has performed particularly well over the past few years  and both have significant question marks  They re risky buys  but if they perform well in 2020  their share prices could take off  Let s take a look at which one is the better buy for not just this year  but for the long term as well 
Will Gilead s pipeline be enough to save the crashing stock 
In five years  Gilead s share price has fallen by more than 35   and over the past 12 months its returns have been flat  In contrast  the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has risen by 45  in five years and increased by 22  in the last year  Gilead s been an underperformer for years  as not only have its sales been shrinking from  32 6 billion in 2015 to just  22 1 billion in 2018  but profitability has also fallen from  18 1 billion to  5 5 billion during that time 
While HIV product sales of  14 6 billion in fiscal 2018 rose by 12  from the prior year and are up 25  in two years  there s been a more profound decline in the sale of Harvoni during that time  Harvoni treats patients who have Hepatitis C  and in 2016 its product sales totaled  9 1 billion  The drug then declined to just  1 2 billion in 2018  decreasing more than 86  in only two years  The change in Gilead s product mix is also likely the reason for the change in its product gross margin  which in 2016 was 86  and is now at 78   Falling sales along with a declining gross margin only make it more difficult for the company to cover rising expenses 

The company needs new products to help turn around its numbers and inject some growth into its financials  The problem is that although it has many products it is working on with more than 100 active clinical studies  it s too early to tell if any one of those will be able to generate the sales needed to make Gilead an attractive buy  Outside of its HIV products  only two    Harvoni and Epclusa    had sales of more than  1 billion in fiscal 2018  New products are great for growth  but finding a winner is easier said than done 
Is Biogen too dependent on the success of one drug 
Biogen is another stock that s struggled in recent years  but its decline has been more modest than Gilead s  falling 14  in five years and just 4  over the past 12 months  However  the stock dropped  100 last March when the company scrapped trials relating to its key Alzheimer s drug  aducanumab  which did not have encouraging results  The company did not believe it was likely to pass late stage trials  Biogen s stock dropped from  320 to below  220 in just two days 
However  in October  the company flipped the script and said it was going to seek approval for the drug in the U S  after additional data showed that one of the trials was successful  While the reversal did not entirely make up for the losses the stock incurred in March  it did help rally the share price  which closed 2019 just short of  300 
The problem for Biogen investors is that they need good news from aducanumab or the stock could be headed back down in a hurry  Over the past nine months  the company s sales have grown by just 4 9  from the same prior year period  While multiple sclerosis product sales during the past nine months of  6 3 billion continue to make up the bulk  75   of the company s sales  they re also down from the prior year when sales were  6 4 billion  Spinal muscular atrophy drug sales of  1 6 billion from Spinraza represent the only other segment that has more than  1 billion in revenue  While sales from the segment have risen an encouraging 24  in one year  Biogen needs more than that to stimulate its long term growth 
Gilead s diversification makes it the better stock
Both of these healthcare stocks pose risks for investors today  Valuation multiples can change rapidly for either company depending on how their new drugs do  and that s why Biogen trading at less than 11 times earnings compared to Gilead trading at 31 times shouldn t be the only metric that investors consider today  
Biogen has more overall risk and dependency on aducanumab  which makes it hard to justify buying the stock today  While a good trial result will certainly help improve the company s prospects  it s proven to be too volatile with respect to the success of just one drug  That s why Gilead  despite trading at a higher earnings multiple and being the more expensive stock of the two  may be a better long term buy since all of its hopes aren t in just one basket ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pduoe,2052555
128390,349905,BIIB,Better Buy  AbbVie vs  Biogen,news,"AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  are two pharma stocks that haven t performed well lately  Over the last 12 months  AbbVie s shares are down by 2   while Biogen s stock is down by 10   By contrast  the pharmaceutical industry    as measured by the SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals Index    is up by 14  over the same period 
However  2020 could be very different for both companies  as AbbVie is hoping its acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN  pays off  while Biogen is putting its hopes on its potential drug for Alzheimer s disease  AD   aducanumab  With that in mind  let s see which of these two companies is the better buy today  
AbbVie isn t dead in the water yet
Humira remains AbbVie s top selling drug  However  Humira has been facing stiff competition from biosimilars in Europe  and the international sales of the drug have declined as a result  Beyond Humira  the company can count on such products as cancer drugs Venclexta and Imbruvica  as well as Skyrizi  a medicine for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 

AbbVie s revenue growth has been crawling in recent quarters  During the third quarter  the company reported net revenue of  8 5 billion  a meager 3 5  increase year over year  Humira s net revenue was  4 9 billion  a 3 7  decrease compared to the prior year quarter  This was because Humira s international revenue declined by 33 5  year over year 
And while sales of Imbruvica increased by 29 3  year over year  and sales of Venclexta grew by 130   revenue from these products is unlikely to be enough to offset Humira s decreasing sales  This is precisely why AbbVie is acquiring Allergan in an all cash transaction valued at  63 billion  Once this transaction closes    which is expected to happen in early 2020    AbbVie will become a leader in the medical aesthetics market 
AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez said  

With the planned acquisition of Allergan  we will be adding highly valuable on market assets with leadership positions across additional and attractive growth segments including significant new growth platforms in medical aesthetics and CNS  Central Nervous System  

Gonzalez also touted the value of the most important asset the company will be acquiring in this transaction  namely Botox    B ased on the uniqueness of this particular molecule  we have come to the conclusion that it would be extremely difficult to create a biosimilar version of Botox and I would tell you  we looked at this very extensively with a lot of outside expertise and we feel very confident that that s the case   In other words  AbbVie s future after Humira may not look so bleak after all  
Biogen s hopes rest on aducanumab
Biogen s current top selling product is multiple sclerosis  MS  drug Tecfidera  The company s lineup also includes MS drug Tysabri  a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy  and Flixabi  a biosimilar for rheumatoid arthritis 
Much like AbbVie  Biogen s financial results haven t been particularly impressive recently  During the third quarter  the company s revenue was  3 6 billion  a mediocre 5  increase compared to the year ago period  Most notably  sales of Tecfidera only increased by 3  year over year  Biogen s bright spot during the quarter was Spinraza  whose sales increased by 17  compared to the prior year quarter  But Biogen s MS segment    its largest medical segment by revenue    continues to struggle to generate stellar top line growth  and the company is looking elsewhere for a boost  
That s where aducanumab comes in  Before investors place their hopes in this potential blockbuster drug for AD  though  it is essential to review its history  Biogen first announced it was abandoning the development of aducanumab in March because monthly doses of the AD drug failed to prove their efficacy in a pivotal late stage trial  But in October  Biogen argued that a few more monthly doses of aducanumab were shown to be effective in treating AD after all  and the company decided to bring aducanumab back from the dead 
Biogen is hoping to send aducanumab to the U S  Food and Drug Administration for approval sometime this year  and if all goes well  the company will receive approval for this potential blockbuster medicine later in the year  However  whether things will work out as planned for Biogen is far from being a foregone conclusion 
Which stock is the better buy 
Both AbbVie and Biogen are attractively valued  Biogen s forward price to earnings  PE  ratio is 8 87  and its price to earnings to growth  PEG  ratio is 1 72  AbbVie  with its  forward PE of 9 10 and its PEG of 2 74  is slightly less attractive   
However  AbbVie is a more attractive dividend stock  The company currently offers a juicy 5 3  dividend yield  and AbbVie has raised its quarterly dividend payouts by 141  over the past five years  By contrast  Biogen currently does not return cash to its shareholders by way of dividends 
With that said  I think AbbVie looks like the better option right now  While the company s sales of Humira will continue to decline  Humira alone generated more revenue than Biogen s entire lineup during the last quarter   4 9 billion versus  3 6 billion   Further  AbbVie s acquisition of Allergan will bring more diversification to its revenue stream  By contrast  Biogen s future is hanging on aducanumab  and if the FDA does not approve the AD drug  the company s shares will likely come crashing down  again   and its future will look bleak ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfdht,2054802

128393,349908,BIIB,Why Biogen Stock Slumped Last Year,news,"What happened
Biotech heavyweight Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  failed to follow the broader industry higher last year  Despite biotech stocks at large posting market beating gains in 2019  Biogen s shares actually lost 1 4  of their value last year  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  
So what
Biogen s stock lost ground for three key reasons in 2019 

The company s core multiple sclerosis franchise essentially flatlined from a revenue generation standpoint  
Although Biogen did reel off a handful of important business development deals in 2019  the company didn t pursue a bolt on acquisition that would immediately change its near term outlook  
Biogen s decision to pursue a regulatory approval for its controversial Alzheimer s disease drug candidate  aducanumab  failed to win over the whole of the investing community  Most industry insiders  in fact  think that the Food and Drug Administration will ultimately reject the drug  


Now what
Even though Biogen hasn t even filed for aducanumab s approval  the biotech is reportedly already gearing up for the drug s potential launch  That s a rather surprising move  given that aducanumab faces an uphill battle on the regulatory front 
The key takeaway  though  seems to be that management probably won t pull the trigger on a major acquisition in 2020  Avoiding the numerous pitfalls associated with costly merger and acquisition deals could turn out to be a stroke of genius    that is  if regulators unexpectedly give the thumbs up to aducanumab 
But the flip side is that Biogen will be behind the eight ball in terms of business development in the event that aducanumab turns out to be a dead end  Therefore  investors may want to take a wait and see approach with this large cap biotech stock this year ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pivx-,2061160
128394,349909,BIIB,2 Reasons to be Optimistic About Biogen s Alzheimer s Drug,news,"Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  shocked investors last year when it said it would submit its investigational Alzheimer s drug to the Food and Drug Administration for approval    months after halting studies that showed the drug didn t work 
The biotech company explained its decision to file in early 2020 for regulatory approval  saying a look at broader data renewed its belief in aducanumab  The drug acts by binding to and eliminating beta amyloid  a protein that clings to neurons in the brains of Alzheimer s patients 

Biogen said the earlier data  which didn t meet endpoints and resulted in halting trials  involved giving the drug at lower doses  In patients with a gene variant that increases a side effect risk  researchers started with lower doses  then later increased them when it was deemed safe to do so 
Therefore  that study  called Engage  had fewer participants getting high doses for the full treatment period compared with Emerge  the second study  In Emerge  the high dose of aducanumab reduced clinical decline  while in Engage  only the subset of patients given high doses showed the same result 
Though this newer data left doubts among some scientists and investors  there are two reasons to be optimistic about a possible FDA approval 
1  The FDA has been approving more and more drugs
In 2019  the FDA approved 48 novel drugs  While down from the total of 59 approved in 2018  it still is well above the 10 year average of about 38 
The number of approvals has more than doubled since 2010  and with the exception of a couple of dips  the approval numbers have been on an upward trajectory for most of the decade 
Why is the FDA approving so many drugs  The answer to that question leads us to the second reason to be optimistic about Biogen s aducanumab 
2  The Alzheimer s drug is a treatment for an unmet need
The FDA faces the dilemma of whether to approve a much needed drug based on weaker data due to market need  or wait until clinical outcomes are met 
Often  the FDA bases a decision on  surrogate  endpoints  which measure quicker to establish elements like tumor shrinkage in the case of cancer drugs  rather than clinical outcomes like survival or disease free status 
Clinical outcomes take more time to meet  which has the result of denying an entire patient population access to a drug that could be life changing or lifesaving   The FDA has increasingly accepted less data and more surrogate measures  and has shortened its review times   according to a recent paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association 
Biogen s aducanumab  if approved  would be the first drug on the market to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer s disease 
According to the Alzheimer s Association  5 8 million Americans are living with the disease  In trials  the Biogen drug showed benefits in areas of memory  orientation  language  and daily activities 
But some analysts and physicians argue that the data falls short of meeting the FDA s requirement of  substantial evidence  of effectiveness 
Evaluate s Vantage 2020 report  which says the FDA s accommodating position on approvals is likely to last  predicts the aducanumab decision could confirm exactly how flexible the FDA will continue to be in future cases 
The Vantage report said a nod from regulators might be seen as  a Sarepta  NASDAQ SRPT  2 0 and a further demise in standards of evidenced based medicine   The FDA drew criticism in 2016 when it approved Exondys 51  Sarepta s first drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  even though an advisory committee said the drug didn t provide enough proof of efficacy 
The example of Sarepta s drug isn t alone  Last year  the FDA approved Karyopharm Therapeutics s  NASDAQ KPTI  Xpovio for multiple myeloma even though the advisory committee favored waiting for further trial data and recommended postponing an approval  In these cases  as in the case of Biogen s Alzheimer s drug  patients  treatment options are limited    and an FDA refusal could draw ire from patient groups 
What does this mean for investors 
The FDA s decisions and flexibility are indeed reasons to be optimistic about aducanumab  but it still is too early for Biogen and its investors to proclaim victory 
Once Biogen submits aducanumab to the FDA  investors should be on the lookout for the advisory committee s opinion  Though  the FDA doesn t always follow the direction of this panel of experts  the regulatory agency does seriously consider its opinion  A positive opinion from the panel is likely to boost Biogen shares and mitigate the risk of buying the stock 
Conversely  a negative message from the panel is likely to weigh on the shares and shake investor confidence  For the long term investor  Biogen s pipeline makes it a valuable investment  but in the coming months  the aducanumab story may translate into some ups and downs for the shares ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkz9a,2064214
128395,349910,BIIB,Is Biogen Stock a Buy ,news,"Investors who bought shares of Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  in 2010 or earlier and held onto them have plenty of reason to smile  Biogen has gained more than 390  since 2010  Last year  its portfolio of more than 10 drugs  including partnered therapies  generated  13 5 billion in total revenue 
Investors who are newer to the Biogen story  though  might not be as happy  The stock is down 40  from the high it reached in March 2015  and it finished last year 1 4  lower after the company scrapped development of its Alzheimer s drug aducanumab  but then reinstated the program 

After Biogen s great gains earlier in the last decade and somewhat less impressive performance over the past year or so  investors might wonder about future potential  Are Biogen s biggest stock gains in the past  Not necessarily  Earnings  products  and valuation are three reasons why investors can be optimistic about the shares as a longer term investment 
This year  however  the stock seems set for more volatility as investors bet on whether the Food and Drug Administration will approve aducanumab  Another looming uncertainty is whether the U S  patent office will vote for or against a patent protecting Biogen s billion dollar multiple sclerosis  MS  drug  Tecfidera  in the next few weeks 
Aducanumab driving stock performance
Aducanumab has pretty much taken over Biogen s stock performance since last March  when the company said the Alzheimer s treatment didn t work  ending clinical trials  The shares tumbled 33  on the news and only began to recover when Biogen reversed its decision in October  The company shocked investors when it reinstated the aducanumab program and said it would submit the drug to the FDA for approval in early 2020  Biogen brought the drug back after examining data from a broader set of patients who had access to a higher dose of the product  Higher doses reduced clinical decline  meaning it stemmed the worsening of the disease   the company said  Since that news  the stock has climbed 30  
Once Biogen submits the drug to the FDA  the next catalyst will be when the advisory committee to the regulatory agency offers its opinion on the drug  The FDA doesn t always follow the expert panel s advice but does seriously consider it  Lastly  the final FDA decision will be the ultimate catalyst 
With all eyes focused on aducanumab  the biggest risks for Biogen are a negative opinion from the advisory committee and a rejection from the FDA  The stakes are high  considering the absence of a competitor and size of the market  Currently  there isn t an FDA approved treatment that reduces clinical decline in Alzheimer s disease  which affects 5 8 million Americans  According to Zion Market Research  the global Alzheimer s drug market is expected to generate revenue of  5 7 billion by the end of 2024 
Patent office decision
As for Tecfidera and the patent office decision in the coming days that will either favor Biogen or Mylan  the drugmaker that hopes to bring a generic to market  the stakes are surprisingly not too high  Though SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects Biogen to win  he noted that impact on the shares should be limited  with much of the risk linked to the case priced in at the current level  He predicts shares would gain 5  if Biogen wins and fall 12  if the company loses the review and an appeal 
Setting aside the aducanumab case and the upcoming Tecfidera decision  let s turn to earnings  Though growth has slowed for Biogen s MS drugs as the company faces competition from European rivals Novartis  Sanofi  and Roche  MS drugs represented  2 3 billion in third quarter revenue  a 2  increase year over year  The company surpassed analysts  earnings estimates in the past four quarters and most products are posting sales growth  Spinraza  a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy  gained 17  to  547 million in the quarter  while Biogen s biosimilar portfolio grew sales 36  to  184 million  The pipeline is reason to be positive about future drugs that may eventually compensate for declining revenue from older drugs  Including aducanumab  Biogen has five drugs in phase 3 trials and about 20 in earlier stage trials 
Another plus for Biogen is its valuation  Biogen trades at 10 times earnings  and its price to book value    or the company s market value in relation to the actual value of the business    is 3 7  Both measures are close to the lowest ever for the company  Wall Street analysts advise buying the stock  and considering the average price estimate  Biogen s shares have at least 6 7  upside 
Is Biogen s stock a buy 
From a valuation  earnings  and pipeline perspective  Biogen is a buy    for investors who are either very short term or who are in this for the long haul  Here s why  There will be bumps along the road until the FDA issues a decision on aducanumab  Biogen expects to submit the drug early this year  then approval could take about six to 10 months  Investors who buy and sell on a day to day basis could benefit from fluctuations  and investors who believe in the Biogen story and hope to hold onto the shares well past the aducanumab decision likely will reap rewards from the company s sales growth over the long term    with or without the Alzheimer s drug  But investors who want to buy shares now with the idea of selling in a few months may face a lot more risk ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pms85,2067754

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories 
Gilead Announces Top Line Results From NASH Study  Gilead announced mixed top line results from the mid stage study on combination and monotherapy of investigational treatments for advanced fibrosis  F3 F4  due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  
The 48 week  phase II ATLAS randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of monotherapy and dual combination regimens of the nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor  FXR  agonist cilofexor 30 mg  the acetyl CoA carboxylase  ACC  inhibitor firsocostat 20 mg and selonsertib 18 mg in patients with advanced fibrosis  F3 F4  due to NASH 
The results showed that the investigational regimens did not lead to a statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients who achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of a  1 stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH 
Earlier  Gilead s Kite and Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals  Ltd    NASDAQ KNSA   entered a clinical collaboration to conduct a phase II  multicenter study on pipeline candidate mavrilimumab in combination with CAR T cell therapy Yescarta  The objective of the study is to determine the effect of mavrilimumab on the safety of Yescarta 
Concurrently  Kite submitted a Biologics License Application  BLA  to the FDA for the investigational CAR T cell therapy  KTE X19  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma  MCL  
Biogen s Gosuranemab Fails in Phase II Brain Disorder Study  Biogen announced that its phase II study   PASSPORT   evaluating pipeline candidate  gosuranemab  BIIB092   in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy  PSP  failed to meet its primary endpoint   Data from the study showed that improvement in PSP patients treated with gosuranemab as measured by PSP rating scale at week 52 was not statistically significant 
Moreover  the candidate failed to demonstrate efficacy in patients on key clinical secondary endpoints  Based on these data  the company has decided to discontinue further development of the candidate for PSP and other primary tauopathies 
However  Biogen stated that it will continue the development of gosuranemab for treating mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer s disease  Currently  the candidate is being evaluated in the phase II TANGO study for this indication 
Amarin Up on FDA Approval of Vascepa Label Expansion  Shares of Amarin Corporation gained after the company announced that the FDA approved a label expansion of Vascepa  Vascepa is now approved as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction  stroke  coronary revascularization and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adult patients with elevated triglyceride  TG  levels   150 mg dL  and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
The label expansion should significantly boost sales as  per estimates  millions of high risk patients in the United States could benefit from this one of a kind prescription therapy  Vascepa will be a new FDA approved treatment option to reduce the persistent cardiovascular risk faced by many patients despite the use of statins with other contemporary standard of care therapies 
Amgen s Evenity Gets Approval in Europe  Amgen and partner UCB announced that the European Commission  EC  has granted marketing authorization to Evenity  romosozumab  for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture  The approval was supported by the positive opinion given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  in October

128423,349938,BIIB,Biogen s secret campaign to bring its Alzheimer s drug back from the ashes,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO  Reuters    Biogen Inc s  O BIIB  shock decision this week to bring its experimental Alzheimer s drug back from the scrap heap was born out of  top secret  meetings  non disclosure agreements and six months of hashing over trial data with scientists  regulators and statisticians  researchers told Reuters 
Biogen had announced in March that it would terminate two large clinical trials of aducanumab because they were likely to fail  Within weeks  a group of company researchers set out to understand what went wrong 
As they studied data from a larger pool of patients who received the drug  they began to question that conclusion 
In the months that followed  Biogen kept its own trial investigators and committee overseeing the trial in the dark about the possibility that some patients had benefited from high doses of the therapy  researchers told Reuters 
The company said it brought in outside Alzheimer s experts and statisticians to help it parse the new findings  and sought feedback from U S  regulators on whether it could be considered for approval 
The result  made public on Tuesday  was an astounding reversal  Biogen will seek U S  approval for the therapy early next year  once again raising hopes for patients suffering from the brain wasting disease  Biogen shares gained 27  on investor hopes for a multibillion dollar blockbuster 
The risks for Biogen remain high  Wall Street analysts cast doubt on whether Biogen s analysis would pass muster with the U S  Food and Drug Administration without an additional years long trial to confirm the findings 
Several Alzheimer s researchers questioned why one trial appeared to succeed  while another with the same design failed 
Many experts say they are reserving judgment until Biogen presents more detailed data in December 
Company executives are reluctant to characterize their interactions with the FDA  but said they worked closely with the agency until they were confident in the findings 
Biogen was only willing to move forward with seeking approval for aducanumab after meeting twice with FDA  The final decision was made immediately after the second of those meetings  which took place on Monday  Biogen officials said 
For the FDA  to say it s reasonable to file an application after two extensive discussions with them  formal meetings as well as a number of informal discussions  I think it s significant   Biogen research chief Al Sandrock said in an interview 
A NAIL IN THE COFFIN
Biogen s earlier decision to terminate the trials was viewed as the final nail in the coffin for the so called  amyloid hypothesis    the theory that removing a protein associated with Alzheimer s could stave off this fatal form of dementia  Many similar drugs had previously failed 
Globally  131 million people are expected to be diagnosed with Alzheimer s by 2050  up from 50 million today  Any successful treatment could be worth  10 billion or more in annual sales  industry analysts say 
The March announcement also raised concerns about a second therapy  BAN2401  that works in a similar way  Biogen is partnering with Japan s Eisai on both drugs 
Ivan Cheung  Eisai s chief executive  said in an interview that he expects aducanumab s revival will energize enrollment in a late stage study of BAN2401  with results expected in 2022  Patients taking the highest dose of BAN2401 showed some encouraging results in a midstage trial last year 
 That s why in the Phase III trial  we are only studying the highest dose   Cheung said 
The two aducanumab trials   Engage and Emerge   started a month apart in 2015  Each had about 1 640 patients  As they progressed  the company made changes in the trial that expanded the number of patients who received a higher dose 
As part of a planned  futility analysis   outside monitors reviewed half of the data as of December 2018 to determine whether the drug had a reasonable chance of success 
 So many of us felt that this might be the drug that would cross the finish line   said Dr  Sharon Cohen  director of the Toronto Memory program  who led one of the studies  In March  she received the answer  the therapy looked like a dud 
However  patients continued to receive treatment in the interim  Cohen believes the fact that some patients got a higher dose for longer helped swing results in the Emerge study  which ultimately showed a benefit 
A CONTRADICTION
A month after announcing the failure  Biogen began analyzing results from both trials  including additional data from patients who later completed treatment 
By the time Biogen had its first FDA meeting in mid June  the company knew that one of the studies had succeeded  and understood that dose was important  said Samantha Budd Haeberlein  who runs Biogen s Alzheimer s program 
 We did a great deal of analysis in close contact with the FDA to really understand what occurred in these trials   Haeberlein said   It took several months to work through that  
During that entire stretch  Cohen said she and fellow investigators were waiting to hear why the drug had failed  They expected a presentation in July during the Alzheimer s Association annual meeting  but none came 
 I was completely unaware of what had been discovered until last Sunday   said Dr  Anton Porsteinsson  a principal investigator for the trials from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry  Porsteinsson said Biogen asked him to sign a non disclosure agreement before sharing the new analysis 
Cohen said she first reviewed the new data on Monday in what she called a  top secret  meeting  She said the company wanted a few investigators to hear the findings ahead of Tuesday s announcement  but had concerns about insider trading 
Many still question why only one trial succeeded 
 The signal from the positive trial was kind of convincing   said Mayo Clinic Alzheimer s expert Dr  Ronald Petersen  who has been a paid adviser for Biogen  It showed a 23  reduction in a key measure of cognitive decline 
 But the other study  which was meant to be identical  didn t show it   he said   That s the challenge there  ",2019-10-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biogens-secret-campaign-to-bring-its-alzheimers-drug-back-from-the-ashes-2004238,2004238
128424,349939,BIIB,Charity to pay  4 million to resolve U S  pharma kickback probe,news,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON  Reuters    A Florida based charity will pay  4 million to resolve claims that it acted as a conduit for companies including Biogen Inc  O BIIB  and  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their high priced multiple sclerosis drugs  the U S  Justice Department said on Wednesday 
The settlement with the patient assistance charity The Assistance Fund marked the third so far with a foundation linked to an industry wide probe that has resulted in  850 million in settlements with drugmakers and charities 
TAF like the other foundations provide assistance to patients seeking to pay out of pocket costs for medications and says that since 2009 it has provided assistance to 78 000 people 
TAF did not admit wrongdoing  It said it fully cooperated with the investigators and is committed to operating in full compliance with federal guidelines governing how charities like it can provide assistance to Medicare patients 
Biogen  Novartis and Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries Ltd  TA TEVA   which the department said also provided the charity money  did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment 
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co payments for patients enrolled in the government s Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older  Companies may donate to non profits providing co pay assistance as long as they are independent 
But the government has alleged that various drugmakers have used charities like Orlando  Florida based TAF as means to improperly pay the co pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs  in violation of the Anti Kickback Statute 
The investigation  led by the U S  Attorney s Office in Boston  came amid growing attention to soaring U S  drug prices  Co pays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a medicine s cost 
The settlement with TAF centered on payments it received from three MS drug manufacturers  Teva  which sells Copaxone  Biogen  which sells Tysabri and Avonex  and Novartis  which sells Gilenya 
The government alleged that TAF engaged in practices that allowed it to coordinate with Teva  Biogen and Novartis from 2011 to 2014 ensure that it used the companies  money to support patients using their respective MS drugs instead of rival ones 
The department said that TAF also solicited and received payments from Teva for the years 2011 to 2015 that correlated with the charity s spending on patients using Copaxone ",2019-11-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/charity-to-pay-4-million-to-resolve-us-pharma-kickback-probe-2024780,2024780
128425,349940,BIIB,Wild Biotech Day Sparks  7 6 Billion Shuffle for Neurology Trio,news," Bloomberg     Thursday marked another wild day for biotechnology firms as a highly anticipated presentation from Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB   took the spotlight and results from neurology focused peers triggered huge stock swings amid a flurry of reports 
When the dust settled in afternoon trading  the presentation from Biogen  combined with key study data from Sage Therapeutics Inc  and Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc   resulted in a combined  7 6 billion shift in value for the three companies  The huge moves were yet another reminder of how biotechnology investing    and  more specifically  betting on drug development for diseases affecting the brain    can often resemble a roulette wheel 
Biogen s standing room only presentation of detailed results for its Alzheimer s disease drug at a California medical meeting initially sank its shares by 5   The stock later rallied to add about  2 billion to the company s market value  Despite Biogen s advance  some analysts on Wall Street were skeptical  including Mizuho s Salim Syed  who called the data  not that impressive  and added that  old questions remain  new ones raised  
For Sage  Thursday s trading action was a day to forget  The Cambridge  Massachusetts based company saw its shares plummet about 60   That was worth a whopping  4 6 billion as some investors quickly pointed out that sales of the company s lone drug on the market are projected to top out at less than  500 million annually  Bloomberg data show 
Acadia  a company focused on developing drugs to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system disorders  was among the day s big winners after data drew praise across Wall Street  The company added a cool  1 billion to its value after presenting better than anticipated data at a conference Wednesday night for patients with dementia

128449,349964,BIIB,3 Best Performing Biotech Funds So Far In 2019,opinion,The biotechnology industry has surpassed the S P 500 so far this year  turning up as one of the best performers this year  The better than average performance of the industry has been mainly driven by mergers and acquisitions  initial public offerings  IPOs   introduction of biosimilars  collaborative operations  rising use of AI and new job opportunities In fact  the major biotech ETFs and indexes have performed impressively so far this year  The SPDR S P Biotech ETF  NYSE XBI  has gained 26 7  year to date  while the ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology  BIB  added 38 4  Biotechnology mutual funds are good investment options regardless of how the financial markets are performing  Investors who wish to make the best of the biotechnology industry s gains could consider investing in mutual funds focused on biotechnology companies M As  IPOs   Tie Ups Keep Biotech in the LimelightThe biotechnology sector has been in news since the beginning of 2019  A significant number of companies participated in mergers and acquisitions  In January alone  two major deals were signed  First  Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  announced that it will acquire Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG   The acquisition was finally completed in November 2019 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited completed the acquisition of Shire in January  In the very next month  Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  acquired Loxo Oncology  This acquisition extended the scope of the former s oncology portfolio into precision medicines via the addition of an array of highly selective potential medicines for patients that suffer from genomically defined cancers  There were many other such deals announced during the period The number of IPOs has also been vast in 2019  In fact  the numbers have been rising steadily over the last couple of years This is because biotechnology firms call for much financing  particularly when they advance in their research  Going public not only makes it easier to take care of the financing they need but also gives them more visibility in the industry  This may open up opportunities for acquisitions and collaborations later on  thus helping the company The industry was also in news because of a number of collaborations this year  In October  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  announced a strategic collaboration with BeiGene to help the former expand its oncology presence in China Earlier this year  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and C4 Therapeutics announced a collaboration to evaluate the use of the latter s novel protein degradation platform  The companies plan to discover and develop treatments for patients with neurological conditions The Future of Biotechnology ShinesAccording to   the size of the biotechnology market was valued at  399 4 billion in 2017  The market is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 9 9  from 2018 to 2024 Apart from the factors mentioned above  rise in

128481,349996,BIIB,Roche s NDA For SMA Drug Risdiplam Gets Priority Review,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced that the FDA has accepted the new drug application  NDA  for its investigational agent risdiplam  The company is seeking approval of the candidate for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  
Risdiplam is an investigational  orally administered liquid survival motor neuron 2  SMN 2  splicing modifier for SMA 
With the FDA granting a priority review to the NDA  a decision from the regulatory body is expected on May 24  2020  If approved  risdiplam will become the first at home administered medicine for people with SMA 
We note that a Priority Review designation is granted to drugs with potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment plus prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease 
The NDA was based on 12 month data from the pivotal FIREFISH and SUNFISH studies  which evaluated risdiplam across a broad patient population suffering type 1  2 or 3 SMA 
In November  Roche announced  from the part 2 of the SUNFISH study on risdiplam  The study met its primary endpoint of change from baseline in the MFM 32 scale after one year regimen with risdiplam compared to placebo  as data showed statistically significant improvements in the overall study population with type 2 or 3 SMA 
Moreover  no treatment related safety findings causing study withdrawal have been seen in any risdiplam study to date 
Shares of Roche have rallied 22 5  so far this year compared with the  increase of 5 1  

 
We remind investors that Roche leads the clinical development of risdiplam in collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics   NASDAQ PTCT   
Risdiplam is also being evaluated in a broad clinical program for SMA in patients ranging from newborns to 60 year olds  It includes those who are previously treated with SMA targeting therapies  Additionally  the company has two ongoing studies  namely JEWELFISH and RAINBOWFISH 
Successful development of risdiplam will boost Roche s growth prospects  However  competition is stiff in the SMA market from the likes of Biogen s   NASDAQ BIIB   Spinraza and Novartis    NYSE NVS   gene therapy Zolgensma

128487,350002,BIIB,Lagging U S  healthcare stocks could see short term boost but clouds linger,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Second quarter strength in U S  healthcare stocks is almost as reliable for Americans as warming weather and the start of baseball season  This year  however  the already lagging sector may struggle to sustain any kind of rally  Healthcare shares are suffering from a broad market rotation favoring other groups  market watchers say  as well as from policy related uncertainty  although positive earnings reports in the coming weeks could provide temporary relief  Federal government pressure to lower the cost of healthcare  and in particular prescription drug prices  for consumers continues  And as the 2020 U S  presidential election campaign heats up  that focus is likely to intensify with numerous Democratic candidates keeping it front and center  which could heighten volatility for the group s shares  That could upend a traditional second quarter trend  The overall market tends to be more rocky starting in the period  so investors become more defensive with their portfolios  benefiting groups such as healthcare that are seen as safer bets  according to CFRA strategists  To some degree  healthcare is suffering from its own success  Healthcare was the best performing major S P 500 sector last year  when the overall stock market stumbled  As the market rebounded this year  fueled by the Federal Reserve signal that it was not inclined to raise interest rates  optimism regarding global trade tensions and better than feared economic data  investors piled into laggards  That favored sectors such as technology and industrials  while healthcare s strength last year stemmed partly from its allure as a more defensive bet   When the Fed shifted their stance in early January  it totally changed the backdrop   said Walter Todd  chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina  Investors sold healthcare stocks and  started buying the most beat up names   he said  Earnings could provide a boost  starting on Tuesday  Results are due from diversified healthcare manufacturer Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH   the biggest and third biggest U S  healthcare companies by market value  respectively  Healthcare companies in aggregate are expected to increase first quarter earnings by 4 4  from a year earlier  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  That is the second biggest rise expected of the 11 major sectors and a stand out as earnings for the overall S P 500 are expected to drop 2 1    If the healthcare companies are reporting good earnings and the stocks continue to underperform  then you start to get some valuation support   said James Ragan  director of wealth management research at D A  Davidson  The healthcare sector has climbed 72  of the time during the second quarter  according to CFRA  which looked at 30 years of data  That compares to 62  for the overall S P 500  and is a higher rate than the other sectors  The healthcare sector on average has gained 3 6  in the second quarter  compared to 2 2  for the S P 500  according to CFRA  But the clouds that have rained on healthcare s performance so far in 2019 are not expected to dissipate soon  The S P 500 healthcare sector has climbed 4  year to date  well below the nearly 16  gain for the overall S P 500  as the benchmark index nears record highs   A BAD WEEK   Uncertainty over policy is particularly punishing shares of health insurers and other services companies  investors say  That includes proposals to change the drug rebate system under which drugmakers refund money to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers  and the prominence of Senator Bernie Sanders and other left leaning presidential candidates who support  Medicare for All  government run healthcare  Last week alone  the S P 1500 managed healthcare care index tumbled 10   including steep drops for insurers Anthem  NYSE ANTM  Inc and UnitedHealth   It s a bad week where all these things have kind of combined and people just want out   Jeff Jonas  a healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds  said on Friday  Shares of many large pharmaceutical and biotech companies   which comprise about half the sector   have struggled this year  Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  shares tumbled after the company s closely watched experimental Alzheimer s disease medicine failed in clinical trials  the kind of event that analysts say scare off investors from drugmaker shares broadly  Those stocks have largely avoided the pain doled out to services shares from drug pricing and other policy concerns  but that could change   I am not sure if we are done with the news flow regarding that topic   said Thrivent Financial healthcare analyst David Heupel   Shares of life science tool and healthcare equipment companies  viewed as relatively immune from policy concerns  have outperformed their healthcare brethren this year  But they also now trade at expensive valuations compared to their five year averages  After selling off to end 2018  many small  and mid cap biotech stocks have rebounded this year  making valuations less cheap than they were   I d love to say that healthcare is going to claw back a lot of this underperformance   said Jeffrey Schulze  investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments   
But  he adds  political risk and his expectation that other market groups will lead  when it s clear that global growth is going to come  may weigh on the sector s prospects  ",2019-04-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lagging-us-healthcare-stocks-could-see-shortterm-boost-but-clouds-linger-1836626,1836626

The professional services company blamed the shortfall on continued softness in business from  a few of our largest banking clients  and a slowdown in its health care segment  Cognizant now sees full year revenue up 3 6 percent to 5 1 percent  down from a prior view of 7 percent to 9 percent  Its adjusted earnings per share view was lowered to a range of  3 87 to  3 95  down from a February projection of  at least  4 40  
Wall Street bulls were quick to throw in the towel as eight buy rated analysts trimmed their ratings to neutral  including  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   which wrote that it was  still confused on what happened during the qtr so suddenly   JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  cut its rating to underweight from neutral  saying  execution likely played a role  in the company s first quarter revenue miss as new Chief Executive Brian Humphries took the reins after the period ended

128491,350006,BIIB,For Anderson family  an early bet on SMA gene therapy,news,By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    When Malachi Anderson was diagnosed with a rare and often deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  as an infant nearly four years ago  his parents Tina and Torence had a decision to make  In years past  many of the babies born with the most severe form of SMA  like Malachi  died before their second birthday  Those who survived longer would likely not walk  eat or breathe on their own  By 2015  drugmakers were testing two experimental therapies in clinical trials  a one time gene therapy treatment that is now owned by Novartis AG and Spinraza  a Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  drug which is given through spinal infusion every four months  indefinitely  On Friday  U S  regulators approved the gene therapy  called Zolgensma  for children under age 2 with all types of the disease  The company set the price at  2 125 million  the highest price yet for a new medicine  saying that it was comparable over a five year period to the cost of Spinraza  already approved in late 2016   After Malachi missed development milestones and was diagnosed  the Andersons researched possible treatments online  the couple said in an interview arranged by Novartis  They were connected to a family whose daughter had been treated with the gene therapy and were encouraged by the progress she had made   The Spinraza trial was underway in Chicago  several hours from their home in Mansfield  Ohio  Participating would have separated Tina and baby Malachi from his family  including his father and five siblings  to undergo treatments  Tina Anderson said   In addition  some patients in the trial were receiving a placebo as a comparison  a risk she didn t want to take   I didn t want to have to depart from our family   she said   Was it worth me going if he didn t get the drug   A Biogen spokeswoman said that more than 7 500 people with SMA have been helped by Spinraza  and that it is the only treatment available for a broad age range of patients  It has more than 300 patients who have been followed for up to six years  An hour from their home  Nationwide Children s Hospital in Columbus  Ohio had enrolled just over a dozen patients in the first SMA gene therapy trial   If this worked  our son would have a chance at a life   she recounted  After passing several screenings  Malachi was chosen as patient number 14  making him one of the last to enter that trial  Within weeks  he received the treatment  an hour long infusion  cradled in his mother s arms  Tina said she was confident of the choice they had made that day  despite the many unknowns of an experimental treatment   I don t think we had much fear going into it  We had prayed about it   she said  The next day reality hit  Tina described shaking and vomiting  overwhelmed with the idea that  we just got something really huge  in a therapy so new   Malachi will turn four this summer  He cannot walk or crawl but can propel himself in a wheelchair and has learned other maneuvers  such as climbing down off the couch  Torence Anderson said  He enjoys going to school and sharing meals with his family  including his favorite food  cheeseburgers  The Andersons say he is gaining strength in regular PT sessions and are hopeful he will be even more mobile  So far they are not looking for treatment beyond Zolgensma  but are paying attention to the new drugs in development for SMA   There s not a whole lot of definitive information on this is what we should be doing  this is what needs to happen   Torence said   We are hoping the decisions that we are making are the right decisions    HIGH COST FOR FAMILIES  As part of a clinical trial  the Andersons received Zolgensma at no cost  It is unclear how much patients will now pay for the therapy under their insurance plans or if they do not have insurance   Ahead of the approval  some payers had told Reuters that they were concerned about being able to afford a new generation of million dollar treatments like Zolgensma  Gene therapies are also being tested to treat hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy  another rare disorder  On Friday  Novartis said it had signed a deal with Cigna  NYSE CI  Corp s specialty pharmacy and distribution units  The agreement will allow small insurers and employers the ability to pay over five years  Cigna Chief Clinical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview  They are also working on a payment structure that would enable payers to be compensated if patients receiving the treatment do not meet agreed upon thresholds  Miller said  Dave Lennon  head of Novartis  AveXis unit which developed Zolgensma  said that the largest health insurers  such as  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and Anthem  NYSE ANTM  Inc  are likely to cover the therapy in one payment  Smaller regional insurers and employers would likely be interested in pay over time deals  Lennon said in an interview  Miller said the employers who hire Cigna to manage prescription drug benefits for their workers are worried about gene therapy costs  On the other hand  he said  the treatment has saved the lives of children   I believe there is enough money in the healthcare system to make it work   Miller said

128529,350044,BIIB,Biogen scraps two Alzheimer drug trials  wipes  18 billion from market value,news,By Julie Steenhuysen and Takashi Umekawa CHICAGO TOKYO  Reuters    Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  and partner Eisai Co Ltd are ending two late stage trials of their experimental Alzheimer s disease drug aducanumab  a major setback in the quest to find a treatment for the mind wasting disease and a blow to Biogen  which lost more than  18 billion of its value on Thursday  Experts had seen aducanumab as one of the last tests of the hypothesis that removing sticky deposits of amyloid from the brain of patients in earlier stages of the lethal disease could stave off its ravages  which include loss of memory and the ability to care for oneself  Biogen shares fell nearly 30 percent to  225 70  its largest drop since February 2005  when they fell nearly 43 percent to close at  38 65 on Nasdaq  The decision was based on a so called futility analysis of aducanumab data by an independent monitoring committee that determined the trials had little hope of succeeding  Markets in Japan were closed for a national holiday so the impact of the news on Eisai will be delayed  Eisai in July had touted promising but confusing 18 month results from another Alzheimer s drug  BAN2401  being co developed with Biogen  That drug failed in a 12 month analysis   TRANSFORMATIVE FAILURE  Investors had been cautiously optimistic about aducanumab following early promising data  Without potential future revenue from Alzheimer s  Biogen has poor growth prospects as it faces patent issues over its big selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera and possible competition to spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza  Wall Street analysts said   We view this as a transformative failure for Biogen s pipeline   RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research note  Abrahams  who reduced his Biogen price target to  240 per share  said further declines were likely given that  investors owned Biogen to not miss out on what could have been one of the biggest blockbuster products in the pipeline of large biopharma   Any successful treatment for Alzheimer s  which affects about 5 7 million Americans  is virtually guaranteed to become one of the world s top selling drugs  But efforts so far have had a dismal track record  with more than 100 failures   The two halted trials were in the final stages of testing aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer s and mild Alzheimer s disease dementia  Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting   This disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer s disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience   Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said   Eisai and Biogen said they would continue to work on other Alzheimer s treatments  including BAN2401  Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said Biogen instead should be looking to build its pipeline through acquisitions   They need to stop wasting or stop investing money in Alzheimer s now   Suneja said  Suneja said Biogen has about  42 billion in financing capacity and identified potential acquisition targets such as Sage Therapeutics Inc   GW Pharmaceuticals  O GWPH  and Zogenix Inc that are  very interesting companies that should be considered now  more seriously   WHAT S NEXT  Major drugmakers  including Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and Co  AstraZeneca Plc  Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE   Merck   Co and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   have abandoned Alzheimer s drugs targeting amyloid because of lack of efficacy or safety issues  Roche is still testing an amyloid targeting drug  gantenerumab  at a higher dose after it failed in a trial in early stage disease   Dr  Ronald Petersen of the Mayo Clinic  who has consulted for Eisai and Biogen  said amyloid is clearly linked with Alzheimer s because it shows up in the brains of people with the disease  But removing it did not appear to help   Should we abandon amyloid  I m not completely there yet  but you d certainly like to see some kind of positive response   Many companies including Biogen  Eisai  Lilly and AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   are pursuing alternative approaches  such as focusing on tau  another Alzheimer s protein that is more closely linked with the onset of symptoms  Others are pursuing targets aimed at reducing inflammation  which is believed to play a role in the very early formation of the disease  Dr  Howard Fillit of the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation said research must identify biomarkers and diagnostics to help  weed out ineffective drugs earlier   before they are tested in large  expensive trials  Fillit said aducanumab hit its target and removed amyloid but still did not help patients  which makes him  very pessimistic that the amyloid approach will work clinically   He said BAN2401 is not that different from aducanumab   If they want one more shot on goal  I would think that would be a business decision rather than a strong scientific decision

128530,350045,BIIB,Eisai starts phase 3 trials for second Alzheimer s drug after first s failure,news,"By Takashi Umekawa TOKYO  Reuters    Eisai Co Ltd on Friday said it has begun phase 3 clinical trials of Alzheimer s treatment BAN2401  a day after the Japanese drugmaker and U S  partner Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  scrapped trials for another Alzheimer s drug  aducanumab  The aducanumab announcement knocked  18 billion of Biogen s stock value  On Friday  Eisai was untraded  flooded with sell orders at 7 565 yen  almost 17 percent lower than its previous close  The demise of aducanumab came after independent experts determined the trials had little hope of succeeding  marking the latest setback in the quest to treat a mind wasting disease that affects 5 7 million people in the United States alone  Eisai and Biogen were jointly developing three experimental drugs for Alzheimer s  aducanumab  BAN2401 and elenbecestat  all designed to target the brain destroying protein beta amyloid   As we have believed aducanumab was the best hope for treating Alzheimer s  ending its trials is big negative surprise   said analyst Motoya Kohtani at Nomura Securities  BAN2401 has been met with scepticism since the partners reported promising but confusing 18 month results in July  Yet Eisai remains confident in its continued development   We still believe that amyloid beta hypothesis is potentially the right approach for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease   an Eisai spokesman told Reuters  Eisai will conduct phase 3 trials of BAN2401 involving 1 566 patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer s disease dementia with confirmed amyloid accumulation  Alzheimer s treatments are known as being particularly difficult to develop  as both diagnosis and the recruitment of appropriate trial participants are challenging  From 1998 through 2017  only four treatments have been approved with another 146 attempts resulting in failure  according to the Adis R D Insight database

Business description
Formycon is a biotechnology company developing biosimilars  The main lead is FYB201  a Lucentis biosimilar candidate that has completed Phase III and is entering regulatory review  FYB203 is an Eylea candidate biosimilar in preclinical  They are both out licensed  FYB202  a biosimilar candidate of Stelara  is being developed in a joint venture
Financials  H119 results review
Formycon reported H1 revenues of  17 2m as research and development payments from partners vs  24 6m in H118  The operating loss was  0 7m  vs  8m in H118  including non recurring items  
The FYB202 project is run through a joint venture company  FYB202 GmbH   Co KG  with Aristo Pharma  which requires periodic investment depending on its undisclosed financial position  According to Formycon  the projected development cost is estimated at about  130m  which implies a total contribution by Formycon of  32 4m  There was an H1 investment of  4 7m in the joint venture which added to the  15 97m invested in H118 to give a balance sheet asset of  20 7m  Further investment of  12m may be required at some point 
Formycon made a  17 26m placing on 22 March 2019 with Swiss investor M H Equity  M H   The investment was at  29 90 per share for the 577 397 shares  However  M H only part paid the shares to a value of  5m  To resolve the matter on June 26 2019  Wendeln   Cie  KG  an asset management company controlled by the shareholder and Supervisory Board member Peter Wendeln  assumed all rights from the subscription by M H and acquired the 577 397 shares  This increased the combined shareholding of Peter Wendeln and companies affiliated with him from about 18 9  to about 24 6   In the 30 June balance sheet  there remained  12 3m as a creditor 




The H119 profit and loss and cash situation is summarised in Exhibit 1 with a simple projection for H2 based on Edison estimates and management guidance 
After the  17 3m cash raised  less the creditor of  12 3m  cash and cash equivalents was  7 5m  down from  12 3m as of 31 December 2018  Formycon expects H219 revenues of about  18m  Formycon has guided to a small overall reported loss for FY19  If H219 has similar expenses to H1  about  18m  year end cash after settlement of the  12 3m creditor might be about  19m  but this will vary depending on underlying development costs and unknown working capital movement and H2 JV investment  The historic financial position is shown in Exhibit 2 
A marketing partner for FYB201 in the US might be agreed  according to Formycon  in Q419  This will allow a 2021 US launch assuming an FDA approval  In Europe  regulatory review is expected from Q120 with potential launch in 2022 on European patent expiry 




Three key projects for global markets
The lead project is FYB201  a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis now entering regulatory review  The project on the Stelara biosimilar candidate has completed a pilot phase and is due to enter Phase I soon in Q419 and the Eylea biosimilar candidate  FYB203  is preclinical  Formycon estimates that it may enter clinical development in mid 2020  A further project is currently undisclosed 
Although we cite the reference product sales for each project  the in market biosimilar price will be typically lower by c 15 20  initially and possibly 30 50  if competition is tough  One element in these markets is that switching rates from established reference products to slightly cheaper  but not necessarily identical biosimilars has often been slow  For approval  a biosimilar must show comparable safety  efficacy and immunogenicity to the original  reference  products so  technically  there is no reason for prescribers not to switch  In May 2019 the FDA set out guidelines to establish full interchangeability with reference products  This might enhance US uptake of biosimilars 
A new set of EU rules were approved on 20 May 2019 and allow potential competitors to manufacture biosimilars in Europe from six months before the patent and any supplementary protection expires  Formycon does not expect this  in practice  to accelerate the launch of FYB201  but it may enable more rapid launches for other products  for example FYB202 
FYB201  viewing a competitive space
Lucentis  ranibizumab  Roche  US  Novartis  EU   had 2018 sales of  3 7bn  Ranibizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody fragment produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology  it binds vascular endothelial growth factor A  VEGF A   The later competitor product Eylea  Regeneron  initially took sales and market growth from Lucentis  The position has stabilised and Lucentis sales grew 9  in 2018  Lucentis patents expire in 2020 in the US and 2022 in Europe 
Formycon licensed FYB201 to Bioeq  based in Z rich  Bioeq comprises a joint venture between Polpharma  a Polish pharmaceutical company  and the Str ngmann family s investment company  The clinical studies for FYB201 are run by a Bioeq subsidiary  Bioeq GmbH  based in Germany  A US marketing partner is expected to be agreed  according to Formycon  in Q4 2019 
The Phase III study  COLUMBUS AMD  NCT02611778   reported its primary endpoint in May 2018  which confirmed comparable efficacy between FYB201 and Lucentis in patients with nAMD  included in wet AMD   The clinical primary endpoint measured the change in the best corrected visual acuity after eight weeks  All secondary endpoints were also met  The Phase III is now completed with no observed issues about the safety and immunogenicity of FYB201 
Competitors include 
Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis  Korea  sales via Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   with a Phase III  NCT03150589  completing in Q419  the primary endpoint may have completed in January with the safety phase ongoing 
Xbrane  Sweden  is partnered with STADA  a privately owned German based generics and OTC company that sells  some  in licensed biosimilars  The global Phase III  NCT03805100  XPLORE  has a primary endpoint due in May 2020  Xbrane management expect sales from Q122  STADA currently has no US distribution at all and selective EU and Asian coverage 
Roche has a novel antibody  faricimab  in a Phase III  primary data Q321  completion Q422  The excellent Phase II performance was based on one injection every 16 weeks  this might compete in the premium market after 2023  Roche is also trialling a Lucentis medical device delivery system to protect its core franchise  the primary endpoint will be reached in Q1 2021 
Novartis has filed brolucizumab  a scFv antibody fragment against VEGF A  with the FDA  This has a priority review  If approved by the FDA  in mid October  Novartis anticipates launching brolucizumab by the end of 2019  It claims a dosing interval of up to every 12 weeks 
A market complication will be biosimilar versions of Avastin  Avastin has the same mode of action as Lucentis but is a large monoclonal rather than a smaller fragment  Avastin is used off label for nAMD as it is cheaper  generic versions could accentuate this gap  This use is believed to be decreasing because the larger Avastin pack size gives handling and sterility issues 
FYB202  A stellar project
Formycon is developing a biosimilar  FYB202  to Stelara  ustekinumab  Jansen   The product is an antibody that binds interleukin 12  IL 12  and IL 23  These potent cytokines drive the immune response so neutralising them controls autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s disease and psoriasis  In Europe  it was EMA approved in July 2019 for moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis that was unresponsive to other therapies  It is not used for rheumatoid arthritis  a massive market  but is effective for psoriatic arthritis  Veale and Fearon  2015    Stelara has its main US patent expiry in September 2023 in the US and in January 2024 in Europe  Sales were  5 2bn in 2018 driven by the 2017 approval in Crohn s disease 
The general market for these anti inflammatory therapies targeting cytokines such as IL 12 and tumour necrosis factor  TNF  is likely to be competitive with the patent expiries of huge   19 9bn  global franchises such as Humira  adalimumab  an anti TNF monoclonal   mainly used for rheumatoid arthritis  but also Crohn s disease and psoriatic arthritis  Stelara has a different mode of action to anti TNF therapies as it binds a different set of inflammatory messenger proteins  This different approach might be better for some patients 
In Europe  the Humira patent expired in October 2018 and four Humira biosimilars are sold  Amgevita  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN    Hyrimoz  Sandoz   Hulio  Mylan Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics  and Imraldi  Biogen Samsung Bioepis   International  mainly European  2018 Humira sales were  6 3bn after a 14 8  Q4 decline due to European patent expiry 
In the US  2018 sales were  13 7bn  up 9   The primary patent expired in 2016 and three biosimilars are already approved  Amjevita  adalimumab atto  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN    Hyrimoz  adalimumab adaz  Sandoz  and Cyltezo  adalimumab adbm  Boehringer Ingelheim   with Imraldi  Biogen Samsung Bioepis  under FDA review  However  so far patents and agreements with Amgen mean that these biosimilar launches will be delayed and then phased over 2023 
FYB202 has been licensed to privately owned Aristo Pharma through a joint venture vehicle  FYB202 GmbH   Co  KG  Formycon holds 24 9  and will therefore have to fund this proportion of the clinical and development costs  amount undisclosed  but will receive that share of profits  The pilot phase of the project has ended  After FDA meetings  Phase I could now start in early Q4 2019  This implies Phase III starting in 2020 21  There are no clinical trials disclosed  Others such as Icelandic company Alvotech and Australian NeuClone are in preclinical development of Stelara candidate biosimilars  no trials are listed 
FYB203  An eye on the future
FYB203 is a preclinical project to develop an Eylea biosimilar  Regeneron had 2018 Eylea sales of  6 7bn  split  4bn US and  2 7bn international   Eylea is used in a similar way to Lucentis but has a different mode of action as it binds both VEGF A and placental growth factor  Lucentis binds only VEGF A  The Eylea maintenance dose interval is every eight weeks  double that of Lucentis although Formycon notes that in reality clinical surveys show that the use patterns are similar  US Eylea patents start to expire in 2020 but there seem to be patent extensions  Sharma et al   2018  that will prevent biosimilar competition in the US until 2023  European patents expire in 2025  In addition  Eylea formulation patents do not expire until 2027 28  Formycon has filed patents for an alternative formulation that has shown preclinical intraocular bioequivalence 
Formycon has a global licensing deal with Santo Holding and gains sales related royalties  Preclinical work is underway  a Phase I III trial might start in 2020  according to management 
Competitors include a joint development programme between Momenta Pharmaceuticals and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV on the Eylea biosimilar  M710  A Phase III trial  NCT03610646  in 324 patients is underway and due to report primary data in Q120  Alteogen  South Korea  has a preclinical project  ALT L9  so it might be a potential future competitor 
Valuation  Clear pipeline and solid financial position
So far  the biosimilar business has been less aggressive than small molecule generics  This is because the technology is complex and the development and production costs of biologicals are high  which sustains margins  Formycon expects switch rates to increase due to cost pressures on healthcare systems 
Formycon s market cap is about  310m with about  1m of debt liabilities  Adding liabilities and subtracting  19 8m effective cash gives an EV of about  290m  Value progression depends on the likely royalties from FYB201 and FYB203 and the 24 9  profit share from the joint venture on FYB202  Filing for FDA and EMA review and signing a US marketing partner are anticipated short term value points 
Formycon is in a strong position on Lucentis biosimilar development with a completed  positive Phase III and planned early Q419 BLA application to the FDA with EMA submission in Q120  However  Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis is not far behind in the US and both Samsung Bioepis and Xbrane might be ready for the European patent expiry in 2022  making the market competitive 
The other projects are further behind  but FYB202 could develop quickly through the JV  Formycon s 24 9  share of costs will need funding  this is worthwhile as it gives an increased profit share  The Stelara franchise appears not to be targeted by many developers but the related Humira EU market is a battleground  with the US protected until 2023 and competitors queuing to pile in  Stelara might be a more protected market as not all Crohn s and psoriasis patients will use anti TNF products  which might protect volume and margins  The recent EU ulcerative colitis indication extension should boost the potential market 
It is harder to assess FYB203  An Eylea biosimilar should sell very well but competitors seem  oddly  very limited to date given high sales and relatively close US patent expiry in mid 2023  The Momenta Pharmaceuticals and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  joint venture is the clear leader so far  We would expect further entrants over the next few years  The market will also be complicated by new  long acting antibody fragment products from Novartis and Roche at premium prices  However  while the new products may be more convenient  if approved  neither of them has shown clinical superiority over Lucentis and Eylea so the biosimilar market will be substantial and very valuable 
Investment case summary

128612,350127,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   is set to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 22  before market open  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20 71  Biogen s shares have declined 24 9  this year so far compared with the  s decrease of 6 4  in the same time frame   Biogen s earnings performance has been strong as it delivered a positive surprise in each of the four trailing quarters with the average being 8 79  Biogen Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderSecond quarter MS revenues  excluding Ocrevus royalties  were flat over year  We do not expect it to have improved much in the third quarter  Biogen is receiving royalties on U S  sales of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   newly launched MS drug  Ocrevus  which is likely to have contributed to the top line in the third quarter Among the MS drugs  Tecfidera s U S  revenues are expected to have increased as the share of new prescriptions is rising  Meanwhile  ex U S  Tecfidera revenues are likely to have benefited from volumes increases in Europe and Japan in the third quarter  which might have offset the impact of ongoing price decreases in certain European countries  U S  sales of another MS drug  Tysabri may have been hurt by Ocrevus launch On the second quarter conference call  management said that launch of Novartis  new drug Mayzent  siponimod  has had a minimal impact on sales of Tysabri and Tecfidera  An update is expected on the upcoming call The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera in the third quarter is pegged at  1 12 billion while that for Tysabri  Global In Market sales  is  462 million Meanwhile  combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  are likely to have declined due to transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Spinraza sales in the second quarter were supported by continued patient growth in U S  markets  which made up for sequentially lower sales in ex U S  markets due to positive pricing adjustment in France in the first quarter  unfavorable timing of shipments in some markets and continued transition from loading to less intensive maintenance doses in more mature markets  It remains to be seen if ex U S  sales have improved in the third quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Spinraza is  519 million Interestingly biosimilars contributed significantly to Biogen s top line in the first half driven mainly by Imraldi s launch  a trend that most likely continued in the third quarter In September  Biogen and Eisai discontinued two late stage studies on its Alzheimer s disease  AD  candidate  elenbecestat  The decision was taken following a safety review conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring Board  The board s recommendation to discontinue the studies was due to unfavorable risk benefit ratio  An update on Biogen s plans for its AD program is expected on the third quarter call  especially after failure of two AD candidates this year  In March  Biogen Eisai had discontinued ENGAGE and EMERGE phase III studies on aducanumab in early AD Lower R D costs following the closing of the aducanumab and elenbecestat studies are expected to get reflected in the bottom line number Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Biogen this earnings season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a

128614,350129,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  Beats On Q3 Earnings  Eyes FDA Nod For Aducanumab,opinion,"Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   reported third quarter 2019 earnings per share of  9 17  which comprehensively beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 28  Earnings rose 24  year over year  backed by higher revenues  lower tax rate and a lower share Sales of this neuroscience focused biotech came in at  3 6 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter  Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 53 billion Revenue growth was principally driven by higher sales of its key multiple sclerosis  MS  drugs and continued global launch of spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  drug  Spinraza To Pursue FDA Approval for AducanumabIn a separate press release today  Biogen released results from a new analysis of a larger dataset of the discontinued ENGAGE and EMERGE phase III studies on aducanumab in patients with early Alzheimer s disease  This analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA  We remind investors that in March  Biogen and its Japanese partner Eisai had discontinued ENGAGE and EMERGE studies following a futility analysis The new data showed that aducanumab reduced clinical decline of Alzheimer s disease in such patients as measured by the pre specified primary and secondary endpoints  The data also showed that aducanumab is  pharmacologically and clinically active  as determined by dose dependent effects in reducing accumulation of amyloid  a kind of protein  in the arteries of the brain  Based on this data  Biogen plans to submit a biologics license application  BLA  seeking approval of aducanumab to the FDA in early 2020  This new analysis of a larger dataset includes additional data that became available after the pre specified futility analysis  This includes a subset of patients getting the highest dose of the drug The promising new data from two failed studies on aducanumab have revived hopes for approval of this almost written off experimental Alzheimer s therapy Quarter in DetailProduct sales in the quarter were  2 9 billion  up 4  year over year  Royalties on sales of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   MS drug  Ocrevus were  188 million in the quarter  up 37  year over year  Though Ocrevus poses strong competition to Biogen s MS drugs  the company receives royalties on U S  sales of Ocrevus from Roche  Revenues from Biogen s share of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits increased 9  from the year ago period to  408 million  Other revenues declined 26  in the quarter to  110 million Biogen s MS revenues of  2 35 billion in the reporter quarter  including Ocrevus royalties  rose 2  year over year but declined 2  sequentially  Tecfidera sales rose 3  year over year to  1 12 billion driven by revenue growth in international markets  However  Tecfidera global sales declined 2  sequentially  U S  sales in the quarter were  842 0 million  flat year over year while ex U S  sales were  280 4 million  up 13 1  Tysabri sales rose 3  year over

Plegridy  in the quarter were  530 million  down 10  year over year  Avonex revenues declined 13  from the year ago quarter to  420 million  Plegridy contributed  110 million to revenues  up 2  year over year U S  Interferon revenues have been declining due to transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Sales of Spinraza increased 17  year over year and 12  sequentially to  547 0 million driven by higher sales in the United States as well as ex U S  markets Spinraza U S  sales were  236 7 million in the quarter  up 5 7  year over year driven by continued patient growth  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza sales rose 27 3  year over year to  310 4 million The number of patients on Spinraza grew approximately 3  in the United

TakeBiogen beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the third quarter  However  the results were overshadowed by Biogen s announcement that it will pursue regulatory approval of aducanumab  which pushed its stock up almost 35  in pre market trading  However  this year  till Oct 21   Biogen s shares declined 25 7  compared with the  s decrease of 5 8  in the same time frame   We like Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline  Several of these assets have transformative potential  In the third quarter alone  Biogen initiated two new clinical programs targeting Parkinson s disease and brain contusion  Nine important data readouts are expected by the end of 2020 However  Biogen is heavily reliant on sales of its drugs for MS  which is a highly competitive disease space  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from Novartis  oral gene therapy for SMA Type 1  Zolgensma  which was approved by the FDA for use in children less than 2 years old in May 2019  is a concern Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Biogen Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

128641,350156,BIIB,6 Small Drug Stocks In Focus Ahead Of World Alzheimer s Day,opinion,Every year World Alzheimer s Day is observed on Sep 21  which is part of World Alzheimer s Month  The theme this year is to raise awareness to counter the common stigma surrounding Alzheimer s related dementia  The World Alzheimer s Month campaign was launched in 2012 A type of dementia  Alzheimer s disease  AD  is a progressive medical condition  The majority of AD patients are aged above 65 years  However  per estimates  approximately 200 000 people below the senior citizen age bracket are suffering from the disease in the United States alone  Most people often think that this disease is normal during one s silver years Drugs Therapies Currently ApprovedWhile there is no cure for the disease yet  there are a few drugs approved by the FDA for Alzheimer s that help control the symptoms  A class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors is administered to patients in the early to moderate stages of Alzheimer s  Among these  Exelon  NYSE EXC  patch is a prescription medicine used to treat mild  moderate  and severe memory problems associated with AD  Allergan s Namenda is an N methyl D aspartate  NMDA  receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer s type  Generic versions of Namenda have also been launched Failures Outweigh SuccessesAlzheimer s has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments  both funds and resources   Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease  This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer  Also  Alzheimer s progress may go unnoticed for years   By the time  the symptoms of the ailment become evident  significant functions may be already lost  which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult According to the Alzheimer s Association  in the 10 years from 2002 2012  244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer s in studies registered with clinicaltrials gov  out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval Big shots like Merck  Lilly  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Novartis and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  have terminated development of candidates for AD due to failure of studies Among more recent failures  in July  Amgen Novartis discontinued two pivotal late stage studies on their BACE1 inhibitor CNP520 to prevent or delay the symptoms of AD in a high risk population as some patients in the studies experienced worsening of cognitive function  Last week  Biogen Eisai discontinued two late stage studies on elenbecestat  following a safety review conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring Board  The board s recommendation to discontinue the studies was due to unfavorable risk benefit ratio  In March  Biogen Eisai discontinued two phase III studies on aducanumab in early AD as a futility analysis showed that the studies were unlikely to meet their primary endpoints  In January  Roche  RHHBY  discontinued two late stage studies evaluating crenezumab as it was unlikely to meet primary endpoints of the studies  Roche is developing crenezumab in partnership with AC Immune   NASDAQ ACIU   Interest Still Alive in the AreaDespite the setbacks  several companies continue to invest heavily in developing AD treatments  given the high commercial potential of this market  estimated value of the U S  market for the disease is around  30 billion  and also due to an increase in the understanding of this disease  Success in this area will lead to huge returns  considering 5 8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer s disease with the numbers expected to more than double by 2050  Data  Alzheimer s Association   It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States  The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales In 2018  the FDA proposed new guidelines  which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer s disease drugs  aimed to treat earlier stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality  This strategy is part of FDA s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions  These efforts by the FDA may also reinvigorate research efforts related to Alzheimer s drugs after repeated failures Stocks in FocusLet us take a look at six small cap companies with promising candidates in their pipeline for AD AC Immune AC Immune has collaborated with Lilly is to research and develop tau aggregation inhibitor small molecules for the potential treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases  In July  AC

128648,350163,BIIB,Eisai Biogen to advance Alzheimer s drug  provide fresh hope,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Deena Beasley  Reuters    Eisai Co Ltd and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc will move forward with late stage clinical trials of their Alzheimer s disease drug  BAN2401  and are working with regulators to design the next studies and gain expedited review as a breakthrough therapy  The companies announced this month that despite failing at an earlier stage  the drug slowed Alzheimer s progression at its highest dose  providing renewed hope in a field littered with failures  In interviews with Reuters  Japanese drugmaker Eisai said the treatment also worked at lower doses  Full results will be presented on Wednesday at the Alzheimer s Association International Conference in Chicago   Our plan would be to start more trials   Dr  Lynn Kramer  chief medical officer of Eisai s neurology unit  told Reuters   Whether it be Phase III in the same patient population  or other populations  We are thinking about a number of things   Kramer said the company had already contacted various regulators and plans to pursue accelerated approvals   We are certainly considering  prime  status in Europe   breakthrough  in the United States and  sakigake  in Japan   he said of various paths to potentially swifter approvals  The companies said after 18 months of treatment  patients who received the highest dose of BAN2401 saw a statistically significant improvement in cognitive and biological measures of Alzheimer s versus placebo  That was a welcome surprise as the drug did not appear to be working at the 12 month mark  The news marked a rare success for Alzheimer s research following failure after failure of candidates from companies including  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Eli Lilly and Merck  NYSE MRK    Co  It also raised hope for aducanumab  another Biogen Eisai drug in final stage testing  Both treatments are antibodies aimed at removing toxic clumps of amyloid from the brain  Any successful Alzheimer s treatment is virtually guaranteed to become a multibillion dollar seller  Alzheimer s  the most common form of dementia  affects nearly 50 million people worldwide and is expected to rise to more than 131 million by 2050  according to Alzheimer s Disease International   All the chips are on the table with these two trials   said Dr  Ronald Petersen  an Alzheimer s expert from Mayo Clinic in Rochester  Minnesota  ALL HAD BRAIN AMYLOID One difference  experts say  is that the Eisai Biogen drugs are among the first to use PET scans to ensure study participants all have amyloid in their brains  Many dementia patients in previous trials later proved not to have the amyloid plaques the experimental drugs targeted  greatly increasing the likelihood of failure  The U S  Food and Drug Administration has said it is open to trials that measure effects on biomarkers  such as beta amyloid  rather than symptoms like memory loss  to allow companies to test treatments much earlier in the disease  The trial of 856 patients with early Alzheimer s tested BAN2401 at five doses against placebo  Participants were evaluated using an Eisai devised tool that drew from three established Alzheimer s assessment scales  Kramer said the custom endpoint was important as prior cognitive scales were developed for people with later stage disease  The trial also used an  adaptive  design that allowed Eisai to place new enrollees into groups receiving what appeared to be the most effective doses  Kramer would not reveal how many patients received the highest dose   We believe that there are plenty of patients at the higher doses  When people see the results  they will think so too   he said  While the news release only mentioned the highest dose  Kramer said other doses were also effective   There is a clear dose response   he said  The companies will likely face some skepticism  The 12 month results used a predictive  Bayesian  statistical method  while the 18 month results used traditional statistical methods to assess the drug  Kramer said the goal at 12 months was to show an 80 percent probability that patients would be 25 percent better off at the end of the trial than those who got a placebo   This was a very complicated trial design  I m not surprised that it didn t work   said Dr  Paul Aisen of the University of Southern California s Alzheimer s Therapeutic Research Institute  Aisen said he wished they had used a more traditional design from the start   Now we re left having to worry about changing the analysis after seeing some of the results and what kind of bias they may have introduced   Any positive data out of these clinical trials  has to be a good thing  even if it s small   said Gareth Howell  an Alzheimer s expert from The Jackson Laboratory in Maine  Dr  Stephen Salloway  a Brown University neurologist and an investigator on the aducanumab trials  said the BAN2401 results provide  consistent evidence that this strategy could be effective   
Kramer said there is no doubt the BAN2401 results are positive for aducanumab s prospects   It has a bigger positive implication for BAN2401   he said ",2018-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/eisaibiogen-to-advance-alzheimers-drug-provide-fresh-hope-1542021,1542021

128688,350203,BIIB,Are Investors Undervaluing Biogen  BIIB  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Biogen  BIIB   BIIB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is BIIB s P B ratio of 3 29  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 3 32  Over the past year  BIIB s P B has been as high as 5 85 and as low as 3 08  with a median of 4 67 
Finally  investors should note that BIIB has a P CF ratio of 7 08  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  BIIB s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 7 54  Over the past 52 weeks  BIIB s P CF has been as high as 20 62 and as low as 7 04  with a median of 12 04 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Biogen s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that BIIB is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-biogen-biib-right-now-200455160,200455160
128691,350206,BIIB,Amgen  AMGN  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Amgen  AMGN   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  211 9 in the previous session  Amgen has gained 5 9  since the start of the year compared to the 3 8  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the  0 5  return for the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 30  2019  Amgen reported EPS of  3 97 versus consensus estimate of  3 58 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 43  
For the current fiscal year  Amgen is expected to post earnings of  14 25 per share on  22 79 billion in revenues  This represents a  1 04  change in EPS on a  4 04  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  14 91 per share on  22 88 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 68  and 0 42   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Amgen may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Amgen has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are D and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 11 4X versus its peer group s average of 14 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 42  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Amgen currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Amgen passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Amgen shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Amgen Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Amgen have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Genomic Health  GHDX   Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   and Biogen  BIIB   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 38  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Amgen  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-amgn-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200455121,200455121

128705,350220,BIIB,Samsung BioLogics  shares slide again  unit s valuation jump questioned,news,"By Joyce Lee and Ju min Park
SEOUL  Reuters    Shares in South Korea s Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd  KS 207940  fell 3 5 percent on Thursday  a day after losing almost  6 billion in market value as the contract biotech drugmaker was hit by a regulatory probe into its accounting rules 
South Korea s financial regulator said earlier this week it had given preliminary notice to BioLogics  an affiliate of tech giant Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   and its auditors of measures it could take concerning breach of accounting rules 
While the regulator did not elaborate  some lawmakers and an activist group have previously said BioLogics breached rules to inflate net profit before its 2016 listing  The drugmaker has denied it breached rules 
According to its stock market filing in 2016  the valuation in its books of loss making drug developing unit Samsung Bioepis jumped by 18 times to 4 8 trillion won   4 5 billion  in 2015 after it switched to valuing the unlisted firm at fair market value instead of at book value 
BioLogics said on Wednesday it treated Bioepis as an affiliate  not a unit  from 2015 and thus switched to fair market valuation  because it could lose control of the unit due to the possibility of the unit s minority investor Biogen Inc  O BIIB  exercising a call option to increase its stake to nearly 50 percent 
In making the switch of the valuation method  BioLogics said it followed accounting rules and recommendations by accounting experts  with the approval of country s three major accounting firms 
The change in the method helped BioLogics swing to a net profit of 1 9 trillion won in 2015 from a loss of 28 billion won a year earlier  bringing criticism that the process  ahead of its  2 billion IPO in 2016  lacked transparency and may have misled investors 
 It s unclear how they came up with the 4 8 trillion won valuation for a loss making firm  and what kind of valuation criteria they used to reach that conclusion   said Kim Eun jung at People s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy  the activist group that reported the case to the regulator last year 
 If the value was inflated  Samsung BioLogics shareholders are the victims here  
Some blamed the regulators 
 Regulators could have caught it earlier when it was being listed  I am more upset at regulators than Samsung  We are the ones damaged without any protection   said an asset manager at a local firm who sold off personal holding of BioLogics shares on Wednesday 
Shares in BioLogics  the world s No 3 biotech contract manufacturer after Lonza Group  S LONN  and Boehringer Ingelheim  have nearly trebled since its listing  The news of the notice on accounting irregularities sent shares in the  24 billion company down nearly 20 percent  its biggest daily drop  on Wednesday  The stock closed at its lowest level since January on Thursday 
Regulators are expected to begin deliberating on the case within a month before making a final decision  If they rule that BioLogics violated accounting rules  South Korea s stock exchange could then debate whether to delist the firm  an exchange official said 
Biogen  which owns approximately 5 percent of Bioepis  has yet to exercise the option  and its CFO said last week on an earnings call that it plans to do that and increase its equity stake

128712,350227,BIIB,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Biogen  BIIB ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Biogen  BIIB  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this biotechnology company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Biogen is 16 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 18 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Biogen has an S TA ratio of 0 54  which means that the company gets  0 54 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 19  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Biogen looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 4 8  this year versus the industry average of 3 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Biogen have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Biogen has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

128713,350228,BIIB,Stocks Advance In July Despite Rate Cut Selloff ,opinion,"SPECIAL ALERT  Remember  we need your input to make next week s new Zacks Ultimate Strategy Session episode the best it can be  There are two ways you can participate  1  Zacks Mailbag  In this regular segment  Kevin Matras answers your questions ranging from current market conditions  general investing wisdom  usage of the Zacks Rank or any resources of Zacks com and more  Pretty much anything goes

	Just make sure to email your submissions for either one  or both  by Thursday morning  August 1  Email now to mailbag zacks com  The market got the 25 basis point cut that was widely expected on Wednesday  but the major indices still plunged on the uncertainty of future easing 
	The problem really started at Fed Chair Jerome Powell s press conference  when he said that today s action was more like a  mid cycle  policy adjustment 
	In other words  further rate cuts are possible but far from guaranteed 
	That s not what the market wanted to hear  sending the major indices sharply lower before paring some of the losses by the closing bell 
	The Dow still slumped by 1 23   or about 333 points  to 26 864 27  The NASDAQ slipped 1 19   or around 98 points  to 8175 42  while the S P dipped 1 09  to 2980 38 
	With the rate cut being so widely expected  the market wanted more  It would ve loved to hear that we were at the beginning of an easing cycle  And we know how the market can throw a tantrum when it doesn t get what it wants  Even with today s selloff though  the major indices were up for July  The NASDAQ increased more than 2   while the S P gained 1 3  and the Dow advanced 1  
	That s a second consecutive month of gains for stocks 
	In other news  this was Apple s first session since reporting a positive earnings surprise and encouraging outlook after the close yesterday  Shares of the iPhone maker were up a little more than 2  today despite the lower market 
	If you thought that all the drama was done for this week  think again  On Friday  we re getting the government s jobs report for July  It blew past expectations in June by adding 224 000  which had people nervous at the time that the Fed wouldn t cut rates at the July meeting 
	Though not a harbinger of what s coming on Friday  the ADP  NASDAQ ADP  jobs report today showed 156 000 jobs added in July  which was inline with expectations 
	Well  here we go into August  Let s hope for THREE straight months of gains  Today s Portfolio Highlights Large Cap Trader  The portfolio put the rest of its set aside cash equally into the following three stocks with 5  allocations each 
	  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB    a leading biopharma company
	  CACI International  CACI    a provider of IT and network solutions for defense
	  Logitech Int l  LOGI     a maker of innovative peripherals for the digital world
	All three of these companies are Zacks Rank  2s  Buys  in highly ranked industries  They ve also suffered through pullbacks and have a lot of upside ground to recover  Read John s specifics on all of these new buys in the complete commentary Technology Innovators  You want to know why Brian likes the solar space right now  Take a look at portfolio position Enphase Energy  ENPH   which soared 30  on Wednesday after reporting a strong quarter  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 38   while revenues of a little over  134 million topped our expectations by more than 10   Needless to say  ENPH was easily the top performer of the day among all ZU portfolios  Surprise Trader  In the past couple of quarters  WillScot  WSC  has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate with triple digit surprises  Now  on the eve of its next report  this provider of modular space and portable storage solutions has a positive Earnings ESP of 11 7   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  reports after the bell tomorrow  Dave sees another low bar for its release  so he added WSC on Wednesday with a 12 5  allocation  To make room  the editor sold Skechers  SKX  for a nice 13 2  return in approximately three weeks  See the full write up for more on today s moves  Insider Trader  When Tracey bought railroad components maker Wabtec  WAB  back in late May  the company had been down more than 30  year to date  And then it suffered a panic sell off stemming from a downgrade  However  the editor remained patient  and today it paid off  The market liked its recent quarterly report  so the editor felt this was a great time to sell WAB and secure a 21 3  return in two months   Healthcare Innovators  Short sellers have begun to attack medical instruments company Penumbra  PEN  after a brokerage saw the potential for a big downside  Kevin was holding onto this name on the possibility of some M A activity  But today s pullback convinced the editor to just sell PEN and bank a nearly 25  return in about 10 months  He ll look to get back into the name once it has moved lower

128721,350236,BIIB,In broad healthcare bets  small stocks favored over large,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    When it comes to investing in the U S  healthcare sector  it has paid off big to bet on smaller stocks  So far this year  the healthcare sector within the small cap S P 600  SPSMCA  has gained about 14 percent as investors point to a boost from an expected pick up in deal making  Those gains far outpace the 1 5 percent decline for the healthcare sector within the S P 500  SPXHC   the benchmark for large cap U S  companies  as of Monday s close  While small cap stocks in general have fared better than large caps this year  the edge has been slight   with the overall S P 600  SPCY  up 0 8 percent versus a 0 6 percent dip for the S P 500  SPX    GRAPHIC  Smallcap health stocks in 2018     An expectation for increased acquisitions in healthcare has benefited small stocks  with deal premiums and improved valuations leading to higher share prices  investors say  The anticipation of more consolidation has gained steam as investors began anticipating the federal tax reform package that paves the way for larger companies to bring back money from overseas  Healthcare analysts also point to relatively strong innovation among smaller companies as helping their shares  while some investors cite the potential for smaller stocks to be more immune to concerns about regulatory pressures in healthcare   GRAPHIC  Small cap health stocks  performance over three years      A lot of it is all the M A and consolidation that has been going on  You are seeing it across medical devices  you pretty constantly see it in pharma and biotech  now you are seeing it in large cap deals in the insurance and  pharmacy benefit  side of things   said Jeff Jonas  a portfolio manager focusing on healthcare for Gabelli   Co   That has given the big boost   Over the past three years  small cap healthcare has also beaten large cap   65 percent to 11 5 percent   with small cap outperforming large in the four biggest industries  pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  equipment and supplies  and providers and services  The top small cap healthcare stock gainers this year include diagnostics company Abaxis Inc  O ABAX   biotech Enanta Pharmaceuticals  O ENTA  and HealthEquity Inc  O HQY   which provides health savings accounts  Among large healthcare companies  shares of biotech firms  Celgene Corp   O CELG  and Biogen Inc  O BIIB  have stumbled in 2018 amid product setbacks  along with shares of  Cigna Corp   N CI   following its planned purchase of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts  O ESRX    The stock price of the largest healthcare company by market value  Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ   is down about 9 percent in 2018   Big cap healthcare is generally dominated by major pharma  and they have done nothing     Same thing with big biotech   said Les Funtleyder  healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management   The interesting science has all happened at the small cap therapeutic level   Money flows suggest a small cap strategy within healthcare gaining favor  The Powershares S P Smallcap Health Care Portfolio ETF  O PSCH  has seen its assets grow to  392 million  more than double than at the end of 2016  according to Lipper data   While more than  3 8 billion has flowed out of healthcare ETFs and mutual funds this year   66 million has flowed into the Powershares smallcap ETF  according to Lipper  Similarly  the SPDR S P Biotech ETF  P XBI   which weights large  mid and small cap biotech stocks relatively equally  has drawn  276 million in net inflows this year  The Ishares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  O IBB   which is more heavily weighted to large cap stocks  has had net outflows of  822 million   There s certainly more innovation in the small cap space and I don t think it s any big secret that the pipelines of the larger companies are kind of looking boring at this point      said Terry Smith  director of life sciences research at Emerald Advisers  a small cap investment firm in Leola  Pennsylvania   So they do need to buy innovation   Another factor that could be propelling smaller stocks  including biotechs  is the potential for them to be less in the crosshairs of any concerns over drug pricing  an issue that has clouded the healthcare sector since the run up to the 2016 presidential election  investors said  Smaller biotech companies typically work on fairly innovative therapies or those that address new markets  said David Heupel  a healthcare analyst for Thrivent Investment Management   GRAPHIC  Smallcap healthcare stock graphic  interactive      Typically that is not where we re so worried about price   Heupel said   It s been more in the areas of   I ve got five diabetes drugs that do the same thing  why are we allowing them to price up 6  to 8 percent every year    Greenwood Capital has an overweight position on healthcare in its small cap portfolio  but not in its large cap fund  according to Walter Todd  chief investment officer for the Greenwood  South Carolina  firm   We felt like in healthcare you had a lot of opportunity with much less risk than the large cap space   Todd said  To be sure  betting on individual small cap stocks is still a very risky endeavor  For example  biotech companies banking on one product can see huge share swings on single events  
 It is better to have a basket of them  so if one or two of the pharma or biotech companies fail  it doesn t ruin the entire portfolio   Gabelli s Jonas said ",2018-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-broad-healthcare-bets-small-stocks-favored-over-large-1365371,1365371

128737,350252,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  Up On Q2 Earnings   Sales Beat  Raised View,opinion,"Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   reported second quarter 2019 earnings per share of  9 15 which comprehensively beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 58  Earnings rose 58  year over year  backed by higher revenues and lower R D costs  Also  a lower share count due to share buybacks in the quarter benefited earnings per share Sales of this neuroscience focused biotech came in at  3 62 billion  up 8  from the year ago quarter  Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 48 billion Revenue growth was principally driven by higher sales of its key multiple sclerosis  MS  drug  Tecfidera globally and spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  drug  Spinraza in the United States Quarter in DetailProduct sales in the quarter were  2 88 billion  up 4  year over year  Royalties on sales of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   MS drug  Ocrevus were  183 million in the quarter  up 62  year over year  Though Ocrevus poses strong competition to Biogen s MS drugs  the company receives royalties on U S  sales of Ocrevus from Roche  Revenues from Biogen s share of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits increased 4  from the year ago period to  394 million  Other revenues rose 47  in the quarter to  160 million Biogen s MS revenues of  2 4 billion in the reporter quarter  including Ocrevus royalties  rose 3  year over year  In the second quarter  increase in channel inventory added approximately  25 million to U S  MS product revenues versus an unfavorable impact of approximately  170 million in the first quarter due to a decrease in channel inventory Tecfidera sales rose 6  year over year and 15  sequentially to  1 15 billion  U S  sales in the quarter were  869 8 million  up 5 3  year over year while ex U S  sales were  280 4 million  up 7 4  Tysabri sales rose 2  year over year and 3  sequentially to  475 million  Tysabri U S  sales were almost flat at  264 3 million in the quarter  International revenues rose 4 6  to  211 0 million Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  in the quarter were  554 million  down 11  year over year  Avonex revenues declined 13  from the year ago quarter to  438 million  Plegridy contributed  117 million to revenues  down 6  year over year U S  Interferon revenues have been declining due to transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Sales of Spinraza increased 15  year over year to  488 0 million  Spinraza sales  however  declined 6  sequentially due to lower sales in ex U S  markets Spinraza U S  sales were  230 6 million in the quarter  up almost 12  year over year  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza sales rose 18 8  year over year to  257 6 millionHowever ex U S  sales declined 12 7  sequentially due to positive pricing adjustment in France in the first quarter  unfavorable timing of shipments and a transition from loading to less intensive maintenance doses in more mature markets The number of patients on Spinraza grew approximately 4  in the United States and 17  outside the United States in the quarter compared with the end of the first quarter Samsung  KS

Benepali recorded sales of  120 million in the quarter  up 4  year over year  Flixabi sales of  17 million rose 50  year over year Research and development  R D  expenses declined 42  year over year to  477 million  following the closing of the aducanumab studies  In March 2019  Biogen Eisai announced the discontinuation of ENGAGE and EMERGE phase III studies on aducanumab in early Alzheimer s disease  AD   A futility analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee showed that the studies were unlikely to meet their primary endpoints  Also  R D costs in the second quarter of 2018 increased by  324 million attributable to an upfront payment made by Biogen to expand its agreement with partner Ionis for the identification of new gene therapies to treat SMA as well as a broad range of neurological diseases Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses were up 8  year over year to  553 million 2019 GuidanceThe company raised its full year expectations for revenues and earnings per share while lowering its costs and tax expense guidance The revenue guidance was raised from a range of  13 6  13 8 billion to  14 0  14 2 billion Earnings per share are now expected between  29 60 and  30 40  an increase from the prior guidance range of  26 65 and  27 65 R D costs are expected to be 15 5  to 16 5  of total revenues  less than approximately 16  to 17  expected previously  SG A costs are expected in the range of 15 5  to 16 5  of total revenues  versus the prior guidance range of approximately 16  to 17   Adjusted tax rate guidance was lowered from a range of approximately 18  to 19  to 15 5  to 16 5  Our TakeBiogen beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the second quarter and upped its financial guidance for the year  Shares rose around 2  in pre market trading in response  However  this year so far  Biogen s shares have declined 22 8  this year compared with the  s decrease of 0 2  in the same time frame   We like Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline  Several of these assets have transformative potential  In the second quarter alone  Biogen added four new programs to its pipeline including two potentially mid  to late stage clinical assets in inherited retinal disease from the June 2019 acquisition of gene therapy maker Nightstar Therapeutics Several data readouts are expected in 2019 2020 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s However  its core MS business  excluding Ocrevus royalties  is facing rising competitive pressure  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area as evident from the recent failure of aducanumab and uncertainty over the

128752,350267,BIIB,Sanofi digs deep to buy U S  haemophilia group Bioverativ for  11 6 billion,news,"By Sudip Kar Gupta PARIS  Reuters    French healthcare group Sanofi  PA SASY  has agreed to buy U S  haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for  11 6 billion  its biggest deal for seven years  which it said would strengthen its presence in treatments for rare diseases  Sanofi shares fell 3 4 percent by 0920 GMT  making the stock the worst performer on France s benchmark CAC 40 index and several analysts deemed the deal expensive  The move comes at a time of renewed interest by large drugmakers in smaller biotech firms and predictions by some experts that 2018 will see a substantial pick up in mergers and acquisitions   Sanofi has agreed to buy all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ for  105 per share in cash  marking a premium of 64 percent to Bioverativ s closing price on January 19  Bioverativ  a maker of haemophilia drugs  was separated from Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc early last year  The agreed transaction marks Sanofi s successful return to deal making after its failure to land major takeovers in recent years  It is its biggest acquisition since the 2011 takeover of U S  biotech company Genzyme for around  20 billion  Sanofi lost out on buying California based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  in 2016  and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion  which was bought by Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  last year   With Bioverativ  we welcome a leader in the growing haemophilia market   Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said  The market dealing with treatments for haemophilia is an important one that is evolving rapidly as new drugs change the landscape  Further ahead  gene therapy promises to disrupt traditional approaches to tackling the inherited condition  Sanofi said the sector had around  10 billion in annual sales  dealing with 181 000 people affected worldwide  It added that haemophilia represented the largest market for rare diseases and was set to grow by more than 7 percent per year through to 2022   MORE DEALS  Sanofi expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its business earnings per share in the full 2018 financial year and up to 5 percent accretive for the following year  However  some analysts questioned the cost   Bioverativ looks a relatively expensive acquisition  It is logical in terms of building around Sanofi s presence and pipeline in rare diseases and haemophilia  though management may have to argue against concerns on competition   analysts with Jefferies wrote in a note to clients   The obvious parallel is Shire s highly unpopular acquisition of Baxalta  but Sanofi s 2011 acquisition of rare disease specialist Genzyme was also unpopular at the time  yet has it turned into a major success story   analysts with Kepler said  Sanofi added it would fund the takeover with a mixture of existing cash resources and a debt issue   We have the means to make further takeovers   added Brandicourt on a conference call  without going into further details  Brandicourt has said in the past he was ready to do deals of a similar size to the  20 billion purchase of Genzyme to help accelerate growth at France s biggest drugmaker  One asset analysts and bankers believe could be of interest is Pfizer s consumer health unit  although competition for this business is likely to be fierce   Sanofi said it expected to achieve a return on its invested capital  ROIC  in excess of the cost of capital within three years  The French group also expects to preserve its strong credit rating  This month Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  agreed to pay up to  7 billion to take over Impact Biomedicines and the U S  company is also said to be circling Juno Therapeutics  In Europe   Novo Nordisk   CO NOVOb  has offered  3 1 billion for Ablynx and Japan s Takeda Pharmaceutical plans to buy TiGenix for  630 million  The spate of deal making follows a relatively subdued 2017 for biotech M A

Biotechs in Focus Post Pfizer Array DealShares of many biotech companies have rallied following the announcement of the Pfizer  NYSE PFE    Array BioPharma deal  Announced earlier this week  the deal has an enterprise value of approximately  11 4 billion  The deal is likely to strengthen Pfizer s oncology portfolio as Array BioPharma is focused on developing targeted small molecule drugs for treating cancer and other high burden diseases  Its first commercial therapy  Braftovi plus Mektovi  approved as a treatment for BRAF mutant melanoma  was approved July last year and has shown encouraging uptake  Cancer has become the area of focus of several pharmaceutical companies due to unmet needs and lucrative market opportunities In a move to bolster their oncology pipelines  several pharmaceuticals companies may acquire or collaborate to gain rights to prospective cancer treatments  Major drug biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers into their pipeline product portfolios   either from internal development or from the purchase of assets  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  are the forerunners with huge cash pile  These companies are also looking to expand their pipeline to continue on growth path As expected  there has been an accelerated pace of merger and acquisitions  M A  activity in pharma space this year  especially in cancer  We have already seen some major deals this year  In January  Bristol Myers offered to buy Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  for  74 billion  followed by Lilly s acquisition of Loxo Oncology for  8 billion in February Apart from cancer focused stocks  pharmaceuticals companies are also targeting biotechs with transformative  next generation gene therapies in their pipeline  Gene therapies targeting rare diseases are expected to achieve better efficacy  Moreover  rare diseases with high unmet need can also lead to high asking price for these therapies The performance of the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry has not been impressive as a whole  However  the industry has gained 4  so far this year  after falling more than 25  in 2018  driven by increased M A activity this year  pipeline successes and frequent new drug approvals  Moreover  certain stocks in the sector with innovative pipelines or commercial drugs with significant sales potential have seen their share price rise  Some of these companies have already been acquired We have chosen four companies among the stocks that surged following the Pfizer Array BioPharma deal and have an encouraging cancer gene therapy pipeline or portfolio of drugs  making them potential acquisition targets IncyteIncyte s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead  Amgen and Bristol Myers  The market cap of Incyte is around  14 billion The primary reason behind Incyte being a strong buyout target is its key marketed product  Jakafi  a JAK inhibitor  It is the first and the only product to be approved for polycythemia vera  PV  and myelofibrosis   MF     two rare blood cancers  Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications  In order to expand the patient population and increase commercial potential of the drug  the company is working on expanding its label further Another asset of interest to investors is Olumiant  also a JAK inhibitor  marketed in the EU and the United States  only the lower 2 mg dose  for rheumatoid arthritis  RA   Meanwhile  Incyte s pipeline boasts interesting targeted

128770,350285,BIIB,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Biogen  BIIB ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Biogen  BIIB  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this biotechnology company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Biogen is 17 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 8  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Biogen has an S TA ratio of 0 55  which means that the company gets  0 55 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 18  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Biogen looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 3 2  this year versus the industry average of 1 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Biogen  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Biogen has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Biogen is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-06-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-biogen-biib-200434433,200434433
128779,350294,BIIB,Bumper crop of new drugs fails to lift big pharma R D returns,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    It is shaping up to be a bumper year for drug approvals  with U S  officials clearing twice as many novel medicines as in 2016  yet returns on research investment at leading pharmaceutical companies are down  In fact  projected returns at 12 of the world s top drugmakers have fallen to an eight year low of only 3 2 percent  consultancy Deloitte said on Thursday  The disconnect reflects the rising cost of developing new drugs  meager peak sales expectations for individual products and the fact that younger biotechnology companies are accounting for a growing proportion of new products  So far this year  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  gatekeeper to the world s biggest drugs market  has approved 41 novel drugs compared with 22 for the whole of 2016      The strong biotech sector is good news for investors like Daniel Koller  head of investment management at Swiss based BB Biotech  which has money tied up in fast growing U S  and European companies   It s been a great year for approvals in 2017 and we assume another very positive year for biotech in 2018   he told Reuters   It is a confirmation of the health of the industry   But for the giants of the pharma world tracked by Deloitte  things are not so rosy  This decade has seen shrinking profitability in their research labs  with the average internal rate of return  IRR  down sharply from 10 1 percent in 2010 to 3 2 percent this year  A separate group of four large biotech companies are projected to enjoy an IRR nearly four times higher at 11 9 percent  The calculations are based on long term sales forecasts   The biotech companies are seeing more success   said Mark Steedman  one of the report s authors  Steedman said biotechs typically had a leaner cost structure  although there were signs of big pharma beginning to streamline R D operations and deploy new technologies in drug discovery  such as artificial intelligence   There are reasons for optimism   he said   It s going to take a little bit of time but we the think the impact could be monumental in terms of increasing productivity    2 BILLION PER DRUG Today  the average cost of bringing a new drug to market at a large company is nearly  2 billion  up from  1 2 billion in 2010  while forecast annual peak sales per drug have fallen from  816 million in 2010 to  465 million  The figures highlight a dilemma as R D resources are shifted from mass market treatments to more specialist therapy areas  This year s haul of new drugs does include some likely blockbusters designed for relatively wide use  such as Roche s multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus and Novo Nordisk s Ozempic for diabetes  But many new drugs are for rare diseases  including very specific sub types of cancer  A few are truly ground breaking  such as the first gene modified cell therapy against a type of leukemia from Novartis  and next year is expected to see the first U S  approval of a gene therapy for a rare inherited eye condition   Such pioneering drugs come at a huge price  with Novartis  cell therapy Kymriah costing  475 000  while gene therapy could fetch around  1 million per patient   The insights from human genetics and the insights from an understanding of the immune system are finally being translated in medicines  and very new technologies are now starting to pay off   Roche CEO Severin Schwan said in a recent interview  The 12 big drugmakers analyzed in the Deloitte study were  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Roche  Novartis  Sanofi  PA SASY   GlaxoSmithKline  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   AstraZeneca  Merck  NYSE MRK    Co  Eli Lilly  Bristol Myers Squibb  Takeda and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN

Chubb s shares have gained  8 1  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Property  Casualty and Title industry  which has increased  2 8  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks the company benefits from a suite of compelling products as well as services  Its inorganic growth story is impressive  helping it to achieve a higher long term ROE 
Increased scales  efficiencies and a solid balance sheet will lend it a competitive edge  It estimates solid growth in Overseas General operations  which includes both commercial and consumer lines  A strong capital position aids Chubb to boost shareholders  value and invest in strategic initiatives for driving growth 
However  exposure to cat loss remains a concern as it induces volatility in underwriting profitability  Also  mounting expenses weigh on margin expansion  Chubb Limited s first quarter 2019 core operating income of  2 54 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 49 by 2  and also improved 8 5  year over year on the back of robust premium growth and net investment income 
Shares of Buy ranked Las Vegas Sands have gained  15 7  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Gaming industry s increase of  11   The Zacks analyst thinks that increased revenues at casino  rooms and mall drove the company s top line in first quarter 2019  It generated solid revenues from Macao operations as well 
In the next couple of years  the company is likely to spend  2 billion in Macao  To strengthen the resort portfolio  Las Vegas Sands is focusing on expanding the Four Seasons Tower Suites Macao  St  Regis Tower Suites Macao and the Londoner Macao  Planned investment in new capital projects in Macao and higher revenues from The Parisian Macao are also likely to drive growth 
Las Vegas Sands  consistent focus on a convention based Integrated Resort business model is an added positive  Nevertheless  high debt and competition are worrisome  Estimates for the current year have witnessed upward revisions in the past 60 days

128816,350331,BIIB,Formycon  FY18 Results  FYB201 Launch On Track For 2021,opinion,"Formycon AG  DE FYB  s partner Bioeq IP AG  Bioeq  plans to file FYB201  its Lucentis biosimilar  to treat neovascular age related macular degeneration  nAMD  with the FDA in early Q419  The Phase III met its key primary endpoint  The US launch could be in 2021 and the EU in 2022  FY18 revenues were  43m  which includes  34 5m in payments from partnered projects  Bioeq is the partner on FYB201  Santo on FYB203  an Eylea biosimilar  and there is a joint venture with Aristo Pharma on FYB202  a Stelara biosimilar   FYB202 could enter a Phase I trial in mid 2019  Formycon guides for FY19 revenues of about  34m  Liquid cash at end FY18 was  12 31m  There was a private placing of  17 3m in March 2019  implying Q119 cash of about  29m 
FYB201 and FYB203 target the major nAMD markets
Formycon has two biosimilar projects targeting the nAMD market  In May 2018  the COLUMBUS AMD Phase III study of FYB201 met its primary endpoints  The global exclusive partner  Bioeq  plans to make regulatory filings in the US in early Q419 and in the EU in Q120  Bioeq aims to launch the product in 2021  US  and 2022  EU  and is developing its marketing strategy  Global 2018 Lucentis sales rose 9  to US 3 7bn  Formycon s preclinical Eylea biosimilar FYB203  also for nAMD  is licensed to Santo  Formycon notes that the total payments from development compensation and sales participation should be over  100m  Global sales of Eylea were  6 7bn in 2018  core patents expire in 2023  US  and 2025  EU   One Eylea biosimilar consortium  Momenta plus Mylan is in Phase III  With the cost pressures on healthcare  Formycon assumes a very valuable nAMD market for biosimilars 
A stellar opportunity through a JV
Formycon has made significant progress on FYB202  a Stelara biosimilar for Crohn s disease and psoriasis  through a joint venture deal with Aristo Pharma  Formycon owns 24 9   Stelara  2018 sales  5 2bn  has a different mode of action to anti TNF agents  lead product Humira   19 9bn in 2018  so should be protected from the fierce competitive environment developing in the anti TNF area  The project should enter Phase I in mid 2019 with Phase III possible in 2020 in our estimate  Formycon needs to fund its share of the costs but then shares the profits so this could be very lucrative  Stelara patents expire in 2023  US  and 2025  EU  
Valuation  Starting to reflect clinical progress
Formycon s market cap is about  319m with an EV of  310m  Regulatory review of FYB201 and the clinical progression of FYB202 will be key to adding value in 2019 


Business description
Formycon is a biotechnology company focused on biosimilars  The lead product is FYB201  a Lucentis biosimilar that has completed Phase III  FYB203 is an Eylea biosimilar in preclinical  They are both out licensed  FYB202  a biosimilar candidate of Stelara  is being developed in a joint venture with Aristo Pharma and enters Phase I in mid 2019 
Bull
Leading biosimilars company addressing markets worth  15 6bn in 2018 
Two partnered products plus JV deal 
Potential first to market advantage for FYB201 
Bear
No EMA guidance for intraocular biosimilars 
US biosimilar market still immature 
No apparent Bioeq sales capability yet 
Financials  FY18 results review
Formycon reported revenues of  43 00m in 2018 driven by licensing deals and milestones for out licensed projects  These comprised cash income of  34 5m  vs  29 43m in FY17  plus a non cash recognition of  8 5m from the H118 deal with Aristo Pharma to create a joint venture on FYB202  The company had guided to FY18 cash revenues of  32m  The headline FY18 revenue figure gave an accounting profit of  7 1m  vs a loss of  1 58m in FY17  Exhibit 1   although on cash revenues alone this would have been a loss of about  1 4m 
Investments on the balance sheet rose from  0 25m in FY17 to  15 97m in December 2018 due to the FYB202 JV  The cash outflow after investments was  3 17m so cash reduced to  12 31m in December 2018 from  15 48m in FY17  Formycon had  5 22m in receivables at the year end   10 97m FY17  so effective cash was  17 53m  FY17 26 45m   Formycon made a placing on 22 March 2019 with the strategic Swiss investor M H Equity AG  M H  and Formycon s share capital of  9 4m increased to  10m after issuing 577 397 new shares  The investment was  17 26m at  29 90 per share  Formycon states that the funds will be used for proprietary biosimilar developments 
Management has guided that 2019 revenues will be around  34m  If operating cash flows are similar to 2018  then Formycon will make yearly small loses or a minor profit up to the potential FYB201 2021 US launch 
Bioeq funds the FYB201 project but has no sales operations  so marketing partners will be needed in Europe and  especially in the US  Formycon expects that a commercialisation partner will be agreed during 2019  this could add to overall value 

Three key projects
The lead project is FYB201  a biosimilar to Lucentis and licensed to Bioeq  The project on Stelara has completed a pilot phase and is due to enter Phase I and the Eylea biosimilar  FYB203 is preclinical  Each of these is in a deal or joint venture  Although we cite the reference product sales for each project  the in market biosimilar price will be typically lower by c 15 20  initially and possibly 30 50  if competition is tough  One element is these markets is that switching rates from established reference products to slightly cheaper  but not necessarily identical  biosimilars has often been slow  For approval  a biosimilar must show comparable safety  efficacy and immunogenicity to the original  reference  products so  technically  there is no reason for prescribers not to switch  In May 2019 the FDA set out guidelines to establish full interchangeability with reference products  This might mean further clinical trials are needed but  if followed  it could enable routine switching and so faster penetration to give higher biosimilar shares 
A new set of EU rules  due to start in summer 2019  will allow potential competitors to manufacture biosimilars in Europe from six months before the patent and any supplementary protection expires  Formycon does not expect this  in practice  to accelerate the launch of FYB201  but it may enable more rapid launches for other products  for example FYB202 in 2023 
FYB201  Viewing a competitive space
Lucentis  ranibizumab  Roche  US  Novartis  EU   had 2018 sales of  3 7bn  Ranibizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody fragment produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology  it binds vascular endothelial growth factor A  VEGF A   The later competitor product Eylea  Regeneron  initially took sales and market growth from Lucentis due to a longer dosing interval  The position has now stabilised and Lucentis sales grew 9  in 2018  Lucentis patents expire in 2020 in the US and 2022 in Europe 
Formycon licensed FYB201 to Bioeq based in Z rich  Bioeq comprises a joint venture between Polpharma  a Polish pharmaceutical company  and the Str ngmann family s investment company  The clinical studies for FYB201 are run by a Bioeq subsidiary  Bioeq GmbH  based in Germany 
The Phase III study  COLUMBUS AMD  NCT02611778   reported its primary endpoint in May 2018  which confirmed comparable efficacy between FYB201 and Lucentis in patients with nAMD  included in wet AMD   The clinical primary endpoint measured the change in the best corrected visual acuity after eight weeks  All secondary endpoints were also met  The Phase III is now completed with no issues about the safety and immunogenicity of FYB201 observed 
Competitors include 
 
Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis  Korea  sales via Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   with a Phase III  NCT03150589  completing in Q419  the primary endpoint may have been reached with the follow up safety phase ongoing 
 
Xbrane  Sweden  is partnered with STADA  a privately owned German based generics and OTC company that sells  some  in licensed biosimilars  The global Phase III  NCT03805100  XPLORE  has a primary endpoint due in May 2020  Xbrane management expect sales from Q122  STADA currently has no US distribution at all and selective EU and Asian coverage 
 
Roche has a novel antibody  faricimab  entering Phase III after excellent Phase II performance with one injection every 16 weeks  this might compete in the premium market after 2023  Roche is also trialling a Lucentis medical device delivery system to protect its core franchise 
 
Novartis has filed brolucizumab  a scFv antibody fragment against VEGF A  with the FDA and this will potentially have an H220 launch  It claims a dosing interval of up to every 12 weeks 
A market complication will be biosimilar versions of Avastin  Avastin has the same mode of action as Lucentis but is a large monoclonal rather than a smaller fragment  Avastin is used off label for nAMD as it is cheaper  generic versions could accentuate this gap  This use is believed to be decreasing because the larger Avastin pack size gives handling and sterility issues 
FYB202  A stellar project
Formycon is developing a biosimilar  FYB202  to Stelara  ustekinumab  Jansen   The product is an antibody that binds interleukin 12  IL 12  and IL 23  These potent cytokines drive the immune response so neutralising them controls autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s and psoriasis  It is not used for rheumatoid arthritis  a massive market  but is effective for psoriatic arthritis  Veale and Fearon  2015    Stelara has its main US patent expiry in September 2023 in the US and in January 2024 in Europe  Sales were  5 2bn in 2018 driven by the 2017 approval in Crohn s disease 
The general market for these anti inflammatory therapies targeting cytokines such as IL 12 and tumour necrosis factor  TNF  is likely to be competitive with the patent expiries of huge   19 9bn  global franchises such as Humira  adalimumab  an anti TNF monoclonal   mainly used for rheumatoid arthritis  but also Crohn s disease and psoriatic arthritis  Stelara has a different mode of action to anti TNF therapies as it binds a different set of inflammatory messenger proteins  This different approach might be better for some patients 
In Europe  the Humira patent expired in October 2018 and four Humira biosimilars are sold  Amgevita  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN    Hyrimoz  Sandoz   Hulio  Mylan Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics  and Imraldi  Biogen Samsung Bioepis   International  mainly European  2018 Humira sales were  6 3bn after a 14 8  Q4 decline due to European patent expiry 
In the US  2018 sales were  13 7bn  up 9   The primary patent expired in 2016 and three biosimilars are already approved  Amjevita  adalimumab atto  Amgen   Hyrimoz  adalimumab adaz  Sandoz  and Cyltezo  adalimumab adbm  Boehringer Ingelheim   with Imraldi  Biogen Samsung Bioepis  under FDA review  However  so far patents and agreements with Amgen mean that these biosimilar launches will be delayed and then phased over 2023 
FYB202 has been licensed to privately owned Aristo Pharma through a joint venture vehicle  FYB202 GmbH   co KD  Formycon holds 24 9  and will therefore fund this proportion of the clinical and development costs  amount undisclosed  but receive that share of profits  The pilot phase of the project has ended  After FDA meetings  Phase I is planned to start in mid 2019  This implies Phase III starting in 2020  which Formycon indicates could lead to a 2023 launch  There are no clinical trials disclosed  Others such as Icelandic company Alvotech and Australian Neuclone are in preclinical development of Stelara biosimilars  no trials are listed 
FYB203  An eye on the future
FYB203 is a preclinical project to develop an Eylea biosimilar  Regeneron had 2018 Eylea sales of US 6 7bn  split  4bn US and  2 7bn international   Eylea is used in a similar way to Lucentis but has a different mode of action as it binds both VEGF A and placental growth factor  Lucentis binds only VEGF A  The Eylea maintenance dose interval is every eight weeks  double that of Lucentis although Formycon notes that in reality clinical surveys show that the use patterns are similar  US Eylea patents start to expire in 2020 but there seem to be patent extensions  Sharma et al   2018  that will prevent biosimilar competition in the US until 2023  European patents expire in 2025  In addition  Eylea formulation patents do not expire till 2027 2028  Formycon has filed patents for an alternative formulation which has shown preclinical intraocular bioequivalence 
Formycon has a global licensing deal with Santo Holding and gains sales related royalties  Preclinical work is underway and a Phase I III trial might start in 2020  according to management 
Competitors include a joint development programme between Momenta Pharmaceuticals and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV on the Eylea biosimilar  M710  A Phase III trial  NCT03610646  in 324 patients is underway and due to report primary data in Q120  Alteogen  South Korea  has a preclinical project  ALT L9  so it might be a potential future competitor 
Valuation  Clear pipeline and solid financial position
Formycon s market cap  14 May 2019  is  319m  Adding liabilities and subtracting cash gives an EV of about  310m  The current base value is set by the M H investment at  29 90 per share  Value progression depends on the likely royalties from FYB201 and FYB203 and the 24 9  profit share from the joint venture on FYB202  So far  the biosimilar business has been less aggressive than small molecule generics  This is because the technology is complex and the production costs of biologicals are high  which sustains margins but reduces the incentive to switch unless products are proved interchangeable 
Formycon is in a strong position on Lucentis biosimilar development with a completed  positive Phase III and planned early Q419 BLA application to the FDA with EMA submission in Q120  However  Samsung Bioepis is not far behind in the US and both Samsung Bioepsis and Xbrane might be ready for the European patent expiry in 2022  making the market competitive  Bioeq has no stated plans for marketing  a crucial aspect  However  Formycon expects Bioeq to announce its US and European marketing partners during 2019 to add value to the investment case 
The other projects are further behind but FYB202 could develop quickly through the JV  Formycon s 24 9  share of costs will need funding  this is worthwhile as it gives increased profit share  The Stelara franchise itself appears not to be targeted by many developers but the related Humira EU market is a battleground  with the US protected until 2023 after which competitors are queuing to pile in  Stelara might be a good  more protected market as not all Crohn s and psoriasis patients will use anti TNF products  which might protect volume and margins 
It is harder to assess FYB203  An Eylea biosimilar should sell very well but competitors seem  oddly  very limited to date given high sales and relatively close US patent expiry in mid 2023  The Momenta Pharmaceuticals and Mylan joint venture is the clear leader so far  We would expect further entrants over the next few years  The market will also be complicated by new  long acting antibody fragment products from Novartis and Roche at premium prices  However  while the new products may be more convenient  if approved  neither of them has shown clinical superiority over Lucentis and Eylea so the biosimilar market will be substantial and very valuable 
Investment case summary
Formycon has a robust financial position with high revenues  cash for investment and a strong product pipeline targeting major global markets  It can now develop its own proprietary pipeline  which should add further value 
Although there are always technical risks and delays in development  these are manageable and much lower than mainstream therapeutic development  The main uncertainties are on exact product launch dates  competition and the ability of partners to market effectively in large  complex global markets  Assuming these aspects are resolved  as we expect  Formycon should become a leading and very profitable biosimilar company ",2019-05-23,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/formycon-fy18-results-fyb201-launch-on-track-for-2021-200424177,200424177

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Biogen due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Biogen Beats on Q1 Earnings  Spinraza Drives SalesBiogen reported first quarter 2019 earnings per share of  6 98  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 84  Earnings rose 15  year over year  backed by higher revenues and a lower share count due to share buybacks in the quarter Sales came in at  3 49 billion  up 11  from the year ago quarter  Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 38 billion  Revenue growth was principally driven by higher sales of Spinraza and higher contribution from biosimilars Quarter in DetailProduct sales in the quarter were  2 68 billion  up 6  year over year  Royalties on sales of Ocrevus were  112 million in the quarter  up 46  year over year  Revenues from Biogen s share of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits increased almost 11  from the year ago period to  405 million  Other revenues rose 78  in the quarter to  292 million primarily due to the sale of approximately  200 million of inventory associated with the Bioverativ spinoff Biogen s multiple sclerosis  MS  revenues of  2 1 billion in the reporter quarter  including Ocrevus royalties  were flat year over year  However  excluding Ocrevus royalties  MS revenues declined 2  year over year In the first quarter  U S  MS product revenues were hurt by approximately  170 million due to a decrease in channel inventory In 2019  Biogen expects the growth rate in core MS revenues  excluding Ocrevus  to be similar to 2018  which means a decline year over year Tecfidera sales rose 1  year over year to  999 million  U S  sales in the quarter were  717 7 million  down 1 5  year over year while ex U S  sales were  281 1 million  up 9   Tecfidera U S  sales were hurt by lower volumes and higher discounts and allowances  Strong ex U S  performance in the quarter was driven by double digit volume increases in Europe and Japan  which offset the impact of ongoing price decreases in certain European countries Tecfidera sales declined 10  sequentially in the quarter due to lower U S  sales  Tecfidera U S  revenues were hurt by a decrease in channel inventory of approximately  110 million against an increase of  60 million in the previous quarter Tysabri sales were flat year over year and fell 1  sequentially to  460 million  Tysabri U S  sales declined 1 9  to  245 0 million in the quarter due to lower channel inventory levels  International revenues rose 1 4  to  215 4 million Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  in the quarter were  500 9 million  down 9  year over year  Avonex revenues declined 12  from the year ago quarter to  397 million  Plegridy contributed  104 million to revenues  up 4  year over year U S  Interferon revenues have been declining due to transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Sales of Spinraza increased 42  year over year to  518 0 million  Spinraza sales rose 10 3  sequentially as strong sales performance in ex U S  markets offset lower sales in the United States Spinraza U S  sales were  223 3 million in the quarter  down 5 5  sequentially hurt by seasonality  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza sales rose 26  sequentially to  295 2 million driven by new country launches and increased penetration across all major geographies The number of patients on Spinraza grew approximately 5  in the United States and 24  outside the United States in the quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 In the United States  the

128840,350355,BIIB,5 Low Price to Book Value Stocks For Great Returns ,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  are the first ratios to hit an investor s mind while finding undervalued stocks  However  price to book ratio  P B ratio   though underrated  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with great returns The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityNow let us understand the concept of book value What is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading

128868,350383,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"We expect Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   to beat estimates when it reports first quarter 2019 results on Apr 24  before market open  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 02  Biogen s shares have declined 24 8  this year so far against the  s increase of 2 9  in the same time frame   Biogen s earnings performance has been strong as it delivered a positive surprise in each of the last four trailing quarters  with the average being 6 49  Biogen Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
     Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcementFactors to ConsiderOn the fourth quarter conference call  Biogen had said that it expects core MS revenues  excluding royalties on Ocrevus  to be similar to 2018  which implies a year over year decline In the fourth quarter  MS revenues benefited from  115 million in inventory channel build  expected to reverse in the to be reported quarter  Therefore  a potential inventory draw down is expected to hurt revenues in the first quarter of 2019 Among the MS drugs  Tecfidera s U S  revenues were relatively stable in the second half of 2018 against declines seen in the first half  U S  Tecfidera revenues are expected to remain stable in the first quarter of 2019  Meanwhile  ex U S  Tecfidera revenues should continue to benefit from volumes increases in Europe and Japan  which may offset the impact of ongoing price decreases in certain European countries  U S  sales of another MS drug  Tysabri  are expected to be hurt by Ocrevus launch The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera in the first quarter is pegged at  1 08 billion while that for Tysabri  Global In Market sales  is  447 million Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  are expected to decline again due to the transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Biogen receives royalties on U S  sales of Roche s  RHHBY  newly launched MS drug  Ocrevus  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ocrevus royalties is  148 million for the first quarter of 2019 Biogen s new drug  Spinraza  approved for spinal muscular atrophy  saw strong sales performance in 2018  On the Q4 call  management guided that in 2019  global Spinraza revenues are expected to grow in the mid to high teens range with growth in both the U S  and ex U S  Global Spinraza revenues are expected to be flat sequentially in the first quarter due to seasonality with return to growth beyond first quarter  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza s uptake will be driven by continued patient growth in 2019 although at a more modest rate in more markets  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spinraza is  488 million in the first quarter Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis  the joint venture between Biogen and Samsung BioLogics  markets three anti TNF biosimilars in the EU   Flixabi  a biosimilar referencing Remicade   Benepali  a biosimilar referencing Enbrel  and Imraldi a biosimilar referencing AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira   Interestingly in 2018  biosimilars contributed significantly to Biogen s top line  Biogen expects biosimilars to record double digit revenue growth through 2019  primarily driven by the launch of Imraldi Key Q1 DevelopmentsLast month  Biogen entered into an agreement to acquire London based clinical stage gene therapy company  Nightstar Therapeutics for approximately  800 million  In January  Biogen announced two strategic collaborations to develop potential therapies for Alzheimer s disease  Parkinson s disease and other devastating neurological diseases  Investor questions are expected on the strategic benefits of the deals and plans to integrate them on the first quarter earnings call Also last month  Biogen and partner Eisai discontinued two phase III studies    ENGAGE and EMERGE    on aducanumab in early Alzheimer s disease  AD   The decision was taken following a futility analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee   IDMC    The analysis showed that the studies are unlikely to meet their primary endpoints  Investors are expected to question management on future plans for aducanumab on the investor call Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Biogen is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for a likely positive surprise Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference

Investors will also focus on further updates on the company s impending acquisition of Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG    The impending acquisition will result in a specialty biopharma company with a strong oncology portfolio and diverse pipeline in the therapeutic areas of inflammatory  immunologic and cardiovascular diseases  While the company s blockbuster drug  Opdivo  is performing well on the back of label expansions  it continues to face pricing pressure and stiff competition in the immuno oncology space  This in turn has led to limited additional market share gains  Bristol Myers recently announced that its shareholders have given a green signal to the acquisition  More than 75  of the shareholders voted in favor of the merger agreement at the Special Meeting of Stockholders  The transaction will close in the third quarter of 2019  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals  However  a few shareholders had earlier opposed the deal  expressing multiple concerns related to growth of the company following the acquisition Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol Myers will beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen Earnings ESP  The company s Earnings ESP is  2 61   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Bristol Myers has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  We caution against the stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

potential Several data readouts are expected in 2019 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s  However  its core MS business  excluding Ocrevus royalties  has been on a declining trend  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area as evident from the recent

128895,350410,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Biogen  BIIB  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  6 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 38 billion  up 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 29  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Biogen 
For Biogen  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Biogen will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Biogen would post earnings of  6 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  6 99  delivering a surprise of  4 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Biogen appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biogen-biib-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407804,200407804

Meanwhile  Celgene has been in the news lately due to a merger agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced earlier this year  Per the deal  Bristol Myers will acquire Celgene for a whopping  74 billion  Celgene s shareholders will receive  50 plus one share of Bristol Myers and one tradeable Contingent Value Right  CVR   which will entitle the holder to receive a cash payment of  9 00 upon the achievement of FDA approval of three products in its pipeline   ozanimod  liso cel and bb2121   within specified time periods

128948,350463,BIIB,S P Holds Onto 2800 Despite Sharp Selloff,opinion,"The market released a lot of pent up concerns and frustrations with Friday s sharp selloff  which ruined what could have been another solid week for the major indices 
	In the end though  this week s actual losses were not as brutal as today s session felt  The Dow was off by approximately 1 3   while the S P and NASDAQ each shed less than 1   The indices went into Friday s session with gains for the week so there was a good cushion for the pullback  while the S P still managed to stay above 2800 by a slim margin 
	Investors have been worried about a slowing global economy for a while now  and yet our market has still been moving higher  But soft manufacturing numbers out of Europe and the U S  were too much to handle today  especially coming after a sudden dovish turn from the Fed  Two days removed from the Committee s decision to not hike rates for the rest of 2019  already skittish investors are now wondering if the about face is indication that the slowdown is worse than expected 
	Adding to the cautious sentiment was the inverted yield curve between the 3 month Treasury bill and the 10 year note  Such a move is considered to be a signal of recession down the road  not immediately but several months from now  We ll see   
	That s a lot for the market to take in  It s no wonder that it didn t have the wherewithal to shrug it off on Friday in the wake of such a strong start to 2019 
	The NASDAQ was outperforming its counterparts all week as tech has been very strong  but today it took the biggest step back  The index slipped 2 5   or nearly 200 points  to 7642 67  The Dow dropped 1 77   or about 460 points  to 25 502 32 
	The S P had just as bad a day as the others  but this index was able to barely hang onto the important 2800 mark  It was down 1 9  to 2800 71 So is this the start of a broader pullback or a buying opportunity  The funny thing is that folks always talk about how healthy and necessary pullbacks are after long runups  yet when one actually comes along we turn it up to eleven and proclaim it as a harbinger of doom 
	It should take more than one sharp pullback to panic the bulls  Let s see what next week has in store before stampeding toward the exits Today s Portfolio Highlights   Healthcare Innovators  Shares of Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  lost over 30     and  20  billion of market cap    in 2 days after its Alzheimer s drug failed Phase 3 trials  Now  the mega biotech may be looking to buy other small life sciences companies to help refortify its central nervous system pipeline  and Kevin thinks that bodes well for a gene editing innovator like Sangamo Therapeutics  SGMO   The company s zinc finger nuclease technology platform holds potential for treatments in several types of unmet medical needs  including Hemophilia A  Sickle Cell  and 3 other genetic expressions  The editor likes the risk reward with this name at under a  1 billion market cap  so he added it to the portfolio on Friday with specific buy window guidelines  Read the complete commentary for a detailed analysis on SGMO  including what the analysts are all saying Technology Innovators  There s a buying opportunity in the healthcare tech space  Shares of Inovalon Holdings  INOV  dropped approximately 20  after the company missed quarterly earnings estimates  However  guidance for the rest of the year was not terrible  so Brian Bolan decided to buy the dip and add INOV to the portfolio on Friday  The editor also sees a good recipe for a squeeze in this name as 17  of the float is sold short  Read the complete commentary for more on this new buy Value Investor   We ve also had yield inversion  which has meant a recession within 6 to 18 months afterwards  Some will maybe argue  this time will be different  but in the modern era  that simply hasn t been the case 
	 I ve been saying all along that we shouldn t fear a recession  They are a normal part of the business cycle  I know most people are scared because they remember 2009 all too well   Don t we all  
	 But do you remember the 2000 2001 recession  Most don t because  outside of Silicon Valley  it simply wasn t that bad  It was a standard  garden variety slowdown  After ten years of outsized growth  a slowdown is to be expected 
	 Let s see what the stock market does next week  Just because it was spooked on Friday  doesn t mean it will be on Monday  There s a lot going on  but there s no need to panic right now      Tracey Ryniec
	Have a Great Weekend

Our Take
Biogen holds a strong position in the multiple sclerosis  MS  market  with a wide range of products like Avonex  Tysabri  Tecfidera and Plegridy  The Nightstar acquisition will somewhat diversify Biogen s MS portfolio  Ophthalmology is an emerging growth area  and a potential approval of Nightstar candidates will boost Biogen s portfolio 
However  shareholders weren t that impressed and were probably asking for a bigger splash 
This year started with a bang for the biotech industry with the announcement of one of the biggest mergers of the sector  the Bristol Myers and Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  collaboration  This was followed by a slew of other announcements  Biogen becomes the latest company to join the M A bandwagon  In particular  gene therapy is a hot area of pursuit for most biotechs  given the potential of the therapy  
Swiss pharma giant Roche Holdings   OTC RHHBY   recently announced that it will acquire gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics   NASDAQ ONCE   for  4 3 billion

Top Stock Reports for Visa  Honeywell and Biogen
 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Visa  Honeywell and Biogen  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see all of today s research reports here    
Visa s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year   22 3  vs   14 3    Visa s results were driven by growth in payments volume  cross border volume and processed transactions  and a lower tax rate  The Zacks analyst thinks numerous strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for long term growth and consistent increase in revenues 
Visa is well poised to gain from growing electronic payment processing and a solid brand name  Its strong capital position enables investments in business  Nevertheless  high client incentives and operating expenses  and foreign exchange volatility might put pressure on margins  Softness in cross border volumes is another concern 
Shares of Honeywell have underperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the past three months  gaining  10 3  vs  a  12 8  increase  Honeywell believes that strength in its commercial aftermarket and sensing businesses as well as solid demand for its productivity and commercial fire products will boost its revenues in the quarters ahead 
The Zacks analyst thinks stronger sales volumes  increased productivity and ongoing commercial effectiveness actions will likely boost near term profitability  Notably  the company anticipates generating organic sales growth in the range of 2 5  in 2019  Rising costs of revenues are a worry for the company s gross margin 
Also  analysts have become increasingly bearish on the company over the past couple of months  Increases in debt levels can increase its financial obligations 
Biogen s shares have underperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry year to date   3 5  vs   11 9    Biogen has a strong position in the MS market with a wide range of products  The Zacks analyst likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  among others  Meanwhile  its newest drug Spinraza is performing well and has multi billion dollar potential 
Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are encouraging with several having transformative potential  Multiple data readouts are expected in 2019 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s  However  its core MS business  excluding Ocrevus royalties  has been largely flat 
Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area

128996,350511,BIIB,U S  companies  stock buyback plans hit four year low  TrimTabs,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    The value of stock buyback announcements from U S  companies slowed to its lowest level in four years  TrimTabs Investment Research said on Tuesday  potentially undercutting one of the main drivers of the current bull market  At  1 8 billion a day  the amount of buyback announcements from U S  companies during the nearly completed second quarter earnings season is tracking to the lowest since the same period of 2012  according to TrimTabs  which compared six week periods during which companies report quarterly results  The number of companies announcing buybacks has also fallen  averaging 3 3 a day so far  the lowest since the third quarter of 2013 and well below the 6 1 per day during earnings season a year ago   Buyback activity has been disappointing in earnings season   said David Santschi  chief executive officer of TrimTabs   The reluctance to pull the trigger on share repurchases suggests corporate leaders are becoming less enthusiastic about what they see ahead   Stock buybacks prop up share prices as a decrease in the number of shares outstanding boosts earnings per share  and have been an important factor in propelling the market to record highs   While companies may have dialed back their buybacks  the extent of the slowdown remains to be seen  The strong current pace of corporate debt issuance could provide new fuel for ramping up stock repurchases  said Brian Reynolds  chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York   We have seen throughout this credit cycle  sometimes the buybacks grow faster and sometimes they grow slower   Reynolds said   Going forward  there is plenty of ammunition to boost share buybacks should CEOs feel the need   The latest buyback data shows the continued sluggish pace of repurchases this year  According to TrimTabs  the total amount of announced buybacks through July is down 21 percent from the same period a year ago   It s not a good sign  for the stock market  Santschi said   Buyback volume has a fairly high correlation with stock prices

128997,350512,BIIB,Big Pharma vs Big Pharma in court battles over biosimilar drugs,news,"By John Miller ZURICH  Reuters    The line dividing makers of brand name drugs and copycat medicines is blurring as companies known for innovative treatments queue up to peddle copies of rivals  complex biological medicines  These drugmakers are now increasingly straddling both sides of the courtroom  too  protecting their high price products from biosimilars   biopharmaceutical drugs with the treatment properties of medicines they seek to mimic   while simultaneously challenging rivals  patent claims  Biologics  manufactured in living cells  then extracted and purified  are more complex than traditional medicines and cannot be copied with precision  and so their knock off versions are called biosimilars instead of generics  The allure of biosimilars is clear  with insurers and other payers counting on the steep discounts  U S  pharmacy benefit managers are already trimming brand name drugs from their rosters   With Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez predicting biosimilar discounts of up to 75 percent  in part based on developments in Europe  makers of innovative drugs are fighting tooth and nail to protect their higher priced products for as long as possible    For instance  AbbVie has sued in Delaware claiming patent protection for its arthritis drug Humira  the world s best selling prescription medicine  until at least 2022 as it seeks to delay an Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  replica that won U S  approval last week   Meanwhile  Amgen has gone to another U S  federal court seeking to protect its own arthritis medicine  Enbrel  from a Novartis biosimilar until 2029  With lawsuits pitting Big Pharma against Big Pharma piling up  lawyers said the legal landscape has gotten a lot more complex   One of the biggest surprises has been the number of innovator biopharma companies  like Amgen  now developing biosimilars to compete with the products of other innovator companies   said Don Ware  an expert on biosimilars at U S  law firm Foley Hoag in Boston    This creates conflicts for law firms like ours  because suddenly the clients we advise are adverse to each other   Ware said   And it makes it hard for the companies to retain top outside counsel without having to give them conflict waivers   Sanofi  Merck  NYSE MRK   Eli Lilly   Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  are also embroiled in lawsuits over biosimilars  NOT BITTER ENEMIES Even so  some analysts say the lawsuits are business as usual and are unlikely to spill over into other areas  including research partnerships  Novartis and Amgen may be at each other s throats in court over the Swiss drugmaker s Enbrel copy  but the two are still cooperating on a drug for migraines   It s not like these companies are bitter enemies   Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said   These court cases are simply the last resort of original drug makers to wring a few more months or a year of exclusivity from their blockbusters   Conflicts pitting big drugmakers against each other may have been inevitable after Europe in 2006 and the United States in 2010 created separate biosimilar approval rules   After all  Big Pharma s financial clout and expertise made large  sophisticated drugmakers the natural candidates to manufacture complex biosimilar copies that cost hundreds of millions to bring to market  far more than for generic off patent copies of simpler  small molecule drugs  
Some smaller companies and generics makers have jettisoned biosimilar programs after originally underestimating hurdles to entry  Richard Francis  head of Novartis s Sandoz division that makes biosimilars  said earlier this year   Just this week  Shire abandoned two biosimilar candidate drugs that accompanied its Baxalta takeover  copies of Amgen s Enbrel and AbbVie s Humira  to focus on rare diseases   The realization of what it s going to take to stay in this market and be successful has led to a change in the landscape and the players in it   Francis said ",2016-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-pharma-vs-big-pharma-in-court-battles-over-biosimilar-drugs-429831,429831

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 90 74 or 0 49  to 18 313 77  closing lower for the seventh consecutive session  At session lows  the Dow fell as much as 153 points  Since hitting an all time record high of 18 622 01 on July 22  the Dow has fallen back by more than 300 points over the last week and a half  Nevertheless  the Dow is still up by more than 1 100 points from its lows five weeks ago in the immediate aftermath of the surprising Brexit decision on June 24

The top performer on the Dow was  Exxon Mobil  Corporation  NYSE XOM   which added 0 88 or 1 02  to 86 74 during Tuesday s relief rally  Shares in ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  are still down by more than 5  from their levels last week  before the world s largest oil companies reported their worst quarterly profits in 17 years  Exxon shares also rebounded in spite of continued declines in crude prices  which closed below  40 a barrel for the first time since April 
The worst performer was  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE   which fell 0 82 or 2 20  to 36 49  While the pharmaceutical giant reported better than expected results for its second quarter on Tuesday  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  suffered a hit due to a disappointing period among its patent protected medicines  Though sales of Pfizer s branded drugs rose by 7  to  7 11 billion for the three month period ending in late June  they still fell sharply below analysts  forecasts for the quarter 
The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB   which surged 28 46 or 9 43  to 330 29  Shares in Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  popped in Tuesday s session after a report surfaced that the Cambridge  Massachusetts based biotech firm could emerge as an acquisition target for a larger company such as Merck  NYSE MRK  or Allergan  NYSE AGN pa   The worst performer was  DISH Network  Corporation  NASDAQ DISH   which fell 4 10 or 7 67  to 49 38 after the satellite TV network announced plans to raise  2 billion in a convertible debt sale  It came following reports that the Federal Communication Commission s  FCC  AWS 3 auction on radio spectrum from local TV broadcasting networks could be delayed even further until the completion of the fourth quarter  Leading telecom companies such as AT T Inc  NYSE T    VZ Holding AG   SIX VZN  and T Mobile US Inc  NASDAQ TMUS   which are expected to be among the top bidders in the auction  have been prohibited by regulators from holding strategic discussions  The Dish Network  which has accumulated approximately 80 MHz of radio spectrum for mobile video services  has yet to attract a partner among the aforementioned telecom companies

International Trading
Despite the problems in Europe  the German DAX continues to rise and is nearing a potential break out should it rise above 11 535  It would likely send the index on to 11 891 

Reasons To Be Optimistic Longer Term
It seems hard to deny that no matter the troubles some of the economic indicators maybe flashing  stock markets continue to rise  The big question is whether it is part of a longer term dead cat bounce or if it is a sign an improving global outlook 
The critical industrial metals such as copper have seen a massive move higher in recent weeks  All of the significant steps higher in the stock markets of global export economies and metals such as Copper and Platinum  are at least pointing to a hint of optimism taking hold suggesting that perhaps the worst of the economic slowdown is behind us 

US Trading
The US equity market is pointing to a lower opening of about 1 point on the S P 500  It continues to be my view that equity prices are due for a minor pullback  I think at this point  it is pretty safe to say that I m obsessive over small details on daily movements of stock prices  However  it is just hard for me to ignore the glaring signs of a brief price decline that is in the works for stocks 
NASDAQ  QQQ 
The NASDAQ fell below the rising wedge yesterday  and that would suggest there are still declines on the way  perhaps by as much as 2 5  to 7 300  allowing the index to fill the gap  Again  nothing major  but hard to ignore the possibility 

S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY  
For now  a zone of support for the S P 500 comes between 2 750 and 2 760 

Nike  NYSE NKE 
Nike is pulling back some this morning after one if sneakers fell apart during the middle of an NCAA basketball  Support for the stock comes at roughly  81 50 

Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN 
Amazon has struggled in recent days and continues to hug the  1 620 level  I ve said it before  and I shall repeat it  I still think this one is heading lower with a target for  1 520 

Johnson and Johnson  JNJ 
Johnson and Johnson has been subpoenaed over its baby powder  The stock hit its resistance on at  136 75 and in the short term  it could drop back to around  131 

Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB 
Biogen was downgraded this morning to hold from buy at Stifel with a  346 price target  Overall there is a downtrend to this stock and drop to  310 seems to be the most likely path 

Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
Facebook continues to work its way lower trying to fill the gap  The first stop on the chart is  157  and then  148 

Twitter  TWTR 
Twitter is failing at resistance at  31 90  and that means it may be on its way to  30 20

129034,350549,BIIB,Gilead shares look cheap but investors fret over growth,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK  Reuters    Shares of  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD  are trading at ultra cheap levels as investors broadly shed biotech holdings and question what the company could do for an encore after several years of torrid growth 
While biotech and healthcare stocks have underperformed the broader market all year  Gilead stands out for its low forward price to earnings ratio  which is widely used by investors to value stocks 
The stock closed at  89 53 on Thursday  having lost more than one fourth of its value since hitting an all time high of  123 37 in June 
That put the share price at 7 3 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months  No other large U S  pharmaceutical or biotechnology company trades below a ratio of 10 9  according to Thomson Reuters data 
Gilead s valuation in recent weeks has been the lowest since it became a solidly profitable company more than a decade ago  Over the past 10 years  the stock has traded at a forward price to earnings ratio of 16 6 times  on average 
By other metrics  the stock does not look as appealing  Using a measure of a stock s value called a PEG ratio  which factors in Gilead s lackluster growth outlook and its price to earnings ratio  the shares look at least twice as expensive as the average big biotech stock  analysts  estimates show 
 People are just skeptical about the long term earnings power of the company   said John Fraunces  co manager for the Turner Investments medical sciences fund in Berwyn  Pennsylvania  which does not own Gilead shares 
VICTIM OF OWN SUCCESS
To an extent  Gilead is a victim of its own success  The company  the largest biotech by market value at  120 billion  built upon a leading HIV medicine franchise by adding hepatitis C treatments that revolutionized care for the serious liver disease 
That medical advance was reflected in its financial performance  From 2013 through last year  Gilead s sales tripled to nearly  33 billion  while earnings shot up more than six times to  12 61 per share 
But investors are concerned that Gilead s hepatitis C franchise sales may have peaked 
Earnings per share are expected to fall 3 percent this year with no growth expected through 2019  while sales are expected to recede to about  29 billion over the next four years  according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters 
Gilead shares have declined 11 percent in 2016  though that is less than the 19 percent drops for big biotech peers Biogen Inc  O BIIB  and  Celgene Corp   O CELG   while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index  NBI  has fallen 27 percent 
Investors said the company s future could rest in part on what it does with its balance sheet  Gilead amassed  26 2 billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities by the end of 2015 
The company s dividend yield sits at 1 9 percent  below the roughly 2 3 percent average for companies in the S P 500 Health Care index  SPXHC   while it bought back  10 billion worth of its stock last year 
A major acquisition of promising companies or new medicines could help propel sales and earnings  but investors are worried about the price of buying such growth  They had also fretted over the  11 billion Gilead paid in 2011 for Pharmasset  but that deal ended up being the foundation for its hepatitis C franchise success 
 What investors are worried about is   Does management go out and overpay for an acquisition    said John Toohey  head of equities at USAA Investments in San Antonio  which owns Gilead shares 
The stock is  exceptionally cheap   Toohey said   The  valuation  gap is so big between Gilead and other stocks  we re willing to be patient  ",2016-03-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/gilead-shares-look-cheap-but-investors-fret-over-growth-390731,390731

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcementFactors to ConsiderThe performance of Biogen s multiple sclerosis  MS  drugs has been stable lately  Tecfidera U S  revenues improved in the third quarter  Meanwhile  ex U S  sales were strong driven by patient growth across European markets  solid emerging market growth and particularly strong performance in Japan  which offset the impact of ongoing price decreases in certain European countries U S  sales of another MS drug  Tysabri have been hurt by Roche s   OTC RHHBY   newly launched MS drug  Ocrevus  Meanwhile  patient growth in all major European markets and solid emerging market growth is pushing up Tysabri s sales in ex U S  markets In the fourth quarter  Biogen expects worldwide MS product revenues to be stable from the year ago period  benefiting from a moderate inventory channel build and less significant impact of Ocrevus on a year over year basis The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Tecfidera in the fourth quarter is pegged at  1 10 billion while that for Tysabri  Global In Market sales  is  452 million The combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy is expected to decline due to a shift to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance Biogen s new drug  Spinraza  approved for spinal muscular atrophy  performed well in the past two quarters  On the Q3 call  management was optimistic that Spinraza patient starts will grow in the United States in future quarters as it continues to capture the adult segment  which represents approximately 60  of all SMA patients  It had until then penetrated only 15  of the adult segment  Thus  this segment represents presents strong growth opportunity  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza s uptake in the fourth quarter is expected to be driven by continued patient growth  although at a more modest rate in mature markets Biosimilars sales in the third quarter rose both year over year and sequentially  Biogen markets two biosimilar products   Flixabi  a biosimilar referencing Remicade  and Benepali  a biosimilar referencing Enbrel   In the fourth quarter  Biogen expects relatively stable biosimilars revenues compared to the third quarter  Importantly  in October  Biogen launched Imraldi  its biosimilar version of AbbVie s blockbuster drug  Humira in several European markets  This should bring in additional sales in Q4 Revenues from Biogen s anti CD20 therapeutic programs  which include Biogen s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits  contributed significantly to the top line in the past two quarters primarily driven by Ocrevus royalties  We expect the positive trend to continue Overall  on the Q3 call  management had said that the fourth quarter of 2018 will face difficult comparisons from the prior year quarter as the latter had benefited from favorable timing of contract manufacturing Both R D and SG A expenses are expected to sequentially increase in the fourth quarter due to the timing of clinical trial expense and market expansion investments as well as seasonality Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  Its Earnings ESP is  0 17  as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at  6 71 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at  6 72  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Biogen s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   has an Earnings ESP of  0 25  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to release results on Jan 29  You can see  Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   has an Earnings ESP of  2 31  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release results on Jan 31 Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year Who wouldn t  Our annual Top 10s have beaten the market with amazing regularity  In 2018  while the market dropped  5 2   the portfolio scored well into double digits overall with individual stocks rising as high as  61 5   And from 2012 2017  while the market boomed  126 3  Zacks  Top 10s reached an even more sensational  181 9  ",2019-01-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biogen-biib-q4-earnings-coming-up-whats-in-the-cards-200377532,200377532

SchwabThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Pfizer  Biogen and Schwab  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Pfizer s shares have outperformed its peer group in the past one year   the stock is up  14 8  over this period vs  a  0 5  decline for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry   Pfizer is facing top line headwinds like genericization of key drugs  supply challenges in the legacy Hospira portfolio  pricing pressure and rising competition  However  the Zacks analyst thinks products like Ibrance  cost cutting efforts  a lower tax rate and share buybacks can support bottom line growth  Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and looks well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years  which can drive long term growth  Bavencio  though approved for two small indications currently  is being considered a key long term growth driver for Pfizer if it can gain label expansion approvals  Pfizer gained FDA approval for four new cancer drugs in 2018  which can boost oncology sales  Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q4 earnings release  Pfizer has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters Shares of Biogen have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past one year   1 8  vs   19 8    Biogen has a strong position in the MS market with a wide range of products  The Zacks analyst likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  Spinraza is performing strongly and has multi billion dollar potential  Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are encouraging since several of them have transformative potential  Multiple data readouts are expected in 2019  However  the launch of Ocrevus by Roche is having a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the United States  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area  However  estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q4 earnings results  The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters Schwab s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past three months  gaining  0 1  vs  6 2   The Zacks analyst emphasizes that the company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  Its fourth quarter 2018 results were driven by a rise in interest income and trading revenues  The company remains well positioned to gain from the rising rate environment and its initiatives to strengthen trading income  Further  its steady capital deployment actions reflect a strong balance sheet position  However  continuously rising operating expenses remain a major concern and hurt bottom line growth to some extent  Also  the company s significant dependence on fee based revenue streams is cause for apprehension Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sysco and Philips Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment

129053,350568,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Up Y Y,opinion,"Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   reported fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of  6 99  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 72  Earnings rose 32 9  year over year  backed by higher revenues 
Sales came in at  3 53 billion  up 7  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 39 billion 
Revenue growth was principally driven by higher sales of Spinraza  and higher contributions from biosimilars and Ocrevus royalties  Tecfidera sales also increased during the quarter 
Biogen s shares have decreased 8 9  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 24 6  

 
Quarter in Detail
Biogen s multiple sclerosis  MS  revenues were  2 30 billion in the reporter quarter  including approximately  152 million in royalties on the sales of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   MS drug  Ocrevus  MS revenues grew 2  year over year 
In the United States  MS sales are dented by the launch of Ocrevus  Though Ocrevus poses strong competition to Biogen s MS drugs  the company receives royalties on U S  sales of Ocrevus from Roche 
Tecfidera sales rose 3  year over year and 2  sequentially to  1 10 billion  This included U S  sales of  856 30 million  up 3  year over year  and ex U S  sales of  254 10 million  up 4 1   
Tysabri sales were flat year over year at  464 million  Tysabri U S  sales rose 1 9  to  256 80 million in the quarter  International revenues declined 1 4  to  207 60 million  Tysabri sales fell 1 2  sequentially 
Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  in the fourth quarter were  597 2 million  down 7 4  year over year and 1 2  sequentially  Avonex revenues declined 8  from the year ago quarter to  481 million  Plegridy contributed  116 million to revenues  which decreased 7  year over year 
U S  Interferon revenues have been declining due to transition of patients to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance 
Zinbryta generated no revenues in the quarter as the drug was withdrawn from the market in March 2018  due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption  The drug had contributed  11 7 million to total revenues in the year ago quarter 
Spinraza  spinal muscular atrophy  sales grew 30  year over year to  469 9 million  driven by sales growth in both the United States and the ex U S  markets  However  sales fell 0 5  sequentially 
Spinraza U S  sales were  236 2 million in the fourth quarter  up 5 5  sequentially  driven by increased new patient demand  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza sales fell 4 1  sequentially to  233 7 million  due to lower volumes in some markets stemming from loading dose dynamics  unfavorable shipment timing in certain distributor markets and pricing dynamics in certain markets 
The number of patients on Spinraza grew approximately 9  in the United States and 18  outside the United States in the quarter compared with the end of the third quarter of 2018 
In the fourth quarter of 2018  Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of  156 million  up 28  year over year and 13 3  sequentially  Biogen markets three anti TNF biosimilars in the EU   Flixabi  a biosimilar referencing J J   NYSE JNJ   Merck s Remicade   Benepali  a biosimilar referencing Amgen Pfizer s Enbrel  and Imraldi a biosimilar referencing AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira  
Revenues from Anti CD20 therapeutic programs  which include Biogen s share of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits and Ocrevus royalties  increased almost 29  from the year ago period to  535 million 
Research and development  R D  expenses increased 2  year over year to  602 million  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses were up 7  year over year to  591 million 
FY18 Results
The companyreported 2018 earnings per share of  26 20  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  25 84  Earnings rose 20 1  year over year  backed by higher revenues 
For full year  revenues came in at  13 45 billion  which increased 9 6  year over year and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 31 billion 
2019 Guidance
Biogen provided its outlook for 2019  The company expects revenues of   13 6  13 8 billion  Earnings per share are expected between  28 00 and  29 00 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is  13 65 billion and  28 20 per share  respectively 
Our Take
Biogen beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  fueled mainly by strong performance of its newest drug  Spinraza  which we believe has a multi billion dollar potential  Biogen s efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  among others and regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are impressive 
Several of these assets have transformative potential  However  the launch of Ocrevus by Roche is having a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the United States  which is a concern 
Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

129085,350600,BIIB,Biogen Inks Two Deals To Make Drugs For Neurological Diseases,opinion,"Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   announced two strategic collaborations to develop potential therapies for Alzheimer s disease  Parkinson s disease and other devastating neurological diseases 
The first collaboration was with private biotech C4 Therapeutics  C4T   per which the latter s novel protein degradation platform would be leveraged to discover and develop potential novel targets for treating neurological conditions  such as Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease  Under this deal  while Biogen and C4T have agreed to discover the potential targets together  Biogen will be responsible for advancing the candidates for future development and potential commercialization  For the deal  Biogen will be entitled to pay C4T up to a total of  415 million in upfront and potential future milestone payments plus potential future royalties 
The second deal is with Waltham based Skyhawk Therapeutics  under which Biogen will use Skyhawk s SkySTAR technology platform to develop potential targets using selective RNA modulating small molecules that can treat multiple sclerosis  spinal muscular atrophy and other neurological diseases  For its research services and the exclusive license to the SkySTAR s platform  Biogen made an upfront payment of  74 million to Skyhawk while the latter will also be entitled to potential future milestones and royalties  Biogen has also reserved the option to license any therapies resulting from this collaboration and will take care of its future development and commercialization 
The collaborations are in line with Biogen s strategic priority to build potential therapies for neurological conditions  In 2017  Biogen added seven new clinical stage programs to its neuroscience pipeline through advancing internal pipeline candidates and external deals  In 2018  Biogen signed five business development pacts with several having transformative potential 
Shares of Biogen were up almost 4  on Friday after it announced the two deals  The stock has dipped 3 5  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 18 9  
 

 
Several companies have lately invested in collaborations with smaller biotechs to discover potential treatments for AD and other neurological diseases 
Last month  Lilly   NYSE LLY   signed a collaboration agreement with Swiss biotech AC Immune SA   NASDAQ ACIU   to jointly develop tau aggregation inhibitors  which have potential to treat AD and other neurodegenerative diseases 
In October  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   announced the creation of a new biotech called Cerevel Therapeutics in partnership with private equity firm Bain Capital  LP  which will focus on developing drugs to treat central nervous system  CNS  disorders including Parkinson s and Alzheimer s disease 
Alzheimer s  a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory  has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments  both funds and resources  to that end  Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease 
Despite several setbacks  the companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer s disease treatments  given the high commercial potential in this market  Success in this area means huge returns  This is because more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050  Data  Alzheimer s Association   The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales

129086,350601,BIIB,Will Biogen  BIIB  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Biogen  BIIB   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This biotechnology company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9 97  
For the most recent quarter  Biogen was expected to post earnings of  6 80 per share  but it reported  7 40 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 82   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  5 22 per share  while it actually produced  5 80 per share  a surprise of 11 11  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Biogen lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Biogen currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 20   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-biogen-biib-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200376751,200376751

year in the positive territory  with biotech as one of the best performing industries  A slew of strong earnings  a higher number of FDA approvals and continuous influx of foreign funds into biotech companies in America bolstered the industry s performance Such trends are expected to continue  In fact  an even higher number of biotech firms are expected to go public in 2019  Under such broadly encouraging conditions  investing in mutual funds having significant exposure to biotech companies seems prudent Biotech Indexes and ETFs on a TearBiotech ETFs and indexes have had a bullish run in

prospects across the health care sector remain promising  Per the latest report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   the health care sector witnessed a surge in jobs by as much as 50 000 last month  Ambulatory health care services and hospitals added the greatest number of jobs across the industry Foreign Investment Breathe Life in U S  BiotechSilicon Valley and Cambridge  MA have primarily been the front runners in providing the largest growth of innovation in the biotechnology sector in the United States  This also reflects on the fact that the majority of foreign as well as domestic investors in the space target these areas  This has not only resulted in innovation but has also created newer jobs in the field and generated handsome dividends for investors Although North American investors account for about 99  of the funding in Silicon Valley and Cambridge  foreign funds  particularly from China  have risen steadily  Furthermore  a surge in the size of biopharma deals and investment rounds has not only resulted in successful IPOs but also M A exits  This trend is largely expected to continue through 2019 Venture Investment and IPOs to Propel Biotech in 2019There were about 76 health care IPOs in 2018  Coming to the average returns  health care IPOs posted an average return of 8 9  on total proceeds worth  9 1 billion  Meanwhile  Series A investments

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Pfizer  PFE   Biogen  BIIB  and Schwab  SCHW   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Pfizer s shares have outperformed its peer group in the past one year   the stock is up  14 8  over this period vs  a  0 5  decline for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry   Pfizer is facing top line headwinds like genericization of key drugs  supply challenges in the legacy Hospira portfolio  pricing pressure and rising competition  
However  the Zacks analyst thinks products like Ibrance  cost cutting efforts  a lower tax rate and share buybacks can support bottom line growth  Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and looks well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years  which can drive long term growth  Bavencio  though approved for two small indications currently  is being considered a key long term growth driver for Pfizer if it can gain label expansion approvals  
Pfizer gained FDA approval for four new cancer drugs in 2018  which can boost oncology sales  Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q4 earnings release  Pfizer has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters 
 You can   
Shares of Biogen have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past one year   1 8  vs   19 8    Biogen has a strong position in the MS market with a wide range of products  
The Zacks analyst likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  Spinraza is performing strongly and has multi billion dollar potential  Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are encouraging since several of them have transformative potential  Multiple data readouts are expected in 2019  
However  the launch of Ocrevus by Roche is having a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the United States  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  
Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area  However  estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q4 earnings results  The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters 
 You can   
Schwab s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past three months  gaining  0 1  vs  6 2   The Zacks analyst emphasizes that the company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  Its fourth quarter 2018 results were driven by a rise in interest income and trading revenues  
The company remains well positioned to gain from the rising rate environment and its initiatives to strengthen trading income  Further  its steady capital deployment actions reflect a strong balance sheet position  However  continuously rising operating expenses remain a major concern and hurt bottom line growth to some extent  Also  the company s significant dependence on fee based revenue streams is cause for apprehension

129107,350622,BIIB,Roche s SMA Candidate Risdiplam Gets PRIME Designation In EU,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced that the European Medicines Agency  EMA  has granted PRIME  PRIority MEdicines  designation to the company s investigational oral medicine risdiplam  RG7916  for the treatment of people with spinal muscular atrophy  SMA   The EMA grants PRIME status to drugs that have a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments  or benefit patients without treatment options 
We note that Roche is developing risdiplam  an oral SMN2 splicing modifier  as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics   NASDAQ PTCT   
The designation is primarily based on results from Part 1 of the pivotal studies FIREFISH and SUNFISH  in children and adults with Type II and III SMA  
FIREFISH is an open label  two part pivotal clinical trial in infants with Type I SMA  Part 1 was a dose escalation study in 21 infants  while Part 2 is a pivotal  single arm study on risdiplam in approximately 40 infants with Type I SMA for 24 months  followed by an open label extension 
The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety profile of risdiplam in infants and determine the dose for Part 2  The preliminary data from Part 1 of the FIREFISH study showed that infants with Type I SMA are meeting developmental milestones  including sitting without support 
Six out of 14 infants  43   were able to sit  with or without support   including three  21   who achieved unassisted stable sitting after eight months of treatment  Additionally  four infants  29   demonstrated rolling to the side along with seven  50   kicking and six  43   achieving upright head control 
SUNFISH is a two part  double blind  placebo controlled pivotal clinical trial in children and young adults  two to 25 years old  with Type II and III SMA  Part 1 determined the dose for the confirmatory Part 2  Roche completed enrollment in Part 2 in September 2018 
The preliminary data from Part 1 of the SUNFISH study showed improvements in motor function in patients with Type II III SMA  The follow up studies are ongoing for the confirmatory Part 2 portions of both the studies 
Roche is also conducting a third study  JEWELFISH  which is an open label exploratory trial in people aged 12 60 years with Type II or III SMA who have been previously treated with SMN targeting therapy as part of a clinical study 
The company also plans to initiate a new trial  RAINBOWFISH in pre symptomatic SMA  by early 2019 
Notably  Biogen s   NASDAQ BIIB   Spinraza is already approved to treat children and adults with SMA  which reflects the prevailing competition in the market 
Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market  In particular  the company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs  which include Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla 
The company is making efforts to develop its portfolio beyond oncology  into immunology and neuroscience  Approval of new drugs and diagnostics tests  and label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche  given its current challenges 
Year to date  shares of Roche have increased 1 6   compared with the  s growth of 8 4   Roche s legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars  Novartis   NYSE NVS   has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan  MabThera in Europe  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  too has got its biosimilar of Avastin

129111,350626,BIIB,AbbVie  ABBV  Seeks Approval For RA Candidate Upadacitinib,opinion,"AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   announced that it has filed a new drug application   NDA   to the FDA and a marketing authorization application   MAA   to the European Medicines Agency   EMA   for its oral investigational JAK inhibitor  upadacitinib  The company is seeking approval of upadacitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis   RA   
The regulatory submissions were based on encouraging data from the phase III SELECT study  which evaluated more than 4000 patients across five phase III studies on RA  In all the studies  upadacitinib met all primary and secondary endpoints 
Data from the SELECT study showed that treatment with upadacitinib  both as a monotherapy and in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs  led to improved symptoms of RA  better physical function and inhibited radiographic progression 
Shares of AbbVie were up 2 2   following the announcement of the news of Thursday  However  the stock has plunged 11 7  year to date  against the  increase of 1 6  

Approval and successful commercialization of upadacitinib are critical for long term growth at AbbVie  especially as biosimilar competition looms for its blockbuster RA drug  Humira 
Humira accounts for around 65  of AbbVie s revenues  The drug generated sales of  15 billion in the first nine months of 2018  an increase of 10 9  year over year  However  biosimilar competition for the drug could hurt sales for the company 
Though biosimilar versions of Humira are already approved by the FDA  per settlements with several companies biosimilar entry in the United States is scheduled for 2023  However  in the EU  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Biogen   NASDAQ BIIB   and Sandoz s biosimilars were launched in October this year  while others like Momenta  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   and Fresenius Kabi will launch their versions as soon as they get EMA s approval 
Notably  other than rheumatoid arthritis  upadacitinib is also being evaluated in a mid stage study for giant cell arteritis  and late stage studies for Crohn s disease  psoriatic arthritis  ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis

129132,350647,BIIB,Why Is Biogen  BIIB  Up 4 5  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Biogen  BIIB   Shares have added about 4 5  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Biogen due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Biogen Tops Earnings   Sales in Q3Biogen reported third quarter 2018 earnings per share of  7 40  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 80  Earnings rose 17  year over year backed by higher revenues and a lower tax rate and share count Sales came in at  3 44 billion  up 12  from the year ago period  Moreover  sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 33 billion  Revenue growth was principally driven by higher sales of Spinraza and higher contribution from biosimilars and Ocrevus royalties  Higher other revenues benefiting from greater contract manufacturing revenues also pulled up total revenues in the quarter  Meanwhile  the MS franchise was stable from second quarter levels Quarter in DetailBiogen s multiple sclerosis  MS  revenues were  2 31 billion in the reporter quarter including approximately  137 million in royalties on the sales of Roche s MS drug  Ocrevus  MS revenues were flat year over year as well as sequentially The number of patients on Biogen s MS products globally was flat year over year In the fourth quarter  Biogen expects worldwide MS product revenues to be stable from the year ago period  benefitting from a moderate inventory channel build and as Ocrevus impact will become less significant on a year over year basis Tecfidera s sales rose 2  year over year to  1 09 billion  This included U S  sales of  842 1 million  up 0 7  year over year  and ex U S  sales of  247 9 million  up 6 3    However  Tecfidera sales were flat sequentially Tecfidera U S  revenues were relatively stable in the third quarter compared against the declines seen in the first and the second quarters  Meanwhile  the strong ex U S  performance was driven by patient growth across European markets  solid emerging market growth and particularly strong performance in Japan  which offset the impact of ongoing price decreases in certain European countries Tysabri s sales were flat year over year at  470 million  Tysabri U S  sales declined 5 2  to  253 0 million in the quarter hurt by Ocrevus launch  International revenues rose 7 2  to  217 2 million driven by patient growth in all major European markets  except Germany and strong double digit patient growth in emerging markets  Tysabri s sales rose 1  sequentially Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  in the third quarter were  590 million  down 11  year over year and 6  sequentially  Avonex revenues declined 10  from the year ago period to  482 million  Plegridy contributed  108 million to revenues  which decreased 13  year over year U S  Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies Zinbryta generated no revenues in the quarter as the drug was withdrawn from the market in March 2018 due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption  The drug had contributed  14 million to total revenues in the year ago quarter Spinraza  spinal muscular atrophy  sales grew 73  year over year and 11  sequentially to  468 million driven by sales growth in both the United States and in the ex U S  markets Spinraza U S  sales were  223 9 million in the third quarter  up 8 7  sequentially driven by increased new patient demand among adults  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza sales rose 12 5  sequentially to  243 8 million driven by strong patient uptake  expansion into new regions and accelerated pace of reimbursement across multiple geographies Overall commercial patients on Spinraza rose approximately 20  in the quarter  The number of patients on Spinraza grew approximately 11  in the United States and 29  outside the United States in the quarter compared with the end of the second quarter In the United States  the number of adult patients on Spinraza rose more than 20  in the quarter compared to last quarter  with the company capturing the under penetrated adult segment  In the third quarter  more than 50  of the new patient starts in the United States comprised adults Management is optimistic that patient starts will grow in the United States as it continues to capture the adult segment  which represents approximately 60  of all SMA patients  It has till now penetrated only 15  of the adult segment and thus this segment represents a potential growth opportunity  In ex U S  markets  Spinraza s uptake will continue to be driven by continued patient growth  although at a more modest rate in more mature markets Biogen said that approximately 60  of U S  sales in the third quarter were from patients who received less intensive maintenance doses  dosing only once 4 months  versus 55  in the previous quarter In the third quarter of 2018  Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of  135 million  up 33  year over year and 6  sequentially In the fourth quarter  Biogen expects relatively stable biosimilars revenue compared to the third quarter Revenues from Anti CD20 therapeutic programs  which include Biogen s share of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits and Ocrevus royalties  increased almost 26  from the year ago period to  511 7 million Research and development  R D  spend increased 14  year over year to  508 million  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  spend was up 14  year over year to  495 million  However  both SG A and R D costs declined sequentially in the third quarter In the quarter  the board of directors authorized a share buyback program of up to  3 5 billion  The company also said that it is evaluating opportunities for potential business development and M A activity Pipeline SetbacksOn the third quarter conference call  management announced a few pipeline setbacks Regarding the company s gene therapy program for SMA  which is on clinical hold  Biogen said the FDA had raised questions on the company s preclinical data package and that it is assessing options to determine if there is a viable path forward for the gene therapy program in SMA Biogen also said that a phase IIb study evaluating vixotrigine  Nav1 7 inhibitor  in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints  Accordingly  the company has discontinued development of the candidate in this challenging indication  The company has delayed the start of a phase III study on the candidate in trigeminal neuralgia as interactions are ongoing with the FDA regarding the design of the phase III study Fourth Quarter OutlookThe fourth quarter of 2018 will face difficult comparisons from the prior year quarter as the latter benefited from favorable timing of contract manufacturing Both R D and SG A expenses are expected to sequentially increase in the fourth quarter due to the timing of clinical trial expense and market expansion investments as well as seasonality

129164,350679,BIIB,InterMune drug may offer big upside to Roche if aimed at liver,news,"By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot
 Reuters    Roche Holding AG s planned  8 billion purchase of InterMune Inc is centered around hopes for blockbuster sales of its lung drug  but the smaller company s development pipeline may end up giving the Swiss drugmaker a far bigger bang for its buck 
Industry analysts have forecast annual sales of about  2 billion for the pulmonary fibrosis treatment  pirfenidone  once it gains U S  approval  giving Roche a valuable addition to its respiratory franchise 
But the company is expected next year to begin clinical trials of ten fold more potent next generation drugs that could also treat similar damage to the liver and kidneys as well as lungs 
Success there could be a game changer  given the unmet medical need to treat liver and kidney scarring that can be caused by factors such as obesity  diabetes and alcohol and drug abuse 
 Liver fibrosis is a huge  multibillion dollar market that s far bigger than the lung fibrosis market   said Katherine Xu  an analyst with William Blair   Co   It involves millions of patients in the United States  versus 100 000  
Pirfenidone  a pill with annual sales of about  150 million in Europe and Canada  treats a progressive scarring condition of the lungs called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that typically kills patients within a few years 
Roche announced its proposed  8 3 billion cash purchase of InterMune on Sunday 
The two companies have barely mentioned the liver potential of the newer formulations as they focus on unlocking the value of pirfenidone by winning U S  approval of the drug for lung fibrosis  The Food and Drug Administration awarded the medicine its  breakthrough  designation   a signal the agency sees it as a potentially important new therapy 
The FDA approval is expected this year following large trials that showed it prolonged patient lives  A rival drug from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim is also expected to gain U S  approval this year 
While the focus has been on the potential of pirfenidone to treat lung damage  Dr Talmadge King  chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California  San Francisco  said fibrosis is believed to occur in a similar way throughout the body  including the heart 
 If you can get the drug to the site and slow or prevent the process from occurring     it has the potential to have a positive effect in a number of organ systems  so I would assume that that s where it s going to head in time   said King  a lung specialist who led the large late stage trial of pirfenidone upon which InterMune based its U S  marketing application 
InterMune s research chief  Scott Seiwert  said animal studies suggest that the newer formulations of pirfenidone have  a much milder side effect profile  
InterMune has said trials of its potent next generation pirfenidone analogues could involve patients with lung  liver or kidney fibrosis  Seiwert declined to predict what the Roche strategy will be 
Many analysts have yet to delve into the InterMune pipeline s potential of treating liver and kidney fibrosis 
 It s not something we ve included in our valuation  of InterMune  said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen  given the many failures of other drugs that have attempted to treat liver fibrosis  and InterMune s focus on preparing for the U S  launch of pirfenidone 
She noted that huge sales of new drugs for hepatitis C  especially Gilead Sciences Inc s Sovaldi   have drawn a lot more attention to liver related diseases  

Gilead and Biogen Idec Inc are developing injectable drugs against pulmonary fibrosis  with Gilead also testing its drug against liver fibrosis  But they are a few years away from seeking approval  and Andersen predicted InterMune will be the entrenched leader

129166,350681,BIIB,Earnings Speculators Bet On Big Moves For Biogen Stock,opinion,"Shares of Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  are hovering around breakeven today at  318 97  as traders gear up for the company s third quarter earnings report  The pharma name is scheduled to report before the market opens this Tuesday  Oct  23  and speculative traders are banking on a much bigger than usual post event price swing for BIIB stock 
On the charts  BIIB has had a volatile run in 2018  The stock fell as low as  249 17 on April 24  but bounced back to hit a three year peak of  388 67 as soon as July 25  As a result  a 50  Fibonacci retracement of the aforementioned annual low and multi year high rests at  318 92    just pennies below the stock s current trading levels  and in line with BIIB s year to date breakeven mark of  318 57 

Digging into its earnings history  BIIB closed higher the day after reporting in six of the last eight quarters  including the last three in a row  Looking broader  the shares have averaged a 2 6  move the day after earnings over the last two years  regardless of direction  This time around  BIIB options traders are expecting nearly four times that average move  with a 10 6  swing priced in for Tuesday s trading 
Data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  shows BIIB with a 10 day put call volume ratio of 1 43  which ranks in the 96th percentile of its annual range  This suggests that puts have been purchased over calls at a near annual high pace during the past two weeks  with traders showing a distinct preference for bearish bets on BIIB ahead of earnings 
Conversely  analyst sentiment has been extremely optimistic toward the drug stock  This is per the overwhelming 18 of 24 brokerage firms that sport a  buy  or better rating  Plus  BIIB s average 12 month price target of  390 88 stands at a 22 5  upside to current levels 
Given the technical significance of the  318  319 neighborhood where the stock is currently trading  traders will certainly be watching this area closely in the aftermath of BIIB s quarterly results  And with sentiment polarized ahead of earnings  the stage could be set for an extreme move in one direction or the other in the wake of the report ",2018-10-23,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-speculators-bet-on-big-moves-for-biogen-stock-200349841,200349841

129168,350683,BIIB,Probiodrug  Support For Abeta Theory From Biogen Eisai ,opinion,"We believe one of the main reasons for the devaluation of Probiodrug AG  AS PDB  shares over the past year was the largely disappointing industry newsflow frustrating research on Abeta theory  even though Probiodrug s technology is differentiated from all other Abeta therapies studied in late stage trials  The recent surprise announcement of disease modifying effect obtained by Biogen Eisai with their MAb BAN2401 in a Phase II trial may reignite interest in the amyloid theory and in the Alzheimer s disease  AD  field in general  While funding and lack of visibility on a partnering deal are near term risks  we find Probiodrug s asset PQ912  a small molecule glutaminyl cyclase  QC  inhibitor  and its Phase IIa data interesting  In our view  any progress with raising new funds or finding a partnering would unlock substantial upside from the current low valuation level

   Ireland s Elan also beats expectations
   Elan gives J J option to buy Biogen MS drug stake
   US biotechs Gilead  Genzyme  Celgene also report this week
   Actelion shares up 1 2 percent  Elan up 0 1 percent

  Adds more comment  updates shares 
 By Sam Cage and Padraic Halpin
 ZURICH DUBLIN  July 21  Reuters    European drugmakers
Actelion and Elan both beat profit forecasts on Tuesday  as
sales of key medicines helped shield them from the recession 
 The strong results from Actelion  Europe s largest biotech
company  and Irish drugmaker Elan set the stage for results from
U S  biotechs Gilead  Genzyme and Celgene 
 Actelion raised its full year outlook after its
second quarter profit beat expectations  helped by strong sales
of key drug Tracleer    results which Vontobel analyst Andrew
Weiss described as  stellar  
 Elan  also beat expectations  aided by a jump in sales of
multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  even though it posted a wider
net loss 
 The Irish company  which this month sold an 18 4 percent
stake to U S  healthcare group Johnson   Johnson  also confirmed
it has given J J an option to acquire Biogen Idec Inc s 50
percent stake in the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  should
there be a change of control at Biogen 
  Actelion is trying to cut its dependence on Tracleer for
  pulmonary arterial hypertension  which rakes in more than  1
billion a year  by developing it for new indications and pushing
other new drugs to market 
 However  it reported some delays in its promising portfolio
of new medicines    a key driver for biotech groups    including
sleep drug almorexant  which is being developed with Britain s
GlaxoSmithKline 
 Actelion Chief Executive Jean Paul Clozel said the group was
in talks with U S  regulators over labelling for almorexant  a
potential billion dollar seller  which would mean a delay of
eight to nine months 
 Actelion shares were up 1 2 percent to 58 2 Swiss francs by
1347 GMT  versus a 1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European
health care index  Elan shares  which jumped 9 percent on Monday
following media reports that it may invest in a biologics
operation in Ireland  were up 0 1 percent to 5 685 euros 
  Despite the strong financial results  we are disappointed
to learn that the pipeline has experienced several delays   said
Olav Zilian  an analyst at brokerage Helvea 
 
 MS BOOST FOR ELAN
 Elan s results were driven by a 30 percent jump in sales of
its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  which the company said
about 43 300 patients worldwide were taking by the end of June 
 Elan and partner Biogen Idec originally predicted 100 000
patients would be taking Tysabri by the end of 2010  While they
still expect to reach that figure  which would mean the drug
could bring in  2 billion to  3 billion a year  they do not
expect to reach it within that timeframe 
 Jack Gorman  an analyst at Davy Stockbrokers  said that
giving away the right on the potential blockbuster drug Tysabri 
may actually be a good move for Elan 
  Looking at it another way  such a provision may indicate
that J J has more than a passing interest in the Tysabri asset
   if it was ultimately to become Elan s partner in MS  we would
view this as a good result   Gorman said in a note

129194,350709,BIIB,UPDATE 2 Elan gives J J potential option to buy Biogen MS stake,news,"  J J can finance Elan purchase of 50 pct Tysabri stake
   Deal contingent on change of control at Biogen
   J J and Elan would enter fresh 50 50 collaboration
   Elan shares up 1 2 pct
 
  Adds analyst comment  update share price 
 By Padraic Halpin
 DUBLIN  July 21  Reuters    Ireland s Elan  said on
Tuesday it gave U S  healthcare conglomerate Johnson   Johnson
 the potential option to acquire Biogen Idec Inc s
 50 percent stake in multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri 
 The potential option is part of a recent deal in which J J
agreed to pay  1 billion for an 18 4 percent stake in Elan and
 500 million for a majority stake in its pipeline of
experimental Alzheimer s disease drugs 
 Elan and Biogen  which is based in Cambridge  Massachusetts 
have a 50 50 partnership under which each has the right to
acquire full control of Tysabri should there be a change of
control at either company 
 But in the event of a change of control at Biogen  J J can
now choose to finance a possible Elan purchase of Biogen s
rights to Tysabri  which is on track to make  1 billion a year 
  We have entered into an arrangement with Johnson   Johnson
that would allow them to finance us to purchase the other 50
percent of Tysabri in the event that there was a change of
control at Biogen   Elan Chief Financial Officer Shane Cooke
told a news conference 
  If J J were to finance us to do that  then we would enter
into a collaboration with J J on a 50 50 basis   he said  adding
that its change of control agreement with Biogen was unchanged 
 
 GOOD PARTNER
 Analysts said the arrangement  while hypothetical  gives
Elan more control over the fate of Tysabri and takes an element
of risk out of the partnership with Biogen 
  My initial reaction was  what are they doing here  but it
is really just covering their position   Ian Hunter  an analyst
at Goodbody Stockbrokers said  
  They now know who their potential partner could be if
anything happened at Biogen Idec  There s no uncertainty   
 Dublin based Elan confirmed the new agreement after Reuters
learned of it from sources with knowledge of the  1 5 billion
deal  ID nN20149879  
 Elan  which beat expectations with a 14 percent rise in
second quarter revenues  said around 43 300 patients worldwide
were on Tysabri therapy at the end of June 
 Biogen and Elan originally predicted 100 000 patients would
be taking Tysabri by the end of 2010  While they still expect to
reach that figure  which would generate  2 billion to  3 billion
a year  they don t expect to reach it within that timeframe 
  J J would be a pretty good partner in the event that all
these things triggered that particular situation   said Jack
Gorman  an analyst at Davy brokerage 
  J J would bring plenty of commercial clout  autoimmune and
infusion expertise and  given they re a big pharma with biotech
capability  presumably they d also have manufacturing
capability  
 Elan shares were down 2 3 percent at 5 58 euros by 1545 GMT
after jumping 9 percent on Monday following media reports that
it may invest in a biologics operation in Ireland

129211,350726,BIIB,Week Ahead  Investors Primed To Drive Equities To New Highs,opinion,"US jobs report positive for equities  negative for dollar and yields
US equities expected to rally in July and second half 2018
S P blew out bearish pattern  Dow Jones crossed back above 200 DMA
WTI developing bullish pattern

Bullish investors will start the coming week with a resounding nod to keep on pushing higher from Friday s mixed jobs report nonfarm payrolls increased but average hourly earnings disappointed  The release suggests the possibility of a slower pace to monetary tightening  in our view paving the way in July for heights yet unexplored 
The results boosted equities  while pulling yields and the dollar lower  All major US indices  including the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ finished the day and the week higher  Overall  the favorable employment report signals that the economy has been growing despite the negative sentiment surrounding an expanding trade war  Even more encouraging  we believe the positive equity market finish  both for the day and week  indicates a likely trajectory for the month and the second half of the year  We think investors are primed to boldly go where no one has gone before  Here s why 
It s the Economy Stupid
The addition of 213 000 new jobs in June  which beat the 195 000 estimate  is the third strongest showing of the year  for a total of 1 3 million jobs added since the start of 2018  That s a 15 percent acceleration of the 1 1 million jobs in the preceding six month period  And while unemployment rose to 4 percent  slightly higher than the previous reading  it s still the lowest since 1969  An increase this minimal  off a near 50 year low remains an obvious sign of improving job prospects  Wages rose 2 7 percent YoY  increasing from last year s 2 4 percent mark 
June s report provides hard proof that the US economy is improving  It also offers a positive outlook for additional economic expansion since more jobs and higher wages would support consumer spending  which makes up the lion s share of the US GDP  a necessary component for yet more growth 
As for investor bullishness  even after the fear of tariffs materialized  time and again demand continued to support prices within uptrends  The favorable employment report indicates that despite the negative sentiment of an escalating trade war  the economy still keeps growing  By pushing stocks higher  investors continue to demonstrate that they don t believe a full fledged trade war will end economic growth but instead view it as a negotiating strategy  a way for the US president to strengthen his hand 
Market Internals Almost All Green
The S P 500 advanced on Friday  up 0 85 percent  with all 11 sectors in the green  led by Healthcare   1 44 percent  after biotech shares drove gains following a report that Biogen s  NASDAQ BIIB  Alzheimer s drug showed positive results in a large clinical trial  The strong finish boosted the leading benchmark to a 1 52 percent gain on the week  led once again by Healthcare   3 06 percent   though Energy   0 36 percent  finished the week in the red  following volatile oil prices down 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0 4 percent on Friday  ending the week 0 85 percent higher  halting a three week slump  The NASDAQ Composite jumped 1 35 percent Friday  gaining 2 4 percent for the week  It s now within 1 5 percent from its all time high two weeks ago 
The Russell 2000 outperformed  surging 0 85 percent  for the fourth straight day  to a 3 14 percent advance  to 0 8 percent from its highest price on record  the week before last 

From a technical perspective  the S P 500 Index blew out a bearish pennant  trading entirely above the negative pattern on Friday  Even the Dow Jones the major index underperformer during a trade war  because its multinational mega cap companies rely on exports for growth closed above a bearish pennant  as well as back above the 200 DMA for the first time after nine sessions 
Bulls have trampled all of the bears  red lines  suggesting the path is now clear for another charge higher 

While the nonfarm payrolls report buoyed equities  the release weighed on yields  including the 10 year Treasury  as the wages component missed estimates  the second time in a row  Average hourly earnings were up just 2 7 percent year over year  one tenth of a percentage point below expectations 
This offers another example of the different perspectives held by equity traders versus bond traders  equity traders focused on the positive side of the report  the higher YoY number  bond traders paid attention to the lower than expected result  The slower outlook for interest rate hikes increased demand for long term bonds at the current rates  dragging yields down 

The lower outlook for rates weighed on the greenback  which found support for now by an uptrend line since mid May

Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
Recently  investors on Stocktwits and Twitter have been asking about some of the drug stocks 
If you look at the valuations  you can see why 
Many are dirt cheap  with some trading with single digit P Es 
Problem is  the Street hates them  which makes them perfect for value investors  
Retail and energy stocks were hated over the last several years too but have staged big turnarounds in 2018 
Will the drug stocks be the next big turnaround success story 
Definition of a Value Trap
Remember  a value trap is a stock that looks cheap based on basic value fundamentals like the P E ratio 
Who doesn t like a company trading at 5x earnings 
But sometimes there s a reason for the cheapness  Investors have to look beyond the value fundamentals at earnings 
Are they rising or falling 
Rising earnings with a low P E tells you that something right is going on at a company  But an earnings decline can be a sign that the company has lost its way 
Value Stock or a Trap 
1        Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   has a forward P E of just 11 8  Shares are down 13 3  over the last 2 years while the S P 500 has gained 34 5  in that time  What are the earnings expected to do in 2018 
2        Biogen   NASDAQ BIIB   is trading with a forward P E of 12 9  Year to date  the shares are down 8 4  but they ve gained 28 5  over the prior 2 years  Estimates for 2018 have been cut in the last 60 days  but is there earnings growth 
3        Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   has taken a beating this year with shares falling 27  year to date  It s now trading with a forward P E of just 9 2  That s cheap  But is it a trap 
4        Lannett   NYSE LCI   is the cheapest among this group  It has a forward P E of only 5 3  Should you take a chance  Shares are down 31  year to date and have fallen 35  the prior 2 years 
5        Valeant   NYSE VRX   has had its problems the last few years but the shares have rebounded in 2018 and are up 22  compared to the S P s return of 3 4   It s also cheap  with a forward P E of just 8  Is this the bottom of the earnings decline 
There are lots of categories in the healthcare sector including the insurers  hospitals  device manufacturers  staffing and others 
But the drug companies have been hit especially hard 
Just because they re cheap  however  doesn t mean they re a good buy  Investors need to do their homework

129248,350763,BIIB,Roche Announces Positive Data On Gazyva And MS Drug Ocrevus,opinion,"Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced encouraging data from the final analysis of the CLL11 study  evaluating Gazyva based treatment in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  CLL  
The phase III  multicenter  open label  randomized three arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of Gazyva in combination with chlorambucil compared to MabThera in combination with chlorambucil or chlorambucil alone  in nearly 800 patients with previously untreated CLL and comorbidities 
The final results  after a follow up of almost five years  showed clinically meaningful improvements with Gazyva plus chlorambucil across multiple endpoints  including progression free survival  PFS  and overall survival  OS   when compared head to head with Rituxan plus chlorambucil 
These long term data confirm Gazyva s efficacy to extend the lives of patients suffering from CLL  compared to that of MabThera Rituxan 
Gazyva based treatment reduced the risk of death by 24  compared to MabThera Rituxan based treatment  Gazyva is approved in combination with chlorambucil  for patients with previously untreated CLL 
Roche is a leader in the oncology market with a wide portfolio of drugs for breast cancer and CLL among others 
Additionally  Roche announced new data on multiple sclerosis  MS  drug  Ocrevus  which will be presented at the 4th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology  EAN  from Jun 16 19 in Lisbon  Portugal 
The data from a new exploratory analysis  from the extended control period of the phase III study  ORATORIO  in primary progressive multiple sclerosis  PPMS  patients  showed that Ocrevus may significantly delay the time to need a wheelchair by seven years  as measured by the length of time until a person reaches Expanded Disability Status Scale seven or greater  EDSS 7   using 24 week confirmed disability progression  CDP  
Patients  treated with Ocrevus  showed a 46  reduction in the risk of progressing to a wheelchair compared to the placebo treated group  The analysis also showed that the placebo treated patient population studied in Oratorio had similar disability progression rates to an untreated real world PPMS population  The extrapolated median time to wheelchair  EDSS 7  for placebo treated people in the Oratorio study was 12 1 years 
The longer term efficacy and safety data are consistent with the drug s favourable benefit risk profile  for both PPMS and relapsing MS  RMS  
In addition  a new global study  FLOODLIGHT Open  is now enrolling patients in the United States  The study uses proprietary FLOODLIGHT mobile technology to collect and monitor anonymized patient data to help gain a better understanding of MS disease progression  The study is an observational  open access study aimed to enroll 10 000 people globally  including people with relapsing and progressive forms of MS  within five years 
Roche will be initiating two new phase IIIb studies of Ocrevus in 2018 
While the MS market holds immense potential  competition is stiff with the likes of Biogen  Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   
Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche  as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars 
Roche s stock has lost 12 7  in the last six months compared with   decline of 3 1  
 

 
Novartis   NYSE NVS   has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan in Europe  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer  colorectal cancer  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer

129263,350778,BIIB,Selecting Deep In The Money Strikes  A Real Life Example Using BIIB,opinion,"Option selection is the second required skill when selling call and put options  On 9 26 2017  George shared with me a trade he executed with Biogen  Inc   NASDAQ BIIB   An in the money strike was sold and share price immediately accelerated  George was inquiring about how deep in the money  ITM  the strike prices should be set 
George s initial trade

Buy 100 x BIIB at  313 80
Sell  1 month   307 50 call for  8 20
9 26 2017  Stock trading at  318 46

We use in the money strikes when concerned about potential price decline of the underlying security 
Calculating initial timer value returns

Using the multiple tab of the   we see an initial time value return of 0 6  with a   of that initial profit not breakeven  of 2   When evaluating if this was the best strike to select we must first define what the goals were prior to entering the trade  If the return goal and protection goals were met  then yes this was the appropriate strike  If not  a more relevant option should be considered 
One month later
With BIIB trading at  328 78 on 10 23 2017  let s view the  for in the money strikes and assume a goal of 2    4  for initial time value returns  my personal preference  

We will evaluate three in the money strikes   315 00   317 50 and  320 00  by entering the information into the multiple tab of the Ellman Calculator 

The initial time value returns of all 3 strike prices approximate our 2    4  1 month goals  If we are looking to generate the most protection of the time value profit  we would favor the  315 00 strike  4 2    If we preferred the greatest time value profit  then the  325 00 strike should be considered  The  320 00 strike is an excellent compromise 
Discussion
When deciding on which in the money strike to select  initial time value goals must first be established  From there  the amount of profit protection should be considered  Once those two components are defined  strike selection will become apparent

129272,350787,BIIB,Drug Biotech Stock Q1 Earnings Due On Apr 24  LLY  BIIB  AMGN,opinion,The first quarter 2018 earnings season started on a solid note  showing signs of yet another reporting cycle emerging strong  Per the latest   87 S P 500 members   accounting for 17 4  of the index   have already released financial figures as of Apr 20  2018 Total earnings for these index participants jumped 25  from the year ago quarter  driven by 10 7  improved revenues  The beat ratio was 82 8  for the bottom line and 67 8  for the top line Further good news is that the ongoing earnings phase seems to have also begun encouragingly for the Drug Biotech sector  Among the major large cap players  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   kicked off the season strongly  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales in first quarter 2018  Another large cap player having reported earnings performance last week is Novartis   NYSE NVS    which also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter We remind investors that though the Drug biotech sector faced severe volatility since the last couple of months due to broader market pressure  mainly driven by the U S  China trade war  the sector is still likely to improve as the year progresses We expect a surge in new product sales in sync with rising demand  This apart  a successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  more frequent FDA approvals  a consistently sturdy performance of key products  growing demand for drugs  especially to address rare to treat diseases  an ageing populace and an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that should keep the sector well in place Also  according to the Earnings Preview  the broader Medical sector  inclusive of drug  biotech as well as Medical Device companies  is likely to record 6 8  year over year growth in revenues and a 9 4  rise in earnings in the period under discussion Three pharma biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Apr 24  Let s see  how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise    Lilly is slated to release first quarter earnings before the market opens  The company delivered a positive surprise of 5 56  last quarter  Moreover  the company s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4 08  However  our proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  Though the company s favorable Zacks Rank  2  Buy  increases the predictive power of ESP  its of  0 48  leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about a probable surprise  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings is pegged at  1 13 per share Lilly s strong uptake of new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance and Lartruvo should compensate the sales decline of its established products  namely Zyprexa  Alimta  Cialis  Strattera and Effient  We expect this uptrend to find reflection in the results of the soon to be reported quarter   Read More    Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB  Biogen Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Biogen is also slated to release first quarterearnings before the market opens  The company s track record has also been impressive so far  It delivered a positive surprise in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6 91   However  Biogen came up with a negative surprise of 3 31  in fourth quarter 2017 Moreover  our proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  Though the company s favorable Zacks Rank  3  Hold  increases the predictive power of ESP  its Earnings ESP of  0 51  leaves surprise prediction inconclusive  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  5 93 per share  You can see  Sales of Biogen s multiple sclerosis drugs improved  Patient growth across major European markets as well as growth in the strong emerging market drove international Tecfidera sales while inventory build in the quarter benefited U S  sales  We expect this momentum to continue in the impending results of the soon to be reported quarter   Read More    Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN  Amgen Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Amgen is scheduled to release first quarter earnings after market close  The company delivered a negative surprise of 4 93  in the previous quarter  Amgen s earnings performance has been quite robust with the metric beating expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing the same in the remaining one with an average beat of 2 93  Our proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  The combination of Amgen s Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP and a positive Earnings ESP of  3 34  makes us confident about an earnings beat in the upcoming report  The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at  3 23 per share You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Amgen s latest products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand  This upside might make up for the weak sales on stiff competition of mature brands such as  Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen in the to be reported quarter  Read More    Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this

129317,350832,BIIB,AbbVie s RA Candidate Meets Primary Endpoints In Phase III,opinion,"AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   has announced that its pipeline candidate  upadacitinib  met the primary endpoints in the 4th phase III study from its SELECT program  which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis  RA   Upadacitinib is an investigational oral JAK1 selective inhibitor  which is being studied as a once a day oral therapy 
The phase III SELECT COMPARE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib  15 mg  compared with placebo and AbbVie s marketed drug  Humira  adalimumab   over 12 weeks on patients with moderate to severe RA  who are on a stable background of methotrexate and had an inadequate response  In the study  upadacitinib met both the primary as well as secondary endpoints compared with placebo while showing superiority as compared to Humira 
The primary endpoints of the study registered ACR20 responses and clinical remission  Data from the trial demonstrated that 71  of patients receiving the 15 m oral once daily dose of upadacitinib 15 mg achieved an ACR20 response compared with 36  of patients receiving placebo at week 12  Moreover  29  of subjects treated with upadacitinib achieved complete remission in comparison to 6  with placebo 
Additionally  data from the study also showed that 45  of patients experienced low disease activity  secondary endpoint  when treated with upadacitinib compared with 29  receiving Humira and 14   receiving placebo at week 12 
Notably  SELECT COMPARE is the fourth of the six ongoing phase III studies under the SELECT RA clinical trial program conducted on upadacitinib 
We remind investors that last December  AbbVie announced that upadacitinib met the primary endpoints in the 3rd phase III study from its SELECT trial 
Other researches are also underway on upadacitinib for treating Crohn s disease  ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis 
Shares of AbbVie have rallied 42 7  in the past year  outperforming the  s 6 4  rise 

Notably  AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug  Humira  However  several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company  Also  the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson   Johnson s Simponi and UCB s Cimzia among others 
Significantly  Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   JAK inhibitor  Olumiant  was approved in the EU for RA last February and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for the same indication  which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval 
Also  of late  Biogen   NASDAQ BIIB   has announced resolution of the ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen s biosimilar version of Humira  in the EU  Per the settlement agreement  Biogen plans to launch Humira biosimilar in Europe by October  2018 
However  if upadacitinib is approved  it might reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie s top line AbbVie Inc  Price

Biogen Tops Sales in Q4  Misses EarningsFourth quarter 2017 earnings per share were  5 26  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 44 by 3 3   Earnings however rose 4  year over year as higher revenues made up for higher operating costs Sales came in at  3 31 billion  up 15  from the year ago period  Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 07 billion by 7 6  Higher MS sales and Spinraza outperformance led to the strong top line performance in the quarter  Sales in the quarter also benefited from  40 million in inventory build and increased contract manufacturing  other revenues  The top line  excluding hemophilia revenues  grew 26  year over year Quarter in DetailBiogen s MS revenues were  2 3 billion  up 5   in the quarter including approximately  77 million in

year  and ex U S  sales of  244 million  up 20 6   Patient growth across major European markets and strong emerging market growth drove international Tecfidera sales while a  20 million inventory build in the quarter benefited U S  sales Fourth quarter Tysabri revenues were  463 million which decreased 2  year over year and 1  sequentially Tysabri U S  sales declined 13  to  252 1 million in the quarter  Biogen said that since Ocrevus launch  it has witnessed a decrease in the number of patient starts and an increase in discontinuation of Tysabri in the United States  International revenues rose 14  to  210 6 million in the quarter helped by a large order in Russia and patient growth in all major European countries following the label update in 2017 Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  in the fourth quarter were  645 million  down 6  from the year ago period  Avonex revenues declined 8  from the year ago period to  520 million  Plegridy contributed  125 million to fourth quarter 2017 revenues  flat year over year as well as sequentially U S  Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral or high efficacy MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance Zinbryta  launched in collaboration with AbbVie  contributed  12 million to revenues in the fourth quarter compared with  14 million in third quarter 2017 Newly launched Spinraza brought in revenues of  363 million in the fourth quarter  registering growth of 34  sequentially  As expected  Spinraza sales in the fourth quarter were mainly driven by ex U S  markets Spinraza U S  sales were  218 million in the fourth quarter  slightly better than  198 million in the third quarter  Biogen said that 25  of U S  sales in the fourth quarter were from patients who receive less intensive maintenance doses  dosing only once 4 months   versus 10  in the third quarter According to Biogen  50  of Spinraza revenues will be derived from maintenance dosing by the end of 2018  which will help stabilize the growth trajectory However  Biogen said the number of patients on therapy in the United States rose 33   from the third quarter In ex U S  markets  Spinraza recorded sales of  144 million  significantly higher than  73 3 million in the third quarter as it almost doubled the number of commercial patients on therapy  The company said that Germany  Turkey  and Japan accounted for over two thirds of ex U S  revenues In the quarter  Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of  122 million compared with  101 million in the third

129349,350864,BIIB,Are Alzheimer s Focused Stocks Set For A Financial Windfall ,opinion,In spite of the increasing incidence of Alzheimer s  there is no recognized drug that can cure or slow the progress of the disease   claims that in every 66 seconds  an American develops Alzheimer s  People living with Alzheimer s find it extremely difficult to carry out daily functions and hence need to be under supervision round the clock Coming to other life threatening conditions  CNBC reports that deaths related to Alzheimer s have skyrocketed 89  while those following heart diseases have dropped 14  since the turn of the century Detection Years Before Onset of Alzheimer sA blood test has been introduced to detect Alzheimer s almost two decades before a patient shows any noticeable symptoms  Last year  Dr  Randall Bateman of Washington University announced that the test will be able to detect the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain  The buildup of the toxic protein is among the first signs of the deadly disease Also  in January  a team of researchers from Japan and Australia introduced a blood test with accuracy as high as 90  for the detection of the disease  Dr  Bateman employed the mass spectrometry testing for identifying the protein  According to the email of Bateman to CNBC  scientists from Japan had developed an identical mass spectrometry investigative procedure for protein detection which came up with similar results   Blood Tests to Speed Up Drug ResearchClinical trials for drugs that could delay the start of the disease failed a number of times  thanks to the unavailability of a decent number of qualified patients  revealed Dr  Jeff Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic  Hence  the wider the patient base  higher will be the possibility of meaningful clinical trials With the new blood tests  doctors will be able to detect patients early and include them in clinical trials for the development of effective preventive treatments  Also  there would be proper utilization of millions of dollars of federal government funding for the preventive treatment Importantly  the blood tests will be the most efficient way to detect Alzheimer s as other alternatives are quite expensive  Lumbar puncture for the early diagnosis is among the alternatives that collect cerebrospinal fluid  For the process  a needle is inserted in the lower back of patients  giving rise to the need for local anesthetic  Positron emission tomography is another process that could cost at least  7000  Also  the accuracy of the PET scans is significantly lower than the blood tests Dr  Robert Vassar of Northwestern University has also backed the efficiency of blood tests over other methods for the diagnosis of Alzheimer s  Meanwhile  Dr  Bateman added that the blood tests will be more in demand once proper preventive measures have been established Stocks to GainPeople all over the world will likely gain access to the tests in the coming few years  per Dr  Bateman However  the question that looms large is what is the next course of action for those who find out that they are at a risk of developing Alzheimer s  Meanwhile  the launch of the blood tests paves the way for advanced clinical trials More than 5 million people are estimated to be living with the disease in the United States  per The Alzheimer s Association  Notably  the health organization expects this number to rise more than three times by 2050 As Alzheimer s is a pressing concern  there is massive business potential in this space  Hence  the launch of the blood tests will help companies focused on developing preventive treatments make billions Based in Cambridge  MA  Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   has been paying particular attention on stepping up research work on

research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Novartis  BP and Biogen  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today Novartis  shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry   0 8  vs   3 2    over the last six months  Novartis  fourth quarter results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto  The generic division  Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathin and Erelzi Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor  Exjade  Jakavi  Zykadia  Tasigna  Jadenu and Kisqali  The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost given the potential in the CAR T therapy space Meanwhile  the strategic decision on Alcon to retain the business or separation via capital market transactions such as a spin off or an initial public offering has been postponed for 2019  However  the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs in Novartis  portfolio is a cause of concern  Moreover  Kisqali s uptake has been slow Shares of BP are up  16 1  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry  up  7 2    During 2017  the leading integrated energy firm brought online seven key upstream projects  BP is also expected to bring online five more developments in 2018 All these projects along with the developments placed online during 2016 will likely help the energy giant add 800 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to net production capacity by 2020  The firms  fourth quarter 2017 earnings skyrocketed year over year  courtesy of record oil and gas production and higher commodity price realizations However  the bottom line missed expectations  thanks to a surge in exploration expenses  Moreover  the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP operated

shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry over the last year   20 9  vs   0 8    Biogen had a mixed fourth quarter as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for

likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  among others  Meanwhile  its newest drug Spinraza has witnessed strong patient uptake in the U S  and internationally However  weakening MS trends is a concern  Tecfidera is witnessing slight decline in U S  patient demand due to increasing competition from oral medicines and a slowdown in the overall

has a strong portfolio of MS products  However  the overall growth trends in the multiple sclerosis market are gradually slowing down  Tecfidera s U S  patient demand has been declining due to

129444,350959,BIIB,3 Pharma   Biotech Pipeline Areas To Keep An Eye On In 2018,opinion,Although there are still a few days left for the year to end  2017 has turned out to be pretty good for the pharma and biotech sector where FDA approvals are concerned  Till date  the regulatory agency has given its nod to 43 novel drugs  well above the 22 drugs approved last year  Immuno oncology was a key focus area in 2017  whether it was to do with scientific conferences  clinical trial collaborations  acquisitions or FDA approvals The approval of Novartis s   NYSE NVS   Kymriah  a gene cell therapy  and Gilead s   NASDAQ GILD   Yescarta  a CAR T  chimeric antigen receptor T cells  cell treatment  ensured that the highly lucrative immuno oncology market remained in the limelight The  11 9 billion acquisition of immuno oncology focused Kite by Gilead also increased interest in this category with investors expecting more acquisition announcements in this area While we see 2017 as a year focused on immuno oncology  here is a look at three therapeutic areas that we think will garner a lot of interest in 2018 Immuno OncologyImmuno oncology will remain a key focus area in 2018 as well  The basic concept of cancer immunotherapy or immuno oncology is to utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease  This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body  While some immuno oncology treatments have the potential to be effective as monotherapies  others may be more effective when combined with other treatments Different types of immunotherapies include monoclonal antibodies mAbs  man made versions of immune system proteins which can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell   immune checkpoint inhibitors  recognize and attack cancer cells   vaccines  help prevent or treat cancer  and others that boost the overall immune system Encouraging results generated by some companies demonstrating partial and complete responses in late stage cancer patients and the recent FDA approval of Kymriah and Yescarta has raised hopes for cancer patients and increased interest in this segment of the cancer market  With immuno oncology set to change the treatment paradigm for cancer  this area represents huge commercial potential Companies that have progressed quite a bit in this area include Juno Therapeutics   NASDAQ JUNO    Incyte and bluebird bio   NASDAQ BLUE   with these companies often considered to be acquisition targets Alzheimer s DiseaseAlzheimer s disease is an area where many companies have tried their luck though not with much success  Over the last several years  big players like Merck  NYSE MRK   Lilly   NYSE LLY    Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and J J have all faced setbacks in their quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer s Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer s disease treatments include players like Biogen   NASDAQ BIIB    Novartis  AstraZeneca  Eisai and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  Biogen s aducanumab is one of the most important candidates in the company s pipeline with the candidate currently in a couple of late stage studies  Biogen is also working on elenbecestat  E2609   a BACE inhibitor in a phase III program and BAN2401  a humanized beta amyloid antibody in phase II development with top line results expected by the end of January 2018  All three candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai   Lilly also has quite a few Alzheimer s disease candidates in its pipeline including lanabecestat  which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca with data readout expected in 2019  Meanwhile  Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE1 inhibitor CNP520 which has fast track status in the United Status  Roche is also collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer s disease treatments Although Alzheimer s has historically been a very challenging therapeutic area with quite a few stocks stumbling in their efforts to find a treatment  the market is highly lucrative  As a result  several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer s disease treatments  According to the Alzheimer s Association  in the 10 years from 2002 2012  244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer s in studies registered with clinicaltrials gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval While these numbers are far from encouraging  success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer s disease with the numbers expected to increase to as much as 16 million by 2050  Data  Alzheimer s Association   It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States  The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales Medical MarijuanaAnother segment of the pharma and biotech industry that will remain in the limelight next year is the medical marijuana industry  The industry got its first exchange traded fund   ETF   earlier this year and has been attracting interest from investors over the last few quarters  The industry is expected to grow rapidly with legislators allowing or looking to allow more legal uses of marijuana and marijuana related products  especially in the medical and life sciences industry Some of the key players in this area include GW Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ GWPH    INSYS Therapeutics  Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals GW Pharma commercialized the world s first plant derived cannabinoid prescription drug  Sativex  which is approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis  However  the company has been in the news for its lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate  Epidiolex  cannabidiol or CBD   which is in development for a number of rare childhood onset epilepsy disorders  The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and Lennox Gastaut syndrome   approval could come as early as mid 2018 if priority review is granted  Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications  GW Pharma has several new formulations of CBD in development including improved liquid formulations  a solid dose form and an intravenous formulation Specialty pharma company  INSYS  uses its proprietary spray technology and capabilities for the development of pharmaceutical cannabinoids for a wide range of indication including treating addiction to opioids  opioid overdose  epilepsy  and other disease areas with significant unmet need  While GW Pharma and INSYS are both Zacks Rank  3  Hold

129468,350983,BIIB,Biotech ETFs  What Lies Ahead ,opinion,"So far  it s been a good year for biotech stocks with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index soaring 19 6  year to date  This is in sharp contrast to last year s performance when the Index was down 19 1  with several factors including the drug pricing controversy weighing on the sector 
2016 was disappointing from an R D perspective as well with a fewer number of drugs managing to gain FDA approval and quite a few companies suffering from high profile pipeline failures  Mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition were some of the other challenges for the sector    Read   
However  ramp up in new product sales  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from key products are some of the factors that have helped the sector recover this year  Moreover  investors now seem more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are focusing more on the fundamentals of the sector 
Increasing Threat from Biosimilars
Although biosimilars are yet to pick pace  they remain a major threat for biotech stocks specially companies that are set to lose patent protection for major blockbuster drugs in the next few years  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies 
According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen and Remicade biosimilars alone represent potential savings of more than  22 billion 
Mergers and Acquisitions  M As  Yet to Pick Pace
Although expectations were high that M A activity would pick up in 2017  this did not happen  While several small deals were announced  big ticket M A activity was more or less limited with major acquisition news including Johnson   Johnson s  30 billion acquisition of Actelion and Gilead s  11 9 billion acquisition of Kite   Read   
The sector will receive an additional boost if more M A deals are announced  though companies are likely to adopt a  wait and see  stance as they await more clarity on the drug pricing situation and tax reforms  Another major deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over priced deals 
Higher Number of Drugs Approved So Far in 2017
So far in 2017  the FDA has granted approval to 34 novel drugs  surpassing last year s total tally of 22  Key approvals in the biotech sector this year include Gilead s Yescarta  CAR T therapy for certain types of large B cell lymphoma  and Vosevi  hepatitis C virus   Puma s Nerlynx  to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning   Regeneron Sanofi s Kevzara  rheumatoid arthritis  and eczema treatment  Dupixent  TESARO s PARP inhibitor  Zejula and BioMarin s Brineura  treatment of a specific form of Batten disease  among others  Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential 
The FDA is working on streamlining the development process for drugs for rare diseases as well as for targeted cancer therapies  The agency is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications   Read   
Innovative Pipelines   Catalysts
Biotech companies continue to work on bringing innovative new treatments to market  and there could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read outs especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno oncology  Alzheimer s  central nervous system disorders  and immunology inflammation

129501,351016,BIIB,Biogen  BIIB  Tops Q3 Earnings   Sales  Spinraza Sales Up,opinion,"Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB    a well known name in the multiple sclerosis  MS  market  surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017  The company s revenue was driven by continued a strong performance of its newest drug Spinraza  for spinal muscular atrophy 
Despite better than expected results  Biogen s shares were down almost 3  in pre market trading  This was probably due to the fact that the sales of its multiple sclerosis franchise were below expectations amid an increasingly competitive market  However  we note that Biogen s shares have gained 15 8  so far this year  comparing unfavorably with the  s increase of 9  

Third quarter 2017 earnings per share were  6 31  which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 70 by 10 7   Earnings also rallied 22  year over year 
Sales came in at  3 08 billion  up 4  from the year ago period  Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 04 billion by 1 6   The top line  excluding hemophilia revenues  grew 13  year over year  The company spun off its hemophilia business in February this year 
Quarter in Detail                           
Biogen s MS revenues were  2 3 billion in the quarter including approximately  65 million in royalties on the sales of Roche s MS drug Ocrevus 
Tecfidera sales increased 3  from the year ago period to  1 07 billion  However  the drug recorded a 4  sequential drop in revenues  This included the U S  sales of  836 3 million and ex U S  sales of  233 3 million  In the United States  Tecfidera Inventory levels in the third quarter were relatively flat compared with the year ago levels  which hurt sales in the reported quarter 
Third quarter Tysabri revenues were  469 million  U S   266 8 million  ex U S   202 6 million   which decreased 9  year over year and 5  sequentially  We believe Ocrevus  launch has put pressure on Tysabri s U S  sales in the quarter 
Combined interferon revenues  Avonex and Plegridy  in the third quarter were  662 million  U S   473 3 million  ex U S   188 7 million   down 7  from the year ago period  Avonex revenues declined 7  from the year ago period to  538 million  Plegridy contributed  124 million to third quarter 2017 revenues  down 3  year over year and 7  sequentially 
U S  Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance 
Zinbryta  launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   in August last year  contributed  14 million to revenues in the third quarter  down 11  sequentially 
Newly launched Spinraza brought revenues of  271 million  U S  revenues  197 6 million  in the third quarter  registering growth of 33 5  sequentially as the drug witnesses a strong demand in the United States  The company is working on expanding access to all patients 
This quarter  Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of  101 million compared with  91 million in second quarter 2017  The company markets Benepali  a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   Enbrel in Europe  Benepali recorded revenues of  99 2 million  registering a growth rate of 11 8  sequentially  Biogen also markets Flixabi  a biosimilar referencing Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   blockbuster drug  Remicade  which recorded revenues of  2 2 million in the reported quarter compared with  1 9 million in the second quarter 
Revenues from anti CD20 therapeutic programs  which include Biogen s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits  climbed 28  from the year ago period to  406 million in the third quarter 
R D spend decreased 15 6  in the reported quarter to  446 4 million  while SG A spend declined 6 2  year over year to  433 8 million  
Collaboration Agreement
This month  Biogen announced restructuring of collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune to improve long term value of Alzheimer candidate aducanumab  which is presently in a phase III study 
Concurrent with the earnings release  Biogen announced a renegotiation of its agreement with Neurimmune by making a one time payment of  150 million in exchange of a reduction in Neurimmune s 15  royalty rate on the potential sales of aducanumab  The re negotiated deal thus increases aducanumab s profit potential 
On Oct 23  Biogen and partner Eisai refined their existing Alzheimer collaboration  Biogen already has an agreement with Eisai to develop the phase III BACE inhibitor  E2609 and the phase II amyloid beta antibody  BAN240 for Alzheimer s disease  However  Biogen has announced that Eisai has exercised the option to jointly develop and commercialize aducanumab  The company will now receive 55  of aducanumab s potential profits in the United States  68 5  in Europe and 20  in Japan Biogen Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

129560,351075,BIIB,Endocyte Inks Deal For Prostate Cancer Candidate  Shares Up,opinion,"Shares of Endocyte  Inc    NASDAQ ECYT   have soared more than 150  on Oct 2  after it acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize ABX GmbH s phase III ready prostate cancer candidate 177Lu PSMA 617 
Also  the share price increased more than 50  in pre market trading on Oct 3  The company made an upfront payment of  12 million to ABX 
Consequently  Endocyte s shares have outperformed the  year to date  The stock has rallied 142 4  compared with the industry s gain of 3 5  in the same time frame 

The deal provides Endocyte with the most advanced targeted radioligand therapeutic  RLT   which is being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer and represents a greater than  1 billion market opportunity   
In fact  177Lu PSMA 617 targets the prostate specific membrane antigen  PSMA   present in about 80  of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  mCRPC   The candidate has also shown high response rates in late stage prostate cancer patients in the studies presented at recent European Society for Medical Oncology 
177Lu PSMA 617 has the potential to be the first in class RLT to address both bone and soft tissue disease and is a very important for patients suffering from mCRPC 
Going forward  Endocyte intends to seek regulatory approval to commence a phase III study of 177Lu PSMA 617 in early 2018  The company expects the study to complete by 2020  Also  it plans to utilize and focus our resources on the development of 177Lu PSMA 617 
In June 2017  Endocyte announced its plans to reduce its workforce by about 40  in order to better focus its resources on the more valuable opportunities  Interestingly  the company plans to shift its focus on its most promising programs  which include its CAR T cell SMDC adaptor platform  the dual targeted DNA crosslinker drug EC2629 and the cohort of taxane exposed patients receiving EC1169 
Moreover  the company narrowed the EC1169 development program to focus only on the cohort of taxane exposed  mCRPC patients  Further the company stopped enrollment in the EC1456 trial  where the level of clinical activity necessary to support continued advancement of this candidate was not met 
The deal seems to be lucrative for the company and should bode well for its future Endocyte  Inc  Price

129571,351086,BIIB,Seeking Confirmations In The US Market  USD  S P 500 And Tightening ,opinion,"Seeking Confirmations
We have several inputs forecasting change  market pivots  ranging from seasonal tendencies to an expected US dollar rally  Fed monetary tightening  such as it is   the 30 month S P 500 cycle  not to mention a presidential administration in utter disarray and not having done much  if anything  to further the fiscal stimulation  which  the story goes  would replace the Fed s monetary stimulation under the previous administration  view that much of the stock market s post election euphoria was built upon 
In other words  we have working plans for two main themes  a correction in the stock market and in the mirror  a tradable rally in the gold sector  Based on an email exchange with a subscriber  I want to be clear that yes  I think the stock market has probably topped out for something more than a routine pullback  but no  we do not have the all clear on that from a technical confirmation standpoint just yet  although the sector breakdowns noted in a Friday update held that status to close the week 
As for the precious metals  gold shot above and closed below our 1st target of 1300 on Friday and HUI broke above  and closed below short term resistance  Despite that little head fake the sector is constructive insofar as the stock market seemed to change character and did not put on an op ex Friday relief  short covering  rally  implying a waning of confidence  But the gold sector has not technically confirmed 
US Stock Market
This chart shows what I mean about  seeking confirmations   Who s broken down  The Dow  It is above the SMA 50  Semis  What if just maybe that is a Symmetrical Triangle targeting much higher levels  Small Caps  Bear biased but no breakdown 

In TA it is absolutely important to have facts to go with opinions  My opinion is that a correction is beginning  not ending  But the facts are that not one of the items above is broken down in standard technical terms  Although in a Friday update we did note Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV  to be in a breakdown posture with a target of 75  This chart would expand that to 74  SMA 200  to 76  trend line  

Looking closer at Healthcare  we see strong lateral support for XLV at 75      a reasonable target for Devices  which I ve taken the liberty to short since we d taken the liberty of being quite bullish the sector a year ago  is around 150  assuming a market pullback  and we can still anticipate 290 to 295 on the Biotech ETF 

Here is said Biotech ETF  NASDAQ IBB  and some of its top components looking for lower levels  with Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  in a relative still bullish state  

The Device sector has been following MDT into breakdown mode  TMO in particular  looks like it is setting up for significantly lower levels  I shorted the ETF rather than individual companies to back out individual company risk  I tend not to be that sort of gung ho player from the short side  But boy  that TMO looks toppy

129601,351116,BIIB,What You See  And What You Get  The Neurology Of Perception,opinion,"  1     Neuroscience  The 4 Theaters Of The Brain 5     Investors Train Their Brains to Trade  Assumption and Perception 10     Neurology Is The New Oncology  The Boom In Brain Sciences 14     Biotech Companies With Breakthrough Research 21     Appreciating Differences  The Story Of A Misdiagnosis 34     Episode Roundup  Welcome back to Mind Over Money  I m Kevin Cook  your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics  Today s episode is all about your brain  from three different angles 
First  I want to share with you a lesson I used to teach beginning and intermediate traders about their perception and their assumptions 
Second  I m going to talk about some of the exciting biotechnology companies doing breakthrough research in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson s  multiple sclerosis  and Alzheimer s 
And last  I am going to tell you a story about a young woman who led a torturous first third of her life with a neurological condition that went undiagnosed  and where no drugs would have helped anyway 
That story comes from a terrific book I m reading by Dr  John Ratey  a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School   
A User s Guide to the Brain  Perception  Attention  and the Four Theaters of the Brain
Ratey s Four Theaters is a description that really appeals to me based on my reading of other neuroscience books over ten years ago  Back then I concluded that behavior and identity are a complex dance created by several sometimes competing forces   what I call your  multi mind  
And this ties into something I realized in the early 2000 s when I was training traders  First  the reason short term trading is so hard is because our brains evolved for very different challenges than those of watching our money fluctuate up and down wildly on a screen full of red and green arrows 
So I say  your brain wasn t made to trade  because we are barely equipped to manage probability and risk in long term planning  let alone minute by minute  We naturally do the wrong things like keep losing positions and take profits too quickly  the two ingredient recipe for trading failure 
This is why over 95  of those who try short term trading in stocks  currencies  or commodities    especially with leverage    will fail and lose most  if not all  of their money  Even though the odds are better than Vegas  we stack them against ourselves with unconscious cognitive biases and bad habits of emotional decision making 
To hear a powerful analogy I use to teach traders about their biases and their  multi mind   be sure to listen to my full podcast attached to this article 
Meet Tony Coles of Yumanity
Doing some preliminary research for this podcast  I found a great article by Matthew Herper writing for Forbes in February of 2015  Matt says  I cover science and medicine  and believe this is biology s century   I couldn t agree more 
That s why I love running a new portfolio here at Zacks called  where I get to focus on the megatrends of science and medicine 
Matt s story  The Coming Boom In Brain Medicines  starts out with a great introduction to a scientist you should know   
TONY COLES COULD have had any job he wanted in the drug industry  In five years at the helm of cancer drug developer Onyx Pharmaceuticals he increased its market cap eightfold by purchasing an experimental blood cancer drug for  800 million  developing it into a big seller and flipping the whole company to Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  for  10 4 billion in October 2013  He personally made  60 million on the deal  Biotech watchers expected him to start another cancer company or even command a drug giant like Merck  NYSE MRK  or Pfizer  NYSE PFE  
Instead  Coles  54  is using his own money to build a Cambridge  Mass  based startup called Yumanity that is using yeast  the microbes that help make bread and beer  to study how misfolded proteins in the brain cause Alzheimer s  Lou Gehrig s disease and Parkinson s  and to create drugs based on that knowledge  There s already interest from Big Pharma  Coles says he chose to attack brain diseases  not tumors  because the need is so dire and the science is so fresh 
 We ve got 50 million people around the world who have these diseases  costing  650 billion a year  and lots of families like mine that have been affected   says Coles   I had a grandmother who died of the complications of Alzheimer s disease  I think about my own health as well  
 end of excerpt from Matthew Herper s Forbes article 
The New Next Frontier in Biotechnology
In my Healthcare Innovators portfolio  I am very focused on the frontiers of cancer research  Especially exciting is the field of  immuno oncology  where researchers are learning to harness a patient s own immune system to fight his or her cancer  The research and the treatments are costly  but the rewards could be enormous    and life saving 
A second disease fighting frontier I follow is that of  gene editing  where the science is allowing a person s genome to be altered and possibly cure inherited ailments 
But the new frontier I have very limited experience with as a healthcare investor is the neurological and neurodegenerative diseases  One company I have favored and owned for its Parkinson s psychosis treatment was Acadia Pharmaceuticals  ACAD  
And I currently own Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  for the successful launch of their drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
Alfred Sandrock  the Chief Medical Officer of Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  has said that  neurology is the new oncology   And I find it thrilling that this  60 billion company with 12 month trailing sales of  11 7 billion  is so engaged in the new next frontier in biotech 
In the podcast  I describe other companies involved on this frontier like Alkermes  ALKS  and Neurocrine Biosciences  NBIX  
I also own Sangamo Therapeutics  SGMO  primarily for their  zinc finger  gene editing technology  But it doesn t hurt that they have early stage programs in Huntington s disease and Alzheimer s in their R D pipeline too 
Appreciating Differences  Appreciating Health
I close the podcast with a 10 minute story that Ratey shares of a woman named Rickie  who was actually the subject of the 1990 book of the same name by Frederic Flach  a psychiatric researcher at Cornell University 
It s an incredible story ofpersonal tragedy and eventual triumph that you must hear 
My goal is not just to help you learn about the brain and perception but also to encourage you to recognize others who may seem very  different  than you and why that might be 
And also to appreciate your own health  to the degree you have it  That s one I often take for granted myself 
Disclosure  I own shares of SRPT and SGMO for the  portfolio

129659,351174,BIIB,It s All About Biotech  Stocks To Watch,opinion,"Michael Bay s latest installment in the Transformers series came out this week and based on the early reviews  it s worse than the rest  Instead of wasting a couple hours of your time on that particular mix of biological beings and technology  you should spend a couple minutes catching up on another  more exciting development in the biotechnology sphere  namely this week s big breakout in biotech stocks 
The world s largest biotech fund  the iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF  NASDAQ IBB   has had a quiet couple of months  For the last four  the fund has been consolidating in a tight range between about 285 and 303  That changed abruptly this week as prices surged above that range  hitting a high above 320 

Source  Stockcharts com
As the daily chart above shows  IBB has already hit its  measured move  objective of the range breakout  In other words  after being contained to an 18 point range for four months  IBB has surged over 18 points after breaking out this week  Given the rapid thrust higher  there s definitely a chance that we could see a profit taking dip in the coming week  especially with the Fourth of July holiday looming the following week  That said  if we take a step back  there s reason for optimism in IBB from a longer term perspective 

Source  Stockcharts com
As the weekly chart above shows  IBB also broke out of a longer term ascending triangle pattern this week  The  measured move  objective of that setup actually suggests that IBB could revisit 2015 s lofty highs  which would put it closer to 400    in the coming months  Of course no pattern is infallible and there will inevitably be setbacks along the way   even if IBB eventually rises to that aggressive target 
Fundamentally speaking  many biotech stocks have continued to increase their earnings and bolster pipelines over the last couple of years  while stock prices have held relatively steady or even pulled back  After a year and a half of relatively  quiet  price action  this week s price action may mark a major turning point for the planet s largest biotech ETF 
IBB Components
Getting a bit more granular  IBB s largest holdings include Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB    NASDAQ AMGN   Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ REGN  and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   all of which traded higher by at least 5  this week  Indeed  REGN rallied by a staggering 11 5  in the four full trading days since Monday s open 
While we wouldn t be surprised to see a pullback in these names over the next week  the big breakout in IBB bodes well for their longer term outlook  We re currently viewing short term dips as buying opportunities as long as IBB holds above 305 
While many are wasting their time and money watching a movie about transforming cars  our readers should be sure to note the more interesting  transformation  taking place in biotech stocks",2017-06-23,Matthew Weller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/it's-all-about-biotech:-stocks-to-watch-200197256,200197256
129660,351175,BIIB,Can Biogen  BIIB  Keep The Earnings Streak Alive In Q2 ,opinion,"Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB    a well known name in the multiple sclerosis  MS  market  will report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 25  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 63  
Biogen s shares have declined 0 4  this year so far while the Zacks classified  industry recorded an increase of 8 8  

Biogen s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far  having delivered back to back positive surprises  The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5 29  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
At the first quarter call  the company had said that it expects relatively stable demand for both Tecfidera and Tysabri  its multiple sclerosis drugs  in 2017 as patient growth in ex U S  markets offsets the modest decline in the U S  due to rising competition from drugs like Roche s Ocrevus  It remains to be seen whether its second quarter performance reflects the trend 
Meanwhile  the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy is on the decline as patients transition to other oral multiple sclerosis therapies or other high efficacy products 
Zinbryta  launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   in Aug 2016  is expected to continue to contribute to revenues in the U S  and the EU  The drug benefits from increased use of high efficacy products 
Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy in Dec 2016 was off to a promising start backed by robust underlying demand Notably  Spinraza  which added  47 4 million to the top line in the first quarter of 2017  should contribute further to sales  At the Q1 conference call  the company had said that it is working on expanding access to Spinraza to all patients 
However  at the call  the company had warned of possible logistics and coverage restriction on the drug in the U S  as well as other markets  We expect management to provide an update on the issue at its second quarter conference call 
Biogen s biosimilar products   Flixabi  a biosimilar referencing Remicade  and Benepali  a biosimilar referencing Enbrel  are also generating higher revenues  The trend should continue this quarter as well 
Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses  Meanwhile  R D expenses are expected to increase due to increased business development payments 
At the second quarter call  investor focus will remain on Tecfidera s scrip trends  sales ramp up of Spinraza  pipeline progress and acquisition plans 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below

Zacks Rank  Biogen s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Biogen Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Stocks to Consider

Merck sees potential in the development and commercialization of the candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease  AD  and other neurological diseases  The company will make an undisclosed upfront payment to Teijin Pharma  which is also eligible to receive development  regulatory and sales milestone payments  Further  Teijin Pharma will receive royalties on product sales and retains an option to co promote an approved product in Japan 
Merck s shares are up 10 4  year to date  comparing unfavorably with an increase of 10 7  witnessed by the Zacks classified  industry 

The addition of the anti tau antibody to its portfolio will complement Merck s other AD candidates  This includes MK 6240  a tau ligand which is currently being assessed as a potential Positron Emission Tomography  PET  imaging agent for quantifying the brain burden of neurofibrillary tangle pathology in people with AD  Merck is also is evaluating verubecestat  MK 8931   a BACE1 inhibitor  to see if it can slow or stop the progression of AD 
Notably in Apr 2017  Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   announced that it has inked a deal to buy worldwide rights for Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   anti tau antibody  BMS 986168  for an upfront payment of  300 million 
Biogen sees significant potential in the development and commercialization of BMS 986168 for the treatment of both AD and progressive supranuclear palsy  PSP   The deal is anticipated to be closed in the second quarter of 2017 
BMS 986168 is an antibody targeting extracellular tau  which is a protein that deposits in the brain associated with AD and other neurodegenerative tauopathies such as PSP  Biogen plans to soon initiate phase II studies for BMS 986168 in both AD and PSP 
However  we want to remind investors that in Feb 2017  the EPOCH study for Merck s verubecestat was stopped after an interim analysis by an external Data Monitoring Committee  eDMC  indicated that the study might fail  While the EPOCH study was stopped due to lack of efficacy  another study  APECS  continues as the eDMC noted that the safety signals observed in the other study were not enough to stop APECS 
In a separate release  Merck also announced that it will collaborate with Optum  the health services business of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated   NYSE UNH    to advance value based contracting of pharmaceuticals  Under outcomes based risk sharing agreements  OBRSAs   health plans   other payers  the companies will reimburse drug manufacturers on basis of clinical outcomes achieved  Optum and Merck plan to publicly share analytic insights  findings and recommendations to help inform and facilitate the understanding and use of pragmatic approaches to OBRSAs in the health care system

129698,351213,BIIB,The Week Ahead  Will A Big Week For Data Bring Volatility ,opinion,"The holiday shortened week ahead features many economic reports  including the most important  The biggest news is at week s end  so both market participants and pundits will have time to settle in after the long weekend  When they get around to the calendar  I expect many to be asking 
Will we finally see some volatility 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was mixed  but the market showed strength anyway 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted a quiet week for data with plenty of talk about the Fed  That was a reasonable guess  but there was not really a dominant theme  There was some discussion about the Fed balance sheet and policy changes  but it was competing with plenty of other news 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a chart of S P 500 market performance 

While there were not many big swings  the 1 4  gain for the week also took markets to intra day highs 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news last week was mixed  but the market reaction was positive  
The Good
Q1 GDP revised higher to 1 2   This is backward looking  of course  but a small positive 
Indicators in all time frames show continuing strength   is a great source  This week s conclusion 
The nowcast for the economy remains positive  as does the near term view  with both stocks and jobless claims leading the way  The longer term forecast remains neutral to positive  shading a little closer to neutral based on the tightening yield curve  less robust growth in real money supply  and the miss in corporate profits 


The Philly Fed index improved again  Steven Hansen    has the analysis 

Q1 Earnings show continued strength  This includes not only earnings and revenue  but profit margins    Also see earnings guru Brian Gilmartin in the quant section  below  

Initial jobless claims beat expectations and registered a decline in the widely followed four week moving average  For a full analysis see Steven Hansen    
The Bad
New home sales declined 11   Most sources cited a normal decline from the gains in March as well as weather  The Capital Spectator has a solid and typical explanation  That said  this was a disappointment and deserves careful attention next month   that it was a reasonable report  noting that sales are up 11 3  compared to the same four month period last year  It is always difficult to interpret highly volatile reports 
Durable goods orders dropped 0 7   the first decline in five months     
Existing home sales dropped 2 3    notes the effect of lower inventory on this report  Bill sees this as the key market factor 

The Ugly
Terrorism in London  UK home to   and Egypt lead the week s  ugly  news  This is another  headline  event that is important  but not currently deemed to be a  market  story 
Noteworthy
Did you know that 40  of millennials use Facebook s  NASDAQ FB   as their sole source of news  Decades ago  warned that the public relied too much on TV news  Things change 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes  once again  to Josh Brown  He is often a candidate and one of the most frequent recipients  This week  a Fast Money guest who  came on to discuss the Plunge Protection Team urban legend as a bonafide explanation for why the market has been acting the way it has   He goes on to write 

Now obviously  the existence of a Plunge Protection Team  or PPT   is demonstrably ridiculous  Especially when you consider the fact that we ve seen the market cut in half twice during the last 17 years  with dozens of instances of 10 and 15 percent corrections all along the way over the last 29 years since the end of Reagan s term  The idea that there could be some clandestine  bipartisan shadow organization  with enough money to prop up a global stock market  and the solemnity required to faithfully do so across a half dozen Presidential administrations and all manner of Congressional configurations  is akin to believing in the Area 51 myths or the moon landing hoax 

Readers will certainly note the relevance to this week s theme  Read the entire post for more background and some great comparisons 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have the biggest week of the year for economic reports   and it is jammed into a holiday shortened week 
The  A  List
Employment report  F   Job market tightening  Implication for wage costs 
ISM index  Th   Good concurrent read on economic changes with some leading qualities as well 
Consumer confidence  T   Conference Board version has been very strong  A slight decline is expected 
ADP private employment data  Th   Non government source is a good alternative to the official report  and often changes expectations 
Auto sales  Th   Even greater interest in recent months as the  peak auto  debate continues 
Personal income and spending  T   Continuing growth expected  Consumer spending remains crucial to economic growth 
Initial jobless claims  Th   Continues with record low levels  Not part of the Friday data sample 
The  B  List
Pending home sales  W   While not directly tied to construction spending  it is a good read on the housing market 
Fed Beige Book  W   Anecdotal evidence from each Fed district will be in front of FOMC members at the June meeting 
Construction spending  Th   April data  Rebound from the March decline is expected 
Trade balance  F   Deficit is expected to increase by 1 or 2   More interest in this topic because of current debate over trade policy 
Chicago PMI  W   A hint for the ISM report  this index has been very strong 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
There is daily FedSpeak on the schedule 
Next Week s Theme
In a sharp change from the last few weeks  we have a big calendar for economic reports  These include the most important  They come in a holiday shortened week  with a relatively slow start  Last week I noted that the A Teams would head for the beach on Friday  It was indeed a very quiet day  It might be Wednesday before action is back to normal 
If this combination can t generate some action  what will  Pundits will be asking 
Is it finally time for some volatility 
As always  there are several viewpoints 

The lack of volatility is a bad omen  Just as night follows day  we should expect the worst   Citations omitted to protect the guilty  
Much is wrong in the world  The Fed is raising rates and plans to cut the balance sheet  Why no reaction     Barron s  
The market is broken and manipulated  Normal trading strategies do not work  Discussed and refuted by  
The move to passive investing has quashed volatility 
Lower volatility is a known coincident effect of bull markets  Nice analysis from The Fat Pitch

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Wade Slome s frank and accurate discussion of the   He cites a list of the regular flops   Schiff  Whitney  Mauldin  Roubini  Greenspan  and Merton and Scholes  Pedigree is not the test here for these  radical forecasters  
He has a great list of quotes on predictions  and this advice 

Rather than paying attention to crazy predictions by academics  economists  and strategists who in many cases have never invested a penny of outside investor money  ordinary investors would be better served by listening to steely investment veterans or proven prediction practitioners  

In the quote  he goes on to cite Billy Beane   not my idea of a market forecaster  but the concept is solid  There are experts  They do not always have precision forecasts  but it is often enough to provide an edge 
Finding the best experts is an important challenge

Nevertheless  I think it s only fair to offer some caution  Before an investor makes a buy  sell or hold decision on Amazon  they should at least consider whether the market will be willing to continue to overlook their lack of profitability  So far so good  caveat emptor

Final Thoughts
Much of the ongoing market discussion centers on a mystery  Why are stock prices higher than many think they should be 
The explanation has gone through many variants during the long bull market  The latest versions relate to market manipulation  low volatility  and ignoring the obvious geopolitical risks 
Perhaps the explanation is much simpler  I discussed this in a recent post on Occam s Razor and Valuation   for the full list of the ever changing excuses for failed valuation methods 
What should we consider instead 
Expected earnings are increasing nicely   now at a double digit pace  These have been better predictors than any of the oft cited bearish valuation methods 
The chance of a recession  the biggest historical threat to markets  remains very low 
The list of  geopolitical concerns and headwinds  does not translate into an impact on earnings 
And especially  Beware of those who twist good news into bad 
It is quite normal for financial stress to be low when times are good  Why expect high volatility  Good times eventually get worse  but good news is not itself an effective forecast of trouble 
Those who reason this way remind me of Chauncey Gardiner  the simple minded hero of one of the all time great movies    Everyone believes his  wisdom   derived entirely from television and gardening 
This might be the best summer investment movie  Few things could help the average investor more than recognizing the slogans and old news in the typical commentary ",2017-05-28,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-will-a-big-week-for-data-(finally)-bring-volati-200191798,200191798

Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc   SGMO   a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company yesterday reported their first quarter 2017 financial results  Sangamo reported a first quarter earnings loss of  0 23 per share which beat analyst expectations of a loss of  0 26 per share

 Our team continues to make significant operational progress across all four lead clinical programs  Three Phase 1 2 in vivo genome editing clinical trials are now screening subjects  and the fourth trial evaluating SB 525  a cDNA gene therapy approach for Hemophilia A  will open later this quarter   said Dr  Sandy Macrae  CEO of Sangamo   We are initiating multiple sites for each program over the next few months to ensure we can accrue patients rapidly into these studies  We remain on course and expect to announce data from each program late this year or in early 2018   

SGMO Technical Analysis
Sangamo Therapeutics Chart
SGMO opened trading yesterday at  4 30 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  4 40  SGMO closed trading yesterday at  4 35 and spiked up after market to  6 30  equivalent to a 45  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time SGMO traded above these levels we have to go back to August 3rd  2016 when it traded at  6 84 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up SGMO had already been in an overall upward trend dating back to December 28th when it traded at  2 90  SGMO has a float of 65 32 million shares and traded 1 81 times the normal daily trading volume on Wednesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see SGMO open trading on Thursday above  5 65 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

Higher realized prices also propelled U S  sales Ex U S  revenues declined 1  to  2 3 billion mainly due to lower volumes and realized prices  Higher volumes of newer products like Cyramza and Trulicity were offset by lower volumes of Zyprexa  Cymbalta and Alimta due to the loss of exclusivity  Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada  Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries Products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo  up 9  to  347 5 million   Humalog  up 17  to  708 4 million  and Strattera  up 4  to  196 2 million  Alimta sales  however

competitive pressure Jardiance sales  up 94  to  74 million  were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class  In Dec 2016  the FDA approved Jardiance for the CV indication

received a complete response letter  CRL  from the FDA regarding the new drug application  NDA  for baricitinib  The letter stated that the FDA is unable to approve the application in its present form  The agency has asked for additional data to determine the most appropriate doses and further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms  The investment community expects a delay in approval of the drug Lilly s Animal Health segment sales increased 2  to  769 4 million as higher sales of companion animal products offset the decline in food animal revenues  The inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica s U S  feline  canine and rabies vaccine boosted sales of companion animal products  However  global competitive pressure hurt sales of both food animal and companion animal revenues in the quarter Gross Margin   Operating Income RiseAdjusted gross margin of 78 1  in the quarter increased 180 basis points primarily driven by increased volume in

129782,351297,BIIB,5 Stocks To Watch Before The Market Opens Today,opinion,"Ford Motors  NYSE F   Donald Trump s public shaming of American automakers General Motors and Ford puts pressure on forward looking estimates for fiscal 2017  If automakers move operations back to the United States  that would cause a great deal of pressure on overall performance  As for the fourth quarters  Ford experienced strong sales volumes in major markets and a considerable upswing in emerging ones 
Sales in China reportedly grew 14  to 1 27 million units in 2016  making Asia the company s fastest growing sector  European sales came in about 6  higher to 1 25 million vehicles over the same time period  The combination of new product launches and low gas prices during 2016 helped boost sales volume  As gas prices start to rise sales of high margin SUVs and trucks will likely stagnate and thereby put pressure on profitability  Meanwhile a  3 billion pre tax loss related to employee benefits place additional constraints on the bottom line 
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Investors expect industrial stocks to lead the way under under the Trump administration  with names like Caterpillar poised to make the biggest move  But given Caterpillar s growing presence in international markets  Trump s potential protectionist policies would cause more harm than good  Despite better than expected results lately  Caterpillar effectively continues to deliver negative growth for 8 quarters and counting 
The strength of the dollar remains a near term threat that affects metal prices and mining operations  Meanwhile political risks in China and Europe put operations in those regions at risk of slowing down and thereby hurting sales  Ongoing initiatives to reduce costs and restructure helps offset any losses incurred in domestic or international markets 
JetBlue  NASDAQ JBLU   In a statement made in early 2017  JetBlue reported a 4 5  increase in traffic on a 3 1  capacity increase for the month of December  The figures pale in comparison to traffic results from November and October that came in 7 1  and 6 5  higher  respectively  Overall preliminary revenue per available seat mile for the three months fell by an average of 1 5   largely due to the negative impact of Hurricane Matthew in October  Investors can also expect compressed margins amid rising fuel and labor costs 
To offset some of the downturn  JetBlue turned its sights to expanding flight coverage and improving the customer experience  The airline recently decided to resume commercial flights to Havana and expand service to Bermuda  highlighting its new focus on international markets  Meanwhile  all flights will now include free Wi Fi access in addition to free streaming video service and 36 channels of DIRECTTV 
Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Financial performance continues to trend higher as Celgene makes a splash in the biotech industry  The company s core drugs and main growth drivers focus on treating cancer and inflammatory drugs  They include Revlimid  Pomalyst Imnovid and Abraxane  each of which continue to gain traction  Revlimid  in particular  is expected to deliver considerable improvement this quarter on consistent market share gains  Meanwhile the company intends to secure additional reimbursements internationally to boost drugs sales  Label expansion in markets like Japan and in the European Union will help edge higher 
Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Lowering drug prices falls under President Trump s list of actions he intends to take as a means to Make America Great  That poses a problem for companies like Biogen and Celgene that thrived in this hands off type of environment  If Trump can break ground on the issue it would likely come at the cost of margins and profitability 
Any reference to Trump or drug prices in Biogen s conference call could make a sizeable impact on forward estimates  For the fourth quarter though  performance will be driven by newer drugs like Zinbryta and legacy ones like Tecfidera  Ongoing restructuring initiatives  cost controls and headcount reduction put in place last year intend to lower operating expense and boost margins for the fourth quarters ",2017-01-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-tomorrow-200173626,200173626

129811,351326,BIIB,Biotech   Pharma ETFs To Suffer In 2017 Too ,opinion,"Be it Clinton or Trump  there seems to be no relief for biotech and pharma stocks and ETFs  Clinton s presidential candidature had hammered the sapce as she was vehemently against the price gouging issue in the pharma sector  read    
While the space got a break from controversies post Trump s win  albeit for a shorter period  it again succumbed to a fall on December 7 after he pledged to lower drug costs  iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  was off over 2 9  on December 7  SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals  NYSE XPH  ETF   HN XPH   lost over 2  

Inside Painful Past ofBiotech   Pharma ETFs
The space has been under trouble since September 2015 following Clinton s tweet about a 5 455  price hike  in about two months  of a drug called Daraprim  used to treat malaria and toxoplasmosis  This gigantic leap in pricing action was taken by a privately held biotech company Turing Pharmaceuticals  Later  EpiPen allergy shot maker Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV and Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  also suffered public outrage over the price gouging issue  read    
As a result  biotech and pharma ETFs were crushed on election uncertainty since Clinton s tweet in September 2015 with IBB and XPH losing about 22  and 32   respectively  as of December 7  2016   So far this year  as of December 7  2016   XPH is off 24 7  and IBB has retreated 21 3   respectively  triggering the question whether 2017 be another year of underperformance for the space 
Trump s Step Toward Lowering Drug Prices
The space had a short peaceful period post election only to be at gunpoint all over again as Trump announced that he will cut down prescription drug prices  As per an article published on    drug company executives and industry observers have already said that Trump may scrutinize their prices as a populist issue  
As per   Trump is in favor of reduced regulations and  prescription drugs are possibly the most regulated products in America   Trump also commented that  renegotiating Medicare prices would save  300 billion a year as the government is the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs   Plus  the possibility of a repeal of Obamacare in the Trump presidency may hurt drug companies 
Thanks to these uncertainties  most of the ETFs in the space were in the red  ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF   SI SBIO    SPDR S P Biotech  MX XBI  ETF  and Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF  lost in the range of 4  to 4 2   see  here  
What Lies Ahead 
Though it is too early to predict how harsh Trump will be to the sector  investors are likely to stay away from it for the coming few days  Investors should note that things are not too bad for the sector either as corporate tax reform and cash access may facilitate biotech stocks and ETFs in the Trump presidency 
In his campaign  Trump indicated that he will reduce corporate tax to 15  and provide a one time repatriation holiday of 10   This lower tax rate would do wonders for big biotech companies like Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  which can see EPS rising by about 10   as per an article published on  
Smaller cap biotech firms would be especially benefited as they are so cash stripped that their present cash holdings can fund just 11 months of research  as per Reuters  This new found source of cash would help several biotech companies to indulge in merger and acquisition activities  read    
Are There Any Healthcare ETF Survivors  
Amid all these upheavals  iShares U S  Medical Devices ETF   MT IHI    down just 0 2  on December 7  and SPDR S P Health Care Equipment  NYSE XHE  ETF   up 0 1  on December 7  have managed to stay afloat  IHI and XHE are up 7 4  and 11 2   respectively  so far this year  as of December 7  and may see relatively smooth trading ahead

129856,351371,BIIB,7 Drug Stocks To Consider As Biosimilars Pick Up Pace,opinion,"Interest in biosimilars has picked up considerably with Pfizer  Inc  s   NYSE PFE   announcement this week regarding its plans to launch a biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s blockbuster drug  Remicade  in late November What are Biosimilars 
A biosimilar is a biologic product whose approval is based on evidence that it is highly similar to an approved biologic  known as the reference product  Moreover  there should be no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference product where safety and effectiveness is concerned While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  they are a new entrant in the U S  where a regulatory pathway was implemented recently Sandoz  a Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   company  was the first to gain approval for and launch a biosimilar in the U S  The company launched Zarxio  filgrastim sndz   a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   Neupogen last year    The second biosimilar to gain approval in the U S  was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade This was followed by the FDA approval of biotech giant Amgen s Amjevita  adalimumab atto   Amjevita is approved for use in all eligible indications of the reference product  Humira  adalimumab   which is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases Biosimilars Set to Change the Competitive LandscapeThe market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative  Several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus will lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to new research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics earlier this year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the U S  through 2020 The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that currently have annual sales of  50 billion  About 30 companies are developing biosimilars of 16 molecules   most of the biosimilars in development are for reference products like Remicade  Enbrel  etanercept   Rituxan  rituximab  and Humira  adalimumab  What about Formulary Coverage Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  announced that biosimilars and follow on biologics will be a key part of its 2017 standard formulary strategy  replacing higher cost drugs within the categories  The company said that its formulary list will include Zarxio  replacing Neupogen  to decrease the risk of infection in patients receiving treatment for certain forms of cancer  and the follow on product Basaglar  replacing Lantus  for the treatment of diabetes Meanwhile  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  will be moving Basaglar from Tier 3 to Tier 1 effective Apr 1  2017  Basaglar is expected to enter the market in mid December  Sanofi s Lantus SoloStar and Lantus Vials will remain on Tier 3 until Mar 31  2017 after which they will be excluded  Zarxio will be on Tier 2  Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts said that the basal insulins category may be reassessed later in the year to reflect anticipated product launches Stocks to ConsiderWith biosimilars picking up pace  it makes sense to zero in on companies that are in the biosimilars business  Here is a mix of pharma  generic and biotech stocks that should benefit from the biosimilars opportunity especially given the current scenario of increased political  media and public pressure on drug pricing  the growing interest in developing biosimilars and the potential of biosimilars to reduce healthcare costs Sandoz  a Novartis company  has a strong presence in the biosimilars market being the first to launch a biosimilar  Omnitrope  in the EU way back in 2006  in Japan  Somatropin BS S C   2009  as well as in the U S   Zarxio  2015   Earlier this year  Sandoz announced that it will launch 5 biosimilars of major cancer and immunology biologics in key geographies by 2020  Some of the biosimilars that Sandoz is working on include biosimilar versions of Enbrel  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan   these biologics generated global sales of approximately  43 6 billion in 2015  Novartis is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock 
NOVARTIS AG ADR Price and Consensus   Pfizer also has a strong presence in the biosimilars market  The acquisition of Hospira significantly expanded Pfizer s biosimilar capabilities and gave the company access to Hospira s lucrative biosimilar portfolio of both marketed and pipeline assets  The company has three marketed products in Europe and several programs including four in late stage development  Rituxan  Humira  Herceptin  and Avastin   The Zacks Rank  3 stock will be launching Inflectra in late November and has decided to price it at a 15  discount to the current wholesaler acquisition cost of Remicade 
PFIZER INC Price and Consensus   Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   has an agreement with Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis for the development and commercialization of multiple biosimilar candidates in certain partnered territories  Earlier this year  Merck announced the filing of a Biologics License Application  BLA  for SB2  infliximab   a biosimilar version of Remicade  Moreover  Merck recently launched a website to provide clarity on and increase awareness about biosimilars  Merck is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see  
MERCK   CO INC Price and Consensus   Cambridge  MA based Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   is a biotech company with a focus in three areas   complex generics  biosimilars and novel drugs for autoimmune diseases  The most advanced biosimilars in the company s pipeline include M923  reference drug  Humira  and M834  reference drug  Orencia   The Zacks Rank  3 stock has a collaboration agreement with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of six biosimilar candidates including M834 
MOMENTA PHARMA Price and Consensus   Although Amgen itself is a major target of biosimilar competition  the company has been quick to recognize the commercial potential of the biosimilars market and has already made significant progress in this field with quite a few late stage biosimilar candidates in its pipeline  Last month  Amgen got FDA approval for its biosimilar version of AbbVie s multi billion dollar drug  Humira  The Zacks Rank  3 stock is developing biosimilar versions of Avastin  Herceptin  Rituxan  and Remicade as well

129857,351372,BIIB,Pharma Industry Outlook   November 2016,opinion,"It s been a rough year for pharma and biotech stocks with several factors weighing on the sector including media and political focus on the high price of drugs  mixed performance results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition 
The impact of these issues is more evident on biotech stocks  with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining 20 9  year to date  YTD  while the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has lost 10 9  YTD 
Drug Pricing to Remain in Focus
Right now  the biggest issue that is weighing on the sector is the political rhetoric regarding drug pricing With presidential candidates  policymakers  the media and the general public focusing on the high price tags for drugs  the drug pricing controversy is not likely to die down easily 
In fact  the drug pricing issue heated up recently given the price hikes taken by Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   MYL  for its life saving combination product EpiPen  Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced a health care plan that will address the excessive price hikes of treatments that have been around for years and also reaffirmed her earlier broader plan  announced in Sep 2015  with the aim to lower drug prices for all Americans 
Insulin drugmakers like Lilly  LLY  and Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  are also under attack with Senator Bernie Sanders posting a series of tweets questioning the prices of their insulin drugs 
Will M As Pick Up Pace 
With the major price correction resulting in reasonable valuations  expectations are high that more M A deals will be announced in the coming quarters  So far in 2016  some of the announced completed acquisitions include Shire Baxalta  Bristol Myers Padlock  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   PFE  Medivation  among others 
In fact  the Pfizer Medivation deal  valued at approximately  14 billion  has raised hopes that major M As will pick pace once elections are over while licensing deals and small bolt on acquisitions will continue 
Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals  with most of them finding it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash 
Divestment of Non Core Assets   Restructuring Activities
Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  UCB  Novartis  NVS   Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  More recently  Sanofi  PA SASY  is looking to divest its generics portfolio in Europe while Valeant is in discussions for various divestitures including the Salix business  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 
New Products Should Gain Traction 
Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  Some of the important new product approvals include Vertex s cystic fibrosis treatment  Orkambi  Amgen s  AMGN  heart failure treatment  Corlanor  Pfizer s cancer treatment  Ibrance  Novartis  psoriasis treatment  Cosentyx  PCSK9 inhibitors   Amgen s Repatha and Sanofi Regeneron s Praluent  Roche s advanced melanoma treatment  Cotellic and Gilead s Genvoya  HIV  
Meanwhile  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 19 new drugs including Zinplava  c  difficile infection   Lartruvo  soft tissue carcinoma   Exondys 51  Duchenne muscular dystrophy   Epclusa  HCV   Ocaliva  rare  chronic liver disease   Zinbryta  multiple sclerosis   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer   Venclexta  chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with a specific chromosomal abnormality   Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   Cinqair  severe asthma  and Zepatier  HCV  among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 
Biosimilars Gaining Importance
With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the U S   Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the U S 
The second biosimilar to gain approval in the U S  was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade 
This was followed by the FDA approval of biotech giant Amgen s Amjevita  adalimumab atto   Amjevita is approved for use in all eligible indications of the reference product  AbbVie  ABBV  Humira  adalimumab   which is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases 
And then there is Lillyand Boehringer Ingelheim s Basaglar  which while technically not approved as a biosimilar  is a  follow on  insulin glargine product approved through an abbreviated approval pathway    Basaglar was found to be sufficiently similar to Sanofi s Lantus to scientifically justify reliance  and to establish its safety and efficacy for the approved uses  Lilly and Boehringer expect to launch Basaglar in mid December while Pfizer will be launching Inflectra in late November 
Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen biosimilars alone represent potential savings of about  5 7 billion 
Apart from Novartis and Pfizer  companies like Merck  NYSE MRK   MRK   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market  Among these companies  Merck is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see

M As to Pick Pace 
The overall pharma industry has seen a lot of consolidation over the last few years  with quite a few deals being announced completed this year as well  With the major price correction resulting in reasonable valuations  we could see several M A agreements being announced in the coming quarters  though companies are wary of bidding wars leading to over priced deals

Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after  Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   immuno oncology  multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C virus  HCV  are in demand  Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after with quite a few deals being signed in these areas 
Innovative Pipelines

Among these  immuno oncology has been attracting a lot of interest as these therapies have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for cancer    they basically use the natural capability of the patient s own immune system to fight the cancer  Major players in this field include Bristol Myers  BMY   AstraZeneca  Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche 
Deals targeting immuno oncology are being inked by companies like Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Merck KGaA  Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca and Incyte  Companies like Kite and Juno are also advancing in this area  Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology

129878,351393,BIIB,6 Healthcare Stocks Investors Can t Miss In Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Controversies surrounding drug prices are again making it to the headlines  this time spurred by the EpiPen price hike issue  Generic drug maker Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  N V  drew flak from lawmakers for over pricing its epinephrine auto injector  EpiPen  severe allergic reactions  around the end of Aug 2016 Tweets  Deals   Biosimilars
The situation heated up after a tweet by Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  which read  EpiPens can be the difference between life and death  There s no justification for these price hikes   Clinton even proposed a health care plan to keep drug prices under control  protecting consumers from unreasonable price hikes and making drug makers accountable 
The issue came to the forefront last year  with drug makers like Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International  Inc  among others coming into the spotlight due to massive price hikes of their drugs  Last September  Clinton s  price gouging  tweet led to a major sell off in the healthcare sector  particularly the biotech space  cutting the bull run of health care stocks short 
On the bright side  mergers and acquisitions  and licensing and collaboration deals continued to impress investors  At present  the most talked about merger is that of German drug maker  Bayer AG  DE BAYGN  and U S  seed giant Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   Last month  after months of negotiations  Bayer finally announced that it has inked a definitive agreement to acquire Monsanto in an all cash deal worth  66 billion  Meanwhile  biotech company Horizon Pharma plc declared plans to take over California based Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp 
Further  in June  Shire plc acquired Baxalta to boost its rare disease and added key products to its hematology  oncology and immunology franchises  while Pfizer  NYSE PFE  purchased oncology focused company  Medivation  Inc   last month for approximately  14 billion 
Meanwhile  Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  announced a string of small bolt on acquisitions last month  The company will be acquiring clinical stage biotech company  Vitae Pharmaceuticals  Inc   to boost its dermatology pipeline  It has also inked a couple of acquisition deals with Tobira Therapeutics  Inc  and Akarna Therapeutics Ltd   targeting the non alcoholic steatohepatitis market 
While most partnerships between large cap and development stage companies were in the field of immuno oncology  other therapeutic areas like autoimmune  cardiovascular  central nervous system disorders also saw action  Mergers  acquisitions and licensing deals are expected to continue in the future as companies look to boost their pipeline and gain a competitive edge 
In addition  news of product approvals  label expansion of existing drugs and regular pipeline updates have been coming in quite often  lifting investor spirits significantly 
While last year  the FDA approved the first biosimilar  Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc  s  NASDAQ AMGN  blockbuster drug  Neupogen   September saw the regulatory approval of Amgen s Amjevita  adalimumab atto   a biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV   s Humira 
In this context  it is important to note that biosimilars are being touted as the next big thing in the healthcare sector

129906,351421,BIIB,Perrigo Up As Starboard Reveals Stake  Changes Proposed,opinion,"Perrigo Company plc s   NYSE PRGO   shares gained 7 4  after the New York based activist investor  Starboard Value LP  revealed in a letter its 4 6  stake in the company  making it one of Perrigo s largest shareholders 
In a letter dated Sep 12  2016  Starboard Managing Member  Jeffrey C  Smith  urged the Chief Executive Officer of Perrigo  John Hendrickson  and its board of directors to consider improving the company s poor operating and financial performance 
Smith mentioned that Perrigo undertook several operational and financial  missteps  last year  which has led to a decline in the company s valuation  Smith pointed out that Perrigo went to great extent  using unrealistic forecasts to reject an unsolicited takeover offer from Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   last year 
Also  the management and board spent more than  100 million in advisor fees in order to defend their move  Smith added that  had the offer been accepted  it would have sent Perrigo  shares above 88  than its current stock price 
Starboard said that not only has Perrigo failed to deliver what it promised after rejecting Mylan s offer  but also the Mar 2015 Omega Pharma acquisition  which created Branded Consumer Healthcare BCH business  has been grossly mismanaged  Further  the company has committed numerous execution errors and considerably lowered its financial guidance on the past two earnings calls 
However  Starboard believes Perrigo holds a strong franchise with valuable assets and significant opportunities to unlock shareholders value 
Starboard believes that the combination of Perrigo s core Consumer Healthcare business and the BCH business offer the company with a unique global over the counter  OTC  market position  However  Perrigo owns quite a few non core assets  Starboard believes that there exist limited synergies between Prescription Pharmaceuticals  Rx Pharmaceuticals  business and the core OTC businesses 
Moreover  Perrigo  which receives royalties on global sales of Biogen Inc  s   NASDAQ BIIB   multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  should consider divestment or explore other broader strategic alternatives including its Rx Pharmaceuticals business 
PERRIGO CO PLC Price   We remind investors that while announcing second quarter 2016 results  Perrigo had lowered its 2016 earnings outlook  The company expects earnings in the range of  6 85 to  7 15 per share  previously guided within that of  8 20 to  8 60  The cut in the earnings guidance was due to continued price erosion and changing market dynamics in the Rx business  in addition to lower expectations from BCH business 
Perrigo in its press release said that it will evaluate the letter and engage in talk with Starboard 
Perrigo is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock  Geron Corporation   NASDAQ GERN   is a better ranked stock in the health care sector  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  You can see

Below we list a few stocks that are expected to conclude the earnings season with a positive surprise Asterias Biotherapeutics  Inc     currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  42 11   This biotechnology company is presently developing proprietary cell therapy programs that are based on its immunotherapy and pluripotent stem cell platform technologies  Immunotherapy is a key area of focus in the medical sector and Asterias  pipeline looks interesting at this juncture  The company s pipeline candidates include AST OPC1  oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  currently in a phase I IIa dose escalation clinical study for spinal cord injury   Another candidate  AST VAC1  antigen presenting autologous dendritic cells   showed positive results for a phase II study in acute myelogenous leukemia  AML   The third candidate  AST VAC2  antigen presenting allogeneic dendritic cells   represents a second generation  allogeneic immunotherapy  phase I II clinical trial of AST VAC2 in non small cell lung cancer slated to start in 2017   We expect investor focus on pipeline updates when the company releases second quarter results on Aug 15 Bio Blast Pharma Ltd     is a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification  licensing  acquisition  development and commercialization of drugs for rare and ultra rare genetic diseases  Such diseases generally have few or no treatments available  thereby underscoring the need for new ones  The company has developed and in licensed potential treatments for a range of diseases  At present  the company has several drug candidates in clinical or preclinical development targeting neuromuscular central nervous system  CNS  and mitochondrial diseases  Bio Blast is expected to release second quarter results on Aug 19  With an impressive track record  a Zacks rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  22 22   we are hopeful of an earnings beat this quarter Evoke Pharma  Inc     currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of  4 65   This specialty pharmaceutical company focuses on treatments for gastrointestinal  GI  diseases  The company is currently developing EVK 001  a metoclopramide nasal spray  for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent gastroparesis in women with diabetes mellitus  The spray formulation is designed to provide systemic delivery of metoclopramide through nasal administration  The company s track record is mixed  having beaten estimates in three of the four quarters and missing the same once  Nevertheless  a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us positive about an earnings beat this quarter  Evoke is scheduled to release second quarter results on Aug 15 Bottom Line  

Although obstacles remain in the form of biosimilars and currency headwinds  investors would do well to keep an eye on these potential outperformers given their solid Zacks Rank and positive Zacks Earnings ESP

Biotech Stock Roundup  AbbVie Tries to Block Humira Copycat

	Several small and mid sized as well as big biotech companies like Regeneron    and BioMarin     reported second quarter results last week  Meanwhile  among other major updates  AbbVie    filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgen     Amgen is seeking FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Humira 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
	1  First a look at earnings results of companies like BioMarin and Regeneron  BioMarin once again reported better than expected results and raised its revenue guidance with both Kuvan and Vimizim performing well  Read more      Regeneron s earnings also surpassed expectations with Eylea continuing to perform well  Read more     
	2  Biogen s    partner Eisai said that their experimental treatment for early Alzheimer s disease  BACE inhibitor E2609  has got the green signal from the FDA for advancement into phase III studies  Biogen also announced the name of the new hemophilia focused company that will be created through the spin off of the company s hemophilia franchise currently comprising marketed products like Eloctate and Alprolix  The company will be named Bioverativ and will trade under the symbol BIVV on the NASDAQ Stock Market  The spin off is scheduled to be completed early next year

	4  AbbVie has initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgen to protect its flagship product  Humira  from biosimilar competition  The move was largely expected considering Humira accounts for a major part of AbbVie s sales  61 4  of total sales in 2015  and the earlier than expected entry of biosimilars would have a huge impact on the company s financials  Amgen s biosimilar version got the support of an FDA advisory panel  A final decision regarding the approval status of the product is expected by Sep 25  2016

AstraZeneca shares have rallied from the mid June lows  erasing most of the stock s earlier underperformance  The Pound weakness following the Brexit vote has been helpful to this London based pharma giant  The company has also benefited from the failure of Bristol Myers  cancer drug  which has put the spotlight on its candidates in that space  These immediate catalysts aside  the analyst likes AstraZeneca s strong diversified portfolio  expanding presence in emerging markets  ongoing cost cutting initiatives and robust pipeline   You can  
Caterpillar shares have been strong performers this year  up more than 22  year to date on hopes that the worst was behind this beleagured mining and construction equipment maker  Caterpillar s earnings picture continues to remain challenged  as the 22  drop in Q2 earnings shows  This tough operating environment has forced management to squeeze more expenses out of the operation  The analyst also points to the improving construction sector as a potential offset to the weak mining sector   You can

129948,351463,BIIB,4 Biotech Stocks Poised To Surprise This Earnings Season,opinion,"Despite the lackluster start to the year  things are now looking up as we stand in the thick of the Q2 earnings season  A majority of the companies that have reported so far fared better than expectations  giving investors something to cheer for 
Amid a challenging macro backdrop  the healthcare sector has been choppy since the beginning of 2016  continuing the volatile streak from the second half of 2015  The biotech sector also took a beating in the second half of 2015 due to pricing issues  The NYSE ARCA Biotech Index   BTK  and NASDAQ Biotechnology Index   NBI  have declined 7 1  and 10 1   respectively  so far this year 
Notwithstanding the decline  things appear far better now than they did a quarter ago for the biotech sector  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc     topped both earnings and revenues expectations  while Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD     beat on earnings but missed on revenues  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN     and AbbVie  Inc     also managed to top both earnings and sales expectations and lifted their view 
Meanwhile  M A and licensing deals should continue to take center stage in the sector  In Jun 2016  Shire plc    acquired Baxalta to further strengthen its rare disease portfolio  Aegerion Pharmaceuticals    and QLT Inc     entered into a definitive merger agreement in Jun 2016 to form a new company  Novelion Therapeutics Inc   while Swiss major Novartis    is reportedly looking to buy AstraZeneca     as per Reuters 
On the other hand  new product approvals  along with label expansion of existing drugs and regular pipeline updates related to key drugs  should keep investors  attention glued to the sector 
Given the strong fundamentals  healthy pipelines and the drive to find innovative treatments for rare diseases  the biotech space promises bountiful opportunities for investors  Here we help you to identify some companies in the biotech sector that have the potential to beat earnings in their upcoming releases  These stocks are well positioned in today s market environment  and could see considerable upside riding on the aforementioned trends  An earnings beat should help these stocks gain investor confidence and show a favorable price movement How to Pick 
Given a large number of industry participants  pinpointing stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting  But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple  One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive Earnings ESP  
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  
Below are four biotech stocks we believe are best positioned to stand out in the ongoing earnings season 
Cambridge  MA based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals     carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has an Earnings ESP of  13 30   This commercial stage biotechnology company is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments primarily addressing gastrointestinal diseases 
The company s lead drug  Linzess  is indicated for patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation or chronic idiopathic constipation  The company is working to boost Linzess sales  which should aid its own performance  Ironwood is scheduled to report second quarter results on Aug 4  Although it has a mixed track record  having beaten estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the same in the other two  the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable rank indicates a likely earnings beat this quarter 
San Rafael  CA based BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc     carries a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 00   The company is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 4  The company has five approved products in its portfolio   Vimizim  Naglazyme  Kuvan  Aldurazyme and Firdapse  BioMarin s track record has been decent so far  with the company beating estimates in three out of the last four quarters  A consistently strong performance of Vimzim should enable the company to beat estimates this quarter 
Another stock that appears poised to beat earnings this quarter is Wilmington  DE based Incyte Corporation     a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics  The company s approved drug  Jakafi  is approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis and patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea 
In Jun 2016  Incyte entered into a share purchase agreement with Ariad Pharmaceuticals    whereby it gained the latter s European business as well as the rights to its leukemia drug  Iclusig  in the EU and 22 other countries  The deal has expanded Incyte s footprint in Europe  Moreover  the company has an impressive track record with a trailing four quarter average positive surprise of 101 83   Incyte s current Zacks Rank  2 and Earnings ESP of  300 00  indicate a likely earnings beat this quarter  The company will report results on Aug 9 
Acceleron Pharma Inc      a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  is scheduled to report second quarter results on Aug 4  The company is focused on the discovery and development of novel therapeutic candidates that engage the body s ability to rebuild and repair its own cells and tissues  Its pipeline comprises luspatercept  sotatercept  dalantercept and ACE 083  The company has a mixed track record but its current Zacks Rank  3 and a positive Earnings ESP of  7 41  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter Bottom Line  

Although obstacles remain in the form of biosimilars and currency headwinds  investors would do well to keep an eye on these potential outperformers given their solid Zacks Rank and positive Zacks Earnings ESP

Notwithstanding this  modest improvement   growth still remains elusive and Q2 is headed to be the fifth quarter in a row to record an earnings decline for the S P 500 index

129951,351466,BIIB,Exelixis  EXEL  Posts Narrower Loss In Q2  Beats On Revenues,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ EXEL   posted a second quarter 2016 loss of 16 cents  narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents and the year ago loss of 22 cents 

Net revenue came in at  36 2 million  up from  8 0 million  which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 6 million 
Quarter in Detail
Exelixis  lead drug  Cometriq  is approved for the treatment of progressive  metastatic medullary thyroid cancer 
Of the total revenue   31 6 million came from product sales  Cabozantinib is marketed in the capsule form as Cometriq for progressive  metastatic MTC  Exelixis was evaluating a tablet formulation of cabozantinib  distinct from the capsule form  for advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  in the METEOR trial  The company received a significant boost in Apr 2016  when the FDA approved its tablet formulation under the brand name  Cabometyx  for the treatment of RCC in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy 
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses decreased 6 2  to  23 million due to lower clinical trial costs and allocation of general corporate costs  Selling  general and administrative expenses jumped to  35 8 million from  12 8 million due to higher personnel related expenses resulting from an increase in headcount  which in turn  was due to sales force expansion in the U S  for supporting the launch of Cabometyx 
Pipeline Update
The European Medicines Agency  EMA  has accepted a Marketing Authorisation Application  MAA  for Cabometyx for review for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  targeted therapy  The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has given a positive opinion on an approval of Cabometyx 
In May 2016  the company announced that an independent randomized phase II trial  CABOSUN  on cabozantinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC  met its primary endpoint  The trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival  compared with sunitinib  in patients with advanced intermediate  or poor risk RCC  Consequently  Exelixis is discussing the results with regulatory authorities and evaluating further actions in the development and submission strategy for cabozantinib as a first line treatment for patients with advanced RCC 
We remind investors that Exelixis has an exclusive licensing agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib  Per the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will enjoy exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future indications of the drug outside the U S   Canada and Japan  The companies will jointly work for the development of cabozantinib in the current and future potential indications 
Meanwhile  Exelixis is evaluating cabozantinib in the CELESTIAL trial for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  The company anticipates top line results from the study in 2017 
Exelixis is also working with partner Roche Holding   OTC RHHBY   to commercialize Cotellic  the other drug in its portfolio  in the U S  We note the drug was approved in the U S  in Nov 2015 for the treatment for patients with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive advanced melanoma  in combination with Zelboraf  In Jun 2016  Roche initiated a phase III trial  COTEZO  on a combination of Cotellic and atezolizumab in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer 
2016 Guidance Updated
Exelixis expects operating expenses of around  250  270 million  This includes about  30 million of incremental  non cash  stock based compensation expenses EXELIXIS INC Price and Consensus 
   Our Take
Exelixis  second quarter results were impressive with the company reporting a narrower than expected loss and beating on revenues  Further  the FDA approval of Cabometyx is a major boost for the company  It is currently focused on launching Cabometyx tablets as a treatment for patients with advanced RCC  Initial uptake of the drug was encouraging and will propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters 
The successful commercialization of Cotellic in the U S  will also boost the top line  However  expenses are expected to increase as the company focuses on commercializing Cabometyx in the U S 
Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A couple of better ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Actelion Ltd   OTC ALIOF   and Biogen  Inc    NASDAQ BIIB    Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelixis-(exel)-posts-narrower-loss-in-q2,-beats-on-revenues-200146160",200146160

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Best PEG Stocks for Lucrative Value Investing 

Value investors with varied risk appetite are most unlikely to hit upon the price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio as an investment option among a number of other popular metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales or price book value  P B   This is because they often find this ratio complicated considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock 

But  in a year full of volatility  it is pointless to ponder on methods which don t consider a stock s future growth rate while calculating its intrinsic merit  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B are most commonly used to single out whether a stock is trading at a discount 

But will a discount based on these multiples ensure success  What if there is a dearth of catalysts to propel growth even though the stock is at a discount right now  In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio 

The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth Rate

A lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors 

While P E fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock 

There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 

Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration 

Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy 

PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median

 P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median 
	 For more accurate valuation purpose  

Zacks Rank of 1 Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have a proven history of success  

Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  

Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

Here are 5 of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening 

AngloGold Ashanti Ltd        This gold mining and exploration company currently carries a Zacks Rank  1 and a Value Style Score  B   The company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 27 6  

Biogen Inc        This popular name in the biopharma market works on innovative therapies in the field of serious neurological  autoimmune  and rare diseases  The company can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score  B   Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 10 2  

QUALCOMM Inc        QUALCOMM is a digital communications products and services company with business spread out in China  South Korea  Taiwan  and the U S  This Zacks Rank  2 and Value Style Score  B  company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 10 8  

Tallgrass Energy GP  LP      This provider of crude oil transportation to customers in Wyoming and Colorado can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank  1 and Value Style Score  A  

Steel Dynamics Inc        This manufacturer and seller of steel products in the U S  holds a Zacks Rank  2 and a Value Style Score  A   The company has delivered an earnings surprise of 3 57  in its last reported quarter with a trailing 12 month earnings beat of 12 29

129956,351471,BIIB,Merrimack  MACK  Q2 Loss Wider Than Expected  Sales Top ,opinion,"Merrimack Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ MACK   reported a loss of 40 cents per share in the second quarter of 2016  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents 

Quarter in Detail
Total revenue came in at  33 7 million  up from  21 3 million reported last quarter  and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  26 1 million 
In Oct 2015  Merrimack Pharma s first product  Onivyde  gained approval in the U S   in combination with fluorouracil  5 FU  and leucovorin  for the treatment of patients suffering from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  who were previously treated with Gemzar based therapy  The drug was subsequently launched in the U S  on Oct 26 
Further  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  of the European Medicines Agency  EMA  has given a positive opinion on the approval of Onivyde 
Onivyde sales in the reported quarter amounted to  12 9 million  up 29  sequentially  We note that the drug was added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  NCCN  2016 Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology as a category I Treatment Option for patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have previously been treated with Gemzar based therapy 
Merrimack Pharma earned collaboration revenues of  19 3 million  up 70 9  sequentially 
Research and development expenses were  41 million  up 24 7   General and administrative expenses were also up 16 2  to  20 7 million 
 
 MERRIMACK PHAR Price and EPS Surprise
   Pipeline Update
Currently  Merrimack Pharma is evaluating Onivyde in a phase II study for previously untreated front line metastatic pancreatic cancer  Data from the phase II study are expected in 2017 
The company also initiated a phase I study on MM 151  in combination with Onivyde plus 5 FU and leucovorin  in patients with RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer as well as a phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MM 151  in combination with seribantumab  in patients with heregulin positive tumors  Apart from these studies  the company also commenced a trial on MM 151  in combination with MM 141  in patients with IGF 1 positive tumors  and in combination with a MEK inhibitor  trametinib  in patients with KRAS NRAS mutant tumors 
A phase II study  HERMIONE  on MM 302 for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is ongoing and results are expected in 2017  The trial is designed to support a potential accelerated approval application to the FDA  In addition  a phase II trial on MM 141 for the treatment of patients with front line metastatic pancreatic cancer who have high serum levels of free IGF 1 is also ongoing and results are expected in 2018 
Outlook
The company anticipates research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the range of  243 5 million to  263 5 million in 2016  compared with its earlier projection of  263 5  283 5 million 
Our Take
Merrimack Pharma reported a wider than expected loss in the second quarter as expenses continued to increase  Nevertheless  uptake of Onivyde has been strong and should boost the top line  going forward  Inclusion of the drug in the NCCN pathway should prove to be a big boost for the company and accelerate patient access to the drug 
Merrimack Pharma carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Actelion Ltd    OTC ALIOF    Agenus Inc   and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc    All the three stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2016-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/merrimack-(mack)-q2-loss-wider-than-expected,-sales-top-200146440",200146440

	Biogen s second quarter results were impressive with the company surpassing earnings expectations by a huge margin  The stock  which has been under pressure on concerns regarding a slowdown in Tecfidera s growth rate as well as overall concerns regarding pricing in the biotech sector  saw its MS franchise recording a sequential improvement in performance  Investors should be cheered by this in addition to the raised outlook  The hemophilia franchise also performed well

130027,351542,BIIB,Medical Stocks Reporting Early Next Week   GILD  LLY   More ,opinion,"Q2 earnings season is gaining momentum with 103  as of Jul 21  of the S P 500 members having already reported results  With 56 3  of these members beating top line estimates and 68 9  surpassing bottom line expectations  
Admittedly  there are some signs of improvement in the aggregate earnings picture that are expected to lift hopes for the second half and thereafter  The quarterly results of some big names across sectors were not only better than expected  but also showed signs of real momentum  That said  earnings are headed south for the fifth quarter in a row  As the rest report Q2 results over the coming weeks  visibility should improve 
Notably  the Medical sector  which was among the best performing sectors in Q1  is again touted to feature on the best performers  list  The Medical sector is expected to be one of the seven sectors to record earnings growth in Q2  Earnings in the Medical sector are expected to grow 1 7  on revenue growth of 7 7   per our  article 
This fact cannot be refuted  Healthcare bellwether Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   kick started the season by posting a beat on both earnings and revenues  Moreover  the company has raised its earnings outlook for the year yet again  Among biotechs  Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   is the only major company to have released Q2 results  Biogen like Johnson   Johnson not only managed to beat earnings estimates by a wide margin  but also upped its guidance for the year 
Meanwhile  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   and Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   also posted encouraging results  beating on both fronts 
A number of pharma and biotech companies are yet to report Q2 results  Let s see what awaits these four medical stocks when they report earnings results early next week 
What to Expect from these Medical Stocks 
Biotech company  Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   known for its presence in the hepatitis C virus  HCV  market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs  Sovaldi and Harvoni  has a pretty good track record with beats in three of the last four quarters  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  which has a positive  of 6 91   looks set to beat estimates in Q2  Focus will be on the performance of the HCV and HIV franchises given that the company has gained quite a few promising approvals over the last few quarters with an eye also on deals acquisitions  Moreover  Gilead s share buyback program should boost the bottom line  read more    
Gilead is scheduled to report Q2 results on Jul 25  after the market closes GILEAD SCIENCES Price and EPS Surprise   Another healthcare company looking up this earnings season is Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY    The combination of Lilly s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and  1 18  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season  Lilly is set to report Q2 results on Jul 26  before the market opens  Lilly has an impressive track record when it comes to earnings  The company s earnings have surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters 
Though existing products like Trajenta and Forteo as well as new products like Cyramza and Portrazza among others should boost top line growth  there are challenges in the form of generic competition faced by drugs like Alimta and Cialis in certain territories as well as competition from immuno oncology agents  Moreover  price revisions in Japan  effective Mar 1  will impact sales  Focus should be on the performance of recently launched moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treatment  Taltz  among other things  read more    LILLY ELI   CO Price and EPS Surprise   Pharmacy benefit manager  Express Scripts Holding Company s   NASDAQ ESRX   Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of the ESP  However  it has a 0 00  ESP  which makes it difficult to predict an earnings beat when it reports its Q2 results on Jul 25  after the market closes  Express Scripts  track record has however been decent with the company having comfortably beaten expectations in three of the last four quarters 
For the second quarter  Express Scripts expects earnings in the range of  1 55  1 59 per share while adjusted claims are anticipated to be 312 million to 322 million  The company should continue to benefit from increased generic utilization  a shift toward mail orders  strong specialty growth and an aging population  Focus will remain on the status of Express Scripts  contract with Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM    read more    EXPRESS SCRIPTS Price and EPS Surprise   Chemed Corporation   NYSE CHE   purchases  operates and divests subsidiaries engaged in diverse business activities  Currently  the company operates through two wholly owned subsidiaries  VITAS Healthcare and Roto Rooter  This Cincinnati  OH based company has delivered encouraging performance in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 2 70   However  the company s Zacks Rank  3 with an ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult this quarter

130028,351543,BIIB,Pharma Industry Outlook  Fundamentals Remain Strong,opinion,"It s been a rough start to the year for pharma and biotech with several factors weighing on the sector including media and political focus on the high price of drugs  mixed first quarter results  slower than expected new product launches  and increasing competition  Macroeconomic factors have also been playing a role in the sector s performance 
The impact of these issues is more prominent in biotech stocks with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining 14 5  year to date  YTD  
However  the sector s fundamentals remain strong and mergers and acquisitions  M As   product approvals and positive data flow should act as catalysts 
M As to Pick Pace 
With the major price correction that has resulted in reasonable valuations  we could see several M A agreements being announced as the year progresses  So far in 2016  some of the announced completed acquisitions include Shire Baxalta  Bristol Myers  BMY  Padlock  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   PFE  Anacor among others  Currently  Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  is looking to acquire cancer focused Medivation   we expect a bidding war as Medivation has signed confidentiality agreements with many firms including Sanofi 
Meanwhile  small bolt on acquisitions will continue  In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time 
Small biotech companies are open to such deals with most of them finding it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash 
We recommend biotech stocks that have attractive pipeline candidates or technology that can be used for the development of novel therapeutics  Therapeutic areas attracting a lot of interest include central nervous system disorders  hepatitis C virus  HCV  and immunology inflammation 
Another highly lucrative area is immuno oncology as these therapies have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for cancer    they basically use the natural capability of the patient s own immune system to fight the cancer  Major players in this field include Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca  Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche 
Deals targeting immuno oncology are being inked by companies like Pfizer  Merck KGaA  Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca and Incyte  Companies like Kite are also advancing in this area 
Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  UCB  Novartis  Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile  
New Products Should Gain Traction in 2H16
Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  Some of the important new product approvals include Vertex s cystic fibrosis treatment  Orkambi  Amgen s  AMGN  heart failure treatment  Corlanor  Pfizer s cancer treatment  Ibrance  Novartis  psoriasis treatment  Cosentyx  PCSK9 inhibitors   Amgen s Repatha and Sanofi Regeneron s Praluent  Roche s advanced melanoma treatment  Cotellic and Gilead s Genvoya  HIV  
Meanwhile  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 15 new drugs including Epclusa  HCV  Ocaliva  rare  chronic liver disease   Zinbryta  multiple sclerosis   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer   Venclexta  chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with a specific chromosomal abnormality   Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   Cinqair  severe asthma  and Zepatier  HCV  among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 
Biosimilars Gaining Importance
With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the U S   Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the U S 
Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen biosimilars alone represent potential savings of about  5 7 billion 
Apart from Novartis  companies like Merck  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Pfizer  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   BIIB  and Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market 
Drug Pricing to Remain in Focus 
With Presidential candidates  policymakers  the media and the general public focusing on the high price tags for drugs  the drug pricing issue is not likely to die down easily at least not until elections are over 
According to the Oct 2015 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  affordability of prescription drugs remains at the top of the public s priority list for the President and Congress   focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices 
So  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market 
Earnings Trends
Looking at consensus earnings expectations  the Medical sector  which had performed well in 1Q16  is expected to see earnings growth of 1 7  and revenue growth of 7 7  in Q2  While results will continue to be affected by currency movement  new products should start contributing significantly and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  Performance should improve as the year progresses 
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  large cap pharma  med biomed gene  med drugs and med generic drugs 
We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 
As a point of reference  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative  
The Zacks Industry Rank for large cap pharma is  74   32 for med generic drugs   85 for med biomed gene and  89 for med drugs  Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments  it is obvious that the outlook is Positive for large cap pharma  med generic drugs and med biomed gene while Neutral for med drugs 
OPPORTUNITIES
While negative currency impact and pricing pressure remain headwinds  many companies which are out of the worst of the genericization phase  should continue to see a sustained improvement in results this year  Cost cutting  share buybacks  and new products should support growth 
Among pharma stocks  companies like Bristol Myers is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock while Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock 
In the biotech space  we are positive on Gilead  Incyte and AVEO   all are Zacks Rank  2 stocks  Within the generic segment  Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Allergan  Mallinckrodt  NYSE MNK  and Supernus are Zacks Rank  2 stocks 
WEAKNESSES
We recommend avoiding names that offer little growth or opportunity for a take out  These include companies which are developing drugs that are likely to face regulatory hurdles 
Pharma companies that currently carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  include Sanofi and Glaxo  Among biotech stocks  companies like Medivation and Lexicon are Zacks Rank  5 stocks  and others like Juno  JUNO  and Epizyme are Zacks Rank  4 stocks ",2016-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pharma-industry-outlook:-fundamentals-remain-strong-200143855,200143855

130061,351576,BIIB,4 Stocks That Crushed The Biotechnology ETF  IBB  This Week,opinion,"Although biotech has been a strong area of the market for quite some time  the past year has been a brutal stretch for this segment  In fact  the top biotechnology ETF    has seen a loss of roughly 25 5  in the past 52 weeks  making for a massive underperformance when compared to the broad markets in the same time frame 

And while there has been a bit of a comeback lately  the last few trading days have certainly put an end to that  as IBB has lost nearly five percent in the past five trading sessions 

But which stocks in particular have been driving this horrendous return as of late for this popular ETF  The following stocks are definitely the culprits as they have all lost more than the overall ETF with several slumping more than 10  in the time frame  Let s take a quick look at a few of the biggest contributors to IBB s underperformance as of late below 

Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB    

Biogen shares have been in trouble lately thanks to a weak report on its MS drug results  The Phase 2 trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints and shares of BIIB plunged as a result  see   



The stock remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   while it has a VGM Score of  A   so fundamentals are still looking promising for this stock despite the recent drop 

Alexion Pharma   

More poor drug trial news to report back on  as ALXN suffered from a Phrase III letdown in its Soliris drug  as this missed its primary efficacy endpoint  Shares sold off significantly as a result of this release  and it is especially disappointing since it comes in Phase III  see    



The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  4  sell  while it has Value and Growth Style Scores of  D  so there are definitely better prospects out there in the biotechnology world right now 

BioMarin Pharma   

And BioMarin struggled as its main competitor in the Muscular Dystrophy market  Sarepta     saw some somewhat promising news from the FDA  This hope for SRPT along with BioMarin s woes in the space  lead many investors to continue their exodus out of BMRN shares which was to IBB investors  detriment yet again  see    



This stock is also a Zacks Rank  3  hold   but the quarterly Earnings ESP is plunging  coming in at  13 5   This suggests that the most recent estimates have been pretty weak for BMRN and that a downgrade may be on the horizon if this trend continues 

Regeneron   

This was a bit of a surprise addition to the list of biggest losers on the week  as REGN actually reported positive results from a Phase III trial  However  the perception of the broader space has swung negative and REGN was unable to escape the downturn  falling more than 7  on the week  See  for more info  



Arguably shares had run up a bit too high in the preceding month and this was just a bit of a snap back to reality  Still  this remains a decent choice in the space thanks to solid EPS growth projections and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   And unlike others on the list  it has been seeing some relatively positive news lately 

Bottom Line

The four components listed above make up roughly one fifth of the total exposure in IBB so they are bound to have a big impact on its overall performance  Investors in IBB will definitely need to see a turnaround here before the fund can make a comeback  and return to its storied past 



However  you could easily argue that the boom is starting to fade in the biotech sector  and especially so given the coming political headwinds for the space  Given that  it may be time to look to other  for now  at least until the firestorm dies down in this often volatile corner of the stock market

130062,351577,BIIB,5 Attractive Biotechnology Stocks For Healthy Long Term Returns ,opinion,"Introduction
I am a fervent believer that investors are best served by investing towards a specific investment objective that suits their own unique goals  objectives and risk tolerance  In other words  investing is not always trying to get the highest possible total returns  If that were true  no one would have ever invested in bonds  CDs or other fixed income instruments 
Personally  my primary current investment objective is focused on achieving a reliable and growing dividend income stream  That doesn t mean that I don t expect capital appreciation to go along with my dividends  because I do  However  capital appreciation is secondary to what I need right now  Therefore  I am content to allow it to happen over the long run  This means being willing to accept the ups and downs of short term market volatility that is sure to occur  as long as my dividend income keeps increasing 
On the other hand  I also have discretionary assets that I can invest in or utilize outside of my core portfolio  So even though I favor dependable dividend paying stocks  I still am attracted to examining exciting growth investments with money I am both willing to and can afford to lose  However  even though I m willing to lose with these discretionary assets  I don t expect to  Instead  my objective is to generate significantly higher total returns than my prudent dividend growth portfolio is realistically capable of achieving 
More simply stated  I still appreciate powerful and exciting growth stocks because I understand they are capable of generating significantly higher returns  However  I am also cognizant of the fact that the risk associated with achieving those returns is also significantly higher  Consequently  I am just as adamantly  or even more so  focused on valuation when investing in growth stocks as I am with prudent blue chip dividend paying stocks 
One of the most difficult things for the value oriented investor to accept and embrace is the reality that the best value comes from stocks that are temporarily out of favor  In this regard  the value investor must also recognize that hitting the perfect bottom can only be accomplished with luck  Therefore  the intelligent value investor is willing to assume some short term pain in order to achieve long term gain 
The biotechnology sector contains many exciting growth stocks  But most importantly  as it relates to this article  the sector has recently been out of favor  which I believe has created bargain investment opportunities  Consequently  I offer the following 5 biotechnology stocks as attractive looking research candidates primarily for growth or long term total return  However  2 of these 5 biotech stocks offer attractive dividends in conjunction with above average growth and attractive value 
3 Research Worthy Biotechnology Growth Stock Candidates
These first 3 biotechnology research candidates are offered as pure growth stocks  None of them pay a dividend  and I don t expect any of them to initiate one anytime soon  However  I believe all 3 appeared attractive relative to their long term growth potential 
On each candidate  I present a short business description courtesy of S P Capital IQ  followed by a series of  and FUN Graphs highlighting some important fundamental metrics  Importantly  what I am presenting here is the recommendation that these stocks are worthy of further scrutiny if growth for high total return is your objective 
Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB 

 Biogen Inc  discovers  develops  manufactures  and delivers therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases  hematologic conditions  and autoimmune disorders  It offers TECFIDERA  AVONEX  and PLEGRIDY to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis  MS   TYSABRI to treat relapsing forms of MS and Crohn s disease  and FAMPYRA to improve walking ability for patients with MS 
The company also provides ELOCTATE to treat adults and children with hemophilia A for control of bleeding episodes  ALPROLIX to treat adults and children with hemophilia B for control of bleeding episodes  RITUXAN for treating non Hodgkin s lymphoma  rheumatoid arthritis  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL   as well as two forms of ANCA associated vasculitis  GAZYVA for the treatment of patients with previously untreated CLL  and FUMADERM to treat plaque psoriasis 
The company s products in Phase III development stage comprise ZINBRYTA  a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS  Aducanumab for Alzheimer s disease  and ISIS SMNRx for spinal muscular atrophy  Its Phase II clinical trial products include Anti LINGO for optic neuritis and MS  Amiselimod for multiple autoimmune indications  BAN2401 and E2609 for Alzheimer s disease  Raxatrigine for trigeminal neuralgia  rAAV XLRS for X linked juvenile retinoschisis  and BG00011 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  Its Phase I clinical trial products comprise Dapirolizumab pegol for systemic lupus erythematosus  SLE   ISIS   DMPK for myotonic dystrophy  Anti BDCA2 for SLE  Anti alpha synuclein for Parkinson s disease  and BIIB063 for sjogren s syndrome 
The company has a strategic research collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals  Inc  It offers products primarily through its own sales force  marketing groups  and third parties worldwide  The company was formerly known as Biogen Idec Inc  and changed its name to Biogen Inc  in March 2015 
Biogen Inc  was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Cambridge  Massachusetts  

Biogen has produced an impressive record of earnings growth since fiscal year 2008  However  it should be noted that growth expectations for 2016 and 2017 are below historical norms 

When monthly closing stock prices are brought into the equation we initially see a very high correlation between price and earnings over the long run  However  we also see a significant disconnect where price became significantly ahead of earnings justified valuation for most of 2013  2014  and the first half of 2015  However  it appears that expectations for slower growth took the wind out of the price sails 

Nevertheless  in spite of the drastic correction in stock price  the long term returns that Biogen generated for shareholders has significantly outperformed the average company 

Biogen has produced excellent gross and net profit margins over the last 10 years  Even though growth is expected to slow somewhat  I find it comforting that net profit margins are strong and improving 

I also like the fact that Biogen s return on equity has been increasing at a rapid rate 

Consensus long term earnings estimates and growth rates are currently forecast to be below historical norms  However  Biogen does have an exciting pipeline of potential future blockbuster drugs  but  there is high risk as to whether they will generate future profits or not 

Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG 

 Celgene Corporation discovers  develops  and commercializes therapies to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases worldwide  It markets REVLIMID  an oral immunomodulatory drug for multiple myeloma  myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS   and mantle cell lymphoma  ABRAXANE  a solvent free chemotherapy product to treat breast  non small cell lung  pancreatic  and gastric cancers  POMALYST IMNOVID to treat multiple myeloma  and OTEZLA  a small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 for psoriatic arthritis  psoriasis  ankylosing spondylitis  Beh et s disease  atopic dermatitis  and ulcerative colitis 
The company s products also include VIDAZA  a pyrimidine nucleoside analog to treat intermediate 2 and high risk MDS  and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia  as well as acute myeloid leukemia  AML   THALOMID for the patients with multiple myeloma and erythema nodosum leprosum  ISTODAX to treat cutaneous and peripheral T cell lymphoma  and FOCALIN  FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN products  Its clinical stage products include OTEZLA for the treatment of various immune inflammatory diseases  sotatercept for the treatment of renal anemia  beta thalassemia and MDS  luspatercept for beta thalassemia and MDS  CC 486 to treat MDS  AML  and solid tumors  CC 122 and CC 220 to treat hematological and solid tumor cancers  and inflammation and immunology diseases  PDA 002 for the treat diabetic foot ulcers and peripheral neuropathy  and PNK 007 for hematological malignancies treatment 
The company has collaborative agreements with Novartis Pharma AG  Acceleron Pharma  Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc   Epizyme Inc   Sutro Biopharma  Inc   bluebird bio  Inc   FORMA Therapeutics Holdings  LLC  Acetylon Pharmaceuticals  Inc   OncoMed Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NantBioScience  Inc   AstraZeneca PLC  Lycera Corp   Juno Therapeutics  Inc   TriNetX  Inc   Triphase Accelerator Corporation  and Nurix  Inc 
The company was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Summit  New Jersey  

Of the research candidates presented in this article  Celgene  represents my personal favorite  Historical earnings growth has been extremely strong and very consistent since 2008  The only real negative is the company s high debt to capital 

Once again  we see a clear correlation between monthly closing stock prices and earnings over the long run  But most importantly  it is clear that the best times historically to invest in Celgene has been when its price has been below its earnings justified level as it is today 

Celgene represents another example of significant long term performance in spite of its current undervaluation  and the fact that it was moderately overvalued at the beginning of 2008  This clearly illustrates the power of compounding earnings growth at high levels 

Celgene has produced strong gross and net margins historically  However  net profit margins weaken somewhat in 2015  but remain high relative to the average company  On the other hand  net profit margin has improved to almost 32  through the March quarter of 2016  not shown on the graph  

Celgene also produces high returns on equity 

Analysts continue to expect Celgene to grow future long term earnings in excess of 20  per annum 

Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ JAZZ 

 Jazz Pharmaceuticals Public Limited Company  a biopharmaceutical company  identifies  develops  and commercializes pharmaceutical products for various medical needs in the United States  Europe  and internationally 
The company has a portfolio of products and product candidates with a focus in the areas of sleep and hematology oncology  It markets Xyrem  an oral solution for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness  EDS  in patients with narcolepsy  Erwinaze to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL   Defitelio for the treatment and prevention of severe hepatic veno occlusive disease  a potentially life threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  and Prialt  an intrathecally administered infusion of ziconotide for the management of severe chronic pain 
The company also develops JZP 110  a late stage investigational compound  which is in phase III clinical trail for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea  and JZP 386  a deuterium modified analog of sodium oxybate that is completed phase I clinical trail for use in patients with narcolepsy  In addition  it sells psychiatry and other products 
The company is headquartered in Dublin  Ireland  

Jazz Pharmaceuticals went from negative earnings in 2009 to positive earnings in 2010  Consequently  long term earnings growth rate has been distorted by aberrantly high earnings growth in 2010 and 2011  Nevertheless  historical earnings growth since 2013 has exceeded 20  per annum 

When monthly stock prices are included  we once again see a high correlation between earnings growth and stock price over the long term  However  in this case  the orange earnings justified valuation line is drawn at a market average P E ratio of only 15 

Nevertheless  Jazz has produced exciting long term returns for its shareholders 

Jazz has produced exceptional gross margins since 2007  However  net profit margins have been a little more erratic  Nevertheless  I consider this an intriguing research candidate at its current valuation 

The return on equity for Jazz is troubling  Therefore  I consider this my least favorite of the 5 research candidates presented  However  it s hard to argue with its past performance 

Consensus estimates for future growth are very strong   approaching 19  per annum  However  there is scant history available to analyze on this company  and analysts don t have a great record of forecasting earnings over the last couple of years 

2 Research Worthy Biotechnology Dividend Growth Stock Candidates
These next 2 biotechnology research candidates offer both above average growth and above average current dividend yield and dividend growth potential  Consequently  I consider both attractive long term total return opportunities with the benefit of a solid and growing dividend yield 
AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV 

 AbbVie Inc  discovers  develops  manufactures  and sells pharmaceutical products worldwide  The company offers HUMIRA  a biologic therapy administered as a subcutaneous injection to treat autoimmune diseases  IMBRUVICA an oral therapy for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  and VIEKIRA PAK  an interferon free therapy  with or without ribavirin  for adults with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis  including those with compensated cirrhosis 
It also provides Kaletra  an anti HIV 1 medicine used with other anti HIV 1 medications as a treatment that maintains viral suppression in HIV 1 patients  Norvir  a protease inhibitor indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents to treat HIV 1  and Synagis to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in high risk infants 
In addition  the company offers AndroGel  a testosterone replacement therapy for males diagnosed with symptomatic low testosterone  Creon  a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency  Synthroid to treat hypothyroidism  and Lupron  a product for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer  and endometriosis and central precocious puberty  as well as for the treatment of patients with anemia 
Further  it provides Duopa and Duodopa  a levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel to treat Parkinson s disease  Sevoflurane  an anesthesia product for human use  TriCor  Trilipix  and Niaspan treat metabolic conditions characterized by high cholesterol and or high triglycerides  and Zemplar to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism 
The company sells its products to wholesalers  distributors  government agencies  health care facilities  specialty pharmacies  and independent retailers from its distribution centers and public warehouses  AbbVie Inc  has strategic collaboration with C2N Diagnostics  Calico Life Sciences LLC  Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc   Ablynx NV  Galapagos NV  and Alvine Pharmaceuticals  Inc 
The company was incorporated in 2012 and is based in North Chicago  Illinois  

AbbVie has a short history after being spun off of Abbott Labs  However  the company has produced consistent above average earnings growth and its dividend has been increased and grown each year since it was an independent company 

Even though the history is short  AbbVie s stock price has moved in tandem with earnings over the long run  Moreover  periods of both overvaluation and undervaluation are vividly revealed  Currently  I consider this high quality biotechnology company currently undervalued  My only reservation is the company s high debt to capital ratio 

Even though AbbVie s performance history is short  the company has outperformed the S P 500 on both capital appreciation and dividend income  I think this is noteworthy considering how strong the performance of the average company was during this timeframe 

AbbVie has produced strong and attractive gross and net margins since it was an independent company  However  it s also important to recognize that Humira is their flagship drug and it has produced more than 50  of sales and 70  of profits  However  the company s pipeline is interesting  and Humira is expected to be a solid contributor for years to come 

AbbVie s return on equity has been very high stakes in most part due to Humira 

Consensus estimates for AbbVie s future earnings growth is significantly above average  Couple this with an extremely attractive current dividend yield and AbbVie appears to be a very solid investment 

Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN 

 Amgen Inc   a biotechnology company  engages in discovering  developing  manufacturing  and delivering human therapeutics worldwide  It offers products for the treatment of illness in the areas of oncology hematology  cardiovascular  inflammation  bone health  nephrology  and neuroscience 
The company s principal products include Neulasta  a pegylated protein to decrease the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia in cancer patients  NEUPOGEN  a recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony stimulating factor for reducing the incidence of infection for patients with non myeloid malignancies  and Enbrel to treat rheumatoid arthritis  plaque psoriasis  and psoriatic arthritis 
Its principal products also comprise EPOGEN to treat a lower than normal number of red blood cells caused by chronic kidney disease  CKD  in patients on dialysis  Aranesp for treating anemia  XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal related events  Prolia to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  Repatha for the treatment of high cholesterol  and Sensipar Mimpara products for use in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients on dialysis 
The company s other marketed products include Kyprolis  a proteasome inhibitor to treat patients with multiple myeloma and small cell lung cancer  Nplate  a thrombopoietic compound  Vectibix  a human monoclonal antibody  and BLINCYTO for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia  It also develops various products that are in various clinical trials 
The company serves pharmaceutical wholesale distributors  and physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals  and pharmacies  as well as consumers  It has collaborative agreements with Xencor  Inc   UCB  Novartis AG  and Bayer  DE BAYGN  HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc 
Amgen Inc  was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Thousand Oaks  California  

Amgen is widely considered as the mother of all biotechnology companies  This biotech giant has produced strong and steady earnings growth over its entire history  and the initiation of a dividend in 2011 that has grown significantly is also a plus 

Clearly  Amgen s stock price has closely tracked its earnings achievement  After becoming moderately overvalued in 2015  the recent negativity towards biotechnology in general appears to have brought the stock to attractive valuations again 

Amgen has been a solid performer that has generated higher returns than the S P 500 and a higher level of cumulative dividend income even though it s only paid a dividend since 2011 

Not only have Amgen s gross and net profit margins been high  they have also been very consistent 

Likewise  Amgen has achieved a very attractive and consistently high return on equity historically 

Long term estimates for Amgen s future earnings growth are above average  Adding the additional opportunity of an above average and growing dividend income makes Amgen look very solid at current valuations 

Summary and Conclusions
The best of breed companies in the biotechnology sector have a legacy of producing exceptional long term shareholder returns  However  the sector has recently gone out of favor which I believe has created a significant long term opportunity for investors willing to take the risk 
There are many that believe that biotechnology represents the future and promise of medicine  Some even believe that chemical driven pharmaceuticals have run their course  The 5 research candidates presented in this article appear to be worthy of further research and due diligence for those interested in above average long term returns  and are willing to take the risk associated with investing in biotech 
Considering that the stock market in general appears rather frothy  attractively valued biotechnology stocks appear to be worth a closer look considering the retrenchment in price most have experienced recently  But most importantly  biotechnology stocks today appear to offer something for everyone  If income is your objective  there are 2 here that are worth looking at  If growth is your objective  I believe all 5 of these candidates are worth a closer look

130063,351578,BIIB,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  Biogen  Alexion Pharma  BioMarin Pharma And Regeneron,opinion,"For Immediate Release 

Chicago  IL   June 13  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology     Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB      Alexion Pharma     BioMarin Pharma    and Regeneron     

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

4 Stocks That Crushed the Biotech ETF  IBB  Last Week

Although biotech has been a strong area of the market for quite some time  the past year has been a brutal stretch for this segment  In fact  the top biotechnology ETF    has seen a loss of roughly 25 5  in the past 52 weeks  making for a massive underperformance when compared to the broad markets in the same time frame 

And while there has been a bit of a comeback lately  the last few trading days have certainly put an end to that  as IBB has lost nearly five percent in the past five trading sessions 

But which stocks in particular have been driving this horrendous return as of late for this popular ETF  The following stocks are definitely the culprits as they have all lost more than the overall ETF with several slumping more than 10  in the time frame  Let s take a quick look at a few of the biggest contributors to IBB s underperformance as of late below 

Biogen     

Biogen shares have been in trouble lately thanks to a weak report on its MS drug results  The Phase 2 trial failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints and shares of BIIB plunged as a result  see   

The stock remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   while it has a VGM Score of  A   so fundamentals are still looking promising for this stock despite the recent drop 

Alexion Pharma     

More poor drug trial news to report back on  as ALXN suffered from a Phrase III letdown in its Soliris drug  as this missed its primary efficacy endpoint  Shares sold off significantly as a result of this release  and it is especially disappointing since it comes in Phase III  see    

The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  4  sell  while it has Value and Growth Style Scores of  D  so there are definitely better prospects out there in the biotechnology world right now 

BioMarin Pharma     

And BioMarin struggled as its main competitor in the Muscular Dystrophy market  Sarepta  saw some somewhat promising news from the FDA  This hope for SRPT along with BioMarin s woes in the space  lead many investors to continue their exodus out of BMRN shares which was to IBB investors  detriment yet again  see    

This stock is also a Zacks Rank  3  hold   but the quarterly Earnings ESP is plunging  coming in at  13 5   This suggests that the most recent estimates have been pretty weak for BMRN and that a downgrade may be on the horizon if this trend continues 

Regeneron     

This was a bit of a surprise addition to the list of biggest losers on the week  as REGN actually reported positive results from a Phase III trial  However  the perception of the broader space has swung negative and REGN was unable to escape the downturn  falling more than 7  on the week  See  for more info  

Arguably shares had run up a bit too high in the preceding month and this was just a bit of a snap back to reality  Still  this remains a decent choice in the space thanks to solid EPS growth projections and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   And unlike others on the list  it has been seeing some relatively positive news lately 

Bottom Line

The four components listed above make up roughly one fifth of the total exposure in IBB so they are bound to have a big impact on its overall performance  Investors in IBB will definitely need to see a turnaround here before the fund can make a comeback  and return to its storied past 

However  you could easily argue that the boom is starting to fade in the biotech sector  and especially so given the coming political headwinds for the space  Given that  it may be time to look to other  for now  at least until the firestorm dies down in this often volatile corner of the stock market

130064,351579,BIIB,Stock Market News For June 16  2016,opinion,"Benchmarks ended in the red for the fifth consecutive session on Wednesday after the Fed opted to keep interest rate unchanged and raised concerns about number of hikes this year  Meanwhile  concerns over  Brexit  and decline in crude prices continued to weigh on investor sentiment  While the Dow and S P 500 witnessed a five day losing streak for the first time since early February while the Nasdaq registered identical losses for the first time since early April

	After concluding its two day policy meeting yesterday  the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  decided to keep federal funds rate unchanged between 0 25  and 0 5  following concerns regarding weak jobs data  The FOMC stated   The pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up  Although the unemployment rate has declined  job gains have diminished   Also the Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said that  Brexit  is likely to have  consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets  

	Meanwhile  the Fed s decision to stick with its 2016 rate path also appears to be on shaky ground with just six of the 17 policymakers forecasting one rate hike this year  compared to only one Fed official take a similar view in March  Yellen said   I m not comfortable to say it s in the next meeting or two  but it could be It s not impossible that by July  for example  we would see data that led us to believe that we are in a perfectly fine course  

	Moreover  the central bank expects the key inflation rate to remain  low in the near term   Also  the fed funds rate is now expected to be 3  in the long run  compared to earlier projection of 3 3   Moreover  the Fed forecasted the economy would grow at 2  this year  declining from March s anticipation of 2 2  rise  The expected GDP growth rate for next year was also revised down from 2 1  to 2  

	Separately  concerns regarding  Brexit  continue to drag major benchmarks lower  Most of the recently released polls revealed that Britain may opt for  Brexit  in June 23 s referendum  These concerns dragged down the U S  10 year Treasury yield to its lowest level of 1 59  in over three years  Unchanged rate decision also led the U S  dollar to weaken against major currencies  The ICE U S  Dollar Index  DXY  declined 0 4  to 94 59

130091,351606,BIIB,Kite  KITE  And Biogen s Drugs Included In PRIME Initiative,opinion,"Kite Pharma  Inc    NASDAQ KITE   announced that its immuno oncology candidate  KTE C19  has been granted access to the Priority Medicines  PRIME  regulatory initiative in Europe by the European Medicines Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  and Committee for Advanced Therapies  CAT  for the treatment of patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL  
We note that PRIME is a new initiative undertaken by the EMA to provide better scientific guidance and support accelerated review of investigational therapies that address a high unmet medical need  The initiative also offers early and enhanced regulatory support to optimize regulatory applications 
Consequently  Kite Pharma will now work closely with the CHMP and CAT as it progresses with the multi center ZUMA studies on KTE C19  and moves ahead with the marketing authorisation application process 
The candidate was also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with DLBCL  primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma  PMBCL   and transformed follicular lymphoma by the FDA in Dec 2015  Moreover  KTE C19 enjoys orphan drug status in the U S  and the EU for DLBCL  PMBCL  follicular lymphoma  mantle cell lymphoma  chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
The news bodes well for Kite Pharma as it should accelerate the development and consequent review of the candidate  We note that Kite Pharma has no marketed products in its portfolio yet 
In addition  Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   announced that its pipeline candidate  aducanumab  was accepted for the PRIME program for early Alzheimer s disease  AD  primarily based on positive results from the phase Ib placebo controlled study on aducanumab in patients with prodromal or mild AD  Meanwhile  Biogen is evaluating aducanumab in two global phase III studies   ENGAGE and EMERGE   to evaluate its safety and efficacy in slowing cognitive impairment and the progression of disability in patients suffering from AD

130092,351607,BIIB,5 More Trade Ideas For This Week  AGU  BIIB  BLMN  BMY  CNI,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Agrium Inc  NYSE AGU 

Agrium  AGU  has trended lower since making a top over 116 to start March 2015  It started rising off of a bottom in February but found resistance as t crossed 90  he pullback from there made a higher low into May and it turned back up  Entering the week it is back at resistance with support to move higher  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  Look for a break of resistance to participate to the upside   
Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB 

Biogen  BIIB  gapped down in July last year and has drifted lower since  A series of lower highs and lower lows morphed into a bottoming pattern from February through March  And now it has seen a higher high following a higher low in May  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD rises  both supporting more upside  Look for a break of the short term resistance last week to participate to the upside   
Bloomin Brands Inc  NASDAQ BLMN 

Bloomin  Brands  BLMN  has been moving through a rounded bottom  making a series of higher highs and higher lows since February  Last week saw the stock push back to the May highs  with support for more upside from the bullish and rising RSI and the MACD about to cross up  Look for a break of the May high to participate to the upside   
Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY 

Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  recovered from the August 2015 drop  rising into the end of 2015  But it fell back with the market from there to a low in February  Since then it has moved higher to a peak at the end of April  It has consolidated the under resistance for more than a month  As it does  the RSI is rising in the bullish zone and the MACD is about to cross up  Look for a break above resistance to participate to the upside   
Canadian National Railway Company  NYSE CNI 

Canadian National Railway  CNI  ran higher from the February low until peaking in late April  It pulled back from there and found support at the 200 day SMA  It has been consolidating there since  The RSI has started back higher and is moving through the mid line while the MACD is crossed up and rising  Look for a break of resistance to participate to the upside   
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the first full week of June sees the Equity Indexes looking solid 
Elsewhere look for Gold to bounce higher in consolidation while Crude Oil consolidates its move higher  holding at the round number 50  The US Dollar Index looks better to the downside short term in its broad consolidation while US Treasuries are strong and look to move higher  The Shanghai Composite has a short term bias higher and may have broken a long term pattern to the upside while Emerging Markets are continue to move up 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   There charts show some variation in the short run with the IWM leading to the upside  perhaps catching up  while the QQQ has a short term upward bias in consolidation and the SPY looks to be muddled in consolidation after its move higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

130093,351608,BIIB,Why Is Biogen  BIIB  Stock Plunging Today ,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of biopharmaceutical company Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  are plunging  down over 15  in afternoon trading after the company s Phase 2 study of its treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints 
The drug  opicinumab  did not meet the primary objective of the improvement of physical and cognitive function and disability  while the secondary objective was slowing of disability progression 
 Achieving repair of the human central nervous system through remyelination would be a substantial achievement  and while we missed the primary endpoint  the SYNERGY study results suggest evidence of a clinical effect of opicinumab   said Chief Medical Officer Alfred Sandrock   Due to the complex nature of the data set  we continue to analyze the results to inform the design of our next study  
Biogen added that opicinumab was generally well tolerated and showed a linear  well behaved PK profile over the studied dose range 
So far this year  BIIB has underperformed the broader markets  dropping over 5  as of Monday s close ",2016-06-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-biogen-(biib)-stock-plunging-today-200134583,200134583
130094,351609,BIIB,Where s Biotech Headed ,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  was down 14  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  was off by 12 3   I guess it goes without saying that Bill Ackman had another lousy day  Biotech s weakness kept the NASDAQ from any kind of a rally on Tuesday  despite the Dow  SPX and the Russell all being on solid ground 
So where does that leave biotech going forward  Take a look at  NASDAQ IBB     the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index 
There is a clear level of support underneath  but more importantly is the downtrend that is converging with the base resistance  Break these two levels at around  290 and you ll likely have a rally that could go as high as  340 
Obviously that s huge for biotech stocks and a rally would help the entire market make that run toward new all time highs and beyond

Biotech Stocks We re Watching for Earnings Reports

It s nearing the closing bell of the first quarter 2016 earnings season with almost 75  of the S P 500 members having already reported results  With 71 4  of these members beating bottom line estimates and 56 4  surpassing top line expectations  the first quarter earnings season has been  

Notably  the Medical sector is anticipated to be one of the seven sectors to record earnings growth in the first quarter of 2016  as per our   Our Q1 scorecard shows that 75 5  of the Medical sector has reported results with a blended beat of 67 5   the percentage of companies that have beaten both EPS as well as revenue estimates  

Particularly  the earnings picture for the biotech sector looks quite mixed  By now  several biotech companies have reported first quarter results 

Companies like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Regeneron have topped first quarter earnings and revenues  While Amgen raised the outlook for the year  Regeneron upped the 2016 view for its key eye drug  Eylea  However  heavyweight biotech stock Gilead lagged both earnings and revenue estimates even though it reiterated its outlook for the year  As far as the other biotech stocks are concerned  including the likes of Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Alexion  and AbbVie  while some managed to post mixed results  others came up with disappointing performances and outlooks for the year 
	Still  several medium and small sized biotech companies are yet to report first quarter results  Let s see what awaits these six biotech stocks when they report their first quarter 2016 results on May 9 Can these Biotech Stocks Pull a Surprise Horizon Pharma plc    has already provided weaker than expected net sales and adjusted EBITDA expectations for the first quarter of 2016 last month  The company expects a major part of its sales and EBITDA to come in the second half of the year  Focus will be on the results of the company s business units as well as the performance of key products including Actimmune  Horizon Pharma s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of  13 16  do not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  read more     

Oncology focused Incyte Corporation s    Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of the ESP but its ESP of  46 67  makes a surprise prediction difficult this quarter  Incyte s track record has however been pretty good with the company surpassing expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 85 99  

Juno Therapeutics Inc     is among the major players in the field of T cell based immunotherapy and has pipeline candidates like JCAR015  JCAR017 and JCAR014 which use CAR T cell technology to target CD19  It has collaborations with companies like Celgene for the global development and commercialization of immunotherapies  With no approved products in its portfolio and not generating any product revenues as yet  focus will be on the company s cash burn and pipeline updates 
	Juno has a Zacks Rank  3 which when combined with an ESP 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult  read more     

San Diego  CA based Halozyme Therapeutics  Inc       focused on the development and commercialization of oncology therapies  has an impressive track record  The company has beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 60 41   Our model does not show that Halozyme is likely to beat estimates this quarter  Though the company s Zacks Rank  3 enhances the predictive power of the ESP  its 0 00  ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult 

Kite Pharma  Inc   s    performance over the last four quarters is mostly disappointing with the company surpassing expectations in just one quarter  Moreover  Kite Pharma s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  which when combined with an ESP  11 48  does not conclusively show that Kite Pharma is likely to beat estimates this quarter as well 
	This development stage company is looking to transform the paradigm of treating cancer which involves using the body s immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells  Focus will be on updates on the company s progress with its lead pipeline candidate KTE C19 as well as on collaboration agreements with several companies including Amgen  read more

Specialty Sciences  Segmental revenues comprised royalties of  88 million received by Perrigo on net sales of Biogen Inc  s   NASDAQ BIIB   multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  up 7  year over year  Unfavorable foreign currency movements hurt revenues by  1 million 
Others accounted for the remaining revenues 
2016 Earnings Outlook Reaffirmed
Perrigo maintained its earnings guidance for 2016 that was provided late last month  The company continues to expect 2016 earnings in the range of  8 20 to  8 60 per share  representing year over growth of 8 13   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is  8 45 per share 
Our Take
Perrigo s first quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both top and bottom line estimates  We are pleased with the performance of the Consumer Healthcare  Branded Consumer Healthcare  Rx Pharmaceuticals and Specialty Sciences segments  We are also positive on the company s focus on acquisition driven growth  Moreover  the company s restructuring plans to boost shareholder value look encouraging

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

Biotech Stock Roundup

This week  the biotech sector saw quite a few updates on the regulatory and pipeline front  While companies like Sarepta     Biogen     AbbVie    and Intercept    came out with encouraging news  Ionis     suffered a setback 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  Sarepta s shares shot up 26 7  on news that the FDA will not be able to deliver a decision regarding the approval status of the company s experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  treatment  eteplirsen  by May 26  The agency informed the company that it continues to review the NDA and will return with a decision in a timely manner  The news has raised hopes among investors as well as the medical community that the agency may very well decide to approve eteplirsen  Read more     

We remind investors that DMD drugs have not really had much success on the regulatory front so far  While PTC Therapeutics had received a  refusal to file  letter from the FDA for its experimental DMD treatment  Translarna  BioMarin s Kyndrisa received a complete response letter  CRL  earlier this year  BioMarin  in fact  announced this week that it does not intend to continue with the development of Kyndrisa  The company withdrew its marketing application in the EU following discussions with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  which indicated the drug would receive a negative opinion from the CHMP 

2  Across the pond  quite a few drugs received positive CHMP opinions including Biogen s Tysabri  label expansion for use in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients with highly active disease activity despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy  as well as Gilead s experimental hepatitis C virus  HCV  drug  Epclusa  Read more      Amgen s cancer drug Kyprolis and AbbVie s flagship product Humira also got positive CHMP opinions for label expansions  Read more     

3  The FDA granted approval to Biogen and AbbVie s multiple sclerosis  MS  treatment Zinbryta making it the first once monthly  self administered MS treatment to be approved  However  the label has a black box warning regarding the risk of hepatic injury  including autoimmune hepatitis  and other immune mediated disorders  Moreover  only prescribers  pharmacies and patients enrolled in the Zinbryta Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS  Program  which includes required monthly liver function tests  will have access to the treatment   Read more     

AbbVie s cancer treatment  Imbruvica  also gained EU approval for the first line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL  patients  The label expansion was expected as the CHMP had recently issued a positive opinion for this indication  With this label expansion  Imbruvica can now be used across all lines of CLL 

4  Ionis  shares were down 39 4  on news that Glaxo  which has the option to exclusively license Ionis  IONIS TTRRx  has decided against initiating a phase III outcome study in patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy  The study had been placed on clinical hold earlier this year due to safety findings in the ongoing NEURO TTR study   Read more     

5  Intercept s Ocaliva gained accelerated approval in the U S  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  making it the first new medicine to be approved for PBC in almost two decades  Shares were up on the news though approval was largely expected as an FDA advisory panel had voted unanimously in favor of approving the drug   Read more      Of course  Ocaliva s main potential lies in the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  market which represents blockbuster potential

130151,351666,BIIB,IBB Faces Key Technical Test,opinion,"Those who have followed our blog for some time now know that we are big proponents of technical analysis in   This type of examination can also be applied when we are analyzing individual sectors or industries that have diverged from the conventional path of the market 
Last year s big diverging theme was energy stocks as noted by the  21 50  decline in the Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE   versus relatively flat performance in the broad based SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  
This year  the weakest sector has been health care stocks  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV  is still down over 8  as SPY begins to peak its head above the flat line 

The biggest contributor to this decline in health care has been the biotechnology industry  The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  has over  5 7 billion dedicated to a market cap weighted index of 190 biotech companies  Top holdings include large cap stocks  Celgene Corp  NASDAQ CELG   Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN   and Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  
There are a  in varying styles  weights  and construction methodologies  However  IBB is the largest and most watched index of them all because of its tenure and skew towards the largest companies in this group 
The chart below shows that this ETF recently touched a critical level near  240 and has started to bounce intra day  This same level was probed in early February and proved to be a key support line 

It goes without saying that if IBB can mount another rally from these levels  it may be viewed by technicians as a bullish  double bottom  price pattern  I point this out for traders and those with a disciplined investment approach because a breach of those lows could also lead to another wave of selling pressure 
If your style involves watching for turnaround potential using price charts and momentum divergences  then this opportunity should certainly be on your radar  IBB is down  27  on a year to date basis and has shown in the past that rallies can materialize quickly 
I don t currently own any direct sector exposure to a fund like IBB for my growth clients because of the merry go round in leadership  It s difficult to forecast where the next burst of strength will come from at the sector or industry level unless you are betting on short term moves with tight stop losses 
My current mix of stocks is directed towards broad  low volatility or quality focused indexes that I believe offer a more stable platform to participate in further upside momentum  This  without worrying about hitting the nail perfectly on the head 
Nevertheless  I always keep a close eye on how specific areas of the market are trading and whether or not a reversal can morph into a new uptrend

130152,351667,BIIB,This Week s Top 5 Trade Ideas  BIIB  KKR  ON  WEB  ZG,opinion,"5 Trade ideas excerpted from the detailed analysis and plan for premium subscribers
Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB 
Biogen  BIIB  reported earnings Thursday morning and after moved higher to resistance  Friday broke that to the upside making another higher high  This is the second higher high  but still takes place in the long downtrending channel  Positive but with some work left  As it moves up the RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is moving higher supporting the upside  Look for continuation Monday to participate to the upside 
KKR   Co LP  NYSE KKR 
KKR  will report earnings before the market opens Monday  Heading into that event the chart looks promising for a break out  it made a higher low and is approaching resistance  a move over that would make for a higher high and confirm a reversal  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is crossed up and rising  also supporting more upside  Look for a positive reaction to participate to the upside 
ON Semiconductor Corporation  NASDAQ ON 
ON Semiconductor  ON  made a bottom in February and has been moving higher since  the last two weeks it has rounded into consolidation and the Bollinger Bands  are squeezing  This is often a precursor to a move in price  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD flattened after a fall and now approaching a positive cross  Look for a push over resistance to participate in the upside 
Web com Group Inc  NASDAQ WEB 
Web com  WEB  is coming out of a bottoming pattern  having back to back higher highs and higher lows  Coming into the week it is at resistance  trying to make another higher high  The RSI is now in the bullish zone and rising with the MACD crossed up and rising  These support more upside 
Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ ZG 
Zillow Group  ZG  bounced off of a bottom in February  making the familiar  V  shaped recovery  It met resistance at the consolidation zone from November and December before a pullback to a shallower low  Another touch at resistance fell back farther but has also recovered to that resistance  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD crossed and rising as it hits there again on a strong candle Friday  Look for a push through resistance to participate to the upside 
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the last week of April the Equity indexes are showing signs of rotation out of the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  and SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  and into the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in a  30 range while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index continues to test the bottom of a wide consolidation range while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside with risk of the Emerging Market longer term uptrend re exerting itself  Volatility looks to remain subdued and with a bias lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite the moves last week 
Their charts are mixed with the IWM just strong all around and the SPY strong on the weekly timeframe but with cracks on the daily  The QQQ is the weakest on the daily and shows consolidation on the weekly  Perhaps next week rotates back into the QQQ  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

130153,351668,BIIB,Biotech ETFs Sink On Mixed Q1 Results ,opinion,"Since the second half of 2015  the biotech sector has been experiencing weakness due to industry specific headwinds  The bear run was triggered by a  price gouging  tweet from Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  Additionally  strained balance sheets and macro economic factors are adding to investors  anxiety  read    

To deepen its woes  the sector has failed to gain investor confidence so far in the first quarter as well  Although well known biotech industry player Amgen Inc     NASDAQ AMGN    easily managed to beat estimates on both earnings and revenues  several other companies including Biogen    NASDAQ BIIB     Celgene Corporation    NASDAQ CELG     Gilead    NASDAQ GILD    and Alexion Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ ALXN    reported disappointing or mixed results 

Quite expectedly  investors will keep an eye on biotech earnings for the rest of this season to assess whether the sector can pull off another turnaround supported by strong pipelines  innovative treatments  growing demand for drugs  especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending  read    
Biotech Earnings in Detail

Gilead reported disappointing first quarter results as both earnings and revenues lagged the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  The biotech giant s first quarter earnings  including stock based compensation expenses  of  2 98 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 03  Reported earnings were  however  higher than the year ago figure of  2 90 per share 

Quarterly revenues were up 2 6  to  7 79 billion driven by strong product sales  However  the revenue figure fell short the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 13 billion  Meanwhile  the company maintained its 2016 product sales guidance  The company expects product sales in the range of  30  31 billion  The stock has fallen 9 1  since reporting earnings  as of April 29  2016

On the other hand  Alexion came up with out and out disappointing first quarter results with both earnings and revenues missing estimates  First quarter 2016 earnings  including stock based compensation expense  of 87 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents  Earnings were also below the year ago figure of  1 08 per share  Nevertheless  Alexion s revenues climbed 16 8  year over year in the first quarter to  701 million  Revenues  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  712 million 

Alexion has revised its outlook for 2016  The company expects adjusted earnings per share and revenues to be at the low end of the previous projections of  5 00  5 20 and  3 05  3 1 billion  respectively  Shares have lost a whopping 7 6  in the last two trading sessions

The RSI is running flat in bearish territory just above oversold levels  as the MACD continues lower  These support more downside in the price  There is support lower at 255 and then you need to look back to a gap to fill to 253 22 from November 2013  with 230 and 223 followed by 205 as possible support after that  There is resistance above at 275 and 291 before 300  Short interest is low at 1 2  
The reaction to the last 6 earnings reports has been a move of about 9 95  on average or  26 making for an expected range of 234 to 287  The at the money January 29 Expiry Straddles suggest a smaller  17 75 move by Expiry Friday with Implied Volatility at 89  above the February at 43   Open interest is largest at the 275 Strike this week  with most of it on the Put side  There is big activity on the Put side today at the 240 Strike with a block of nearly 1600 trading on the bid  Call open interest is much lighter than both of these but all above the current price

130207,351722,BIIB,Biogen Or Bluebird  Which Will Lead In Sickle Cell Disease ,opinion,"On April 29   of Piper Jaffray released a report highlighting several biopharmaceutical companies tackling Sickle Cell Disease  or SCD  The hereditary blood disorder is recognized by abnormal hemoglobin in the blood  Schimmer believes that to cure SCD with gene therapy  only  a very small percentage of the cells need to be successfully corrected to essentially stop the disease process   The analyst believes that Bluebird Bio and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  have therapies that should  prove successful for patients   but he has unique considerations for each 
Joshua Schimmer has a 58  overall success rate recommending stocks with a  12 9  average return per recommendation 
Bluebird bio Inc  NASDAQ BLUE 
LentiGlobin  Bluebird s pipeline gene therapy for SCD  is currently in Phase 1 2 testing in the United States  France  and Australia  Schimmer notes that BLUE s stock price has increased more than 500  since  the release of the first two beta thal pts treated with LentiGlobin last June   The analyst believes that LentiGlobin will bring in more than  1 billion per year in the United States alone  For now  Schimmer notes the near term investment opportunity in BLUE  However  he notes potential risks such as LentiGlobin s failure to achieve targets in testing Joshua Schimmer maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a  186 price target  He has only rated the stock once before in February  earning an  18 9  average return on the recommendation 
On average  the top analyst consensus for BLUE on TipRanks is Strong Buy 
Biogen Inc  NASDAQ BIIB 
Schimmer also analyzes the pipeline drug developed in partnership between Biogen and Sangamo BioSciences Inc  NASDAQ SGMO   though he focuses his analysis on Biogen  The two companies are working on a ZFN approach to target BCL11a  meaning the use of artificial enzymes to target a specific protein  Schimmer notes that this approach offers  a viable alternative  to LentiGlobin  If the product is successful  Schimmer believes that  even modest penetration  in the market will deliver over  1 billion 
Joshua Schimmer currently has an Overweight rating on Biogen with a  484 price target  He has rated the stock 6 times since January 2010  earning a 67  success rate recommending the stock with a  6 0  average return per BIIB recommendation

130208,351723,BIIB, 400 Billion Hidden In Your Medicine Cabinet,opinion,"If you re like most Americans  your medicine cabinet is filled with drugs that treat high blood pressure  pain and high cholesterol   Better watch those hot dogs and chips during today s Fourth of July festivities     You might feel like you re paying an arm and a leg for these prescriptions  But  surprisingly  those types of medications aren t what s costing consumers the most money   
The bulk of out of pocket pharmaceutical spending goes toward specialty drugs  These drugs require special administration and monitoring and are used to treat complex conditions  As a result  they can be extremely costly 
Today s chart looks at the change in spending on traditional and specialty drugs over the past nine years  As you can see  consumers spent 30  more on specialty drugs last year than they did in 2013 
How is this possible  Easy  Just look at the price tags   
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD    Nasdaq  GILD  Hepatitis C treatment drug Harvoni costs  94 500 for a 12 week treatment  Genentech s cancer treatment drug Avastin costs  5 560 for two vials  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  s  Nasdaq  BIIB  multiple sclerosis drug Avonex costs  1 363 for just one injection 
And this high level pricing isn t about to stop  Consumer spending on specialty drugs is expected to reach  400 billion by 2020 
Of course  while specialty drugs are costly for consumers  they can be extremely profitable for the companies that create them   
In 2014  Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi made more than  12 4 billion for Gilead  Shares of the company ended the year 25  higher than where they started 
So it s easy to see why more and more companies are racing to develop specialty drugs    and why more and more investors are scrambling to get in on the action ",2015-07-05,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/$400-billion-hidden-in-your-medicine-cabinet-257176,257176

ConclusionThe rating is neutral plus  Company is currently in Phase 2 trials for type 2 diabetes  In Phase 1 trials for Alzheimer s Stockholders affiliated with Prospect Venture Partners  New Enterprise Associates  Venrock Associates and Atlas Ventures  indicated an interest in purchasing an aggregate of up to  11 million of IPO stock To put the conclusions and observations in context  the following is reorganized  edited and summarized from the full S 1 referenced above 
Business VTAE is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel  small molecule drugs for diseases that represent large market opportunities where there are significant unmet medical needs 
VTAE is developing a robust and growing portfolio of novel product candidates generated by Contour   its proprietary structure based drug discovery platform 
VTAE s team of accomplished scientists utilizes Contour to rapidly discover highly potent and selective product candidates for validated but difficult to drug targets in multiple disease areas 
Clinical trials  VTAE s most advanced product candidates include VTP 34072  which commenced the first Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in July 2014  with data expected in the first half of 2015  and VTP 37948  which is in Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease  or Alzheimer s  with data expected in the second half of 2014 
Collaborations  Both products are being developed by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH  or BI  under separate collaborations  Due to the fact that the trials for VTP 34072 and VTP 37948 are being conducted by BI in Germany  no IND  investigational new drug  applications have been submitted in the United States to date 
These collaborations have provided VTAE with an aggregate of  152 million in funding as of June 30  2014  including upfront license fees  research funding and success based milestone payments as well as equity investments 
Preclinical studies  In addition  VTAE has several wholly owned products advancing in preclinical studies  including VTP 43742 for the treatment of autoimmune disorders  with Phase 1 proof of concept expected by the end of 2015  VTP 38443 for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome  and VTP 38543 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis 
VTAE intends to advance and retain rights to these and other programs and product candidates that VTAE believes can be developed and commercialized by us  and to strategically partner where doing so can accelerate a program and generate non dilutive capital for us 
Structured based drug discovery  VTAE is a structure based drug discovery company  and has leveraged its expertise to create a growing portfolio of novel  potent and selective product candidates 
VTAE utilizes Contour to discover and develop product candidates for validated therapeutic targets against which the industry has traditionally struggled to develop drugs due to challenges related to potency  selectivity  pharmacokinetics  or patentability issues 
VTAE refers to these targets as  difficult to drug   Contour s computational software uses artificial intelligence and sophisticated algorithms to model the assembly of molecular fragments  which are chemical structures consisting of one to several atoms  into fully elaborated  drug like structures that precisely fit each target s 3 dimensional binding site  These molecules are then assessed by Contour s state of the art scoring function to identify the most promising and drug like structures 
Together  these functions allow VTAE to rapidly focus on those structures with the highest potential from among hundreds of billions of possibilities for a given biologic target  VTAE chemically synthesizes  comprehensively tests and critically evaluates these novel structures rapidly  iterating each new data set back into the design process until VTAE identifies product candidates with demonstrable first  or best in class potential 
VTAE s experienced scientists are experts in the related disciplines of structural biology  molecular modeling  i e   the design of drugs using computers   medicinal chemistry and biology  VTAE s scientists utilize its platform and approach for each of its product candidates to rapidly overcome discovery obstacles 
VTAE has achieved animal proof of concept with a qualified product candidate in less than 18 months from the initiation of a program 
Dividend Policy No dividends are planned 
Intellectual Property Each of VTAE s most advanced product candidates is the subject of patents and patent applications for composition of matter and methods of treatment in major markets worldwide 
These patents and patent applications  if granted  are expected to provide VTAE with intellectual property protection for all of VTAE s current product candidates until 2030 and beyond 
VTAE intends to continue to expand its intellectual property protections by seeking and maintaining domestic and international patents on inventions that are commercially important to its business  VTAE will also relies on know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its proprietary position 
Competition If VTAE s product candidates are approved  they will compete with currently marketed drugs and potentially with product candidates currently in development focusing on the same mechanism of action which include 
 11b HSD1  VTAE believes that Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  or BMS  Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   and Roche Holding  OTC RHHVF  are studying their 11b HSD1 inhibitors in clinical trials 
 BACE  VTAE believes that Merck   Company Inc  NYSE MRK   Astrazeneca Plc  NYSE AZN  and Eisai Co   Ltd   TOKYO 4523  in collaboration with Biogen Idec Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  are studying BACE inhibitors in clinical trials 
 RORgt  VTAE believes that a number of companies including large pharmaceutical companies and large biotech companies are actively assessing RORgt inhibitors in preclinical studies 
 LXRb  VTAE believes that BMS is studying an LXRb inhibitor in cardiovascular clinical trials and Alexar Therapeutics  Inc  is developing an LXRb inhibitor for dermatologic conditions

130282,351797,BIIB,Amgen Beats Earnings Estimates  What s Next ,opinion,"Earlier today  the world s largest biotechnology company  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  reported its earnings results for fiscal Q3 after the closing bell  and the company posted better than anticipated earnings and revenue  despite the fact that the company s total net income was hit hard by the firm s recent restructuring effort 
AMGN has spent a sizeable amount of money  approximately  376 million  and perhaps  150 million in Q4  trying to restructure itself  AMGN has recently had to deal with approximately 2 900 lay offs  and plant closings  in order to reallocate resources and efforts towards producing a potential best seller cholesterol drug  AMGN spiked higher in after hours despite the fact that the firm missed net income estimates  and many investors are still waiting for more information regarding the company s overall restructuring plans  and tomorrow  Tuesday   in New York  AMGN will carry out a business update  AMGN stock closed on Monday at  148 20 share and the stock is up in after hours trading  by about  1 55 share  or 1 05   edging very close to the  150 share price tag  which will serve as a milestone for the AMGN s stock  Amgen announced that it had earned  2 30 EPS  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus estimate by  0 24 share  This is not bad at all  considering how AMGN has been consistent with positively surprising EPS estimates  and how the company retains an average surprise of 11 11   AMGN has also readjusted its earnings expectations for 2014  raising EPS from  8 20    8 40 to  8 45    8 55 EPS  AMGN s recorded revenue for Q3 was up by 6   to  5 03 billion  beating Wall Street s estimate of  4 96 billion  The company previously forecasted  19 5    19 7 billion in revenue  however now it has also raised this to  19 8    20 0 billion  Lastly  AMGN conceded on net profit  Net income was down from  1 37 billion in Q3 2013  to  1 24 billion Q3 2014  Financials aside  AMGN s prospects do not look too bad for the future either  sales of the white blood cell booster  Neulasta  surged by 5   amounting to about  1 19 billion  Kyprolis  on the other hand  is a multiple myeloma drug that was more or less acquired through AMGN s mammoth acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year  and the drug had sales of  94 million  AMGN also sells Prolia  a treatment drug for osteoporosis  and Prolia sales managed to jump 43  to  255 million  however that is not as good as last quarter s revenues of  264 million from the drug  Enbrel  the rheumatoid arthritis drug followed in Prolia s footsteps  and failed to shine as sales fell by about 3   However AMGN was quick to mention that inventory issues hurt the sales for Q3  though as investors  we also have to keep in mind that other biotechnology companies are competing with AMGN  Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  is another large biotech company that is aiming to render Kyprolis obsolete with its own drug  Pomalyst  which accomplished  181 million in sales for the company in Q3 
Bottom LineAMGN seems like a very solid and reputable company without a doubt  but we can expect cutthroat competition and AMGN is going to have to pick up the pace with the needed restructuring process  so as not to fall behind in regards to market share or R D  We can expect AMGN s wide variety of products to contribute to its continued growth and top line revenue  and perhaps when restructuring is finished  the company can march even higher  AMGN has been an excellent investment for investors  and we may see the stock rise on Tuesday  Still  AMGN sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Despite the very high forward P E and PEG ratios when compared to the industry s average  AMGN is performing relatively well compared to other biotechnology giants  such as Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Illumina Inc   NASDAQ ILMN   Intercept Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ICPT   and Biogen Idec Inc   NASDAQ BIIB   All of the aforementioned stocks maintain a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   or  2  Buy   except for GILD  and that is most likely due to how it fares after it conducts its earnings conference call after the closing bell on Tuesday  The following is a comparison between the aforementioned stocks and the S P 500 Index for those looking at making a biotech investment now ",2014-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-beats-earnings-estimates,-what's-next-230467",230467

Net income for Q3 was  2 73 billion  or  1 67 diluted share  which was considerably better than  788 6 million or 47 cents diluted share for Q3 last year  GILD posted  1 84 EPS for the quarter  which was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 64 in EPS  after non recurring items   GILD currently trades at around  108 6 share in after hours trading  which is down by about  4 3  from the market closing price  GILD had previously  during regular trading  made new highs  striking an all time high of  114 13 share 
Details of GILD s Report
Product sales totaled approximately  5 97 billion for Q3  however  sales of GILD s high end Hepatitis C virus treatment slipped below Wall Street s estimates of  2 97 billion  reporting only  2 80 billion in sales  This can be partially blamed on GILD s new combination and improved once a day pill  Harvoni  which has already been approved by the FDA earlier this month  GILD claims that Harvoni will be cheaper than Sovaldi  which is likely true  given that it will truncate the duration of the treatment  which will translate into cheaper costs than Sovaldi  Sovaldi costs about  1 000 pill  or  84 000 for the regular 12 week course of treatment  in conjunction with other drugs  Harvoni will be priced at a hefty  1 125 pill  or  94 500 for a 12 week course treatment  however there will not be a need for patients to use it along with other drugs  and the success rate of Harvoni will be better than Sovaldi s already excellent rate  Many expect that the majority of patients will be able to take Harvoni for only eight weeks  rendering the cost to about  63 000 
Sales by Region        
U S product sales for the third quarter of 2014 increased to  4 21 billion  from  1 67 billion  and Europe product sales increased to  1 44 billion from  823 6 million compared to last year s Q3  The following charts are a quick display of how antiviral products sales have been faring  Antiviral products increased by  5 54 billion for Q3 2014  far better than  2 33 from the same quarter last year  thanks to sales of Sovaldi  Cardiovascular product sales also increased to  278 9 million  up from  250 9 million from last year s Q3 

Many investors blame higher operating costs to be hindering GILD s performance  and GILD s research and development expenses totaled  586 3 million  far higher than Q3 2014 s  488 5 million  However Non GAAP selling  general  and administrative costs were truly disappointing  as they more than doubled year year to  888 3 million in Q3 2014  GILD  however  has witnessed considerable growth in HIV drugs such as Viread  Complera Eviplera  and Stribild  which all managed to hit double digit year year sales increases  with Stribild s revenue jumping 128  from Q3 2013  Higher operating costs will not hold GILD back from growing and beating analysts  expectations  especially when GILD signs blockbuster deals for Harvoni in the international market in 2015  The payment of  337 million   0 21 diluted share  for the branded prescription drug fee imposed by the Affordable Care Act must also be taken into consideration for this quarter s sluggish results  Expansion of clinical studies and the launch of Sovaldi  and the chronic lymphocytic leukemia drug  Zydelig have also run operating costs  and that must be taken into account Round Up Although GILD will tumble off of its 52 week highs in the near term  the stock could have some long term promise thanks to the upcoming international release of Harvoni  Still  it is worth noting that GILD is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   so earnings estimate activity has been mixed as of late  Other biomedical stocks to consider would be Illumina Inc   NASDAQ ILMN   or Biogen Idec  NASDAQ BIIB   Both sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and are likely to pay off very well as growth stocks for the patient investor  The following is a comparison graphic showing GILD s stellar performance versus the S P 500 Index ",2014-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gilead-posts-weak-earnings;-stock-falls-4-after-hours-230630,230630

130292,351807,BIIB,Covered Call Writing With Protective Puts  A Proposed Strategy,opinion,"When protective puts are integrated into our covered call writing strategy it is known as the collar strategy  The covered call aspect of the trade generates cash flow and the protective put leg serves as an insurance policy against catastrophic share depreciation  Recently  one of our members  Gary  shared with me a related strategy he had heard about and I thought I d discuss it with the entire BCI community  On this site we never embrace or reject a strategy approach outright but rather evaluate it from a  pros and cons  perspective and then each of us can make an informed decision as to whether it should be integrated into our portfolios based on our personal risk tolerance  Let s break this down the Blue Collar way 
The proposed strategy
Select a stock or ETF with high implied volatility  like Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD   Biogen Idec Inc  NASDAQ BIIB   iShares NASDAQ Biotech  NASDAQ IBB  
Underlying securities should be large cap so option  is high and bid ask spreads tight
Associated options should have weeklies that generate   1 
Go 1 2 strikes out of the money for weeklies
Buy protective puts 6 months out
Protective puts should be 15   20  out of the money  lower than current market value 
Cost of puts should be no more than 1 month of covered call profits
Theoretical returns
1  per week for 6 months   26 
Cost of put   26  6   4 3 
6 month theoretical return   21 7 
Annualized theoretical return   43 4 
GILD example
Real life price    102 22
 85  6 month put is 17 5  out of the money
Cost of  85 put    4 30  less than 1 month of weekly premiums as shown below 
The  104 weekly call generates  1 25 which meets the 1  system criteria
Theoretical return per contract for GILD example if share price and premiums remain constant
 26 x  125     430  10 222   27 6    55  annualized
Advantages of this strategy
The advantages of this strategy are clear  A huge annualized return can be realized based on certain assumptions like share price and short call premiums remaining constant during the 6 month time frame  We also have protection against catastrophic share loss below the  85 put strike  By selecting a 6 month put  the monthly cost of this protection is decreased compared to buying a put each month  In addition to this  there is opportunity to generate additional profit if share price moves up to the strike of the short call 
Potential pitfalls and possible disadvantages of this strategy
Trading commissions
One of the disadvantages of weeklies is that we have 4   5 times the amount of trading commissions compared to monthlies  Assuming a reasonable fee of  10 per trade  that computes to  260 for the 6 month time frame  assuming 1 contract trades  Let s add  20 in commissions for the purchase of the shares and then put  Therefore  over the 6 month time frame  the short calls must overcome a net debit of  430    280    710 
When do we breakeven  
Based on a weekly premium of  125  we breakeven after 6 weeks  Keep in mind that we paid  102 22 for the shares and we are using a security with high implied volatility as defined by the proposed strategy  If share price declines  we must be prepared for this  we start losing money and we will not break even for 6 weeks 
What about management techniques 
For traditional covered call writing we are managing two positions  the long stocks and the short call  In the proposed strategy  we are also managing the long put position  The investor must be capable of managing all 3 positions   In addition to this  if share price moves above the short call strike  we must roll the option in order to retain share ownership  This will most likely impact our  125 week premium goal as the time value of a short call will decline as the strike moves deeper in the money  Rolling out and up may actually result in a short call debit  Rolling will also result in more trading commissions further eroding the profits from a theoretical trade 
What about earnings reports 
Two times within the 6 month time frame  there will be an earnings announcement  I strongly believe that a short call should not be written in those 2 weeks  thereby decreasing returns from the theoretical stats we archived above  The strategy  however  does require us to retain the shares through these two earnings reports and that may result in a dramatic share decline if the report  s  is disappointing  Now we are protected below  85 because of the long put but there s a lot to lose between  102 22 and  85 
What about dividends 
Of the three securities mentioned by Gary  IBB does distribute a quarterly dividend  Although unlikely  there is the possibility of early exercise  when expiration occurs after the ex dividend date  Should the shares be assigned because of the ex date  new shares would have to be purchased at the current market value and who knows how this would impact our theoretical returns  There are ways to avoid early exercise resulting from ex dates but that would involve sophisticated management skills and would not be guaranteed 
What is the basis for selecting the underlying security 
For traditional covered call writing  according to the BCI methodology  a stock or ETF is chosen based on three factors  fundamental and technical analysis as well as common sense principles like minimum trading volume and avoiding earnings reports  In this proposed strategy  it appears that the main criteria for selection is option returns and liquidity  Quantity seems to take precedence over quality 
What about the 6 month time frame 
We enter a trade today because certain system criteria are met such as those mentioned at the top of this article  By undertaking a 6 month obligation  we are making the assumption that those same positive factors will be in place for half a year  We should at least be prepared that this may not come to fruition as shown in the chart below 

GILD  price movement impacting strike selection
Discussion
There are many ways to make money in the stock and option markets  The proposed strategy may be one of those ways for certain investors  One key point is that there are no free lunches and every strategy has its advantages and disadvantages which must be evaluated before risking our hard earned money

130331,351846,BIIB,5 Top Biotech ETFs,opinion,There are only a handful of effective ETFs focused exclusively on biotechnology  Nevertheless  the sector contains companies that will probably produce more effective medical treatment and healthcare than all the insurance plans and HMOs combined  This is the next big thing for the human race as in the future immunization and cures for disease will allow people to live longer and healthier lives  As an anecdote  a very famous and successful heart surgeon told me a few decades ago that his profession would no doubt be obsolete someday due to advances in biotechnology Biotechnology companies are valued more for their future promise than current earnings and sales  This has always been the case making PEs sometimes very high and confusing more uninformed investors  At the same time  when there are clinical trial failures of new drugs or treatments the related company s shares may plunge significantly  Successful results can lead to dramatic stock gains  One other little known trait is that when earnings from more conventional sectors struggle investors often turn to the biotech sector seeking better performance away from earnings  It may seem an odd pattern but it is something I ve noticed over more than a few decades In fact  since the beginning of 2012  the biotech sector has been one of the better performing areas  This has been due to recent successful clinical trials and a belief that more M A activity will occur  Established pharmaceutical companies may wish to acquire biotech firms as their pipeline of new drugs weakens  It s easier and perhaps even cheaper to acquire these firms than to develop their technology from scratch We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average  When prices are above the moving average  stay long  and when below remain in cash or short  Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high  but

130335,351850,BIIB,TECFIDERA Raises The Bar For Biogen Idec,opinion,The bar has been raised significantly for Biogen Idec  BIIB  after the FDA approval of TECFIDERA   dimethyl fumarate    Biogen Idec s first line oral treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis  MS   While the approval wasn t all that surprising to the market judging by the mild  5 4  jump that BIIB saw during last Thursday s trading  many investors who prefer larger pharmaceutical companies are now looking much more favorably upon BIIB  The stock is up 31 6  since the start of the year  beating the broader market by almost 22   Although it s just one more drug in Biogen s already impressive multiple sclerosis product line  Wall Street is expecting particularly high sales for Tecfidera based on its proven efficacy and target indication  Just how high are these expectations  Consider that Biogen s three big MS drugs   AVONEX  approved in 2003   TYSABRI  in 2006   and RITUXAN  in late 2012   bring in the bulk of its   5 billion in annual revenues  These three drugs bring in quarterly revenues of  736 million   275 million  and  288 million respectively as of Q3 2012  and have generally penetrated quite nicely into their target indications  The one exception is Rituxan  which has a lot more room to run  Then consider that the eight BIIB analysts surveyed by  have an average expectation of  3 25 billion in annual revenue for 2017  This implies that Tecfidera will have to outperform Biogen s blockbuster drug Avonex after it fully saturates its target indication  Yeah  the drug has some pretty big shoes to fill  To top it off  the drug will have competition for this indication from Novartis s  NVS  Gilenya and Sanofi s  SNY  Aubagio  as mentioned in the Bloomberg article   but BIIB investors might be encouraged to know that that Novartis  next  promising  oral MS drug BAF312 isn t expected to hit the market any time before 2017  The notion that Tecfidera is going to single handedly boost Biogen Idec s already enormous revenues by 65  within the next few years might be hard to swallow  but the sheer size of the MS indication makes it more than feasible  The degenerative disease affects about 2 1 million worldwide  and roughly 350 000 in the United States alone  With MS treatments costing around  30 000 per patient per year  one can infer that the MS drug market could be as large as  10 billion in the US alone  with a lot more potential in overseas markets that s more difficult to measure  This is huge market  which is why it doesn t make sense to worry about Biogen s valuation given how much more revenue potential it has down the road  Patent expirations are also a non issue for now  Note that in 2009  Biogen Idec was able to move the patent expiration on Avonex all the way to 2026  So while Biogen Idec really was a laggard amongst the big pharma names in past years  its highly profitable multiple sclerosis portfolio is taking the company in a completely new direction  I also think that Wall Street has placed very realistic expectations for Tecfidera that may even be surpassed before 2017  depending on its marketing and market penetration rate  Because of this  I see BIIB as an undiversified but fairly safe pharmaceutical stock that has one of the better risk reward profiles in the big pharma space  I also believe that its lack of yield is outweighed by the stock s lower valuation relative to its top line growth  which should continue quite nicely with the introduction of Tecfidera  Since the analyst expectations for Tecfidera s sales potential will basically be the market s general expectations for the new MS drug for quite some time  I d expect BIIB to either hold its new levels or possibly stage another rally given that the company doesn t release any additional news that could fade the bullish sentiment  We ll have to see ,2013-04-02,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tecfidera-raises-the-bar-for-biogen-idec-161190,161190

130337,351852,BIIB,Cowen Questions Sales Growth Of Biogen Idec s MS Drug Tecfidera,opinion,Yesterday  Biogen Idec  BIIB  was the worst performer amongst the larger pharmaceutical companies after Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt pointed that the IMS prescription sales data for new prescriptions  NRx  of the company s recently launched multiple sclerosis   MS drug Tecfidera  dimethyl fumarate  may be flawed due to double counting of patients were prescribed a new dose of the drug  After Biogen launched the drug earlier in the year at a price of  54 900 per year  Wall Street began to create a correlation between the drug s performance and the price of BIIB common stock   This can explain the sensitivity that BIIB shares had to Cowen s bearish note on Tecfidera and the delay of the European launch into the second half of 2013   There has been some skepticism over the drug because of the cheap manufacturing cost of the easily available NF  B inhibitor dimethyl fumarate  the active ingredient of Tecfidera  although Biogen was indeed the first to clinically develop the compound for the relapsed MS indication  and can justify a price premium for its branded drug  Now it seems that the patent protection of Tecfidera is causing the drug some serious issues in Europe  which explains why the company would delay its introduction into Europe   AVONEX   interferon beta 1a   TYSABRI   natalizumab   and RITUXAN   rituximab  are Biogen s other primary drugs in the MS indication  These three brought in the vast majority of the company s  1 4 B in quarterly revenues   736 million   275 million  and  288 million respectively   which represents what should be the lion s share of the   10 15 B US MS drug market  The three drugs also saw in 13   9   and 7  year over year growth respectively   Despite the strength of Biogen s existing pipeline  expectations are very high for Tecfidera  and it s generally agreed that the drug will have to pull more than its own weight in order for the company to meet its 2013 sales growth forecast of 16 18   particularly since none of the company s existing drugs are growing sales at that rate  Expect the market to continue to monitor Tecfidera s performance very closely  and to punish BIIB further in the event that Cowen s theory on the prescription sales is correct ,2013-06-06,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cowen-questions-sales-growth-of-biogen-idec’s-ms-drug-tecfidera-170046,170046
