3834,225349,CAMT,5 Explosive Small Cap Stocks,opinion,"As any seasoned investor knows that if you want to experience the highest return for your investing dollars  your best option is to look at small cap stocks  These are the companies that tend to have rapid growth and since most analysts aren t paying attention to them  the stock jumps when it becomes a household name 
So today I am going to highlight 5 explosive small cap stocks that have the potential to provide you with a healthy return on your investment 
Top 5 Small Caps
 1  Camtek  NASDAQ CAMT 
Camtek is a company that is in the semiconductor testing business  It provides services for making sure that all of the devices that have a chip board in them work as stated  And seeing as how more and more items have a chip in them  business for Camtek shouldn t slow down anytime soon 
In fact  the company recently sold off its printed circuit board business just so it could focus more on the testing area of the business 
Recent earnings per share came in at  0 11 and revenues at  34 million  which was a 73  increase  This company has been crushing earnings for 2 years now and shows no signs of slowing down 
 2  OraSure Technologies  NASDAQ OSUR 
OraSure is a medical diagnostics company that has found its niche in saliva  It develops tests using saliva to quickly get results  Some of the tests the company currently offers are for HIV  Hepatitis C  blood alcohol levels and drug levels in the bloodstream 
Earnings per share recently came in at  0 09 and revenues at  40 million  an increase of 28   The stock has risen sharply this year  but as the company continues to churn out new tests  there is no reason to think the stock won t continue higher 
 3  Willdan Group  NASDAQ WLDN 
Willdan is a consulting company  That doesn t sound very exciting nor does it sound like the stock would be one to buy  But you have to understand what the company consults about to get excited about it 
The company advises state agencies  utilities and other organizations in California and New York on topics that include sustainability  homeland security and engineering 
The sexy word there is homeland security as that is a hot topic in the world we currently live in  But the company has reported most of its current earnings are from energy efficiency audits and reviews  This is another hot area currently and with exposure to both sectors  this stock should stay hot 
Earnings per share recently came in at  0 36 and revenues at  72 million  which is an increase of 22  
 4  inTest Corporation  NYSE INTT 
inTest Corp is another of the hot small cap stocks I like  And like CamTek  they are in the business of semiconductor testing  The company designs and manufactures the testing equipment for 3rd parties 
Why are semiconductors hot right now  As I mentioned  more and more devices are having a chip in them  For example  we currently have computers  tablets and smartphones  But we are quickly growing the internet of things  virtual reality  autonomous cars  and artificial intelligence industries as well 
Just that list adds thousands of new products that will have chips in them  And these chips need to be tested 
Earnings per share came in at  0 16 and revenues at  16 million  an increase of 51   In the prior quarter  inTest grew earnings 38  
 5  NutriSystem  NASDAQ NTRI 
Nurtisystem was a on roll with a hot stock price  Then Weight Watchers  NYSE WTW  announced its deal with Oprah and things for Nutrisystem stalled  But I still really like this stock  I think it is just being overshadowed by Weight Watchers  This means you can buy it before the price spikes even higher 
Like Weight Watchers  Nutrisystem is a company that helps people eat healthy and lose weight  What I especially like here though is that they tailor plans to both men and women  Weight Watchers seems to only target women  but there are many men who need to lose weight but don t want to admit they are on a diet 
Nutrisystem has done a good job at helping men diet without feeling like they are dieting 
Earnings per share recently were reported at  0 80 and revenues came in at  195 million  an increase of 30  
Final Thoughts
So there are 5 great small cap stocks to look into  These companies have a bright future ahead of them and are firing on all cylinders  Assuming they can continue to grow revenues and earnings at a steady pace  you can expect a healthy rise in their stock prices

week s article Lakeland Industries  Inc    NASDAQ LAKE    Camtek Ltd    NASDAQ CAMT    Newpark Resources  Inc    NYSE NR    First BanCorp    NYSE FBP  and Sunstone Hotel Investors  Inc    NYSE SHO   5 Cheap Breakout Stocks Offering Spectacular ReturnsPossibly one of the most preferred methods for those using an active investing approach  selecting breakout stocks offers the promise of substantial returns  This approach involves identifying those stocks whose prices are varying within a narrow band If the price of a stock falls below this channel  it could be the best time to sell it off  However  the best time to buy a stock as per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band  Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains Identifying Breakout StocksThe first step to selecting the right breakout stocks is to calculate their support and resistance levels  A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period In other words  the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level  which means most traders are willing to sell it  At the resistance level  most traders are willing to go long on the stock  which means that they would like to add them to their portfolios  The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level Is this a Genuine Breakout The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure

period   This poses a small dilemma for shareholders  as there is expected earnings contraction to take place next year   With 2018 almost halfway over  investors will soon focus on 2019  so hopefully  some more visibility will come with the next earnings report ValuationI see a wonderful valuation for HCLP  with a forward multiple of 4 7x and a trailing earnings multiple of 8x   Either way you look at it  that is pretty low   Price to book is a more conservative measure and at 1 45x multiple is another reason the stock has a value style score of A What really impresses me in the increase in net margin over the last three quarters   That measure has moved from 7  to 13  to 19  and it looks to be headed higher in future quarters  Briggs   Strattonis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  despite having posted a beat at its most recent earnings event   Let s take a look at why this stock can have a solid Value Style Score of A as well as a strong Growth Score of B and still be The Bear Of The Day DescriptionBriggs   Stratton Corporation makes and sells  and services gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment to the original equipment manufacturers  Briggs   Stratton Corporation was founded in 1908 and is headquartered in Wauwatosa  Wisconsin EarningsOn April 25  the company reported earnings of  0 84 per share  and that was two cents better than the consensus estimate   Revenues rose 1 2  on a year over year basis to  604M and that was below the  616M consensus estimate The company also lowered guidance for FY18 to  1 33    1 50 from  1 45    1 62 when the consensus estimate was calling for  1 54  The company also lowered the top end of the projected revenue range but the guide was still within the consensus estimate EstimatesFollowing this report  estimates tumbled   The current quarter saw numbers slide from  0 72 to  0 48 and the following quarter also fell by a penny The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 moved from  1 53 to  1 31 while next year saw a decrease from  1 79 to  1 60 The Zacks Rank is built on the movement of earnings estimates   When estimates move down  the Rank tends to follow  3 Tech Stocks Under  10 to Buy NowHere at Zacks  we don t generally classify stocks as  cheap  or  expensive   and rather than looking at the stock s face value  we have a system that puts an emphasis on earnings estimate revisions to find stocks that will hopefully be winners for investors That being said  low priced stocks can be attractive to smaller investors that can t necessarily afford large stakes in companies with higher priced stocks When looking at these low priced stocks  we can look at the same trends in growth  value  and momentum and apply the Zacks Rank to properly analyze the potential that these companies have  We are also keenly aware of the latest sector trends and make sure to cover all of the hottest industries Today we ve highlighted three stocks that fall into the broad  technology  sector  Each of these three stocks is currently trading for less than  10 per share and holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  or better  Take a look at the strong estimate revision activity and other factors that make these tech companies stick out right now 1        SITO Mobile  Ltd Prior Close   3 60SITO Mobile is a provider of location based advertising and mobile messaging platforms that allow brands to launch targeted mobile advertising campaigns  The stock is sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and the company has witnessed strong earnings estimate revision activity and is now expected to improve its bottom line by 94  in the current fiscal year That earnings growth is projected to come on the back of 25  revenue growth  The company is still expected to be in the red this year  but earnings are estimated to turn positive soon  and EPS expansion is expected to reach an annualized rate of 25  over the next three to five years  Meanwhile  the stock is trading with a respectable P S ratio of 2 1 2        Camtek Ltd Prior Close   7 88Camtek is a developer of automatic optical inspection systems that are used to enhance both production processes and yield for manufacturers in the circuit board and semiconductor industries  After posting better than expected earnings results last week  CAMT has moved to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and its resulting share price surge has earned it an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system Camtek is also an exciting growth pick  with EPS figures expected to improve by 81 5  in the current fiscal year and an additional 25 5  in 2019  Still  the stock is trading with a Forward P E of just 16 1 and a P S of 2 8 so its valuation is hardly stretched considering its rapid expansion opportunities 3        Attunity Ltd Prior Close   9 61Attunity is a provider of software solutions that enable access  management  sharing  and distribution of data across enterprise platforms and the Cloud  The stock is currently holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and looks like one of our hottest growth

3844,225359,CAMT,5 Best Performing Stocks Of May,opinion,"Markets notched up gains once again last month  with tech stocks leading the pack  Indications emerged that the Fed was going to trim its balance sheet even as investors prepared for rate hikes  Meanwhile  the Trump trade petered out even as the President dismissed the FBI director and released budget proposals which were mostly in line with expectations 
The OPEC led output cut deal received an extension which failed to boost oil prices  At the same time  economic data remained mixed even as GDP figures experienced an upward revision 
May s Performance
For the month  the Nasdaq  S P 500 and Dow advanced 2 5   1 2  and 0 3   respectively  During the month  the Federal Open Market Committee released minutes which indicated that Fed officials were in favor of trimming down the central bank s  4 5 trillion balance sheet 
The Trump administration released its budget proposal which seeks to cut federal spending by  3 6 trillion with a focus on balancing the budget over the next decade  Moreover  Trump discharged Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   James Comey from office  Meanwhile  U S  auto industry reported disappointing sales in April  with sales hitting 16 88 million  below an expected annual rate of 17 2 million 
Mixed Domestic Data
Economic reports released in May were mostly mixed in nature  The ISM manufacturing index experienced a decline in April Construction spending contracted while factory orders increased at a slower pace than in February  Additionally  consumer confidence declined from 119 4 in April to 117 9 in May  Retail sales increased at a faster pace in April  even though it came in under estimates  The ISM services index notched up gains for the 88th consecutive month 
In contrast  industrial production recorded a growth of 1  in April  marking its largest increase since February 2014  The leading indicators index increased by 0 3   Consumer spending increased at its fastest pace since Dec 2016 in April even as incomes continued to rise  Both CPI and PPI moved higher  But even though PCE inflation increased by 0 2   the annual rate slowed to a 1 7  gain  lower than the pace recorded in March and well below the Fed s target of 2  
Q1 GDP Revised Upward
As per the  second  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  real gross domestic product  GDP  increased at an annual rate of 1 2  in the first quarter of 2017  It also beat analysts  estimate of 0 9  and was an improvement over Q1 s gain of 0 8   Moreover  corporate profits increased 3 7  year over year in the first three months of 2017  despite falling 1 9  from the fourth quarter of last year 
Additionally  after a temporary pullback  both consumer spending and business investment gained traction  Consumer spending  which accounts for a bulk of U S  economic output  was revised upward from the preliminary reading of 0 3  to 0 6  in the second estimate  Also  business investment rose 11 9  in the first quarter  which is better than the previous estimate of 9 4  
Housing Sector Recovery Stutters
The U S  housing sector recovery remained on track despite the release of discouraging data on the sector  Housing starts declined 2 6  to an annual rate of 1 17 million while building permits also moved 2 5  lower  Existing home sales declined 2 3  in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 57 million  lagging the consensus estimate of 5 65 million 
New home sales declined by 11 4  to 569 000  in April 2017  also coming in below the consensus estimate of 610 000  The pending home sales index also suffering a similar fate  losing 1 3  to come in at 109 8 in April 
Shrinking supply has led to price levels increasing at the sharpest pace in almost three years  Consequently  the Case Shiller 20 city home price index gained 5 9  on a yearly basis  However  market watchers still think that though the recovery is weakening  it is likely to continue  In keeping with such a view  the NAHB Housing Market index increased from 68 to 70 in May  marking its second highest reading since the recession of 2008 
Job Additions Rise  Unemployment Slips
The U S  economy added 211 000 jobs in April  higher than the estimated level of 193 000  The strong payroll growth number was attributable to increase in jobs in leisure and hospitality  health care and social assistance  financial activities  and mining sectors 
Meanwhile  unemployment rate declined marginally from 4 5  to 4 4  in April  marking its lowest level since May 2007  The number of unemployed persons was 7 1 million  in April  The unemployment rate fell by 0 6  and the number of unemployed declined by 854 000 over the year  The  U 6   considered to be a broader measure of the unemployment as it includes those workers who are working part time for purely economic reasons  declined to 8 6  
Payrolls data also showed that the hourly pay rose 2 5  over the last twelve months  In April  average hourly wages for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 7 cents to  26 19  Additionally  the labor force participation rate for April changed little and held steady at 62 9  
OPEC Output Cut Deal Extended
Oil prices recorded their third consecutive monthly loss in May even though the much awaited OPEC deal extension actually came through  Prospects that the deal would receive an extension buoyed oil prices over last month to a certain extent  Ultimately  on May 25  OPEC and 11 non OPEC players decided to maintain to maintain existing production curbs for another nine months  
Despite such a move  crude went south as the broader market was expecting deeper cut from the oil producers or at least an extension of the prevailing curb for another 12 months   Read   
Market watchers now think that the output cut extension and the summer driving season will be unable to dent global supplies significantly  The latest EIA data  which depicts a 6 3  increase in production year over year  hasn t helped matters  Over the month  prices declined by nearly 2 1  and West Texas Crude is currently languishing at a sub  50 per barrel level 
Earnings Growth Hits Record Pace in Q1
The Q1 earnings season is effectively over now  with results from 492 S P 500 members already out  Total earnings for these companies are up  13 5  from the same period last year on  7 2  higher revenues  with 72 6  beating EPS estimates and 65 2  beating revenue estimates 
These results represent a notable improvement over what we have been seeing from the same group of companies in other recent periods  While growth reached the highest level in more than 5 years  a bigger proportion of companies have been able to beat estimates  particularly revenue estimates 
 For the Retail sector  total Q1 earnings are up  1 7  from the same period last year on  3 1  higher revenues  with 60  beating EPS estimates and 50  beating revenue estimates  The sector s Q1 results have been below other recent periods and are also among the weakest of all sectors this reporting cycle   Read   
Trump Trade Peters Out
By the second week of the month  U S  stocks were hovering near fresh highs  with Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   s market value breaking the  800 billion mark for the first time  as the earnings trade replaced the Trump trade  President Trump terminated and removed FBI Director Comey on May 9  a development that few saw coming  This decision made equity strategists emphasize that the days of the Trump trade were over   Read   
Earlier in May  Trump finally secured the necessary votes from House Republicans to pass the bill for repealing and replacing Obamacare with the revised American Health Care Act  AHCA   However  the fate of the bill is still uncertain  as it requires the Senate s approval before it goes to Trump for his signature   Read   
The only White House related development which left investors unperturbed was Trump s budget proposal  which was more or less in line with expectations  Trump s budget seeks to reduce federal spending by  3 6 trillion through cuts in healthcare and food assistance programs  However  the budget assumes the Trump administration will lower tax rates for corporate and households 
Fed Minutes Hint at Balance Sheet Trim
As per minutes released from the Federal Reserve s meeting held on 2 3 May  the central bank officials agreed to trim down its  4 5 trillion balance sheet  The Fed holds a massive portfolio of government debt  generated by purchasing treasury and mortgage backed securities in the years after the financial crisis  According to the minutes  the central bank hinted that it may start unwinding the balance sheet later this year 
So far  the central bank has been reinvesting the proceeds it receives from maturing securities in more bonds  The central bank called for gradual reduction in the amount of bonds it would be purchasing each month  Fed is expected to set cap limits on the amount of securities it will agree to roll off each month without reinvesting  According to minutes  caps would be set at lower levels in an initial stage and then would be raised every three months 
In its minutes  the Fed indicated that it may raise interest rates in its next meeting in June  The minutes also revealed that most of the Fed policymakers agreed that it would  soon  be time to hike interest rates  Strong rate hike prospects and Fed s proposal to unwind its balance sheet boosted investor sentiment

Gains Likely to Continue in June
June typically marks the beginning of weak summer trade  Be it Lehman Bros  collapse or the Fed s stimulus scale back or Greece s running out of money or the more recent  Brexit     investors have had to absorb all these shocks in the month of June  But  rather than markets dealing with such big setbacks  the most likely outcome this time around will be a gradual uptick since economic and earnings scenarios are reassuring   Read   
Investors will look toward encouraging economic data for support as the month progresses  If key indicators including GDP undergo upward improvements  gains are likely to continue for the bourses in the weeks ahead 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

20736,242251,CAMT,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love Camtek  CAMT ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Camtek Ltd    NASDAQ CAMT   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CAMT s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for CamtekA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 19 3  compared to an industry average of 0 4   CAMT is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for CamtekWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of CAMT  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 24 7  to 2 3  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 152 8   Clearly  CAMT is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors  CAMT Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with CAMT as of late too Over the past two months  one earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that one estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago CAMT was expected to post earnings of 28 cents share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of 36 cents for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have CAMT as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep CAMT on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term 5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-camtek-(camt)-200189182,200189182
