187851,409367,VFC,Why VF Corp Stock Just Dropped 10 ,news,"What happened
Shareholders of VF Corp  NYSE VFC  stock are having a very bad day 
The apparel company behind such iconic brands as Vans shoes  Timberland boots  and North Face jackets announced its fiscal third quarter 2020 earnings this morning  Sales of  3 4 billion narrowly missed analyst expectations of  3 43 billion in sales  while  adjusted  earnings of  1 23 per share edged out analyst predictions of only  1 21  Now  VF stock is down an even 10  as of 1 30 p m  EST 
Why 

So what
Despite  missing estimates   VF Corp s sales were still up 5  year over year  led by Vans sales up 12  and  especially  revenue coming out of China up 30   On the other hand  its  outdoor  segment sales rose only 3  year over year   
Improvements in operating profit margins helped lift operating profits 11   Rising expenses  however  dragged the company s net profit back down  with the result that GAAP net income did not rise at all for VF    it earned  1 16 per diluted share a year ago  and  1 16 per share again in Q3 2020 
Now what
That lack of earnings growth  however  doesn t appear to be the primary factor spooking investors today  Rather  investor fears are focusing on guidance for the remainder of fiscal year 2020 
To wit  management warned that although its sales are expected to continue rising at a 5  rate for the full year  and earnings from continuing operations are still expected to grow even more strongly  up 15    the end result will be only  3 30 per share in profit  That sounds good at first  but because VF had previously predicted that its earnings would range from  3 32 per share to  3 37 per share  16  to 18  growth   investors are interpreting the new guidance as a warning of an impending earnings  miss  in the fourth quarter  Taken in conjunction with today s miss  that would be back to back disappointments    pretty bad news 
It looks like today  investors aren t interested in sticking around to see if the news ends up being as bad as that sounds ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pm14m,2066417

Steve Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Joe  and good morning  everyone  Our third quarter performance was strong and our year to date results are at the high end of our long term growth objectives and we re on track to deliver solid performance this year and we are well positioned for continued growth and value creation in fiscal  21  Before we review our third quarter results and adjusted outlook for the year  I d like to take a moment and comment on the news we disclosed Tuesday morning regarding our intent to explore strategic alternatives for the Occupational Work  portion of our Work segment  hereafter referred to as Occupational Work Brands  Scott will cover the specifics  but I d like to highlight a few messages from the announcement materials Driving and optimizing our portfolio continues to be a top strategic priority for VF and exploring strategic alternatives for our Occupational Work Brand is the next natural step in that process  Our decision reflects management s continued focus on transforming VF into a more consumer minded retail centric enterprise with a portfolio of more growth oriented outdoor  active  and Work brands  First  it is important to note that the Dickies and Timberland PRO brand  Phonetic  is part of our review  We remain fully committed to these brands as well as our worthy work purpose territory  There are fundamental differences between the Occupational Work Brands and the Dickies and Timberland PRO brands  including the ability to connect directly with consumers  distribution footprint  supply chain infrastructure and financial profile The leadership teams within our Occupational Work Brands have done an excellent job building these businesses over many years putting VF in an ideal position to find the best future owner for these brands to better enable their next phase of growth and success  In terms of timing  the review process is under way and we will keep you appraised as things evolve over the next few months  Now  let s review our third quarter results and the current state of our business As we head into the final quarter  we remain confident in our ability to deliver another strong year at the high end of our long range plan  Year to date organic constant dollar revenue and EPS increased 8  and 16  respectively  driven by our two largest brands and our International and D2C growth platforms  Our strategic growth drivers performed well over the holiday season and were all    and we are well positioned as we look toward fiscal 2021  For the quarter  revenue increased 6  or 7  excluding the Occupational Work Brands just discussed  While our revenue performance for the quarter was generally in line with our long term algorithm  it was slightly below our expectations due primarily to the performance at Timberland  more challenging conditions in our Occupational Work Brands as well as a mixed holiday season in the US Despite the revenue shortfall  the quality of our growth remains strong as evidenced by 100   Phonetic  basis points of gross margin expansion  12  operating income growth and 14  EPS growth  Our performance during the quarter highlights the diversity and resiliency of our operating model and the momentum we have across our strategic growth drivers  Now let me turn to the performance of our largest brands Vans continues to deliver strong balanced performance across all regions and above its stated long term growth objective  Revenue for Vans increased 13  in the quarter and importantly growth remains well diversified across product categories  channels and geographies  Heritage footwear increased 8   Progression increased more than 30   and Apparel increased 14   Following another quarter of broad based momentum  we are again raising our fiscal 2020 outlook for Vans  We now expect revenue for Vans to increase about 15  for the full year  well ahead of its long term target Moving on to The North Face  Revenue increased 8  in the quarter led by our International business  Growth was balanced across both our D2C and wholesale channels globally and we saw solid performance in our Urban Exploration and Mountain Lifestyle product territories as the brand continues to attract new consumers and capitalize on growth opportunities beyond the core Mountain Sports  Footwear also increased at a high single digit rate during the quarter  In Mountain Sports  strong performance internationally was somewhat offset by more mixed results in the US market  While limited in scope  the performance of FutureLight well exceeded our expectations during the key holiday season and continues to cast a strong halo for the brand  The disruptive innovation has been available to consumers for about four months now and we re seeing 4 times the sales volume in our Pinnacle Summit  Steep  and Flight Series products which feature the FutureLight technology Given our holiday performance and additional visibility through the end of the year  we now expect revenue for The North Face to increase about 9  at the high end of its long term growth objective  Despite early signs of success this year  our results in Timberland were disappointing this holiday season and its revenue decreased 4  in the quarter  Solid momentum in apparel  outdoor footwear and China was not enough to offset challenging conditions in men s footwear in the Americas and Europe  particularly in our classics business  Men s  non classics  and women s performed relatively better as our diversification strategy continues to evolve  As a result of the third quarter performance and improved visibility through the rest of the year  we are lowering our revenue outlook for the Timberland brand in fiscal 2020 and now expect full year revenue to decline between 1  and 2  And last but not least  as expected  the Dickies brand had a great quarter as revenue increased 13   Growth was strong across all key strategic growth drivers highlighted by 68  growth in China and 16  growth in digital with category momentum across icons and new seasonal product  After a flat first half  we had high expectations for the Dickies brand heading into the back half of this fiscal year and the global teams delivered  The brand launched its Yours to Make marketing campaign this quarter  the largest in brand history  driving significant brand heat and consumer engagement  We expect another quarter of double digit growth providing us with strong momentum as we head into fiscal 2021  We continue to be bullish about the growth opportunities at Dickies and are even more confident in our fiscal 2020 revenue growth outlook of 5  to 6  Over the last few quarters  we ve discussed a more uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and the impact that this had on our business results and forward outlook  As we exit the holiday season  I d like to briefly provide our perspective on business conditions across our largest markets  US economic backdrop remains generally solid led by a healthy consumer and low unemployment  That said  we believe performance across retail and our sector was mixed during the holiday season  While inventory levels at retail were in good shape heading into the fall winter period  sell through performance in certain categories was slower than expected  which has led to elevated inventories in select areas and a more promotional environment In Europe  international trade and the Brexit uncertainty have impacted business confidence and investment  However  consumer confidence and spending remains relatively strong  Our EMEA business accelerated in the third quarter and our outlook is generally bullish across the region  In Asia  our brands continue to perform very well in China despite continued unrest in Hong Kong  The recent phase 1 trade deal between China and the US should yield a more constructive consumer and retail environment As I talked about in Beaver Creek  our strategy is to become more consumer minded  retail centric and hyper digital in all that we do  Transforming how we operate is essential to our ability to create value for shareholders and stakeholders  We are in the early stages of our journey and as our work progresses  we increasingly gain clarity on what s required to achieve our vision  As we exit fiscal 2020 and transition into fiscal 2021  we will focus our investments on four key programs The first is to gain a deeper understanding of new and existing consumers  We will further focus our investments on driving proprietary  real time consumer and marketplace knowledge to establish emotional connections  guide personalization  inspire must have products and create consumer centric experiences that enable lifelong loyal relationships The second is developing a more digitally enabled responsive go to market approach  We will increasingly leverage more end to end digital platforms  go to market processes and best practices and manufacturing innovation to help our brands create and deliver high value products and experiences to consumers whenever and wherever they want The third is a more seamless integration across physical and digital touch points  We will work to provide a seamless and consistent brand experience across and between all consumer touch points  be it digital  physical  owned and partnered  and strategic wholesale accounts The fourth is the construction of more robust engagement models that help build and create enduring relationships  We will invest and leverage best of breed marketing and technology platforms and enable our brands to drive new consumer acquisition and build stronger loyalty through personalized engagement Our transformation journey is a multi year endeavor  Investments over the past 2 5 years have laid the foundation that we ll now begin to build on  We have an aggressive agenda and look forward to providing more details and updating you on our progress against these programs as the years unfold  Before turning the call over to Scott  I d like to highlight that on December 5th  we launched our latest sustainability and responsibility report  Made for Change  This report outlines our aspirations for advancing environmental and social improvements across our enterprise and communities worldwide  Included in the report will be publicly announced new ambitious science based targets and commitments around our use of sustainable materials aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions  Details behind these commitments highlights from the last reporting year  and the value this work adds to our business and stakeholders can be found in the report Consistent with our commitment to be a purpose led enterprise  VF has established a clear position as a leader in the work to combat global climate change  Looking ahead and with our Made for Change strategy providing the roadmap  we will strengthen our role as a company that is leading meaningful initiatives that not only lessen our impact on the planet  but also drive purpose led profitable growth for our business and brands And with that  I ll turn it over to Scott Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve  and good morning  everyone  We were pleased with our strong third quarter performance and we remain on track to deliver revenue and earnings growth above our long term commitments  Before we review our third quarter results and adjusted outlook in more detail  I d like to make a few comments related to the announcement made Tuesday morning of our intent to explore strategic alternatives for the Occupational Work Brands  In summary  we intend to sell the brands comprising our Work segment excluding the Dickies and Timberland PRO brands  The Occupational Work Brands include VF s legacy Imagewear business as well as several brands acquired with the Williamson Dickie transaction As a reminder  this is primarily a B2B wholesale business and represents the majority of VF s existing own manufacturing footprint  These brands tend to be more cyclical in nature and have minimal exposure to VF s International and D2C growth platforms  From a financial standpoint  the Occupational Work Brands contributed about  865 million of revenue and  130 million of adjusted operating income in fiscal 2019  As Steve mentioned  the review process is under way and we will provide further details as the process unfolds over the next few months  So  now let s review our third quarter results Overall  our performance was strong  The brands and platforms that are core drivers of our long term growth objectives performed well during the holiday season and the fundamentals of our business remain intact  While parts of the portfolio did not fully meet our expectations  in aggregate  we were pleased with our results despite a mixed holiday season in the US  Our performance in the third quarter highlights the diversity and resiliency of both our portfolio and operating model  two themes we spoke about in detail during our Investor Day in Beaver Creek For the third quarter  total VF revenue increased 6  organically  And if you exclude the Occupational Work Brands  the growth rate becomes 7   a full point higher driven by our largest brands  Growth was relatively balanced by channel in the third quarter as D2C increased 7   including 17  growth in digital and a 6  total comp  and wholesale increased 4  Moving on to our performance by geographic region  Revenue increased 9  internationally and 3  in the US  including the Occupational Work Brands  Strength internationally was driven by 15  growth in Asia  including more than 30  growth in China which benefited by about 5 points from the timing of shipments ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday  Our EMEA business also delivered another solid quarter with 7  organic growth led by 13  D2C growth  including an 11  comp and 30  growth in digital Our fundamentals remain strong as gross margin expanded 100 basis points organically driven by continued favorable mix shift toward higher margin businesses and the timing of foreign currency transaction gains  Operating margin also expanded 100 basis points representing 12  growth in operating profit despite a 9  increase in strategic investment spending  And excluding the Occupational Work Brands  operating profit increased by 15   And to round out the P L  EPS increased 14  to  1 23 which includes the occupational portion of our Work segment Moving to the balance sheet  Inventory excluding the Occupational Work Brands increased 8  or 12  for total VF  Our inventory is a little elevated However  we re comfortable with the quality and expect inventory growth to be in line with top line growth by the end of the year  Leverage at the end of the quarter remains below our long term target of 2 times as we balance cash returns with capacity to pursue our M A agenda  We returned approximately  700 million to shareholders this quarter through dividends and a  500 million share repurchase  While M A is our top capital allocation priority  cash returns to shareholders remain a key component of our TSR algorithm Now turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook  As you saw in the release this morning  we are adjusting our fiscal 2020 outlook following our performance this holiday season and increased visibility for the full year  We now expect revenue to be about  11 75 billion representing 7  growth on an organic constant dollar basis  Excluding Occupational Work Brands  our updated outlook represents growth of over 8   By brand  we re raising our outlook for Vans to about 15  growth  which compares to our prior expectation of 13  to 14  growth  We re tightening the outlook for The North Face to about 9  growth  We now expect Timberland to decline between 1  and 2   which compares to our prior expectation of 1  to 2  growth  And lastly  we re holding our outlook for Dickies at 5  to 6  growth as the business continues to gain momentum We expect our strategic growth platforms  D2C and International  to continue to perform well through the remainder of fiscal 2020  We now expect growth in D2C to be between 10  and 11  versus our prior expectation of 12  to 13  growth  And from a geographic perspective  we now expect our International business to increase about 9   which compares to our prior outlook of 8  to 9  growth  We continue to see gross margin expanding 80 basis points to 54 1  and operating margin expanding 90 basis points to 13 8   We now expect EPS to approximate  3 30 representing about 18  growth  This compares to our prior outlook of  3 32 to  3 37  which represented 19  to 21  growth  Relative to our prior outlook  the reduction in EPS was driven by the performance of Timberland brand and the Occupational Work Brands partially offset by strength in the Vans brand As we head into the last quarter of the fiscal year  we are on track to deliver revenue and earnings growth at or above the long term commitments we laid out in Beaver Creek in late September  Three of our four largest brands are performing at or above their long term growth objectives  And as a reminder  our top 2 brands  Vans and The North Face account for over 80  of our growth in the long range plan  Our strategic growth platforms  International and D2C are strong and well positioned to sustain their growth momentum heading into fiscal 2021  And given our intended actions with our Work segment  we re taking another step to optimize our portfolio  simplify our business and elevate our focus on our largest properties and growth opportunities The fundamentals of our business are strong  We are executing well and we remain confident in our long range organic plan and our ability to deliver on our mid teen TSR commitment  And our balance sheet is primed and positioned to capitalize on M A opportunities that have the potential to drive incremental growth and value creation to our organic plan So with that  we ll now turn the call back to the operator and take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question today is coming from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities  Your line is now live Bob Drbul    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystHey  guys  Good morning  Just two questions from me  I guess the first one is on the Timberland performance  can you just talk to sort of the turn in the Timberland or sort of what needs to happen within that business and sort of the timeline on it  And then the second question I have is just can you expand a little bit more on your inventory levels and sort of maybe inventories in the channel in terms of what you see heading into calendar 2020  Thanks Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Bob  This is Steve  So Timberland  just be really frank with everybody here  we are not pleased with our performance  We re disappointed and our assumption is you are disappointed as well  And where we find ourselves is this is an iconic brand with deep rich heritage and we remain very committed to the strategy that we laid out to you all in Beaver Creek  A lot of foundational work has been done around the brand to really understand the consumer and put together the brand architecture that helps drive the most important aspects of our strategy  which is elevating our product  We talk to you a lot about diversity  diversifying our product offer  We absolutely need to do that to move beyond classics in our men s business to the non classics  but we have to continue to see good growth in our women s apparel and PRO businesses  And concurrent with that is we have to find a way to more intimately connect and engage with consumers as we drive the new brand foundation forward We are not where we d like to be  But I think we are very  very convicted that this brand is one that our skills can absolutely unlock and the diversification strategy that we have in place absolutely gives us confidence that it can be done  I think it s interesting  if you look at the results this quarter  our apparel business was strong  our PRO business was strong  our women s business contributed and in aggregate  those businesses are about half of the total Timberland revenue  Where we need to continue to grow is in the men s classic and non classics  And we laid out that vision in Beaver Creek of the work that needs to be done with the new design teams  the new merchandising skills to drive that turnaround  And we remain very convicted  but don t let me leave you thinking that we are at all pleased  We re disappointed and continue to work very hard with the leadership team there at Timberland to put this business in the right place Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And Bob  as it relates to the inventory levels  I think you re talking about retail inventories  And Steve s comments and mine as well talked about a mixed holiday performance  a little  little softer than our expectation in a few areas and the knock on effect of that is inventory levels are a little elevated  We also know that the promotional environment started a little earlier and went deeper than we were in some cases  And so  what we ve laid out is a plan for the balance of the year to address that  We think that s baked into our guidance  And as I said in the prepared remarks  our expectation is both from our inventory and from a retail inventory that we ll exit this year in good shape  So  back in three months and we ll give you an update on how that progress Bob Drbul    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystGreat  Thanks very much  guys Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bob OperatorThank you  Our next question today is coming from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group  Your line is now live Dana Telsey    Telsey Advisory Group    AnalystHi  Good morning  everyone  As you think about the performance by region  certainly seems like EMEA and China did well  Any break out by brand on what happened in the Americas by channel  whether it s wholesale or direct  in terms of what you re seeing  And then just on Vans  what we should be looking for there going forward  You took up the guidance to 15  for the full year  What should we look for as we go to fiscal  21  Thank you Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerDana  this is Steve  So  I think you actually captured  Our International business was quite good  Europe continues to do well in an environment that isn t necessarily that strong and our Asia business led by China continues to perform very well  Here in the US to our prepared remarks  we saw an uptick in the promotional activity starting pretty early and specifically with our cold weather brands and the results there really hit The North Face and Timberland  And we saw a drop in traffic in our retail  in the notes and you can see it in our slides  we did see a reduction in growth within our brick and mortar In the case of Vans  we had good e commerce pickup  but we saw weakness in The North Face and Timberland on that e commerce side and we do really relate that to the early promotional activity  We did not respond  I think if you remember back three or four years  we did quite a bit of work around rightsizing the channel for distribution  shoring up the promotional activity that we participated in  and we really took the long view and wanted to preserve the integrity and quality of our brand position and with our    within our own environments  we did not chase that promotional environment Some might argue that we should have  but we really do believe that from a long view shoring up that quality and integrity of the brand position is very  very important  And I also would tell you in the case of our North Face business  we are rebuilding a team  They just went through a very significant relocation  and in that our D2C and digital teams are new  We believe we ve got a very strong if not stronger team and our ability to now really engage and drive that particular platform will be back in our control as this team settles into their new position and understands the total brand strategy that they re driving Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And Dana  relative to your question on Vans  I guess the big picture answer is we really don t see anything fundamentally different  right  We just did a 15   which we know is ahead of our long range plan  But we also talked about the soft landing or controlled descent  whatever you want to call it  that we planned on  and we really don t see anything fundamentally different on a forward basis Dana Telsey    Telsey Advisory Group    AnalystThank you Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dana OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse  Your line is now live Michael Binetti    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  guys  thanks for taking our questions here  I wanted to ask about Vans and actives    the active segment margins for a second  They re down a little bit in the quarter  but you guys went through a huge period of growth with Vans and the margins being down in this quarter after being up a lot in the first half of the year  As we look ahead to next year and your fiscal  21  how should we think about the margin compression that we saw in the third quarter  I know you have some tough comparisons lapping the first half of this year and then I know the longer term structural drivers like D2C and International drive this high over the long term  So  it s easy to see that being the case as you get into the second half of your fiscal year next year  But I m thinking more the near term  does the margin need to normalize a little bit in the first half of next year while you lap those big comp growth rates and margin expansion from the first half of fiscal  20 Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Mike  Great question  So the third quarter  you really have to broaden out and look at the full year picture because there is some timing quarter to quarter  What you should expect for the full year is that the margin growth rate will more or less approximate the top line growth rate and that was the way we planned this business  because we re investing back into the growth of Vans and that was something I think we ve been talking about for a while here And the great news with this business is given its gross margin profile  that is really the fuel that allows us to continue to invest back into the business  So as we look forward  we don t see anything structurally different  I m not going to give guidance for next year at this point  but those gross margins and that growth rate will continue to fuel the investment capacity to allow us to invest back into the brand Michael Binetti    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Let me back up and ask about some of the Beaver Creek stuff for a second  I m trying to roll forward the algorithm you laid out just a few months ago at that Analyst Day given what we know about the occupational group at this point  So if our starting point was a 7 to 8 year    sorry  a 7  to 8  revenue CAGR for five years  does that    does the sale of occupational move us up to the 8  to 9  range for the next five years  And I know the occupational business has higher margins about 15  in the overall Company  but I guess we don t know what the gross margin or SG A improvement was baked into the plan relative to the corporate algorithm  So  could you just help us think about how the sale influences the plans for  about 40 basis points of EBIT margin expansion per year and EPS of 12  to 14  per year Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So again  we re not going to revise the long term algorithm  I d say  Michael  it s not materially different  And if you think about the go forward  we know today that certain things are developing somewhat differently  Timberland is a little slower in its acceleration curve  that s moving to the right  On the other hand  you re right  the sale of occupational will have a tailwind from a growth standpoint  But I guess at this point  we re not changing our full view and we don t really see a material difference Michael Binetti    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thanks a lot for the help Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Erinn Murphy from Piper Sandler  Your line is now live Erinn Murphy    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good morning  A couple of questions for me  I guess first just on The North Face  I think you guys indicated that the men s business performed much better than the women s  Can you just kind of expound on what drove that  Was it competition in the women s side that  maybe it was a little bit softer  And relatedly with the FutureLight  excuse me  you ve had it for four months in your direct channel  Can you just talk about the rollout strategies over the next 12 months  Our wholesale account starting to book for spring  where should we see it kind of show up Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Erinn  I ll take your question  So  good call out  Our men s business in The North Face was good  We saw solid growth across really all three of the brand territories  Mountain Sports  Mountain Life and Urban Ex  but really I think it was the Mountain Life and Urban Ex where we saw strong growth  Our women s business in the Americas underperformed and to my earlier comments around the early move to promotional environment  we believe had an impact on our business  Potentially there was some increased competition  and that may have taken some of that  But I think it really comes down to our market segmentation strategy and how we ve set our businesses up to succeed  And going forward  The North Face can really take learnings out of this quarter and apply it to next fall as they think about the wholesale and retail mix of those core women s style Women s continues to be one of the primary growth drivers that Arne laid out in the Beaver Creek conversation and it s a very  very important aspect of the long term growth  We really see this as a point in time not a long term trend and one that we feel confident will not be one that we keep  On the FutureLight question really  we re really happy with where we are  We re seeing that in the prepared remarks  4 times the sales of the Summit  Steep and Flight Series  where FutureLight products are represented  We really have been able to really reposition the brand with these collections with that core consumer  What we found is that the educational element of FutureLight is a significant task in the future and we ve invested heavily around driving the brand and driving the education But this is such a disruptive innovation and how the garment feels  how the government performs is markedly different than anything that we ve seen and been able to use over the last 30 years  And the work to drive that education  that understanding will continue into fiscal  21  fiscal  22 as the product line continues to expand  You will see an expanded offer in spring  20 going on market in rainwear and moving into some more approachable price points  The Dryzzle rain jacket at  229 will be the opening price point with FutureLight  That is a very strong historical seller and we think this will be yet another moment to truly raise the awareness  inform the consumer  and as we do that continue to set ourselves up for future expansion in the coming fall and years after Erinn Murphy    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you  I appreciate that  And then just one quick follow up for Scott  Scott  just on the digital growth  I think you guys referenced why it was weaker at 17  with just Timberland and North Face  But how do you see digital growing in the fourth quarter  and as we get into 2021  should it return back to the longer term CAGR of 24  to 25   Thank you Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We get    I think Steve unpacked what we understand at this point are the drivers for why we saw the moderated performance  We re obviously taking some actions  I mentioned some of those  in terms of promotion  also just in the way that we re communicating and the feedback loop  One of the things that we have is good insight into consumer feedback and we re making adoptions where we can  So we ll see some improvement  but not all the way back to the long term algorithm  Going forward  we see no reason why we can t achieve that  Again  the reasons for the underperformance I think Steve unpacked earlier Erinn Murphy    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  OK  Thank you  all Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Erinn OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Sam Poser from Susquehanna  Your line is now live Sam Poser    Susquehanna    AnalystGood morning  Thank you for taking my question  I just want to follow up  I have two questions  One to follow up on Timberland and what s really    what s being done there to sort of invigorate the    I would call it the core heritage business away from what the classic yellow boot type businesses and when will we potentially begin to see that in earnest given the current deceleration in this plan Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Sam  So  fair question and one that I absolutely expected from you  We    in my earlier comments around Timberland and the classics business  With    as Martino laid out in Beaver Creek  we ve done a lot of work over the last couple of years of really understanding the consumer and really helping us reframe and rethink the brand architecture and how that drives the creative aspect of the business  As we laid out  we ve added new design talent  Christopher Raeburn coming on  the teams  they surround him  the merchandising organization  Sam  what we have to do is not only diversify the product  but we have to elevate the product  I mean we need to really think about the aesthetics  we need to think about the finish  We re opening up some new sourcing avenues  accessing better manufacturing  which will put an elevated offer from both materials and aesthetics into the consumer frame The samples that we re seeing right now give us confidence  That s why earlier on  I said  we remain very convicted that this is a brand that we can drive  And I think to your point on timing  I think you re not going to see it in a dramatic way in fiscal  21  To Scott s comment  we don t see fiscal  21 as a year where we re going to see breakout performance across the full assortment  We do think our apparel business will continue to drive good double digit growth as we re seeing right now  Our PRO business will continue to be a good performer  Our women s business here in the Americas is good and we ll continue to drive that  But the energy around the men s classic and the non classic diversification will be a major focus  And it will really be that following year where we think you ll start to see the evidence and the proof points of that work  And they re really driving off that rich heritage  tapping into that outdoor heritage and those styles that you know so well  will be really top of mind for us Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Sam  I just like to add on too  As we think about where we re at in this brand and what the near to mid term looks like  just to build on Steve s comment  remember part of our strategy is to build the diversified offer but more lifestyle offer and we have some evidence of that  as Steve mentioned  with apparel  But that really enables our D2C growth  but the reality is  this brand today has about 25  of the overall distribution sitting in D2C  So  that large wholesale footprint particularly in the US coupled with the performance we just had at the holiday and the attendant inventory overhang that comes with that means we re going to struggle to grow next year as many of the wholesalers base their next year buys and the order books are set based on the performance they just saw  So I think we have to have a severe assessment of where we re at  And next year  we re not giving guidance per se  but we will struggle to grow as we look at next year in the Timberland brand Sam Poser    Susquehanna    AnalystThank you  And then secondly  can you give us some idea of the percent of sales within the Occupational Work business by quarter just to help us sort of forecast forward with and without that business  And can you give us some idea of how you re foreseeing the occupational business to be on a year over year basis in full year  20 now that we re almost through it vis a vis the release from last year s revenue Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So on the first part  there is some seasonality  but it s fairly balanced on a full year basis  Sam  And I m sorry  could you repeat the second part of your question Sam Poser    Susquehanna    AnalystCan you give us some idea  it was  835 million or  65  Phonetic  million last year  Can you give us some idea of where you re thinking that s going to end up this year or where you see it   Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Flat to slightly down is where we see it for the balance of the year Sam Poser    Susquehanna    AnalystAnd what would be the peak quarter of sales for that business Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I m not going to get into that level of detail  Just    I just refer you back to my earlier comment  Sam from the base of the business Sam Poser    Susquehanna    AnalystAll right  Thanks so much  Have a great    good luck to you Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Sam OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI  Your line is now live Omar Saad    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks for taking my question  Good morning  I wanted to ask about the spin off  Actually the spin offs at this point now with Kontoor in the rear view mirror and the announcement around the workwear decision to sell that business  obviously you re reshaping the portfolio to align with kind of the core competency of the Company and the long term goals  but it also seems like you may be clearing the decks a little bit here  Does it make it easier to do a larger acquisition in the future once this is    this like  kind of last piece is done in terms of the portfolio reshaping  Is that an appropriate way to think about it  Maybe you could frame it for us And then I had a second question on Urban Exploration within The North Face  what you learned in the quarter  How we should think about that component within The North Face over the next    over the long term  what the opportunity is there  Thanks Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Omar  I ll start here  So I m not    I don t think we re in a position to talk to you about the size or magnitude of the acquisitions that our last two dispositions maybe putting us in a position for  But what I would tell you that M A remains at number 1 priority for capital allocation  We    I think have been very clear with our total addressable market where we see the opportunity  And as we simplify and focus our portfolio around brands that really can connect more intimately with consumers and have a direct contact through own distribution and key partners  I think gives you a good sense of where we re looking and where we think we can add value to our portfolio  But absolute size would be difficult to really call out for you right now Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And I d just build on to that  The focus and simplification of the model really helped as you think about future activity  right  So  one just data point x or at the end of this transaction  our portfolio at 12 brands will be roughly half of what it was just a couple of years ago Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBut really aligned with that long term growth algorithm that we laid out in Beaver Creek  a brand    a portfolio of brands that can really drive that algorithm  but also benefit and drive our focus around transformation  So on your question on Urban Ex  Omar  I think the learnings there is that the brand continues to be able to appeal to and attract new consumers leveraging the rich heritage of some of those key icons like the new tee  you see extreme here being pulled out of the archives  So  what they re finding is  this is a real rich area to leverage that historical set of brand icons done in a way that really promotes the rich heritage and authenticity and supports the more technical side of Mountain Sports  So we see good growth and not only here in the US  but from a global standpoint  it s a real strong part of that go forward strategy Omar Saad    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Alex Walvis from Goldman Sachs  Your line is now live Alex Walvis    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  Thanks so much for taking the question  My first question is on the occupational workwear split  Scott  you shared some comments on this in the opening remarks  But I wonder if you could help us out with where we should and shouldn t expect there to be dissynergies from that split Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  there will be some of it  There is    I would characterize this business as moderately integrated  so we will have some dissynergies  just to put a number on it  in the neighborhood of  30 million is our expectation  Now against that likely there will be TSA  and of course we ll get after those costs over time  depends on the buyer and the circumstances  but just to give you some sense of the magnitude  The other thing I would point out is with this action  then it greatly simplifies or focuses our supply chain as well from an own manufacturing standpoint  we talked about this gets us out of the apparel manufacturing  So as you can imagine that gives opportunity for simplification and cost reduction as well Alex Walvis    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  That s helpful  And then if I may  another question on the North America backdrop  So  you shared a lot of comments on the more promotional environment in the holiday period  So to the extent that is possible  is there a way of parsing through how much of the weakness in North America was a softening in underlying consumer confidence or spending versus the impacts of warmer weather trends versus what had been a pretty good winter last year  Do you guys have any thoughts on that split Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Alex  I don t think it s    it would be really difficult  I think to really pinpoint what were those key drivers  You called out some of them  I think the US consumer remains strong  What we saw in our product category  specifically cold weather product  was a slow start to the season  The quick move to its promotional environment certainly did have an impact  But I could also say that when brands are deeply focused and understanding the consumer needs and putting the right products in front of the consumers at the right time  you can absolutely see the sales lift that we plan for  So  we re not going to focus on any one of those key drivers  We re going to be very focused on our consumer understanding  how that will help us drive a more retail centric approach to our go to market strategies  and continue to elevate our digital skills to be able to really engage and drive deeper connections with our consumers Alex Walvis    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan  Your line is now live Matthew Boss    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  thanks  So on gross margin  what was the benefit this quarter from the FX transaction gains and just the expectation for the fourth quarter and how best to think about the impact on the fourth quarter gross margin as a whole from the more promotional backdrop and elevated inventories that you cited Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Matt  We didn t break that out per se  but certainly FX did benefit the third quarter and it does turn negative really for the first time this year in the fourth quarter  and of course that is on an ongoing basis  So  what I will say is this  If you look at our implied guidance  the fourth quarter would say that our implied margin in the fourth quarter is down a bit  underneath that the structural gross margin mix remains strong  It s there and that will continue on an ongoing basis The two factors  one you mentioned is the FX and this  we re talking about transactional FX  which relates to hedges put in place over the last 12 to 18 months or so  and that s something we ve been talking about for a long time  That now turns negative in the quarter  Also while tariff is not a big impact overall or even for the year  we do see for the first time the negative tariff impact in the fourth quarter Now interestingly on a go forward basis based on where we re at right now  it does seem to be about a push year on year  and again really relatively small in the overall scheme of things  So  that s what s going on the gross margin  right  The change in the FX cadence underneath it  you got a continued mix benefit which is structural and will continue  and then a little bit of noise on the tariff  One final thing  I alluded to this in my earlier comments as well  relative to the inventory being a little elevated in certain pockets  we have also factored in to be a little more market appropriate from a promotional cadence standpoint and that s also baked into our guidance as you look at the fourth quarter Matthew Boss    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  And then just a follow up on the portfolio pruning  So I guess maybe larger picture  how should we be thinking about the strategy moving from pruning to M A and how would you prioritize  Maybe best particular categories have increased interest on the radar  I think within that core addressable market that you outlined at the Analyst Day Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So you were right where I was going to start  which is that  those TAMs  the total addressable market is where we re focused  And remember the three lenses that we look at  both the portfolio that we have and the portfolio targets that we evaluate  it s really pretty consistent and straightforward  We re looking at is it    strategically is it an attractive segment of the market  Financially  does it meet the characteristics that we re looking for  And from an ownership standpoint  do we bring something to the party  Is it consistent with our purpose  and does it meet the profile of the target investor that we re going after  So  I think in that is a pretty good explanation of the actions that we ve taken and also gives you a pretty good indication of the kind of areas that we re looking from an acquisition standpoint Matthew Boss    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Jim Duffy from Stifel  Your line is now live Jim Duffy    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Guys  two lines of questioning for me  First  we ve heard a lot about the US market dynamics in the quarter  Can you speak to Asia  Is there a way to size the impact of the Hong Kong disruption  And can you speak to what you re seeing relative to expectations in other countries Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMaybe I ll put some numbers on it first  So    our Hong Kong business is important  It s been a good business  but it s not that large in the scheme of things  like we said in the  100 million range overall  and that has been significantly impacted through the year and we really haven t seen much of a change in trend relative to Hong Kong  Interestingly  we ll start to lap that  We re just having that conversation internally here  As we get into the New year  we ll start to lap when we started to see those issues  The good news for us  is that China in the region has really been strong and you saw 30   that s somewhat artificial and we said there was about 5 points due to the timing of Chinese New Year  So  there s a lot of quarter to quarter noise in that  But still if you like  we ve been in that 25  plus kind of growth range consistently in China and that s really driven the strength of Asia and really why we re at the top end of our long range estimates overall Jim Duffy    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystGreat  I wanted to dig in some on the inventory  Can you guys speak in more detail on the geographic and brand level inventory picture  It seems inventory is most out of balance for the vocational work business in Timberland  Can you talk about plans to get the inventories back in line and the financial impact  And then  Scott  is that cleaned up in the fiscal fourth quarter or is there some lingering impact as we go into fiscal  21 Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  you re talking about our inventory obviously  And so  we re    if you look at the ongoing core inventory  we re up like 8   And as we think about going forward  we said we d be balanced between revenue and sales  So  long way of saying  we think we re OK from an inventory standpoint  By the end of the year  any actions that may be taken  we believe are baked into the outlook  And so  we d say pretty good  So obviously what that means is plus 12   Phonetic  for VF  the occupational business is really elevated  right Now it s a unique model  because  in that business  you have specific customers  you have to    it s all about service  you maintain the inventory  and most of these agreements actually have a clause that says  should there be excess at the end of the program that then they will buy that  they will take that inventory  So it s good inventory  we just have too much of it  is the short answer  And as you can imagine given the actions that we recently announced  taking radical or very costly short term actions to try to reduce the inventory wouldn t make a whole lot of sense because it s good quality inventory and eventually it s going to be used  So  hopefully that gives the picture Jim Duffy    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystIt does  Thank you Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jim OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Jonathan Komp from Baird  Your line is now live Jonathan Komp    Robert W  Baird    AnalystYeah  Hi  Thank you  Steve  maybe just a follow up more related to Timberland and portfolio management actions  I guess it s very clear  your history when parts of the business aren t meeting your strategic and financial goals  you ve been very quick to take action  But in the case of like Timberland where it very clearly fits strategically  but is not necessarily hitting your financial goals  could you maybe just talk more philosophically about kind of your patience and willing to see things out and any thoughts there Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Well  I would start that our willingness to look at divestitures really has come online in the last three years  So as we have made driving and shaping our portfolio our number 1 strategic choice and really focusing now on the parts of the market that we laid out with the total addressable market in Beaver Creek  how we characterize our brands as global activity based lifestyle brands that connect directly with consumers with their predominance through their own in digital channels  That frame has helped us really look at what brands we feel we re best at or said differently  where are we the best owner and where are we not the best owner  And what we ve trimmed are really good brands  but brands that don t really align with that long term view  To the point on Timberland  it absolutely aligns with the consumer  the position in the marketplace and the ability to connect with consumers My earlier point that  we re disappointed in our ability to execute and our conviction around the strategy that we have been working on really over the last 18 to 24 months that Martino articulated in Beaver Creek  We don t have endless patience  We certainly have a very focused approach and clear sets of KPIs that we will look for our brand teams  all brand teams to deliver on a year over year basis  But I really want you all to leave this call knowing that we are still deeply committed to the Timberland brand  We understand where the issues are  My comments around  not only the diversification of the products  but the quality and the aesthetic of the product across all of the different growth drivers  We will keep you very close on how we re doing there  We ll give you the proof points as this strategy starts to take hold  But we do not have endless patience and it is really around the proof points and the KPIs that we work with on a year over year basis with our brands that will ultimately drive the decisions long term Jonathan Komp    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  That s very helpful  And then just separately as you look out to 2021  I think this time last year you gave some high level thoughts on a few of the brands for the year ahead  Do you think of that this year  So I m just wondering maybe outside of Timberland just at a high level  is there anything across the brands that you would think is kind of beyond or different than maybe closer to the long term plan that you ve laid out when you look across the brands Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJonathan  not really  I mean we fundamentally believe we re not in a different environment  We see the long range plan that we just talked about in September as intact  Now obviously a few pieces are moving as I mentioned I think on Binetti s question  structurally you re going to see with the sale of occupational  that s a tailwind to growth  What we just talked about in Timberland is sort of a headwind  But overall  we don t see ourselves in a fundamentally different place And I d just like to remind you  as you think about this year and the guidance change or the outlook change that we just talked through  the uptick in Vans  the adjustment in Timberland essentially are awash and what s left is the occupational reduction  So using different words  if it weren t for occupational  we d still be in the range that we talked about three months ago  and I would say that s really the big picture  So if you look at the ongoing algorithm for VF  which will obviously exclude  the occupational work group  we say yeah  evolved a little differently  but we don t see anything fundamentally different on a go forward basis  But  in three months we ll be back  we ll give you guidance for next year and clean up the details Jonathan Komp    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThat s very helpful  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our final question today is coming from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo  Your line is now live Ike Boruchow    Wells Fargo    AnalystHey  thanks for taking the question  Scott  two questions for you  Just to follow up one more time on the inventory  the slower than expected growth  In that category  is that all cold weather or is that outerwear or is that outerwear and footwear  I m just kind of curious if there s any more color you can kind of give there and then any more color on the types of channels where that inventory    where the slow moving inventory was  Was that broad based  was it your DTC  was it department stores  Just any more color there would be really helpful Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Really I d say the    Ike  it was mixed is the answer  I mean certain categories we saw relatively better sell through and others we saw not quite as strong  Some of the more insulated colder leather jackets as Steve mentioned  women s versus men s  and really again of course Timberland having such a large classic business  some of that classic boots inventory  Those are the main areas that I would say  Listen  even retailer is a retailer  Some are in great shape  some have relatively more and we look at it overall  we would say slightly elevated  right  Not a disaster  not a huge issue  but a little more than we would like to see and that s why we re taking some of the actions that I mentioned earlier And again to the best of our knowledge  we ve got it built into our outlook and we have a good path to exit in good shape  Obviously not all those levers are within our control and in three months  we ll give you an update on how that played out and give you an indication of where we stand going into next year Ike Boruchow    Wells Fargo    AnalystGot it  Thanks  Scott  And then just one quick follow up  Just when we think about what you re trying to monetize the workwear asset for  should we look at the Dickies transaction to give us some kind of guidance  I know you can t tell us what you re trying to sell it for  but just kind of curious  the framework that maybe you re using when you think about that Scott A  Roe    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Of course I m not going to negotiate against myself here  So  but yeah  you can look at comparable transactions  I would say this interestingly  the interest for this asset has been exceedingly high and frankly higher than we expected  So  both on the sponsor side and the strategic side  so  we re optimistic  but let s see where that plays out  We ll have visibility to that in the next couple of months Ike Boruchow    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  Scott OperatorThank you  We ve reached end of our question and answer session  I d like to turn the floor back over to Steve for any further or closing comments Steve Rendle    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  everybody for joining us this morning  Just going to reiterate  Our third quarter performance is strong and our year to date results are at the high end of our long term growth objectives and we re on track to deliver solid performance for this year  As we look at the market signals that we continue to monitor  our focus on transforming to become more consumer minded  retail centric and more hyper digital in how we operate our business could not be more timely The moves we re making with our portfolio will allow us to have greater focus not only by management  but also how we invest against our brand properties  but also our transformation agenda to put us in a much stronger position in the future as we drive against the LRP that we laid out for you all in Beaver Creek  We look forward to catching up with you all in May and giving you insight into how we look at fiscal 2021 and our continued drive against that long range plan  Thanks Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  77 minutesCall

187853,409369,VFC,After Wrangler Spinoff  VF Corp Looks to Shed More Brands,news,"Following the successful spinoff of its Kontoor Brands denim business last May  VF Corp  NYSE VFC  is looking for more businesses to shed  deciding a focus on the consumer market may be its best option  The apparel maker said it was considering strategic alternatives for the occupational portion of its work segment  which includes brands like Red Kap  Bulwark  Walls  and Kodiak  but Dickies and Timberland PRO are not part of the review 
Considering the performance of its Vans business last quarter and Timberland this time around  maybe everything should be on the table 


A portent of things to come
Perhaps investors should have been warned that VF s fiscal third quarter earnings report wasn t going to be all that good  as it announced a couple of days beforehand that it was considering calving off portions of the work segment 
In a statement announcing the brand review  president and CEO Steve Rendle said   Divesting these brands would leave VF with a simplified portfolio of higher growth  consumer focused brands  while providing financial flexibility to fuel further strategic initiatives and enhance shareholder value  
The brands represent about  865 million of its total fiscal 2019 revenue of  13 9 billion and about half of the workwear segment s sales  Customers include the federal government and a number of Fortune 100 companies  Dickies  though  is actually the largest portion of the segment  accounting for about 40  of sales 
There s good reason the apparel company didn t include it and Timberland Pro in the strategic alternative plan    it expects both to record strong growth  especially Dickies  where China is expected to play a big role 
Last quarter  VF had sounded particularly hopeful about the smaller  emerging brands in this category  believing that one or two of them could be  the next North Face or Vans   However  as VF s domestic business continues to face weakened conditions in the manufacturing sector  it may be that management believes jettisoning some brands now will help improve VF s bottom line 
Tripping over its Tims
VF reported third quarter revenue rose less than 5  to  3 38 billion  below analyst forecasts of  3 43 billion  though adjusted earnings of  1 23 per share beat the consensus estimate of  1 21 per share 
The apparel maker s performance was dragged lower by the Timberland brand  which may have been a surprise to management since it had been expecting improved performance in Europe  Last quarter  it was Vans sneakers that impacted its results the hardest  but this time around it saw 13  growth in currency adjusted sales 
The shortfall in performance this quarter  however  caused VF to cut its full year revenue and profit forecast  it now expects to post annual revenue of  11 75 billion versus its prior guidance of  11 8 billion  Adjusted earnings from continuing operations are now expected to be  3 30 per share  down from its previous range of  3 32 to  3 37 per share  and also well below the  3 36 per share Wall Street had been anticipating 
An even narrower focus
Rendle had hinted last quarter that VF s way forward was as a  more consumer minded and retail centric enterprise   but even after getting rid of these nine brands  it might not be the end of VF s divestments 
Rendle says the current round will give it the  financial flexibility to fuel further strategic initiatives and enhance shareholder value   but the weak state many retailers find themselves in as consumers shift how they shop should make investors cautious about the plan ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pms81,2067753
187854,409370,VFC,VF Corporation details coronavirus impact,news,"VF Corporation  NYSE VFC  says about 60  of its owned and partner stores in China have been temporarily closed due to coronavirus mitigation efforts  The company reports stores currently open have experienced significant declines in retail traffic  The Asia Pacific region represented 12  of the company s revenue last year  with Mainland China accounting for 6    While it is not possible to gauge the impact to our supply chain at this point  approximately 16 percent of VF s total cost of goods sold is sourced directly from mainland China  of which 7 percent is bound for the US market   notes VF management

187893,409409,VFC,Wall Street analysts bullish over Nike s digital growth  look past margin weakness,news," Reuters    Wall Street analysts were upbeat about  Nike  Inc s  N NKE  long term growth  encouraged by the sportswear maker s robust online sales and strength in China that helped overcome slowing demand in North America  its biggest market 
At least eight brokerages boosted their price target on the Dow component s stock on Friday  with  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  making the most bullish move by raising it to  120  above Nike s current share price of about  100 
 Given Nike s significant scale and IT spend advantage  coupled with its early lead in digital  we remain very bullish on the company s ability to continue to maintain its momentum in digital   said Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad 
Still  shares of the company were down about 1 5  in early trade as investors worried about its weak margins and growing competition in North America from Adidas  DE ADSGn   Skechers  N SKX  and VF Corp s  N VFC  Vans 
In efforts to win market share from rivals  Nike has collaborated with celebrities  launched limited edition sneakers  spent on technology and increased marketing around major sporting events 
The company s sales have also got a boost in recent years from its  Consumer Direct Offense  strategy that includes focus on online sales  product launches and supply chain improvements to bring new products to shelves faster 
Overall  quarterly sales rose a better than expected 10 2   with its famous Jordan brand hitting  1 billion in sales for the first time  North America sales rose 5   but came in slightly below expectations 
The company s margins came under pressure in the quarter from increased investments  but several analysts attributed much of the weakness to currency fluctuations 
 Despite  the weak margins   Nike remains the envy of the rest of the sector   Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell said 
 With the product pipeline robust today and still ramping  heading towards Tokyo Olympics 2020  we see above average top  and bottom line gains ahead

187942,409458,VFC,Under Armour  UAA  Q3 Earnings On Deck  Can The Company Take The Next Step  ,opinion,"Under Armour   NYSE UAA   is set to report its third quarter results Monday  November 4  before the opening bell  The athleisure company has seen its shares rise 16 8  in 2019 thus far  outperforming the broader apparel market s 11 7  run 
The apparel giant is in the middle of a restructuring plan that was implemented to help the company stimulate its stagnant growth as well as cut costs and reduce inventory levels  The company also recently announced that founder and CEO  Kevin Plank  would be stepping down from the chief executive position and Patrik Frisk would be taking his place on January 1  2020 
Under Armour s Issues Mount 
The shakeup on the executive level comes as Under Armour has been struggling to compete with athleisure rivals like Nike   NYSE NKE    Adidas   OTC ADDYY    and Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU    Patrik Frisk spent nearly three decades working in the apparel  footwear  and retail industries  and has been Under Armour s president and chief operating officer since 2017  Prior to joining UAA  Frisk held various positions at VF Corp   NYSE VFC    where he oversaw outdoor brands like North Face  Timberland  JanSport  Lucy  and SmartWool 
When Frisk joined Under Armour  the company s growth had decelerated  so he helped launch a multi year restructuring plan that is now in its third year  The company faces an uphill battle to get its business in a position to better compete with the industry titans  Revenue at its core North American market  which accounted for 69  of its top line last quarter  has fallen annually for four straight quarters  It expects that dismal performance to continue with a  slight decline  in revenue for the full year 
The company is also spending an alarming amount on endorsement deals for high profile athletes  Under Armour had originally thought that greater scale and better brand awareness should reduce reliance on celebrity spokespeople and big spending but they haven t  Under Armour s selling and administrative expenses amounted for 42  of the brand s total revenue  versus Nike s comparable figure of 32  
Outlook 
Apart from Under Armour s mounting selling expenses  Frisk is also tasked with rebuilding the apparel giant s corporate culture  Under Armour s corporate culture was accused of culminating a male dominant and misogynistic work environment  The company has also had many executives step down for unknown reasons  which is another worrying sign coming from the firm s corporate level 
Kevin Plank s refusal to compete with Lululemon in the booming athleisure market reflects the potential lack of confidence in the business  ability to compete for market share in the athleisure space  The refusal to diversify its business away from the saturated footwear and athletic apparel market left many people confused considering the rate at which the athleisure market is growing  Plank stated that they would rather focus on its performance products  but many investors believe that Under Armour just isn t in a position to even attempt to compete against Lulu s pricing power and brand loyalty 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast Under Armour to see a 28  drop in earnings to  0 18 per share while sales slip 2 43  to  1 41 billion  North American revenue is projected to come in at  1 04 billion for a 2 17  decline  Apparel sales are expected to grow 9 75  to  1 07 billion and footwear sales are estimated to fall 7 23  to  264 2 million  Fiscal 2019 figures estimate the firm s bottom line to see a 25 93  hike to  0 34 per share on the back of a 3 14  pop in net sales to  5 36 billion 
Takeaway  
The company was in need of a rebuilding effort as it has seen its revenue growth decelerate dramatically over the past five years  Frisk is tasked with reshaping the company and fixing its current image problems 
Declining revenue in the North American market is a major headwind that Frisk must also address as well as sustaining the business  international growth  which will be vital if the company truly wants to focus on its performance products  A new CEO at the helm is a step in the right direction  but Frisk will have his work cut out for him for years to come  Under Armour sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

NYSE VFC   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  Realogyis a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is going to be reporting next week   The stock is a little lower today  but here is the rub  the Federal Reserve just cut interest rates again and that means consumers have more spending power     at least they do when it comes to buying a new home Lower rates mean lower payments and that means more people can afford new or better homes   RLGY is positioned to benefit from this as they own a host of brands that serve the real estate market   Coldwell Banker and Century 21 are two of the more recognizable brands in the mix Right now  RLGY is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and let s explore why that is in this Bull of the Day article DescriptionRealogy Holdings Corp  is a provider of real estate services  The Company through its subsidiaries provides real estate brokerage services  relocation services  and title and settlement services  The Company s brands and business units include

Resource Group  Realogy Holdings Corp  is headquartered in Parsippany  New Jersey Recent EarningsRLGY has a subpar earnings history   This is clearly not the reason the stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    It has met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last two reports  but prior to that it missed two times as well   We have seen much better in terms of beating the number Earnings EstimateThe Zacks Rank care most about the movement in earnings estimates and RLGY has a lot of positive earnings estimate momentum I see increases for this quarter  next quarter  this year and next year   The Zacks Rank focuses more on the full year  so over the last 60 day the number for 2019 moving from  1 04 to  1 08 is what we want to see   The 2020 number has moved from  1 20 to  1 29 over the same time horizon ValuationValue players will love this stock as it trades at just under 8x forward earnings and a price to book of 0 43x   Growth is slowing for RLGY  but the stock looks to have bottomed and is bracing for home buying and selling demand to increase with the lower rates  Berry Globalis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  as estimates fell substantially following recent earnings miss   The stock is now the Bear of the Day  so let s take a look at what happened here DescriptionBerry Global Group  Inc  manufactures and distributes nonwoven specialty materials  engineered materials and consumer packaging products in the market  The company services personal care  healthcare as well as beverage and food markets in South America  North America  Asia and Europe  This Evansville  IN based company was formerly known as Berry Plastics Group  Inc  but changed its official name to Berry Global Group  Inc in April 2017  The company employs around 24 000 people globally Earnings HistoryThe earnings history here is not the worst I have ever seen  but it is not the best   I see two misses in the last two reports and before that there were two beats   The misses  however  are bigger than the beats on a percentage basis and that makes the average surprise a negative 4  over the last four quarters Estimate RevisionsEsimates are dropping in a big way for this stock   I see the current quarter moving from  0 90 to  0 74 over the last 90 days   The next quarter also has seen a move lower from  0 82 to  0 70 over the same time horizon The Zacks Rank pays the most attention to annual numbers and over the last 60 days we have seen the 2019 number move from  3 41 to  3 25   The 2020 number has slipped from  4 28 to  3 82 over that same time period ValuationGrowth is slowing here  with the top line contracting 6 5  over the last year   That has brought the valuation down to very reasonable levels  with a forward PE of 11x and a price to sale of 0 7x  The price to book at 3 6x is still a little high for me  but if this company can get margins to move higher that should take care of itself Under Armour is set to report its third quarter results Monday  November

footwear and athletic apparel market left many people confused considering the rate at which the athleisure market is growing  Plank stated that they would rather focus on its performance products  but many investors believe that Under Armour just isn t in a position to even attempt to compete against Lulu s pricing power and brand loyalty Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast Under Armour to see

188002,409518,VFC,New Adidas CEO sets off in pursuit of Nike,news,"By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    Closing the gap on clear market leader  Nike   N NKE  is the challenge facing new Adidas  DE ADSGn  boss Kasper Rorsted when the Dane takes charge of the world s second biggest sportswear brand from the start of October  Investors are banking on Rorsted  54  repeating improvements to profitability he achieved at consumer goods maker Henkel  DE HNKG p  and the Adidas share price has risen by around two thirds since his appointment was announced in January  Ingo Speich  a fund manager at Adidas shareholder Union Investment  said he hopes Rorsted will scrutinize the Adidas product portfolio and its sales structure as the first steps to boosting lagging margins    I expect small measures rather than a bombshell  But in 12 18 months  if the margin is still where it is now it will be difficult for the shares   said Speich  a critic of outgoing Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer  Rorsted s performance at Henkel  the maker of Schwarzkopf shampoo and Loctite glue  is being examined for clues as to what he will do at the sportswear group which supplies soccer jerseys to Manchester United and world champions Germany  At Henkel  Rorsted culled 80 percent of the firm s brands  pushing top names such as Persil at the expense of local labels  He also kept a tight control on costs  shifting some head office functions to  shared service  centers in lower wage countries  Investors also want Rorsted  who earlier in his career worked for U S  firms Compaq and Hewlett Packard  to maintain the focus on reviving the Adidas brand in the United States  The Dane spent a lot of time there in the last few years as he overhauled Henkel s U S  business  Adidas has started to chip away at Nike s dominance in the U S  market thanks to heavy marketing spending and collaborations with singers such as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams as well as top sports stars   One investor said their research suggests a rebound in the Adidas brand has been limited to the lifestyle segment in the biggest U S  cities so far and it still has work to do in the rest of the market and in performance sports  A quarterly earnings report from Nike this week showed it was feeling the effects of increasing competition from Adidas and  Under Armour   N UA   ADVANTAGE NIKE Nike s entrenched strength in its home U S  market helps explain much of its advantage over its German rival in profitability  It is also what drove Hainer to buy Reebok in 2005 for  3 8 billion  but the strategy backfired as the brand has since floundered  with some investors keen for it to be sold  Hainer  a Bavarian who is a supervisory board member of German soccer champions Bayern Munich  has been chief executive since 2001  His critics say he failed to improve profitability even as sales rose by two thirds in a decade  The operating margin was stuck at 6 3 percent in 2015 versus 14 percent at Nike  Some investors hope Rorsted will scale back new store plans to be more like Nike  which focuses on flagship stores in top locations combined with e commerce  Adidas had 2 722 stores at the end of last year and plans to add another 500 600 by 2020 and quadruple ecommerce sales to 2 billion euros   2 2 billion  by then  Nike is more ambitious    targeting  12 5 billion from ecommerce by then  Rorsted  who formally takes charge on Oct  1 after shadowing Hainer since August  was chosen after new investors including Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris  Southeastern Asset Management founder Mason Hawkins and Belgian billionaire Albert Frere bought stakes in the company last year  Sawiris and a representative of Frere have since taken seats on the Adidas board  Sawiris and Hawkins have also set up Southeastern Concentrated Value  SCV   a vehicle to spur boardroom change and influence strategy at firms they invest in   We believe there is a lot of low hanging fruit that Mr  Rorsted can address to get to that 10 11 percent range  Approaching Nike is going to take some more work and heavy lifting   said Scott Cobb  a managing partner at SCV  Hainer  stepping down at age 62  has already started harvesting some of that fruit    announcing plans to sell the loss making golf business and improving the U S  business after Adidas fell into third place behind Under Armour in 2014   REEBOK S FUTURE Investors expect Rorsted to draw on his Henkel experience to make sourcing  logistics and advertising more efficient  although the spiraling cost of top sports sponsorships means it will be hard to bring down marketing spending  One way to boost efficiency would be to further simplify the product range  Adidas already plans to cut the number of different models by a quarter by 2020 to focus on top sellers like retro Superstars and UltraBoost running shoes  Some investors want Rorsted  who played handball on the Danish youth team and is a keen skiier and mountain biker  to consider selling Reebok   Reebok needs to be closely monitored and perhaps reexamined  Reebok waters down margins for the whole company   said Tim Albrecht  a fund manager at Deutsche Asset Management  a top 10 shareholder in Adidas  Hainer has repeatedly ruled out selling Reebok  saying now it has been revamped  the brand is well positioned to benefit from booming participation in fitness  Bankhaus Lampe analyst Peter Steiner said a sale could be harder than it might seem as Reebok has become very intertwined with Adidas  He puts a 30 percent chance on a sale

188004,409520,VFC,Can V F  Corp  VFC  Retain Positive Earnings Trend In Q4 ,opinion,V F  Corporation   NYSE VFC   is slated to release fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 22  before the opening bell This designer  manufacturer  and marketer of branded apparel and related products outpaced earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters  the average positive surprise being 16 3  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the company in the quarter to be reported is pegged at 58 cents per share  which suggest a decline of 13 4  from the year ago quarter  However  estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter moved up in the last 30 days  Moreover  the consensus mark for revenues stands at  3 2 billion  reflecting a year over year increase of 5 2  V F  Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayV F  Corp has been putting up a robust earnings show  backed by solid trends at its core brands  Vans and The North Face   Further  strong growth at international and direct to consumer businesses as well as Active and Outdoor segments is boosting results  The persistence of these trends is likely to aid top and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 V F  Corp s Vans brand continues to display strength  with solid revenue growth across all regions  channels and product categories  Notably  the brand has been on a very long growth trajectory  growing in the mid teens range  since it was acquired in 2004  The brand remains focused on icon management and overall concept  with strength in footwear and apparel  Further  management continues to expect to sustain double digit revenue growth for the brand in the quarters ahead  This should help the company to accomplish a  5 billion revenue target for the brand by 2023  reflecting a five year CAGR of 10 12   With such growth lined up  the Vans brand is likely to contribute significantly to top line growth in fourth quarter fiscal 2019 Moreover  the company s upcoming quarterly results are poised to gain from the 2021 growth strategy  which focuses on business transformation and solid shareholder returns  Moreover  its focus on selling directly to consumers and investment in digital platforms along with robust international expansion plans should support sales growth in the to be reported quarter Driven by the robust quarterly performance and increased visibility through the rest of fiscal 2019  management raised its earnings and sales view for the fiscal year  V F  Corp now expects revenues of nearly  13 8 billion  reflecting an increase of 12  from the year ago quarter  Further  it envisions adjusted earnings per share of  3 73  suggesting 19  growth from the year ago quarter Despite these positives  we remain wary of the company s jeans category  which remains soft  For fiscal 2019  it projects revenues to dip 3  at the Jeans division  However  its decision to spin off the jeans business  which is likely to be effective this month  should cushion future results Further  the company s wholesale business has been hurting its top line for a while  Moving to a more digital driven business  V F  Corp is slowly eliminating sales to middlemen   including department stores and off price retailers   which are exposed to risks of bankruptcy and store closures  This has been hurting revenue contribution from the wholesale business  This trend is likely to weigh on results in the fiscal fourth quarter as well Additionally  V F  Corp s results continue to bear a meaningful impact of negative currency translations  The company s international revenue guidance for fiscal 2019 includes the impact of negative currency translations  It anticipates international business to report revenue growth of about 10 11   down from 12 13  mentioned earlier A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model clearly shows that V F  Corp is likely to beat earnings estimates in the quarter to be reported  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  0 77   which indicates that a positive surprise is likely in the to be reported quarter Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these too

   Hopeful of recovery in 2010  not banking on it
   Keen on more acquisitions  will have  2 bln war chest
 
   Adds detail 
 By James Davey
 LONDON  June 12  Reuters    VF Corp  owner of brands such as
Wrangler  Lee  Vans and The North Face  has seen its markets in
the United States  stabilise  but does not expect a return to
growth in 2009  its chief executive said on Friday 
  The apparel  wholesale  business and the stores that we
sell  in   things seem to be stabilising   Eric Wiseman told the
Reuters Global Retail Summit in London 
  They re not stabilising at a great place but compared to
December  January and February  when week after week it looked a
little bleaker  it s stable   he said 
 Wiseman said VF had also seen some of its markets in Europe
bottom out 
  I don t think most of western Europe is any better or worse
than the U S   it feels like it s stabilising here some too   he
said 
 But he said VF s jeans business in eastern Europe remained
difficult 
 In April the group posted a steeper than expected drop in
first quarter profit and lowered its full year outlook 
 Wiseman does not expect any of VF s markets to return to
growth in 2009 
  We are assuming that there is no recovery this year for
sure   he said 
  We think the right assumptions are to assume that it s
going to be very difficult and if it s better than that we ll
chase business  chase inventory  
 The CEO is hopeful of a recovery in 2010 but is not banking
on it 
  We will not be assuming that there s an enormous recovery
that lifts our performance  That assumption is off the table  
he said 
  Whether there s any improvement in 2010  and when you
assume it  are the discussions we re having now  
 
 WAR CHEST FOR ACQUISITIONS
 
 Wiseman said VF Corp was keen to do more acquisitions  with
the recession having spawned  lots of opportunities   and was
having  a lot of discussions  
 He said the group had the financial firepower to do  a
reasonably large  deal 
  By the end of the year     we ll have  600 million in cash
and  1 3 billion in accessed funds  so we ll be sitting on a  2
billion cheque book that s accessible for investment and
acquisitions  
 Wiseman said VF was particularly keen to expand its
portfolio of brands in  outdoor  action sports and
contemporary  
  We have a  potential acquisitions  list that we go through
every four months   he added 
 Shares in VF  which have lost 18 percent of their value over
the last year  closed Thursday at  59 29  valuing the business
at  6 56 billion

 NEW YORK  June 13  Reuters    U S  stocks drifted sideways
 on Monday  in what is likely a temporary pause in a sell off
brought on by growing fears of another economic downturn 
 The benchmark S P 500 rose for only the second time in the
past nine sessions while the Nasdaq 100  managed to
survive a fall below its 200 day moving average at 2 218 
quickly reversing those losses 
 Investors remained noncommittal about whether stocks have
become cheap enough after six weeks of selling to pour some
money back into equities again 
  If we don t get any great information coming out from the
economy or other phases or sectors of items we look at to help
gauge our trading decisions  then we may kind of lay here for

some calculated risks  but you won t see a lot of money

188019,409535,VFC,Climate Change  Global Clothing Firms Seek Cotton Alternatives,news,"By   

Climate change is threatening to damage the cotton crops we need to make jeans  T shirts  sweaters and other comfy clothing  So the world s apparel companies are finding alternatives to the fluffy fiber in part to insulate themselves from the effects of rising temperatures  prolonged droughts  heavier rainfall and other impacts  NPR s Morning Edition reported Wednesday 
VF Corp  NYSE VFC  which makes Lee and Wrangler jeans  Timberland shoes and The North Face fleece jackets  said it started looking to diversify its raw materials several years ago  after bad weather events in China and Pakistan    two of the world s largest cotton growers    hit the company s cotton supply  While the crop grows especially well in hot climates  it is extremely sensitive to water  Not enough H20  and cotton chokes at the vine  too much  and its roots rot 
In the coming decades  water scarcity spurred by climate change will likely hit cotton the most in China s Xinjian county  Pakistan  Australia and the western United States  according to the International Trade Center  a joint agency of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations  Extreme heat waves could also harm cotton crops  as will an abundance of insects  which are expected to adapt and thrive in new environmental conditions 
Letitia Webster  VF s senior director of sustainability  said that the Greensboro  North Carolina based apparel firm wants to shield itself from those risks    and protect its bottom line   We actually do want to diversify  we want to make sure that we are insulated from some of that   she told NPR 
The company is training 400 Chinese farmers to switch to less water intensive cotton plants  VF is also ramping up its orders of recycled polyester fibers produced by Unifi Manufacturing Inc  NYSE UFI  also based in Greensboro  Unifi turns plastic waste from bottles and leftover polyester scraps into a textured  yarn like string  which the company calls Repreve 
Roger Berrier  Unifi s president and chief operating officer  told NPR that the company struggled at first to sell its high costing Repreve  Now  however  demand is growing 20 percent a year amid rising consumer interest in recycled goods  volatile cotton prices and increasing interest from alternative seeking firms like VF 
Webster said that over time  the company hopes that by incorporating cotton substitutes on a massive scale  it can help drive down the costs of newer materials like Repreve and protect the company s supply chain   It is all about actually reducing risk  which actually does cost   she told NPR ",2014-08-27,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/climate-change:-global-clothing-firms-seek-cotton-alternatives-305934,305934
188020,409536,VFC,Safety overhaul puts strain on Bangladesh garment industry,news,"By Krista Mahr and Serajul Quadir  DHAKA  Reuters    Undaunted by a run of horrific factory accidents that have hit Bangladesh s garments industry  two entrepreneurs bought Adorn Knitwear Ltd earlier this year       It is a small business not far from the rubble of Rana Plaza  a Dhaka suburb building that collapsed in April 2013 killing more than 1 100 people  most low paid seamstresses  and prompting a costly safety overhaul at plants large and small   Whether people like Rezaul Karim Chowdhury  one of Adorn s new owners  can afford those improvements will be critical for the future of a sector that accounts for over 80 percent of this South Asian nation s export earnings  industry leaders say   Last month  Adorn s production lines were silent and its sewing machines gathering dust as the lengthy process of checking the building for structural weakness was underway    We re losing money every minute   said Chowdhury  35  as he looked around his factory  which has a list of potentially expensive fixes to be completed before reopening       Many high volume factories depend on smaller firms  contracting out work to meet orders from big Western retailers under tight deadlines   Today  up to 20 percent of the 3 500 exporting garment factories subcontract  says the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association  BGMEA    If that support system crumbles  some factory owners worry Bangladesh s  24 billion industry could lose the agility that took it to number two in the global league of garment exporters       Since Rana Plaza  nearly two thirds of the country s exporting garment factories have been inspected       Many have been handed lists of structural  electrical and fire safety fixes and upgrades that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars       Larger factories can generally pay for those changes independently  or have access to a growing number of affordable financing arrangements backed by wealthy customers       Hundreds of smaller factories do not  leaving them exposed at a time when owners say they are grappling with a slide in orders and an increase in minimum wages for the industry s workforce of more than 4 million   Already about 450 factories have gone to the wall since last year s disaster  the BGMEA says         If all the factories are becoming big  who will do the smaller things   said Anwar ul Alam Chowdhury  chairman of Evince Group and a former BGMEA president   Then who will come to Bangladesh          A STITCH IN TIME      At Adorn  laborers ripped up flooring to expose steel rods that needed testing  Above them  the word  crack  was spray painted in red in three spots  all to be analyzed by engineers in a weeks long assessment       Getting factories up to speed after inspections may cost owners from  100 000 to  1 million apiece  according to the World Bank s International Finance Corporation  IFC        The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety  brand backed initiatives that have inspected some 1 700 factories  offer mechanisms through which members are helping suppliers compensate workers for lost wages due to closures and finance factory revamps   Several major apparel firms belonging to the Alliance or the Accord said they had made significant investments to help suppliers improve safety  Not all factories have needed outside funding    The U S  based VF Corporation  an Alliance member whose brands include The North Face and Wrangler  announced it would guarantee up to  10 million for the IFC and Bangladesh s BRAC bank to lend its suppliers  So far  three VF supplier factories have received  1 3 million in loans       The IFC is in talks to do the same with several more Accord and Alliance brands    NATURAL CORRECTION       Even with more help coming  there are fewer options for the exporting factories that do not sell to Accord or Alliance companies  According to the International Labor Organization  they number roughly 1 800   The BGMEA says it has asked the government to help these factories get up to speed by setting up a fund offering them low cost loans  but the government says it is up to owners to find a way to meet safety standards after inspections    It will be the responsibility of the owner to pay  or he ll have to close it   said Mikail Shipar  secretary of the Ministry of Labor and Employment   Some suppliers may be too unhealthy to secure another bank loan to stay afloat  said Ian Spaulding  senior adviser to the Alliance        It s going to happen throughout the market  and that s a natural correction that needs to happen    Saving smaller factories is crucial for the local industry to keep its edge  but also for the economy  said Mohammad A  Rumi Ali  a director at BRAC Bank    If 75 000 people lose their jobs  and the majority are women  it s a big cost   he said       Down a dirt road clogged with bicycle rickshaws in Badda  a congested area on the edge of Dhaka  a small garment factory is squeezed into a row of buildings       The owner  who requested anonymity  said he could not meet all the inspectors  requirements  primarily because his business is in a rented building and the landlord refuses to help

188066,409582,VFC,Why Did Under Armour  UAA  Stock Surge Today ,opinion,"Shares of Under Armour   NYSE UAA   were up nearly 6  through early afternoon trading hours Monday after analysts from Stifel said the sports apparel giant was making significant changes that should soon be apparent in its financial results 
Citing management s renewed focus on operating efficiency  expense control  resource allocation  and commitment to earnings  Stifel today set a  27 price target for Under Armour nearly 27  higher than Friday s close 
According to Stifel s analysts  Under Armour began showing signs late last year that  rational minds would prevail and focus would shift from cavalier growth to profitability  
This has not been fully realized in the company s actual numbers just yet  with better than expected Q1 revenue results being overshadowed by concerns about sluggish gross margins  but Stifel believes that should change soon 
 With the recent market evidence that performance athletic demand and channel inventories are healthy  we have increased confidence that inventories will be appropriately matched to demand before year end and margins will inflect and margin improvement can continue in 2019 and beyond   the firm wrote 
Under Armour shares are up nearly 50  in 2018 as the company looks to rebound from a two year selloff that saw the stock crash more than 70  from its all time highs  Fierce competition from Nike   NYSE NKE   and Adidas   OTC ADDYY   exacerbated this volatility  raising questions about the effectiveness of founder and longtime CEO Kevin Plank 
Plank remains the company s CEO  but Under Armour has made changes to its management team including bringing in Aldo and VF Corp    NYSE VFC   veteran Patrik Frisk as its new president  a position that Plank previously held himself 
Stifel s optimism is a part of a larger picture of improving analyst sentiment for Under Armour right now  Within the last 60 days  the company has seen 11 positive revisions to its full year EPS estimates  lifting our Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny in that time 
Still  earnings are projected to slump about 5  year over year in 2018  and one negative revision has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Under Armour is not expected to see significant earnings momentum until next year  when current estimates are calling for adjust profits to surge about 87  from 2018 s estimated totals

The apparel game highlighted gains from Under Armour  NYSE UA  and losses from VF Corporation  NYSE VFC   Under Armour received a nice boost this week after kicking off its promotional tour in China  The campaign featured their most popular sponsor  Stephen Curry  who is likely to help increase sales in the region  If Under Armour can create a meaningful presence in China  which it had otherwise lacked  it will close the gap between them and Nike  NYSE NKE  
VF Corporation  on the other hand  took a beating this week after Buckingham Research lowered its rating to neutral from a buy  The company has delivered negative earnings and revenue growth for 3 consecutive quarters driven by increasing competition in the footwear space  Shares of VF Corp  were down 2 7  last week and nearly 20  in the past 6 months

188185,409701,VFC,VFC  A Beaten Down Dividend Aristocrat With Strong Brands,opinion,"V F  Corporation  N VFC  has been in business for more than 115 years and owns some of the most famous consumer apparel brands in the world  e g  The North Face  Vans  Wrangler  Lee  etc   
Unseasonably warm winter weather  sluggish retail spending  unfavorable currency fluctuations  and several other transient factors have caused this dividend aristocrat to tumble nearly 30  since the end of July 2015  None of these factors seem to impact the company s long term earnings power  potentially setting up an attractive investment opportunity 
VFC has increased its dividend for 43 consecutive years  2 6  yield  and appears to be trading at a very reasonable price  forward P E multiple of 16  considering the quality of the business  These are the opportunities we look for when we buy dividend growth stocks in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewVFC was founded in 1899 and is one of the largest apparel companies in the world with a strong portfolio of brands in the outerwear  footwear  denim  backpack  luggage  accessory  sportswear  occupational  and performance apparel categories  VFC annually produces over 500 million units spread across more than 30 brands including The North Face  Vans  Timberland  Wrangler  Lee  and Nautica 
Approximately 75  of the business is sold on a wholesale basis to retailers  and the remainder of the business is sold direct to consumer  VFC owns over 1 400 retail stores under its different brand names and maintains a significant e commerce presence  
By geography  VFC derived 70  of its 2014 revenues from the Americas  20  from Europe  and 10  from Asia Pacific Business AnalysisIn business for more than 115 years  VFC clearly has some competitive advantages  Many of the company s largest brands have carved out leading mindshare with consumers in their respective product categories because they have delivered quality for so many years   The North Face  1966   Vans  1966   Timberland  1973   Lee  1889   Wrangler  1947   Eastpak  1952   Red Kap  1923   Nautica  1983   Jansport  1967  
Strong brands help VFC charge more for its products and maintain prime shelf space with retailers  i e  retailers need VFC s products to draw in traffic   consumers expect them to have North Face  etc   and might shop elsewhere if they don t carry it  
While VFC has had to evolve its products  designs and marketing strategies over the years  its long standing brand recognition and successful relationships with retailers  there is only so much shelf space for each product category  serve as major competitive advantages 
To stay relevant  VFC invests significantly in advertising  over  700 million in 2014  representing over 5  of sales  and consumer research  VFC realizes that developing a deep understanding of consumers  needs must be at the core of how it designs and markets products to win customers  loyalty  Over the past four years  VFC has conducted thousands of in person interviews and surveyed more than 125 000 people in 15 countries to gain better consumer insights 
The best brands create strong  emotional connections with consumers  and VFC has proven time and again to excel at this objective  The company s relationships with consumers should further strengthen as it expands its higher margin direct to consumer business  which consists of more than 1 400 company owned stores and a significant e commerce operation 
VFC s extensive distribution network and presence in numerous product categories have also helped the company thrive  Whenever VFC develops a new product or acquires a new brand  it can sell these products all over the world and expand them into adjacent product categories to grow sales faster  VFC s markets are highly fragmented and extremely large in size  over  100 billion   providing no shortage of growth opportunities 
Finally  VFC s supply chain is another advantage  The company produces more than 500 million units of apparel  footwear  and accessories every year  representing hundreds of thousands of combinations of style and color  Over 30 000 of VFC s employees support supply chain activities  and retailers require timely fulfillment of quality products that will sell 
Unlike some of its competitors  VFC also manufactures about 25  of its own products  the other 75  are outsourced to third parties   Products manufactured in VFC s own facilities have lower costs and shorter lead times  The company s scale and in house work helps it maintain very competitive production costs and supply chain reliability that smaller players would struggle to match 
Overall  VFC s reputation for quality  strong portfolio of brands  long standing relationships with retailers  and skill in navigating a competitive landscape marked by constantly evolving consumer preferences form the foundation of its successful business Key RisksJust like many other consumer focused companies  VFC s business can unpredictably move around any given quarter depending on consumer spending trends  weather  e g  many of VFC s outdoor products don t sell as well during unseasonably warm winters   raw material costs  e g  denim   and inventory management issues 
While any of these factors could persist for several months of even a few quarters  we don t believe they have any bearing on VFC s long term outlook  If anything  they are buying opportunities 
What would concern us  As consumers  we know that our tastes and preferences are constantly evolving   especially when it comes to fashion 
VFC s business is heavily dependent on a small handful of brands  In fact  its top five brands account for over two thirds of its sales  Each of these brands has thousands of different product designs and colors  but there is some risk that VFC s most profitable brands become less relevant with consumers over the coming years and struggle to grow off of such a large revenue base 
For now  there is no evidence that this is happening  VFC s North Face and Vans brands  its  1 and  2 largest brands  grew by 11  and 10   respectively  during the third quarter of 2015  Timberland was also up 21   For the full fiscal year  management expects the company s top five brands to have a 10  increase in sales 
The company is also concentrated in the outdoor  action sports  and jeanswear apparel categories  80  of total revenue   While these are certainly clothing mainstays  consumer preferences could still evolve within these categories and favor new brands or styles that emerge  Once again  we don t see any cracks in VFC s armor today   these segments are on pace to grow about 10  in 2015 
If VFC s brands did start to lose their luster with customers  it s possible that some of the company s retail customers could allocate VFC s shelf space to a competitor  VFC s largest customer was 8  of its sales last year  and its 10 largest customers generated about 20  of VFC s sales  Obviously  losing a retailer would hurt results 
Some retailers are pursuing vertical integration business strategies  i e  they make their own apparel or buy direct  in an effort to save costs and improve profitability by consolidating their supply chains  Wholesale suppliers with weaker differentiation will likely face more price pressure  but we don t expect this potential trend to have much of an impact on VFC because of its strong brands  Still  it s something to be aware of and is a reminder of the industry s competitiveness 
Overall  VFC s future competitiveness seems like it will depend on the company s ability to stay in front of changing consumer tastes  which influence product design  marketing  and so much more  We would feel a little more comfortable if VFC had greater brand and product category diversification  but VFC s existing brands have shown remarkable durability over many decades of time  Risk is also mitigated somewhat by management s ability to grow or acquire new brands and plug them into the company s existing distribution network Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
VFC s dividend is extremely safe with an excellent Safety Score of 75  Over the last four quarters  VFC s dividend has consumed 55  of its earnings and 79  of its free cash flow  As seen below  the company s payout ratio has historically stayed in the 30 40  range most of the last decade  Management targets a 40  payout ratio  so this comes as no surprise  The company s payout ratio is very healthy  providing plenty of cushion and room for dividend growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
We can also look at how VFC performed during the last recession to better understand the safety of its dividend  The company s sales fell by 6  in fiscal year 2009  and its earnings declined by 24   VFC s stock returned  18  in 2008 and outperformed the S P 500 by 19   Demand for VFC s products is impacted by the health of the economy  which drives consumer spending  but its business model is still quite resilient Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company has also generated double digit returns on invested capital in each of its last 10 fiscal years  Strong profitability is the sign of an excellent business  and VFC s well known brands have helped it maintain great returns over time Source  Simply Safe Dividends
VFC has been nothing short of an excellent free cash flow generator and has seen free cash flow per share triple over the last decade  Free cash flow provides VFC with the flexibility to acquire other brands  repurchase its shares  and reward shareholders with higher dividend payments Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As seen below  VFC s balance sheet also looks strong  The company could cover its entire debt with cash on hand and 1 5 years of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Morningstar recently issued the company an  A  credit rating as well  Strong credit allows VFC to opportunistically pursue acquisitions to further enhance its long term growth profile Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  VFC s dividend payment is about as reliable as they come  The company consistently generates free cash flow  maintains a conservative balance sheet  and has very healthy payout ratios Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
VFC s dividend Growth Score of 77 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is significantly higher than most dividend paying stocks  VFC most recently hiked its dividend by 16  in October 2015  representing its 43rd consecutive dividend increase  VFC is a member of the S P Dividend Aristocrats Index and seems likely to join the Dividend Kings list  companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years  in seven years 
As seen below  VFC s dividend has compounded at a 17  annual rate over the company s last 10 fiscal years  VFC targets a 40  payout ratio  which the company is slightly above today  In other words  dividend growth over the next few years will likely track earnings growth  Management expects VFC s earnings to grow 10 15  per year  and dividend growth will likely be in a similar range Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While VFC s current 2 6  dividend yield isn t great for investors living off dividends in retirement  the company s strong dividend growth is something to keep in mind ValuationVFC trades at about 16x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 2 6   which is meaningfully higher than its five year average dividend yield of 1 8  
While the faster pace of change in consumer apparel markets shouldn t be understated  companies with excellent brand portfolios and long standing distribution relationships typically do not come cheap 
Even if VFC doesn t quite live up to management s expectations of 10 15  annual earnings growth  the stock still appears to be trading at a very reasonable multiple  We believe VFC will continue compounding earnings at a growth rate between 7  and 11  per year over the next five years  resulting in total return potential of 11  to 14  per year 
Growth is supported by VFC s extremely large and fragmented markets  track record of growing smaller brands into category leaders  geographic expansion opportunities  and continued mix shift into higher margin areas  e g  direct to consumer  ConclusionVFC s stock seems somewhat unfairly beaten down today  While current macro trends are far from ideal  the company is still generating excellent growth from its core brands and has demonstrated skill in understanding and evolving with consumer preferences  We don t see anything that suggests VFC s long term earnings power is impaired  but its stock has certainly become much cheaper over the last six months 
With over 40 years of dividend increases  a portfolio of well known consumer brands  a conservative balance sheet  strong free cash flow generation  and numerous opportunities for continued growth  VFC is certainly a blue chip dividend stock that dividend growth investors should pay attention to ",2016-02-11,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vfc:-a-beaten-down-dividend-aristocrat-with-strong-brands-384263,384263

brands and the licensed DKNY JEANS and DKNY ACTIVE brands This is a vol note on a fascinating company with a dramatic turnaround story  a stock price that has nearly doubled in six months  up 136 85  TTM  and still seen as undervalued by some while a potential takeover target  I ll summarize the happs and then show you some awesome upside skew into earnings Let s start with a holistic news report from Bloomberg  below Even after losing more money last year than any other U S  clothing retailer  Liz Claiborne Inc   LIZ  could still be a bargain in a takeover The  1 3 billion owner of the Kate Spade brand will return to profitability in 2012  reversing five years of losses that topped  2 billion  according to analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg  With revenue projected to rise 14 percent next year  New York based Liz Claiborne still closed yesterday at  12 36 a share  a 28 percent discount to 2013 sales  That s cheaper than 94 percent of similar sized U S  apparel companies  data compiled by Bloomberg show Liz Claiborne Inc  s remaining lines    Kate Spade  Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand  which are higher priced and contemporary    could fetch  20 a share in a takeover  said Monness  Crespi  Hardt   Co Liz Claiborne  which is changing its name to Fifth   Pacific Cos  next month  may lure buyers from private equity firms to Warnaco Group Inc   WRC  or VF Corp   VFC   according to Imperial Capital LLC  after selling its namesake brand and other units last year  The remaining lines    Kate Spade  Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand  which are higher priced and contemporary    could fetch  20 a share in a takeover  said Monness  Crespi  Hardt   Co  An acquirer could then benefit from splitting the three brands into separate companies  said Jim Chartier at Monness  It s a completely different company now than six months ago   Casey Flavin  an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management LLC  an independent equities research firm in New Haven  Connecticut  said in a telephone interview   You are left with three brands that are very attractive and so are inherently attractive to M A because of the discount to their value  Source  Bloomberg via Yahoo  Finance

 The stock evolution  read  climb  over the time period has been steadily abrupt  what    which is to say  up a lot  n stuff  I highlighted the pop a couple of weeks ago on 3 30 2012  Here s the AP headline and summary Liz Claiborne jumps 13 pct on buyout reportLiz Claiborne jumps 13 pct on buyout report  company says  no contemplation  of new strategySource  AP via Yahoo  Finance   Remember this news tidbit    it s the culprit for the  broken  skew  More on that in a second    For the record  the 52 wk range in the underlying is   4 02   15 39   A year ago this stock closed at  5 60 Turning to the vol portion  we can see the pop off of that 3 30 2012 news  and while the implied dipped a touch after  it has found that same level again  The 52 wk range in IV30  is  45 73   104 42    putting the current level in the 48th percentile  or essentially in the middle   The next earnings release for LIZ is due out 4 25 2012 BMO and is confirmed by Livevol  s data sources But  having said all that  it s the skew that really caught my attention  Let s check it out  below While it makes sense for May to lie above Jul due to earnings  that upside skew vol difference is awesome  Keeping in mind that the 13 strike is ATM  we can see how the vol dips to the OTM puts and rises rather significantly to the OTM calls I looked back at the historical skew  and whadya know    It was this 3 30 2012 report that  broke  the skew  I have included the Skew Tab from 3 29 2012 and 3 30 2012  below The skew as of 3 29 2012 was  normal   with the OTM puts more expensive  in vol  than the ATM options  in vol  and further  with the OTM calls less expensive than the ATM vols  The takeover   private news is not going away    that is  the new risk it presented to the market  see change in skew charts  has become the new equilibrium  Quite unusual and therefore  quite meaningful To read what skew is and why it exists you can go here  Understanding Option Skew Finally  let s turn to the Options Tab  for completeness We can see that May as a weighted average is priced to 11 vol points higher than Jul  But  looking to the specific strikes we can see that the ATM vol diff is  11 points while the OTM calls on the 17 strike show a vol diff of more than 20 vol points  In English  the option market reflects substantially more upside risk in the near term relative to the intermediate term Jul options  It will be very interesting to see how Jun is priced after Apr expiry  Word   ,2012-04-14,Ophir

188216,409732,VFC,Dividend Growth Stocks Can Provide Retirees Great Total Returns ,opinion,Introduction to Dividend Paying StocksWhen people talk about dividend paying stocks  their focus is often on the dividend income they provide  This is especially true for the investors that fancy themselves purists as dividend growth investors  who seemingly care more about their dividends than they do their capital  However  this article intends to illustrate that dividend growth stocks are not only great income vehicles for retirees  they can also be terrific vehicles for providing total return However  to understand this fully you must first consider that dividend paying common stocks come in all sizes  shapes and flavors  Therefore  some are better for current yield  some are better for a growing income stream and others offer the total package of growth and income  Furthermore  there are many nuances and degrees of growth and or income that various classes of dividend paying stocks possess  In other words  you can t paint all dividend growth stocks with the same general brush Additionally  there are certain attributes  characteristics and relationships between growth and income that various types of dividend paying stocks can have  Generally speaking  although exceptions can be found  the higher the yield  the lower the growth you can expect  and vice versa  In other words  dividend seeking investors are often faced with a trade off between growth and income Invest According to Your Personal Goals  Needs and ObjectivesTherefore  the specific needs  goals and objectives of the individual investor can  and should be  the driving factors in determining what class of dividend paying stocks they should embrace  The amount of time the investor has before retirement is another important factor when deciding what type of dividend paying stock to choose  The investor with a long time horizon might be prudent to opt for higher growth and lower current yield  whereas the investor that is already in retirement  or very close to it  might desire yield over growth These are very personal decisions  and there is no right or wrong answer  Once again  it all comes down to the individual investor s specific situation and the amount of time they have left to invest before they might need to start taking distributions  Risk  or maybe better said  the individual s tolerance for risk  is another crucial piece of the puzzle  Nevertheless  and regardless of each individual situation  the better the investor understands the nuances  characteristics and attributes of the many different classes of dividend paying stocks  the better equipped they are to make the correct decisions Dividend Growth Stocks For Total ReturnWith the above introductory remarks and positioning statements made  the primary thrust of this article is to illustrate that dividend paying stocks  when done correctly  can generate great total returns to fund future retirement with  Although the focus is often mostly on the dividend income  for many dividend paying stocks it is merely the icing on the cake  Whereas the cake is the capital appreciation component that is often overlooked in favor of the yield  Yet  capital appreciation  although perhaps less certain  usually ends up providing the majority of total return  Our statement that capital appreciation is the cake is based on the total investment return that the business  stock  provides in its own right  In other words  it does not consider the reinvestment of dividends because that would represent an extraneous source of return  When you receive a dividend  it is now your money and no longer attached to the stock  Therefore  you can do what you wish with that money  This could include spend it  reinvest it back into the same stock  reinvest it into a different stock  or whatever you choose to do with it Therefore  we believe the fairest and most enlightening way to evaluate total return is by analyzing each component separately and independently  In this manner you can clearly ascertain where and by what magnitude each component  capital appreciation and dividend income  contributes in their own right  In other words  we will look at total returns over reasonably long time frames and calculate how much of a return comes from the dividend and how much of the return comes from the capital appreciation Reinvesting dividends may be a great way to compound wealth  but it does not relate to the return that the actual entity itself produces  Once again  we will produce performance results on dividend stocks where the capital appreciation component is presented separate from  but along with  the dividend component  In this manner  the reader can see exactly how much return specifically comes from the dividend versus exactly how much return comes from capital appreciation  There is no muddy water when presented in this way Both Income And Capital Appreciation Are Highly Dependent Upon ValuationIt is important for the reader to understand that the principles presented with this article are predicated on investing in dividend growth stocks when valuations make sense  Therefore  each example we present will be measured starting from a point in time when the stock was fairly valued  Therefore  we are excluding to the maximum extent possible  the anomalous pricing behavior that the market often conjures up  In other words  we are identifying either overvaluation or undervaluation as aberrant pricing behavior The following examples will review four types of dividend paying stocks  We will start with high growth and moderate yield  followed by above average growth with a stronger yield  then an example of an average grower  and finally a low growth higher yield example  With each of these samples  our focus is on their total return capability and on how much of it comes from growth of capital versus dividend income in the long run  Additionally  the reader should understand that these four examples represent just a few  but certainly not all of the many nuances and variations of dividend growth stocks available Furthermore  with this article  we intend to provide additional evidence of our thesis that the market capitalizes earnings based on the company s earnings growth rate independent of whether the company pays a dividend or not  Therefore  if a company does pay a dividend  the dividend will represent in essence a bonus or additional return over the non dividend paying company with equal growth  For a more detailed look at this thesis   to our previous article  Building The Total Return Case One Step At A TimeOnce again  we re going to rely on the  fundamentals analyzer software tool to illustrate truths about total return based on capital appreciation plus dividends  Moreover  in order to illustrate the primary principles underpinning our thesis  we will build our first example graph one step at a time  Once again  we re going to rely on the F A S T  Graphs  fundamentals analyzer software tool to illustrate truths about total return based on capital appreciation plus dividends  Moreover  in order to illustrate the primary principles underpinning our thesis  we will build our first example graph one step at a time Syngenta  SYT  Earnings OnlyOur first example looks at Syngenta  a very fast growing Switzerland based company engaged in production of products for crop productivity  Syngenta is an ADR and went public in late calendar year 2000  The following F A S T  Graphs  plots their historical record of earnings growth only  the orange line and green shaded area   since they went public  To be clear  this first graph shows no dividends  price or performance When earnings are viewed in isolation like this  we see that Syngenta is clearly a strong business that has grown earnings in excess of 18  per annum since they went public  Furthermore  the company has little debt on the balance sheet  Therefore  based on earnings alone  Syngenta looks like an excellent candidate for capital appreciation Syngenta   Earnings And Price Correlated GraphWith this next look at Syngenta  we add monthly closing stock prices to the equation  the black line   Here we learn that the company s stock price has closely tracked earnings  Moreover  during the short periods of time where price deviated from the earnings justified valuation  it soon returned to fair value  With price tracking earnings so closely  we can safely assume just by looking at the graphic that shareholder capital appreciation should closely correlate to the company s earnings growth of 18 7  Note that since earnings growth for Syngenta exceeded 15  per annum  the PEG  PE equals earnings growth rate  formula for valuing a business is used to determine fair value  color coded in orange ink to the right of the graph   In other words  in this high growth example the orange line represents a PE ratio of 18 7  Consequently  we can see that the market has historically priced this stock close to its fair value PE  more or less The following performance table calculates the capital appreciation component of Syngenta based solely on the market pricing its earnings  When looked at from this perspective  we see that 19 2  capital appreciation closely correlates to the company s 18 7  growth rate  However  as we will soon see  this company does pay a dividend Therefore  the reader should recognize that the following performance results are only looking at the capital appreciation component  In other words  the stock was bought on 11 30 2000 at  8 81 a share and currently is priced at  69 29  Therefore  1000 originally invested grew to  7 863 03 generating capital appreciation of 19 2  per annum With our next graph we introduce the dividend component  The light blue shaded area on the graph below indicates dividends that are paid out of the green shaded earnings  When stacked on top like this we are provided a clear visual perspective of not only the fact that the company pays a dividend  but also its payout ratio  In other words  in this example the light blue shaded area represents approximately a third of the green shaded area  thereby indicating a payout ratio in the 30  to 35  range  the brackets to the right illustrate dividends paid out of earnings providing a visual perspective of the company s payout ratio  Now that we have all the pieces  our capital appreciation component and our dividend component  we can calculate and analyze total return and its sources  First of all  we discover that our  1000 original investment has grown into  7863 03  Therefore  the simple math says that capital appreciation contributed  6 863 03   7863 03 minus  1000 original investment   Once again  this capital appreciation component only  generated a 19 2  compounded annual return for Syngenta s long term shareholders Since we have included dividends  the performance report now provides a dividend cash flow table that allows us to examine dividends and their contribution to our total return  Here we discover that our original  1000 investment received a total of  794 83 of cumulative dividends  note that FAST Graph  does not include partial year dividends  therefore  no dividends have been recorded for 2012   Add these dividends to our capital appreciation component and we discover that our  1000 original investment provided a cumulative ending value of  8657 86  Therefore  our total annualized return comprised of capital appreciation and dividend income is 20 2  per annum However  the important point here is that with this high growth example  capital appreciation produced the lion s share of total return  On the other hand  this does not diminish the value of dividends at all  The dividends generated from this high growth  relatively low payout ratio  dividend growth stock  returned close to 80  of our original investment in cash  Not too shabby OGE Energy Corp  OGE  Above Average Earnings GrowthOur second example reviews the historical performance of OGE Energy Corp  a moderately fast growing  less than 15  per annum  utility stock  We chose this example because we feel that it represents the quintessential visual depiction of the two components of return  capital appreciation plus dividends income With this example over this time period we see that stock price has tracked and valued the full measure of OGE Energy Corp s earnings since 2003  price tracks the orange line   Moreover  the company was approximately in value at the beginning of this timeframe and approximately in value at the end  therefore  valuation bias is mitigated The light blue shaded area shows us that the company has a high payout ratio  see color coded brackets to the right of the graph   However  the price tracking the orange line shows that all of the company s earnings were capitalized by the market  including these dividends that were paid out  Otherwise  the price line would be tracking significantly below the orange line  This is clear evidence that all the company s earnings generated capital appreciation for their shareholders  The market applies a PE ratio  and not a PE minus dividends ratio  When we review the performance of OGE Energy Corp   we see that capital appreciation of 12 3  closely approximates the 13 1  historical earnings growth rate  Moreover  we see that dividends provided a nice return kicker  However  a very interesting fact about OGE Energy Corp  is that despite their strong earnings growth  their dividend growth rate has been very low from 0  growth to 2  growth and a maximum of 3  growth This may be an indication that the company does require retaining a portion of earnings to fund their above average growth rate  However  that is not the real point of this article  This article is about analyzing total return and its sources  With this example  2069 98 of capital appreciation based on earnings growth  and  706 84 of dividend income  Therefore  we continue to see the magnitude and importance of the capital appreciation component VF Corp  VFC    Average To Moderately Above Average Earnings GrowthAs dividend growth stocks go  VF Corp has produced a moderate earnings growth rate of 8 6   Once again  we see an example where the market has capitalized the full measure of this company s earnings growth  In other words  the stock price has tracked and correlated to the orange earnings justified valuation line  Furthermore  the light blue shaded area representing dividends visually indicates a payout ratio in the 25  to 40  area  VF Corp offers a moderate but growing dividend yield of 1 9   When reviewing the performance in this example we again see a very high correlation between capital appreciation and earnings growth  The company s closing annualized rate of return  capital appreciation  over this 15 year timeframe averaged 8 3  which closely matches its 8 6  earnings growth rate  Once again  we see capital appreciation of  2289 74   1000 grew to  3289 74 equaling a  2289 74 profit  Total cumulative dividends since 1998 equal  462 89  Therefore  we have further evidence of why we state that capital appreciation is the cake while dividend income is the icing  Although the dividend income is significant  and certainly nothing to sneeze at   it nevertheless is dwarfed in relation to the capital appreciation component HJ Heinz Co  HNZ  Low Growth Higher YieldOur final example looks at HJ Heinz Co that represents a low earnings growth example averaging only 4 8  per annum and a higher yield currently at 3 6   Just as with each of the other three examples  HJ Heinz Co s stock price tracks earnings  Furthermore  by looking at the light blue shaded area we immediately see a high payout ratio  see performance table below  HJ Heinz Co s performance results offer up a lesson in total return  With a low growth company  capital appreciation is going to be less than we would expect from a faster growing company  Consequently  we see that over this 10 year period that Heinz grew a  1000 initial investment into  1746 41 for a 5 9  annual return  In other words  HJ Heinz Co s stock generated  746 41 of profit Dividends on the other hand equaled  407 64 cumulative since 2003 up through year end 2011 on a  1000 investment  Consequently  although the dividend component was still lower than the capital appreciation component  they did represent a much higher percentage of the total return  To be clear  a low growth  high yield dividend stock will show a higher portion of total return from dividends than a higher growth example would Summary and ConclusionsThis article is offered to illustrate the potential total returns that can be received by investing in high quality dividend growth stocks purchased at sound valuations  The major underlying theme here is that total return is a function of valuation  earnings growth  dividends and dividend growth for dividend paying stocks  For non dividend paying stocks  total return will be a function of earnings growth adjusted by valuation Although we understand that many of our dividend growth investing friends prefer to ignore capital appreciation in favor of dividend income  we are hopeful that this article enhances their appreciation for appreciation  Another way of looking at this is that if your asset base is large enough that you can live off your dividend income  then it makes some sense that you might not worry too much about your capital s growth  But isn t it nice to know that solid capital growth is a potential side effect of a good dividend growth stock portfolio Moreover  isn t it nice to know that long term capital appreciation  although perhaps less certain than dividend growth  will in most cases be much greater than your cumulative dividend income  Frankly  we believe that a well researched portfolio of high quality dividend growth stocks purchased at sound valuations provide a high probability for a secure and comfortable retirement  Of course  continuous due diligence and monitoring is required  And believe it or not  the most exciting part of this recipe is the high capital appreciation potential Finally  this article attempted to illustrate the many variations that comprise the dividend growth stock universe  Although we only showed a few examples  there are many sizes  shapes and flavors of dividend growth stocks out there  Some offer higher growth and less income  some offer higher income and less growth and just about everything in between  The secret is to properly evaluate each potential candidate based on its own merits and attributes  We believe this is a job that is best done one
