quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been stable ahead of second quarter 2019 results and is currently pegged at 75 cents per share  suggesting growth of 29 3  from the year ago reported figure Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsPlano  TX based Diodes  a manufacturer and supplier of high quality discrete and analog semiconductor products  is increasingly focusing on high margin end markets  primarily industrial  automotive and Pericom products Notably  revenues in automotive and industrial end markets surged 23  and 39   respectively  on a year over year basis  in the last reported quarter  The momentum is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter Robust demand of USB Type C charging and packet switches  infotainment systems  other advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS  solutions  Zener  Diodes bridges  and MOSFET design wins are anticipated to aid revenue growth in automotive

32050,253565,DIOD,Should Value Investors Consider Diodes  DIOD  Stock Now  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Diodes Incorporated   NASDAQ DIOD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks P E RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Diodes has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 34  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 43  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Diodes  current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 20 47  over the past five years Further the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 26  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Diodes has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 99  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Diodes  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Diodes has a P S ratio of about 1 64  This is considerably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 25 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Diodes currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DIOD a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 82  which is slightly better than the industry average of 9 79  Clearly  DIOD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Diodes might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives DIOD a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 2 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Diodes Incorporated Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDiodes is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  top 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past two years  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3  This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies

32099,253614,DIOD,5 Stocks With Substantial Net Profit Margin To Invest In,opinion,The primary motive of any investor is to earn maximum returns from his stakes  Thus  they are always on the lookout for companies  which are raking in huge moolah Net profit margin is the most effective way to measure a company s profitability  A proper analysis of the same reveals how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance The Winning StrategyA healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought after elements in a business model Apart from these  we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months  Most Recent     greater than equal to 0  High net profit margin indicates solid profitability Percentage Change in EPS F 0   F 1  greater than equal to 0  It indicates earnings growth Average Broker Rating  1 5  equal to 1  A rating of  1 indicates brokers  extreme bullishness on the stock Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks with

However  a few tech stocks have gained during this period despite the stock market mayhem Wall Street Tumbles as Trade War ResurfacesOn May 10  the U S  government hiked existing tariff rates to 25

32137,253652,DIOD,5 Top Ranked ETFs   Stocks On Sale,opinion,After a peak in early May  the Wall Street has been turbulent  given the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the United States and

32144,253659,DIOD,Top 6 Bets With Wide Net Profit Margin To Add To Portfolio,opinion,Businesses earning big bucks are pursued by all and sundry  In order to estimate the limit of profit  there is no better measure than the net profit margin Net profit margin signifies the financial standing of a company  It is indicative of the company s ability to manage its resources  making it the paramount metric to assess its profitability Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases  the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company s performance

from this strategy Screening ParametersNet Margin 12 months  Most Recent     greater than equal to 0  High net profit margin indicates solid profitability Percentage Change in EPS F 0   F 1  greater

32159,253674,DIOD,6 Stocks To Gain From A US China Trade Deal,opinion,Fresh optimism over a possible solution to the U S  China trade deadlock buoyed markets on Dec 12  A series of developments were the primary catalysts to this new found optimism  Firstly  President Trump indicated on Dec 11 that he will step in to resolve the crisis over a top Huawei executive if it helps to ease trade relations with China  Additionally  The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec 12 that China is working toward offering foreign companies greater access to its domestic market  Previously  China had reportedly offered to make key concessions in order to resolve the lingering trade conflict during a conversation with top U S  officials  These developments indicate that a U S  China trade deal is increasingly likely over the next few months  Technology  materials and industrial stocks are likely to benefit the most from such an agreement  Picking stocks from these sectors would be prudent at this point  Trump Ready to Intervene in Huawei Executive CrisisSpeaking to Reuters on Tuesday  President Trump said that he was willing to intervene in the crisis created by the arrest of a top Huawei executive if it helped to improve trade relations with China  Trump said that he would step in if he thought  it s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made  Trump also sounded confident about arriving at a trade deal with China  He said that telephonic discussions were being held with China on trade issues  This was possibly a reference to the teleconference held on Dec 11

Foreign CompaniesAccording to The Wall Street Journal  China is looking to replace its Made in China 2025 plan with a policy which offers foreign companies greater access to its domestic market  President Xi s ambitious Made in China 2025 plan aimed at making China a leader in cutting edge technologies  Robotics  information and clean energy cars were some of the focus areas of this blueprint  However  Beijing is now looking to introduce a fresh policy which will tone down China s attempt to dominate the manufacturing space  Instead  China s domestic sector would welcome greater participation from foreign companies  The new plan is likely to be launched next year  at a time when the United States and China are in the final stages of negotiating a much awaited trade deal   Incidentally  on Dec 11  China reportedly made fresh overtures to the United States to end the long standing trade impasse  Suggested measures include an increase in offtake of soybeans and other crops  The most significant of these measures is a proposal to reduce tariffs on U S  autos from 40  to 15    Read   Our ChoicesSeveral developments over the course of this week indicate that both the United States and China are eager to end their lingering trade war  President Trump has also indicated that he will go an extra mile to resolve these tensions  He has even offered to intervene in the case of the top Huawei executive whose arrest had heightened trade tensions  Technology  materials and industrials stocks will likely gain the most from this development  This is why it makes sense to

Corp    NYSE CE   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Stocks to Gain from a U S  China Trade DealFresh optimism over a possible solution to the U S  China trade deadlock buoyed markets on Dec 12  A series of developments were the primary catalysts to this new found optimism  Firstly  President Trump indicated on Dec 11 that he will step in to resolve the crisis over a top Huawei executive if it helps to ease trade relations with China   Additionally  The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec 12 that China is working toward offering foreign companies greater access to its domestic market  Previously  China had reportedly offered to make key concessions in order to resolve the lingering trade conflict during a conversation with top U S  officials  These developments indicate that a U S  China trade deal is increasingly likely over the next few months  Technology  materials and industrial stocks are likely to benefit the most from such an agreement  Picking stocks from these sectors would be prudent at this point  Trump Ready to Intervene in Huawei Executive CrisisSpeaking to Reuters on Tuesday  President Trump said that he was willing to intervene in the crisis created by the arrest of a top Huawei executive if it helped to improve trade relations with China  Trump said that he would step in if he thought  it s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made  Trump also sounded confident about arriving at a trade deal with China  He said that telephonic discussions were being held with China on trade issues  This was possibly a reference to the teleconference held on Dec 11 between top U S  and Chinese officials  According to Trump  additional meetings between U S  and Chinese officials are likely to take place in the near future  China May Offer Greater Access to Foreign CompaniesAccording to The Wall Street Journal  China is looking to replace its Made in China 2025 plan with a policy which offers foreign companies

company in deploying its resources  making it the most suitable metric for the measurement of profitability  Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes and other expenses  In fact  net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost control measures Also  higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled

investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors However  net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls  The metric varies widely from industry to industry  While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries  it is not that important for technology companies Moreover  the difference in accounting treatment of various items   especially non cash expenses like depreciation and stock based compensation   makes comparison a daunting task Further  for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding  higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit  In such cases

32199,253714,DIOD,Apple Shares Down 5   Now What ,opinion,"Bad news coming out of Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   supply chain has driven some investors to panic  sending shares swooning 

 
Specifically  Lumentum  which makes Face ID technology for its latest generation of iPhones  slashed its adjusted EPS guidance range to  1 15    1 34  previous  1 60    1 75  and its revenue outlook to  335 million    355 million  previous  405 million    430 million  citing notably softer demand at a key customer  this could be Apple  since the iPhone maker accounted for 30  of its annual revenue  
Suppliers Japan Display and British chipmaker IQE also pulled down estimates citing weaker smartphone demand 
This followed reports from Japanese daily Nikkei that suppliers Foxconn and Pegatron were halting plans to further expand production lines related to the cheapest of this year s lineup  the XR 
Analysts turned negative following Apple s announcement that it would no longer provide details about the number of devices it sells  or even how that breaks down between iPhones  iPads  Macs  etc 
 The lack of transparency is disappointing  and will likely limit investor s visibility into the company   said BMO Capital s Tim Long   Our view remains that units may not grow at all going forward  and while average selling prices  ASPs  are still increasing  at some point they will plateau  
So first  it was Apple s announcement that it would no longer provide certain numbers  then it was the covering analysts voicing their misgivings  and finally  it s Apple suppliers taking down their forecasts 
While things don t look good at this point  the situation was expected  What remains unknown is the extent of damage to Apple  how it will tell on its revenue and profits  how much of it was planned by the company and how much damage control it has up its sleeve 
We won t know the impact on the numbers until the next earnings announcement and we already know that the softness is largely driven by saturation in developed markets  weak demand for very high end devices in developing markets  like India   longer replacement cycles and the stronger dollar that makes Apple products more expensive internationally  But it also makes sense to revisit what Apple has knowingly done to boost its services business at the cost of its hardware business 
So consider the iOS 12  which for the first time  supports 28 devices  including models that launched way back in 2013  This will allow the camera to launch 70  faster and make the keyboard 50  faster  likely supporting the services Apple badly wants the user to avail 
The feeling that Apple is now helping users to hang on to their devices longer may also encourage some to try a more expensive device sometime in the future  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that this move could extend iPhone replacement cycles by six months to 3 2 years and push unit sales down by 6  percent a year for three years 
Second  earlier this year  Apple agreed to pay for battery replacement of older iPhones when they were slowing down  a cost they incurred for the sake of loyalty  so older iPhone users remained in the Apple ecosystem with no need to upgrade 
How much of this Apple will make up with increased service revenue is of course unclear  at least in the near to midterm  But its services prospects are bright and the company is also seeing momentum there 
Recommendation
Because of the increased uncertainty  it s probably a better idea wait for the share price to stabilize before taking any further action  So Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Buy ranked tech stocks worth considering instead would be Diodes Inc    NASDAQ DIOD    Himax Technologies   NASDAQ HIMX    ACM Research   NASDAQ ACMR   and Park City Group   NASDAQ PCYG    But since isnt the best time to invest in tech given the market s concerns about its over valuation  you can also take a look at the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

32201,253716,DIOD,4 Stocks With Rising Cash Flows To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,Investors generally prefer businesses that earn profits  But even a profit making company can end up being bankrupt while meeting its obligations if it has a dearth of cash flow  Therefore  rather than brooding too much on profit numbers  effectively judging a company s resiliency by assessing its efficacy in generating cash flows can be far more rewarding This is because  cash is the key to a company s existence  development and success  It offers the flexibility to make decisions  the means to make investments and the fuel to run its growth engine  thereby indicating a company s true financial health  In fact  cash not only shields a company from market mayhem but also indicates that profits are being channelized in the right direction To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash

duties had caused widespread panic among investors  Also weighing on the markets was Trump s threat to slap tariffs on another  267 billion of Chinese imports  As a whole  tariffs related worries had

32282,253797,DIOD,Feds Object To Broadcom s Hostile Takeover Of Qualcomm,opinion,"Broadcom s   NASDAQ AVGO    117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm  read    has raised a few red flags over at the White House  According to news reports  the government has asked and Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   has agreed to postpone for 30 days its shareholders  meeting  supposed to be held yesterday  where shareholders were expected to vote in favor of replacing its current board with Broadcom selected directors 
The deal is now up for national security review even before it has been signed in an unprecedented move by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   While Broadcom has said that it was engineered by Qualcomm  it s worth noting that it has reportedly been working with CFIUS for the past year  The company now says that since it is bringing its headquarters back from Singapore to the U S   it soon won t be subject to CFIUS directions anyway 

 
Why Is CFIUS Objecting 
It appears that members of the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  are concerned that the emergence of Huawei as a major supplier of communications equipment and Broadcom s chances of selling parts of Qualcomm to Huawei or another Chinese firm to bring down costs could see important communications technology get transferred to the Chinese 
The treasury department under which CFIUS is organized has issued a letter pointing to the importance of having a well known and trusted company  hold the dominant role that Qualcomm does in the U S  telecommunications infrastructure   Huawei already owns 10  of the patents for the 5G standard and if it could gain access to Qualcomm s patents  this would significantly increase its share   A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States   the letter read   
Republican Senator John Cornyn also indicated in a letter to theTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin last week that in this context  Broadcom s determination to take over Qualcomm in a hostile bid appeared significant 
Conclusion
Qualcomm is set to maintain dominance in the 5G standard  as it recently brought a large number of carriers and handset makers to adopt its technologies  It has also made peace with Samsung  KS 005930   a major customer that played a big role in its legal troubles with the Korean FTC 
The company s need for Broadcom isn t clear because cost cutting isn t going to help it stay at the leading edge  Senator Cornyn s concerns seem justified under the circumstances 
However  that doesn t mean a deal won t take place  As Broadcom pointed out  it may soon be outside CFIUS s jurisdiction  It s not exactly anti competitive because the companies operate in adjacent but different segments of the semiconductor market 
Moreover  customer losses  if they occur  will not be a problem for Qualcomm investors who are cashing out  While Qualcomm customers are concerned about the takeover  they may not be in a position to sway investor opinion if the deal is sweet enough for investors 
The board has a big task ahead to convince the owners that the company is worth more than what Broadcom is willing to pay 
Both Qualcomm and Broadcom shares carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Semiconductor stocks worth buying instead are Mellanox Technologies   NASDAQ MLNX   with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   or Diodes   NASDAQ DIOD    or Ichor Holdings   NASDAQ ICHR    which have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Or  take a look at

32283,253798,DIOD,Semiconductor Stock Earnings On May 8  MCHP  DIOD  VSH  MXL,opinion,"The Q1 earnings season will see releases from a number of semiconductor companies over the next few days  The industry serves as a driver  enabler and indicator of technological progress 
According to the latest   technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double digit earnings growth this quarter  Per the report  total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 28 5  on 12 6  higher revenues 
We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year  The sector has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud based platforms  growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence  AI  solutions  Augmented Virtual reality devices  autonomous cars  advanced driver assisted systems  ADAS  and Internet of Things  IoT  related software 
We believe the aforementioned trends have provided some much needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter loss of business due to the declining PC market  which still consumes the bulk of the chips  Notably  according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics   WSTS    semiconductor revenues climbed 20 6  year over year to  408 7 billion in 2017 
The semiconductor industry is anticipated to continue to witness growth this year as well  although not as high as 2017 but still at a respectable rate  Per the WSTS report  semiconductor revenues are likely to touch  437 3 billion in 2018  representing growth of 7 7  
The industry is poised to benefit from rising demand for new technologies  deployment of 5G broadband technology globally and President Trump s pro business policies  including tax cuts  deregulation and outlays on infrastructure 
However  this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space  It should be noted that a company s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management s ability to implement operating and strategic plans 
In other words  a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution 
Let s see what s in store for the following semiconductor stocks  all of which are slated to release quarterly figures on May 8 
Microchip Technology Inc    NASDAQ MCHP   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 35 per share while the same for revenues stands at  984 5 Million  The estimates  when compared with the year ago quarter figures  represent 16 4  and 9 1  increase in earnings and revenues  respectively  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Further  the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5 3   You can see  Microchip Technology Inc  Price and Consensus

   Microchip is benefiting from robust demand for 8 bit  16 bit and 32 bit microcontrollers  We believe that the company s expanding product portfolio driven by new launches will continue to improve customer base  Additionally  the company expanded collaboration with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web services to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud system 
The company also continues to capitalize on enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with design wins  This enables Microchip to have a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry   Read more   
Next up is Diodes Inc    NASDAQ DIOD    which is set to report first quarter 2018 results  The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 43 cents  representing remarkable year over year growth of 207 1   Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly  269 million  up 13 8  from the year ago quarter Diodes Inc  Price and Consensus

   We believe that the BCD Semiconductor acquisition is benefiting Diodes by expanding its footprint in the broader analog market and extending its product offerings  Further  the company s product launches and product refreshes are anticipated to boost revenues  However  stiff competition remains a concern 
Another semiconductor company  Vishay Intertechnology  Inc    NYSE VSH    is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s revenues and earnings is pegged at  685 million and 37 cents per share  respectively  indicating growth of 12 9  for revenues and an increase of 32 1  for earnings on a year over year basis  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 Vishay Intertechnology  Inc  Price and Consensus

   The company is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors as well as passive components  We believe that Vishay s product innovations  successful acquisition strategy  and one stop shop service will act as a catalyst  going forward 
MaxLinear  Inc    NYSE MXL   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s revenues and earnings is pegged at  112 2 million and 35 cents per share  respectively  indicating growth of 26 2  for revenues and an increase of 6 1  for earnings on a year over year basis  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 MaxLinear  Inc  Price and Consensus

   MaxLinear is a provider of radio frequency analog and mixed signal semiconductor SoC solutions for broadband communication applications which offers small silicon die size  and low power consumption  The company recorded an increase of 31  in last quarter revenues which indicates that its increased investment toward sales and marketing are paying off  We believe although elevated expenses are hurting its near term profitability  these will have long term benefits

driven by solid performance of tech heavyweights such as Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a

Swing trade Truecar Inc  NASDAQ TRUE   after snapping back to resistance  fell on Tuesday  and fell hard  dropping another 67 cents  or 4 18   to 15 34  on 2 6 million shares traded  It looks like it s going to retest the lows right about 14 40  50  maybe as low as 14  but that 14 40 range seems to be some kind of support zone potentially  I think that  however  we re going to see it eventually get down to 12 or 13

32400,253915,DIOD,Sector Detector  Santa Tries To  Sleigh  The Fiscal Cliff,opinion,Santa Claus is trying his hardest to keep spirits bright among stock investors  But the President and the House are not playing nice and just might find a lump of coal in their stockings  Neither appears willing to give an inch  so some observers predict that we will indeed go over the fiscal cliff  at least until mid January  Then  with across the board tax increases and spending cuts in place  the politicians can be seen as having restored tax cuts for most of us rather than seen as making the marginal rates on some of us go up Let s review some key dates  First  December 17 is when the President is scheduled to start his vacation  so theoretically a budget deal needs to be struck by then  Unfortunately  I haven t been hearing anything about Clinton style late night phone calls to cajole congress into hammering out some kind of compromise deal  Rallying support from the public is not the same thing  Conservatives are often called evil doers for wanting to cut spending on  sacred  programs  but today more than ever before  someone has to be the grown up and say no  Governing a debt ridden nation is hard work  Just look at what the eurozone is going through  Continuing to be the good guy by saying yes to everyone s pet program is no longer an option The U S  overall has largely avoided the really big discomfort so far because we are in the singular position of being able to print money without causing inflation  But more debt is not a long term answer  It has always been Fed Chairman Bernanke s plan to eventually shrink the balance sheet back down to normal levels  Stimulus is intended to help push up revenues  create jobs  and thus reduce the need for entitlements like jobless claims  but spending cuts ultimately will be necessary to make any major impact on the deficit  On Wednesday  Bernanke announced a new round of stimulus in the face of a still shaky economic recovery  and he said that the Fed would keep interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls below 6 5   as long as inflation remains below 2 5  The next date of interest is December 21 and what some say is the Mayan Prophecy end of days  It will be a very Merry Christmas indeed if the black hole doesn t suck up the Earth or floods don t engulf us all  There s no materialism in that Christmas wish If we all wake up on Saturday  December 22  then it will back to reality  But first there is the Christmas break on Monday and Tuesday before the cliff kicks in on January 1 The market has been impressively resilient given the huge cloud of uncertainty  Exceptions include Apple  AAPL  which has fallen substantially in what many are calling tax related selling in to lock in capital gains at the lower tax rates we have today But if a deal can get done even if it is sometime during January many insiders think that the economy is primed to roar  It might be worthwhile to buy some February call options on a market index  as a lottery ticket The charts got more bullish this past week as investors begin to position in anticipation of a budget deal  The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 143 51  confirming its break above strong overhead resistance at both the 50 day simple moving average and prior support turned resistance at 143  A bullish rising channel looks to be forming  and the upper line of the channel appears to be converging with the prior triple top resistance near 147  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all providing little guidance as they cycle back and forth within the trading noise  The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 15 95  which is down further from last week and still well below the important 20 level  reflecting no apparent fear By the way  Sabrient Systems and subsidiary Gradient Analytics have launched their long awaiting Earnings Quality Rank  EQR  a quantitative model based on Gradient s qualitative forensic accounting screening factors and the test results are even more impressive than we had hoped  EQR offers broad high level coverage of over 3 000 stocks from a quality of earnings perspective  It can be used by a fundamental analyst to scan a universe for short ideas or for evaluating stocks in his portfolio or on her radar screen  or it can be used by a quant analyst as a value added input to his own quant model  Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Little change in the rankings this week  Technology  IYW  stays in the top spot with an Outlook score of 82  IYW still shows the best long term growth rate  forward P E  and return ratios  Consumer Goods  IYK  continues to hold the best analyst score and sports solid return ratios in its own right  reflected in its Outlook score of 77  Healthcare  IYH  stays in third place at 74  and then there is once again a rather large 24 point gap down to Financial  IYF  in fourth place with a modest score of 50 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 15  and is joined in the bottom two this week by Utilities  IDU  with a 28  Stocks within IYZ appear overvalued from the standpoint of the forward P E and lack analyst support 3  Overall  I continue to characterize the fundamentals based Outlook rankings as neutral  with aggressive and defensive sectors mixed about in the rankings  Only three sectors score above 50  and two of those are defensive  non cyclical  sectors  IYK and IYH   All of this continues to reflect uncertainty about economic growth and the Federal budget negotiations 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Materials  IYM  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 61  Utilities  IDU  is the clear laggard on strong market days  scoring 37  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is the clear investor safe haven on weak market days  scoring 57  Energy  IYE  is now the weakest during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 39  followed closely by Materials  IYM  at 40  In other words  Energy and Materials stocks have been selling off the most lately when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  now shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 185  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 111  As for Bull Bear combination  Consumer Goods  IYK  has the best score at 105  while Energy  IYE  and Utilities  IDU  share the worst at 94 These scores represent the view that the Technology and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Utilities sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYW and IYK include Tech Data  TECD   Cerner  CERN   NVR Inc   NVR   and The J M  Smucker Company  SJM  By the way  Sabrient subsidiary Gradient Analytics  whose team of analysts performs in depth analysis of forensic accounting  earnings quality  and equity incentives  primarily to sniff out red flags  had some strong performers among their negative ratings this earnings season  Diodes  DIOD   Tiffany   Co   TIF   CLARCOR  CLC   Jos  A Bank Clothiers  JOSB   and The Men s Wearhouse  MW  are examples of stock identified as at risk that fell substantially after their earnings reports Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned   About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look   Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods   Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions   Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors   About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias   However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs
