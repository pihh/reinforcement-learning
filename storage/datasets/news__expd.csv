intermodal volumes in recent years is anticipated to drive railroads  top line  Volumes at this key revenue generating unit rose 5 6  in 2018  thanks to an increasing number of freight conversions from highway to rail owing to limited truck supply Strong intermodal volumes have been bolstering railroads  top line and the uptrend is likely to continue going forward  Although coal volumes have historically contributed the maximum to rail carloads  the companies have shifted their dependence to intermodal owing to dwindling coal volumes   Intermodal now reportedly dominates overall carloads  Apart from a low truck count  growing e commerce demand is another factor fueling growth of intermodal  Consequently  the sluggish coal scenario is likely to be less of a hindrance for railroads

International of Washington Inc    NASDAQ EXPD   Use DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Analysis to Pick 5 Top Ranked Quality StocksNow that trade tension between the United States and China have taken the Wall Street in its grip  exposure to quality picks has become necessary   There are various ratios that can help you find great stocks  Return on equity is one of them The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis For the rest

105485,327000,EXPD,Old Dominion  ODFL  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Old Dominion Freight Line   NASDAQ ODFL    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10 7  over the past month  ODFL hit a new 52 week high of  161 04 in the previous session  Old Dominion Freight Line has gained 22 1  since the start of the year compared to the 1 1  move for the Transportation sector and the 9 4  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 26  2018  Old Dominion Freight Line reported EPS of  1 33 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 3 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 15  
For the current fiscal year  Old Dominion Freight Line is expected to post earnings of  6 42 per share on  3 94 billion in revenues  This represents a 47 25  change in EPS on a 17 31  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 23 per share on  4 28 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 12 69  and 8 63   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
While ODFL has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Old Dominion Freight Line has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 25X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 23 4X versus its peer group s average of 10 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 07  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Old Dominion Freight Line  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Old Dominion Freight Line currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Old Dominion Freight Line fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though ODFL shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Old Dominion Freight Line Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Saia   NASDAQ SAIA    Herc Holdings   NYSE HRI    and Expeditors International of Washington   NASDAQ EXPD    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ODFL  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/old-dominion-odfl-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200323907,200323907

105488,327003,EXPD,4 Transportation Picks To Reward You With Handsome Dividends ,opinion,"It is a well known fact that expenses associated with oil are considered to be one of the major input costs for any transportation company  Therefore  the recent upsurge in fuel costs does not augur well for stocks in the space So far this year  oil prices have increased roughly 10  and are currently trading at around  66 a barrel  Various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to the rise in oil price  In fact  this marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity  which was trading at around  30 a barrel in 2016  Transports Feeling the PinchWith fuel costs on the rise  it is natural that transportation stocks would be hit hard  This is because an upsurge in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of transports  thus limiting bottom line growth In fact  the first quarter earnings season witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs  Notably  oil prices were up approximately 8  in the January March period  This uptrend continued in the April June period as well Highlighting its struggles  the  is currently ranked 14th among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors The unfavorable rank places the sector in the bottom 13  of the Zacks sectors Turbulence Likely to Continue in Q2 The fact that high fuel costs will restrict bottom line growth of transports in the second quarter can be made out from our latest   Even though  the top and bottom line of S P 500 companies in the Transportation sector are projected to grow year over year to the tune of 7 6  and 12 3   respectively  the figures compare unfavorably to the readings in the first quarter  Revenues and earnings had displayed growth of 9  and 21 3  for transports in the January March period Key transportation players like American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   expect second quarter results to be affected by high fuel costs  Currently  Delta envisions second quarter fuel costs per gallon between  2 20 and  2 25 compared with  2 07 and  2 12 projected earlier  This airline behemoth has also slashed its earnings per share guidance for the soon to be reported quarter due to the cost headwind  The bottom line is now anticipated in the range of  1 65  1 75  lower than the prior estimate between  1 80 and  2 Apart from high fuel costs  expenses on the labor front are expected to weigh on transportation stocks  bottom line performancein the second quarter Sector Lags on the Price Front

105523,327038,EXPD,Triton International  TRTN  Up 17 4  In A Year  Here s Why,opinion,"Shares of Triton International Limited   NYSE TRTN   have gained 17 4  in a year s time  outperforming the  s 14 5  rally 

Reasons Behind the Uptick
Triton International s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments are encouraging  Evidently  in May 2018  the company raised its quarterly dividend by 15  to 52 cents per share  annualized  2 08   In the first quarter of 2018  it paid approximately  36 million in dividends  reflecting an increase of 8 5  year over year  Also  the company s strong cash flow generation is commendable 
Furthermore  Triton International s initiatives to grow its fleet appear promising  The new tax law is an added positive for the company  In fact  reduction in effective tax rate due to the new law led to bottom line growth in the first quarter 
We believe the new tax law is a blessing not only for Triton International  but all  companies  This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder friendly activities  Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CP   and Expeditors International of Washington  Inc    NASDAQ EXPD   also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law 
Notably  a majority of Triton International s revenues is derived from its equipment leasing unit  Most of its leasing revenues are generated from international containers  To this end  the metric increased a respective 13 8  and 20 3  in the Asian and European markets in the first quarter 
We are also impressed by the company s efforts to grow its fleet  CAGR of 8 2  over the 2005 2017 period   Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings moved north to the tune of 7 1  over the last 60 days  reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the stock 
Bullish Outlook
The company s outlook for the rest of 2018 is impressive  It expects gradual increase in adjusted net income for the current year  Meanwhile  demand for the company s containers is anticipated to remain high  thus boosting growth  Favorable market conditions should also drive results in the remaining quarters of 2018 
At its Investor Day on May 31  the company stated that it expects the bottom line to grow moderately in the remainder of the year  Asset growth for 2018 is projected between 7  and 10   Cash flow before capex is expected to exceed 80  of leasing revenues 
Other Favorable Readings
Triton International s trailing 12 month return on equity  ROE  supports its growth potential  The company s ROE of 12 3  compares favorably with ROE of 8 8  for its industry  This reflects the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders  funds  Also  Triton International is attractively valued 
Going by the EV by EBITDA ratio  the stock doesn t look expensive at this point   The measure for the stock is 8 6  which is favorable compared with the S P 500 s 11 4  The stock s favorable positioning compared to the broader market certainly signals more upside 
Additionally  the stock has a  of A  which highlights its attractiveness  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores 
Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score 
Undoubtedly  the above positives substantiate the company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

105562,327077,EXPD,CSX Stock Scales 52 Week High  What s Driving The Stock ,opinion,"Shares of CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   scaled a 52 week high of  65 93 on May 30  before retracing a bit to close the session at  65 64  The day s closing price reflected an improvement of 2 6  over May 29 s close 
We note that this S P 500 member s impressive performance was not limited to May 30  Notably  the company has performed impressively in a year  gaining 20 3  compared with the S P 500 Index s 11 9  rally 

 
Let s delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance 
CSX is benefiting from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system  which was implemented by the company s former CEO   E  Hunter Harrison   who expired in December 2017  The system  designed to improve its operational efficiency  is being backed by CSX s current CEO Jim Foote  The implementation of the above system resulted in CSX generating efficiency related savings to the tune of  460 million in 2017  Strong performance of its intermodal segment is also a positive for the stock 
Furthermore  improvement in operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  was in tune with the company s cost control efforts  To this end  the company s adjusted operating ratio improved 570 basis points in the first quarter  CSX expects to achieve an operating ratio of 60  by 2020 
In fact  the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends buybacks  In February 2018  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company announced a 10  dividend hike to 22 cents per share 
CSX  which bought back shares worth more than  2 billion in 2017  increased the existing share repurchase program to  5 billion  The  5 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019 
You can see  
We believe the new tax law is a blessing for  companies like CSX  This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder friendly activities  Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CP   and Expeditors International of Washington  Inc    NASDAQ EXPD   also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law 
Other Favorable Measures
CSX s trailing 12 month return on equity  ROE  supports its growth potential  Not only has the company s ROE of 18  gradually increased in a year s time  it also compares favorably with the ROE of 16 6  for the S P 500 Index 
The company s  of A further highlights its short term attractiveness  Moreover  CSX s expected earnings per share growth rate  three to five years  of 13 3  compares favorably with its  s 10 6  reading

105595,327110,EXPD,J B  Hunt  JBHT  Hits 52 Week High  What s Behind The Rally ,opinion,"Shares of J B  Hunt Transport Services  Inc    NASDAQ JBHT   scaled a 52 week high of  129 74 on May 21  before retracing a bit to close the session at  128 10  Notably  the company has performed impressively in a year s time  While the stock has surged 52   the  rallied 43 1  

Lets delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance 
J B  Hunt is gaining momentum backed by impressive performance of its primary division   Intermodal  Notably  this segment contributed 55  to the company s first quarter 2018 revenues of  1 948 2 million  Also  segmental revenues increased 14  in the quarter 
Load volumes in Intermodal segment were up 6   Revenue per load  excluding fuel surcharge revenues  rose 4  on a year over year basis  Operating income improved 20  year over year backed by volume growth and customer rate increases among other factors  For 2018  revenues from the segment are projected to increase between 7 5  and 11  
Apart from Intermodal  J B  Hunt s other key divisions   Dedicated Contract Services and Integrated Capacity Solutions   are also performing well  In fact  we expect these segments to continue the trend in the coming quarters as well  Based on this optimism  J B  Hunt anticipates its top line to increase between 11  and 15  in 2018 
Moreover  the new tax law is a boon for transportation companies like J B  Hunt  Effective tax rate at J B  Hunt is projected to come down to approximately 26  in 2018 from 37 9  in 2017  The significant cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow  which in turn  will lead to bottom line growth 
We are impressed by the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases  In January 2018  J B  Hunt raised its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share  mirroring an increase of 4 3  over the previous payout  In terms of buybacks  the company had roughly  521 million remaining under its total share buyback authorizations as of Mar 31  2018 
 Also  J B  Hunt s trailing 12 month return on equity  ROE  supports its growth potential  The company s ROE of 25 9  compares favorably with ROE of 16 3  for its industry and 16  for the S P 500 index  This implies that the company is efficiently using shareholder funds 
We expect an uptick in such investor friendly activities  courtesy of the new tax law  As a result of the huge savings generated from the reduced corporate tax rate more cash are likely to be left in hand for the company to fund such activities

J B  Huntcarries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the broader  are SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    Expeditors International of Washington  Inc    NASDAQ EXPD   and GATX Corp    NYSE GATX    While Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   SkyWest and GATX carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

105761,327276,EXPD,Expeditors  EXPD  Lags Q3 Earnings  Revenues  Stock Down,opinion,"Expeditors International of Washington Inc  s   NASDAQ EXPD   third quarter 2016 earnings of 59 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents  Earnings also declined 5  on a year over year basis 

Revenues of  1 562 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 591 million  The top line also deteriorated 5 4  from the year ago figure  Soft air freight and ocean freight revenues hurt the top line in the third quarter  The lackluster earnings report naturally displeased investors as evidenced by the stock price decline in the early trading session 
Gross profit  net revenue  decreased 4  year over year in the third quarter to  545 3 million  Gross margin  yield  improved marginally to 34 9  in the reported quarter  Expeditors exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 04 billion compared with  807 8 million at the end of 2015  During the quarter  the company repurchased 2 million shares at an average price of  51 16 per share 
Expeditors is not the only transportation company to miss earnings estimates in the third quarter  Transportation stocks like Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CP    Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP   had also reported lower than expected earnings in the quarter 
Segmental Revenues
Airfreight Services revenues declined 5 8  year over year to  621 6 million in the quarter under review  Ocean Freight and Ocean Services revenues decreased 11 2  year over year to  495 5 million  Nonetheless  Customs Brokerage and Other Services revenues inched up 3 2  year over year to approximately  445 4 million EXPEDITORS INTL Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Our Take
We are disappointed by the company s underperformance in the third quarter  However  we believe that the strengthening airfreight business due to growing trade between the U S  and China should boost the company s freight forwarding and customer brokerage business  Furthermore  we are encouraged by the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks 
Zacks Rank   A Key Pick
Currently  Expeditors has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   A better ranked transportation stock is Copa Holdings   NYSE CPA    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 12 cents to  4 67 over the last month for Copa Holdings   You can see

105800,327315,EXPD,Expeditors  EXPD  Likely To Top Q2 Earnings  Stock To Gain ,opinion,"We expect the Seattle  WA based Expeditors International of Washington   NASDAQ EXPD   to report better than expected earnings in the second quarter of 2016  Results are scheduled to be out on Aug 2 
In the first quarter of 2016  the transportation company had reported lackluster results with earnings and revenues missing estimates  All three primary segments   Airfreight Services  Ocean Freight and Ocean Services and Customs Brokerage and Other Services   performed disappointingly in the quarter 
Our quantitative model  however  hints at an earnings beat in the second quarter  Here s why 
Expeditors has the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3 or better   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company stands at  3 45  as the Most Accurate estimate is 60 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 2 cents lower 
Zacks Rank  Expeditors currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 
The favorable combination makes us optimistic about an earnings beat at Expeditors 
As a caution  we advise investors to avoid Sell rated   4 and 5  stocks going into an earnings announcement EXPEDITORS INTL Price and EPS Surprise
   What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Despite the miss in the first quarter of 2016  Expeditors has an impressive earnings history having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  at an average of 4 55   We are impressed with the company s emphasis on cost reduction to drive the bottom line  We are also positive about the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments 
In May 2016  the board of directors at Expeditors approved a hike in its dividend payout  The board declared a semi annual cash dividend of 40 cents per share  annual payout of 80 cents per share  up 11 1    We expect a detailed update on the issue during the second quarter conference call 
However  we expect the top line to remain under pressure in the second quarter as well due to soft air freight and ocean freight revenues

Here are some other transportation companies you may want to consider instead as our model shows they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Tableau Software is placed well to benefit from rising demand for business analytics tools  The company has been seeing strength in its offerings like the hybrid data architecture platform  The company has been taking a number of initiatives to boost its sales productivity and align its marketing efforts to drive growth 
However  the company s growth has been slowing down  It hasn t made profits yet  Ballooning expenses weigh on financials despite its efforts to control costs and cut down on hiring  Moreover  recently  the company witnessed some insider selling activity  which makes us less confident about the company s performance in the to be reported quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tableau Software is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Tableau Software has an Earnings ESP of  2 70   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 38 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 37 cents 
Zacks Rank   Tableau Software s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions TABLEAU SOFTWAR Price and EPS Surprise

In the daily chart  there is an intact uptrend in the small trend  which is currently already clearly in the movement  i e  above the last point two  This could definitely attract further buyers  but an imminent correction is also possible  However  as long as the green correction zone remains intact  setbacks can be used for an entry  Expeditors  Expeditors International Washington  NASDAQ EXPD  is an internationally active logistics company  The services provided include export  import  warehouse distribution  customs clearance  sea and air freight as well as additional services such as cargo insurances  order management or individually customized logistic information services  The company is not active in the areas of inland transport  overnight deliveries or in the transport of small packages 
Since the beginning of August of this year  the value has been able to stabilize itself at a pretty high level and form a temporary new high at  52 68  The correction zone of this intact trend runs between  50 58 and  48 49  Since as early as the beginning of October  this stock has been showing substantial weaknesses  and was traded beneath the green box today for the first time  However  this happened without a closing price  meaning that the trend still remained intact  If enough buyers gather  it would be a very good entry opportunity and a speculation on the continuation of the trend

Our Take
We are disappointed by the company s below par performance in the quarter  However  the earnings miss comes after six successive quarterly earnings beats  We believe that the strength in the airfreight business  led by growing trade between the U S  and China  places the company favorably in the freight forwarding and customer brokerage business  Furthermore  we are encouraged by the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks
