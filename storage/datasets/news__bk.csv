14752,236267,BK,BNY Mellon  BK  Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates As Revenues Rise,opinion,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation s   NYSE BK   fourth quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  1 01 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents  Moreover  the figure reflects rise of nearly 2  from the prior year quarter Results benefited from higher revenues and growth in assets under management  AUM   Moreover  a slight decline in expenses was a tailwind  However  the company s credit quality was mixed After considering non recurring items  net income applicable to common shareholders was  1 39 billion or  1 52 per share  up from  832 million or 84 cents per share recorded in the prior year quarter The company recorded 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  4 02  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 99  However  the figure reflects a decline of 4 5  from the previous year  Net income applicable to common shareholders  GAAP basis  for the year was  4 27 billion or  4 51 per share  up from  4 10 billion or  4 04 per share recorded in 2018 Revenues Improve  Expenses DeclineTotal revenues  GAAP basis   excluding income from consolidated investment management funds  increased 18 1  year over year to  4 76 billion in the fourth quarter  The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 68 billion For 2019  total revenues  GAAP basis   excluding income from consolidated investment management funds  increased marginally year over year to  16 41 billion  The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  16 16 billion Quarterly net interest revenues  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  non GAAP basis   were  817 million  down 8 1  year over year  The decline resulted from lower non interest bearing deposits and the impact of lower interest rates on the securities portfolio and other interest earning assets Also  non GAAP net interest margin  FTE basis  contracted 15 basis points year over year to 1 09  Total fee and other revenues increased 25 4  year over year to  3 95 billion  The rise was driven by improvement in total investment services fees  and investment and other income Total non interest expenses were  2 96 billion  down nearly 1  year over year  This reflects a decrease in all expense components  except for staff expenses  software and equipment costs  sub custodian and clearing costs  business development expenses  and bank assessment charges Solid Asset PositionAs of Dec 31  2019  AUM was  1 91 trillion  up 11  year over year  This reflects higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U S  dollar  partly offset by net outflows Assets under custody and or administration of  37 1 trillion grew 12 1  year over year  reflecting higher market values and client inflows Credit Quality  Mixed BagAs of Dec 31  2019  non performing assets were  89 million  up from  79 million registered at the end of the prior year quarter In the reported quarter  provision for credit losses

fourth quarter  BNY Mellon bought back 22 2 million shares for  1 04 billion  Further  it paid out dividends worth  286 million to common shareholders Our ViewpointThe company s inorganic growth strategy  global reach and strong balance sheet position will go a long way in supporting the bottom line  Moreover  given a solid liquidity position  it will be able to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities  Also  expenses are expected to remain manageable in the upcoming quarters as the company eliminates unnecessary management layers and automates processes  However  lower interest rates will likely hamper its interest revenue growth to some extent in the near term The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

14753,236268,BK,Opening Bell  Phase One Drives Stocks To Records But Warning Bells Are Ringing,opinion,"Phase One  Positive Read  no fresh tariffs  Negative Read  priced in  hollow agreement
Asian stocks enjoyed only a tepid rally  China underperformed
Gold is flat  despite a weaker dollar and rising stocks

U S  futures extended a rally  European stocks hit a fresh record  while Asian stocks were mixed  after the milestone signature on the first stage of a trade deal between the U S  and China took markets to record highs  Haven assets the dollar  Treasurys  gold  the yen and bitcoin eased  Oil was little changed 
Contracts on all four major U S  indices advanced  For large caps  this means underlying gauges are slated to open at prices never seen before  while small caps are set to start the session at the highest levels since September  within 3 percentage points below the Russell s record in September of 2018 

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  NYSE TSM  obliterated expectations  pulling up the European tech industry  sending the STOXX Europe 600 Index to all time highs  Technically  however  we advise caution due to a rising wedge pattern  which suggests that buyers may run out of patience after feeding a market that is not making any significant movement 
Most Asian stocks enjoyed a mild rally  while ironically China s Shanghai Composite   0 52   was the worst performer  Was this profit taking after the execution of positive news priced in or a warning for investors 
While equities are running on the good news that there will be no fresh tariffs this year  there is also the feeling that markets had already played that out and are seeking fresh catalysts to sustain the priciest stocks ever  Add to that a partial agreement that doesn t solve the core issues  compounded by the U S  moving to block sales to Huawei   and despite all the current exuberance  we can t help but feel that risk is growing to the downside 
The U S  sought to prolong the optimism  with Vice President Mike Pence saying that the two world economic superpowers are already discussing Phase Two 

Yields rebounded  after finding support yesterday by the 100 DMA nearing the bottom of a rising channel   but still well below the 200 DMA   as the uptrend fights for freedom from the downtrend from the November 2018 top 

The dollar declined for the second day after failing for four straight days to penetrate the falling channel top   guarded  by the 50 DMA  after the MA fell below the 200 DMA amid the December drop  triggering the ominous Death Cross 

Gold was flat despite a weak dollar and rising equities  suggesting substantial hedging  Technically  the precious metal found support atop the bullish flag 

Bitcoin dropped along with havens  but the digital currency remains well above a completed bullish pennant atop a H S bottom 

Oil rebounded but is still below its uptrend line since early October for the second day  This  after a Golden Cross in late December  For now  the price finds support above the 200 DMA 
Up Ahead
Earnings are due from  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  and Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  on Thursday 
China GDP  along with key monthly data for December  come on Friday 
A final reading on the euro zone s December inflation is also due on Friday

47823,269338,BK, Semi Truce  Trade Deal Roils Markets From Stocks to Soybeans,news," Bloomberg     The U S  and China signed a partial trade deal that confirms a cease fire in the spat that has roiled financial markets for three years 
While the broad terms of the 94 page agreement have been known since last year s handshake deal  the text brought some clarity to markets that remained on edge  Credit card stocks  for example  were among the biggest gainers after the likes of Visa and Mastercard moved a step closer to gaining access to China s  27 trillion payments market 
Commodity markets got some numbers on China s commitments to buy agricultural products  but doubts remain  Currency traders assessed the section that reaffirmed existing G 20 commitments  and investors in tech stocks pored over details on intellectual property concessions  Here s a round up of how Wall Street reacted to the signing 
Equities
U S  stocks powered to fresh highs  only to pare the gains as President Donald Trump held forth for over an hour before signing the deal  The S P 500 was higher by 0 1  as of 3 16 p m  in New York 
 It only modestly moves the needle in the right direction   David Sowerby  portfolio manager at Ancora Advisors said   It s maybe best described as a semi truce  It removes some level of uncertainty that existed before  
 This is going to be a pretty forgettable event because we ll be so focused on the next economic report  the next earnings report   said Jim Paulsen  chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group   This is not a temporary crisis or issue and now it s over  Everyone s gotten used to the fact that this is a chronic issue  
Credit Card Firms
Within the equity market  U S  credit card companies emerged as winners amid signals the path to Chinese customers may be easing  China said it won t take longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic payments services  It s a positive sign for U S  firms that have been trying to gain access to mainland China 
 Visa Inc   NYSE V   Gained 2  as of 2 32 p m   while Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  was up 1 6  and  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP   Rose 0 7  
Currencies
The yuan rose to the strongest since July ahead of the signing and was little changed in the wake of it  as investors doubted the deal provided any real mechanism to enforce currency provisions 
 It still remains to be seen on enforcement of the exchange rate component and the deal overall   Torsten Slok  chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn   said   So we have to stay tuned with regard to the yuan  
 The pact seems to contain nothing that would keep the U S  Treasury from labeling China as a manipulator again in the future   said John Velis  a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK    The lack of detail on enforcement could also be a source of volatility  
The foreign exchange part of the U S  China trade agreement provides  nothing new on disclosure  and  that s disappointing   said Brad Setser  who worked at the U S  Treasury during President Barack Obama s administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations   If there is any real substance to this deal  it isn t in the text but rather an informal commitment by China not to guide the yuan down from its already depreciated levels versus the dollar so long as the truce holds  
Semiconductors
Chipmakers fell Wednesday  The group had been among the most sensitive to any trade related headlines  from tariffs to steps to thwart China s Huawei Technologies Co  The U S  signaled on Tuesday that Huawei remains in its sights 
 Tech remains an issue   Dave Lutz  managing director of JonesTrading  said  Semiconductors are  at ground zero for that  Huawei looms  We act against Huawei  and that s probably not going to help sentiment in Semis  
Soybean Futures Tumble
U S  farmers bore the brunt of China s retaliation during the three year spat  and Trump sought to secure increased levels of purchase commitments from China  The deal indicated China will step up purchases of agricultural goods  but the nation said it would do so according to demand  Soybean prices slumped 
 The Chinese will buy according to their need  but they ll need a lot  make no mistake about it   said Sal Gilbertie  president and co founder of Teucrium Trading   The markets may have been anticipating an immediate burst of buying but this is more of a buy the rumor  sell the fact  
Emerging Markets
The deal did little to alter views on emerging market assets  which have been rallying since last year s detente in the trade war amid expectations for a pickup in global demand 
 It s all baked in the cake   Sacha Tihanyi  deputy head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities in New York said  With continued tariffs and little urgency for a phase two deal   there s probably more risk of downside surprises on the trade front with China than upside  It puts a stamp on what the markets moved on already  
Looking Ahead to Phase Two
Trump said negotiations of the next phase will begin immediately  and investors remained on edge over whether that could entail fresh tariffs or raise other uncertainties for businesses and investors  For now  those talks look set to start on a good footing 
 The implication is that at least it sets a better mood  whether it gets done   Donald Selkin  chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp   said   At least it sets a framework perhaps for a better tone going into stage two but there s a lot of uncertainty  There s a lot in phase one that is not as clear as it s supposed to be  
 It s a real positive   said Matt Forester  chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Lockwood Advisors   There are pieces to the agreement that maybe were not expected in the markets especially around intellectual property and technology transfer  Now the question is going to be whether they will actually be able to reach purchase commitments  But that there is an agreement to try reach those is a good thing  ",2020-01-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/semitruce-trade-deal-roils-markets-from-stocks-to-soybeans-2060456,2060456

202142,423658,BK,KPMG fined 3 5 million pounds for BNY Mellon client audit,news,"By Huw Jones
LONDON  Reuters    Accounting firm KPMG has been fined 3 5 million pounds   4 24 million  by Britain s accounting watchdog for failing to audit client accounts of BNY Mellon  N BK  bank properly  the latest in a string of penalties on KPMG for poor performance 
The fine will keep the pressure on Britain s government to come forward with legislation that implements a proposed shake up of auditing  including a more powerful watchdog 
The Financial Reporting Council  FRC  said on Thursday that in 2011  BNY Mellon held more than a trillion pounds in assets on behalf of its customers  which under  CASS  safekeeping rules must be audited to ensure the assets are being kept safe 
KPMG and Richard Hinton  who signed the client assets report on behalf of KPMG  admitted misconduct  the FRC said 
KPMG said it regretted that aspects of its work did not meet the standards expected by the regulator   We are happy to undertake the additional review process outlined by the FRC as part of our drive to improve audit quality   it said in a statement 
The fine was discounted from 5 million pounds for admission of misconduct  Hinton s 75 000 pound fine was discounted to 52 500 pounds  the watchdog said 
Britain s finance industry watchdog  the Financial Conduct Authority  had fined BNY Mellon 126 million pounds in April 2015 for failing to keep customer money safe 
In the year to March  the accounting watchdog has fined accounting firms nearly 43 million pounds  with KPMG making up nearly half of the total after admitting misconduct in audits of The Co operative Bank  retailer Ted Baker  and professional services firm Quindell 
The watchdog had already put KPMG into close supervision measures  and on Thursday added a requirement for a quality performance review of everyone who signs a client assets report on behalf of KPMG 
Hinton was not a partner at KPMG and is not currently working as a CASS auditor  the FRC said 
The FRC has substantially increased fines on accounting firms  partly to meet criticisms from parliament that it was too timid with KPMG  EY  Deloitte and PwC  known as the  Big Four  
Accounting industry officials have expressed concerns that rocketing fines will put off people working in audit 
 We also take into account that a fine should not be such as to deter accountants from accepting audit or CASS audit engagements   the FRC said ",2019-08-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kpmg-fined-35-million-pounds-for-bny-mellon-client-audit-1942147,1942147
202143,423659,BK,Dollar Soars to New 2019 High Even as Trump Laments Its Strength,news," Bloomberg     The ascent of the dollar is proving almost unstoppable 
While U S  President Donald Trump lamented its strength on Twitter  the greenback continued to surge on Monday  taking a Bloomberg index of the U S  currency to its highest level of 2019 
The dollar strengthened as investors shifted into riskier assets such as stocks and away from havens like Treasuries  which drove up U S  debt yields and supported the American currency  Apparent progress in trade negotiations helped buoy sentiment  as did the prospect of additional stimulus in Germany  The Bloomberg gauge hit its highs of the day after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren downplayed the need for more rate cuts 
 We ve been skeptical that Fed easing by itself would doom the dollar   said John Velis  a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK    With other central banks expected to ease by as much or even more than the Fed  we always thought it would take more than policy differentials to weaken the currency  Boston Fed President Rosengren s hawkish comments today underscore the lack of downward force on the dollar coming from policy expectations  
The U S  currency gauge climbed as much as 0 3   pushing it past its May peak to a level last seen in December  The dollar rose as much as 0 3  against the yen  while the euro slipped as much as 0 1  against its American counterpart

202158,423674,BK,Bitfinex Crypto Case Shows Smaller Investors Face Greater Risk ,news," Bloomberg     The latest allegations against a major player in the nascent world of cryptocurrencies has something in common with past financial scandals  The little guy may end up holding the bag 
In a civil suit filed Thursday  New York s attorney general accused one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges of hiding the loss of about  850 million in client and corporate cash  Multimillion dollar accounts were protected  sometimes by the use of custodian banks in New York  Smaller investors received less assurance  with their funds sent to firms around the world  according to two people with knowledge of the matter 
The lawsuit targets the Bitfinex exchange and affiliated company Tether  What isn t spelled out fully is how Crypto Capital Corp   a Panamanian payments processor that handled funds from retail investors  fits into the picture  According to the suit by New York Attorney General Letitia James  Bitfinex customers sent more than  1 billion to Crypto Capital last year 
Bitfinex executives eventually came to suspect that Crypto Capital had  lost  stolen or absconded with the money   according to the suit  That means it s likely that Bitfinex s retail customers are most exposed to that loss  while institutional investors aren t 
Bitfinex and Tether have struggled to maintain a banking relationship since at least 2017  when they were dropped by their Taiwanese lenders  The issue has been most acute on the retail side of their business  which is why they used Crypto Capital  a private firm with banking connections around the world 
It was through Crypto Capital that the retail customers were told to direct deposits to Poland  Portugal and other locales  said the people  who asked not to be named discussing private business 
These accounts would usually work for a time  then get shut down  leading to customer frustration and confusion  On the retail side  Bitfinex used Crytpo Capital as its bank account and left customer money there  according to one of the people  Tether never used Crypto Capital  the person said 
If you were an institutional investor with millions to spend  Bitfinex established accounts in 2017 at Puerto Rico s Noble Bank and then  in 2018  at Deltec Bank   Trust Ltd  in the Bahamas  Noble  in fact  didn t actually hold the money  Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp  acted as custodian for a time  adding to the protection sophisticated investors received when dealing with Bitfinex 
 We have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been  in fact  seized and safeguarded   Bitfinex said Friday in a statement  That position is contradicted by the attorney general s suit  which said Bitfinex attorneys  do not believe Crypto Capital s representations that the funds have been seized  
An email to Crypto Capital seeking comment wasn t immediately answered 
Tether is one of the world s most popular cryptocurrencies because of its claim that it holds one dollar in reserve for every digital token it creates  Tether has said it holds  2 9 billion  according to its website  The allegations against Tether and Bitfinex have revived doubts about Tether s one for one assertions 
A loss of faith in Tether would be a major blow to traders who rely on it as a substitute for dollars  Virtual currencies tracked by CoinMarketCap com lost  10 billion of value within an hour of the attorney general s statement Thursday  Tether slid 1 4 percent 
State officials focused on the  loan  made by Tether to Bitfinex to cover the Crypto Capital loss  Bitfinex executives transferred  625 million  out of Tether s legitimate bank account  in November 2018  the case alleges  In return  Bitfinex credited  625 million to Tether s accounts with Crypto Capital

202159,423675,BK,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Bank Of New York Mellon,opinion,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BK broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 3 9  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for BK stock 
If that wasn t enough  BK isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  4 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for BK  You can see

202161,423677,BK,Earnings Preview  Bank Of New York Mellon  BK  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This trust bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 91 billion  down 5 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 4  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bank of New York Mellon 
For Bank of New York Mellon  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bank of New York Mellon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of  0 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  2 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bank of New York Mellon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-bank-of-new-york-mellon-bk-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200438457,200438457

202183,423699,BK,Bond Bears Popping Champagne Say U S  Yields Have Room to Rise,news," Bloomberg     A week after Treasuries mysteriously rallied in the wake of the Federal Reserve lifting its long term interest rate forecast  short sellers in the  16 trillion market have reason to celebrate 
The bond selloff deepened Thursday after data Wednesday on U S  private sector jobs bolstered the case for the Fed to keep raising rates into 2019  sending 10 year notes down the most in more than a year  Thirty year Treasury yields pushed above the 3 25 percent level that fixed income veteran Jeffrey Gundlach identified as a  game changer  
 Solid data releases  higher oil prices and a technical backdrop that suggests there are not a lot of obstacles for yields to continue to push higher will have many wondering how far this new push higher can go   said Rodrigo Catril  a Sydney based strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd 
With an American economy in good shape and equity prices flirting with record highs  10 year yields appear to be breaking out of the range of about 2 8 percent to 3 1 percent that s lasted for months  Next up on the potential catalyst list is Friday s payrolls report  which gets even more focus given the emphasis Fed officials are placing on data 
Short sellers were already positioned for more pain in the Treasury market  Speculative net short positions on 10 year notes climbed to a record  the most recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed  An update to those figures comes Friday 
 In hindsight we wish we were even shorter on U S  rates   said Raymond Lee  a fund manager at Kapstream Capital Pty in Sydney   My view was that U S  yields were going to go up    maybe to 3 25 percent    but I didn t think it would be this quick  
Ten year yields reached as high as 3 23 percent on Thursday  handily above the peak in May  and the highest since 2011  It s also above where most analysts had expected them to end the year  with the median estimate at 3 10 percent in a Bloomberg survey 
Read our research roundup of U S  rates strategists  views
Aside from data  there s another dynamic at work  the Fed s accelerating reduction of its balance sheet  It s now letting  50 billion a month of its bond portfolio run off without replacement  Along with an escalation in U S  borrowing requirements    the federal deficit hit  898 billion in the 11 months through August    that s a lot more supply to digest 
 That gradual withdrawal of liquidity is causing yields to rise   Bob Baur  chief global economist at Principal Global Investors  said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Tokyo Thursday   We look for 10 year Treasury yields to hit 3 5 percent at some point    later this year  early next year    and I think that s going to be a real problem for stock markets  
Others  including Macquarie Group Ltd  s Viktor Shvets  say ballooning debt levels will keep a lid on yields   Yields will have to stay very low  primarily because we re overleveraged   Shvets  the bank s head of Asian strategy  told Bloomberg TV in Hong Kong   There s just too much debt in the global economy  
Back on Sept  19  Gundlach said two closes above 3 25 percent on 30 year bond yields would mark a significant milestone  The Thursday session could be key  for him at least  after the Wednesday close at almost 3 34 percent 
Yields  On the march  10 s above 3  again  this time without financial media concern  Watch 3 25  on 30 s  Two closes above   game changer 
  Jeffrey Gundlach   TruthGundlach  September 19  2018
Another reason yields might trend higher is market based measures of inflation have been steady for most of this year  according to Greg Gibbs  That suggests investors don t see inflation exceeding Fed officials  2 percent target on average over the next decade  even as commodity prices climb and wage pressures build 
 The fact that they haven t risen yet may point to further upside risk for yields   said Gibbs  founder of Amplifying Global FX Capital Pty  in Breckenridge  Colorado  who previously worked on the foreign exchange desk at Australia s central bank 
For Bill Gross  dimming demand from foreign investors is adding to the pain as hedging costs rise  At the heart of this phenomenon is the swelling cost to convert payments from euro and yen into dollars 
Read more on why Gross is blaming hedging costs 
Meantime  chart levels may support the bearish view on Treasuries  after yields broke out of their 30 year downtrend  That set off  technical alarm bells  for some investors  according to  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C  
For Marvin Loh  whose career in finance began in the 1980s when yields topped 15 percent  it s important to remember that past   There is still room for higher real yields from a historical perspective   said Loh  a global strategist at Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp  in Boston

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bank of New York Mellon 
For Bank of New York Mellon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 63  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Bank of New York Mellon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 99  delivering a surprise of  7 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

202194,423710,BK,The Aussie Is Increasingly Tied to China Risks  BNY Mellon Says,news," Bloomberg     The link between Australia s dollar and China s stock market is now the tightest in more than a decade  illustrating the risks for the exchange rate as China decides how to respond to U S  trade threats  according to Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp 
The Aussie became increasingly correlated with the markets of Australia s biggest trading partner in 2015  when China hard landing fears contributed to a collapse in that country s stocks and its officials devalued the yuan  The correlation has been on the rise again since April  when U S  China trade tensions deteriorated  BNY Mellon analysis shows 
 The key question therefore when considering the AUD is how Chinese markets along with the CNY might react should a fresh announcement be made   Simon Derrick  chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon wrote in a note to clients this week  using the currency tickers for the Aussie and the yuan   This could prove a critical few weeks for the AUD  
Australia s dollar is particularly sensitive to any escalation of a trade dispute between the world s two largest economies as China buys more than a third of the nation s exports  The Australian dollar is the second worst performing major currency against the greenback this year  It traded at 71 04 U S  cents as of 11 01 a m  in Sydney  near the 2 1 2 year low it hit Tuesday 
Also undermining the Australian dollar has been an historically large gap between Australian and U S  interest rates  thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping its benchmark at a record low while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy 
 Yield support for the currency has continued to deteriorate over the summer to  in many cases  the weakest levels in 20 years   Derrick said of the Aussie

This trust bank has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 0 96  
For the last reported quarter  Bank of New York Mellon came out with earnings of  1 06 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 04 per share  representing a surprise of 1 92   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 03 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 03 per share  delivering a surprise of 0  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Bank of New York Mellon lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Bank of New York Mellon has an Earnings ESP of  0 80  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 16  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-bank-of-new-york-mellon-bk-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200373360,200373360
202212,423728,BK,Bank Of New York Mellon  BK  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This trust bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 3  
Revenues are expected to be  4 04 billion  up 8 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 37  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bank of New York Mellon 
For Bank of New York Mellon  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 68  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bank of New York Mellon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of  1 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 06  delivering a surprise of  1 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bank of New York Mellon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bank-of-new-york-mellon-bk-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200374063,200374063

For the first time in more than a decade  an index that tracks American depositary receipts of Chinese companies surpassed its previous record  helped by a stronger currency  It capped a 12 month  50 percent surge that left the Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  index at 696 21  exceeding the prior top of 693 53 set on Oct  31  2007 
Sound like a big gain  Not hardly  Eleven years ago  Chinese ADRs had jumped almost 500 percent in five years    and 48 percent in just the prior two months  The nausea inducing ride came to an abrupt end when then Premier Wen Jiabao put on hold plans to let mainland investors buy Hong Kong stocks  As worries of a global economic slowdown began to spread  the ADR index lost 70 percent of its value in the next year 
A host of factors have supported the gains  said Ilya Feygin  senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital  Chinese banks have plenty of liquidity and are getting upgrades by U S  brokers  In addition  capital outflows are less of a problem and Chinese economic data so far this year have proved to be stronger than expected

202222,423738,BK,BNY Mellon Still Watching for Bigger Shakeout Outside of Stocks,news," Bloomberg     There s still potential for market turbulence in asset classes outside of stocks  Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp  says 
 We have not seen the broad capitulation of valuation adjustments across many asset classes   BNY Mellon senior global market strategist Marvin Loh wrote in a note Wednesday   In fact  it has only been an equity adjustment at the moment  although many of the thematic catalysts have broader economic undertones  
He pointed to U S  high yield debt volatility versus that of stocks  as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index  or VIX 
 The volatility in U S  and euro high yield has actually continued to widen even as stock volatility has fallen   Loh wrote   Whether this proves to be a harbinger of additional volatility or a delayed reaction to the better tone from equity markets remains to be seen 
 A case can be made that there should be greater co movements  as most asset classes were considered rich at the start of the year   the report said  The Japanese yen is also an asset to watch because its strength shows repatriation during periods of volatility  Loh said 
Still  Loh doesn t see the current situation as too dangerous yet  A breakout  in overly troubling fashion  would need to see inflation adjusted yields move through 1 percent and the 10 year Treasury yield to move above 3 25 percent  he said  The 10 year yield is currently about 2 92 percent ",2018-02-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bny-mellon-still-watching-for-bigger-shakeout-outside-of-stocks-1250929,1250929
202223,423739,BK,Kazakhstan s frozen billions sound alarm for sovereign funds,news,"By Claire Milhench LONDON  Reuters    When a Belgian court ordered a bank to freeze  22 6 billion of assets held in trust for a Kazakhstan sovereign wealth fund  SWF   it set a worrying precedent for other SWFs  The case is one of several brought to courts in Europe by Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati who is attempting to force the Kazakh government to pay up in a dispute about his energy investments in the oil rich country  Court rulings imposing asset freezes in Belgium  the Netherlands  Sweden and Luxembourg are significant because they address the issue of whether SWFs should be treated as investment arms of governments  or as independent institutional investors  SWFs  which often invest the proceeds from the sale of national resources or manufactured goods  have traditionally enjoyed the legal immunity reserved for a sovereign to protect their assets in foreign jurisdictions   The rulings in the Kazakhstan case made waves because they ignore that immunity    This is a dangerous and worrisome precedent for other funds   said Paul Rose  an Ohio State University law professor specializing in SWFs   Lots of funds will be looking very carefully at the outcome of this case and wondering whether their assets can be frozen    The Kazakh government has said it will challenge the judgments   Whether Kazakhstan succeeds in getting the accounts unfrozen or not  those watching the case reckon it is a landmark for SWFs  whose  7 trillion in global investments range from real estate to equities and government bonds   In countries such as Norway  where disputes between investors and the government are more likely to be dealt with through efficient and independent domestic courts  SWFs have little cause to worry  analysts say  But the Kazakh case should be a concern for countries with a poor track record on investor protection  as it could encourage disgruntled investors to target SWFs  offshore held assets  Kirill Dmitriev  head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund  predicted repercussions from the Kazakh case   SWFs represent a significant  share of  global capital and any attacks on SWFs may trigger significant market turbulence   he said   Orders in Dutch and Belgian courts required Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  to freeze monies it held in custody for the Kazakh National Fund and the Republic of Kazakhstan  The Dutch court order has since been lifted  The Belgian ruling is still in place but Kazakhstan will challenge it at a court hearing that has been adjourned until April 27  Kazakh assets in Luxembourg and Sweden are still frozen   ALARM BELLS  SWF assets have been frozen before  but only in exceptional circumstances  For instance  the United Nations imposed a freeze on the Libyan Investment Authority s overseas assets in 2011 as it feared personnel in the deposed government would spirit them away  The Kazakh asset freezes followed a 2013 decision by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to award Stati and his co investors some  500 million in an arbitration  The body provides dispute resolution services to international businesses but it is not a court and is up to national courts to enforce its decisions   Kazakhstan is refusing to pay and President Nursultan Nazarbayev s government said it has done nothing wrong  It has argued that this ruling was based on fraudulent information  according to a press release from the Kazakh Justice Ministry   Stati s petition to a Belgian court to enforce the award resulted in an order requiring BNY Mellon to freeze  22 6 billion in Kazakh National Fund and Republic of Kazakhstan assets  The assets are held in custody by BNY Mellon s European bank  Brussels based The Bank of New York Mellon SA NV  BNY Mellon declined to comment   Stati also obtained a separate order from a Dutch court to freeze an approximately  5 2 billion stake in KMG Kashagan B V  owned by Samruk Kazyna  another Kazakh SWF  KMG Kashagan is a special purpose vehicle through which the country holds a stake in the Kashagan energy project  There were further orders to freeze assets in Luxembourg and Sweden   Stati has also tried to get the award enforced in courts in London and Washington  according to press releases from the Kazakh Justice Ministry  Those decisions would apply to Kazakh assets held in England or the United States   Both attempts have run into difficulties  In a preliminary hearing in June 2017  the English High Court found that the initial arbitration award may have been obtained by fraud  Proceedings are ongoing  with a full trial scheduled to begin in October  the Kazakh Justice Ministry said  Kazakhstan has also filed a separate claim against Stati in Washington with regard to the alleged fraud   IMMUNITY IN QUESTION Industry participants are watching the court cases closely    If 40 percent of a sovereign fund is frozen and you don t have access to it  that should be an alarm bell for policymakers   said Simon Quijano Evans  a strategist at Legal   General Investment Management   It s been assumed so far that these assets were relatively immune   SWFs have labored for years to position themselves as little different from any other institutional investor  mostly to allay concerns countries might have about selling assets to foreign governments   Some SWFs have even renounced their sovereign immunity in investment contracts  according to Professor Fabio Bassan  an SWF law specialist and International Law Chair at Roma Tre University  But by depicting themselves as commercial investors rather than as agents of the state  SWFs have allowed their claim to sovereign immunity to be eroded  experts say   The more they act like ordinary commercial investors and not as vehicles of the state  it creates a risk that courts will not view them as instruments of the state  and are less likely to give them immunity   Ohio University s Rose said  As in the Kazakh case  courts in different countries have different interpretations of the status of an SWF  Graham Harris  a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs  noted that English law still makes it difficult to seize sovereign wealth  but continental European courts are increasingly likely to view an SWF as a commercial entity

202232,423748,BK,Dollar Drop Could Force Global Central Banks Into Rates Rethink,news," Bloomberg     A weaker dollar could be doing the work of global central banks 
The greenback begins 2018 after its worst year since 2003  and analysts at Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp  and  Credit Agricole   PA CAGR  SA say further declines could mean central banks don t have to tighten monetary policy as much as they may now be planning 
The argument goes that by forcing up rival exchange rates  a decline in the U S  currency could slow economic growth and inflation elsewhere  creating room for interest rates to stay lower than they otherwise would be 
 A weaker dollar can potentially have an impact on other central banks   said Mohit Kumar  Credit Agricole s London based head of interest rates strategy   From a broader perspective  a stronger currency is akin to tightening of monetary policy  
At BNY Mellon  senior currency strategist Neil Mellor told clients this week in a report that  marked currency appreciation has the potential to eviscerate forecasts for reviving inflation  which points to the possibility of any tentative plans for policy changes being placed on ice  
With the euro already close to a three year high against the dollar  a further slide in the U S  currency may have implications for the European Central Bank s path away from its stimulus plan  President Mario Draghi has previously stepped in to curb the surge in the euro  warning in September that currency volatility could have detrimental impact on price stability 
 It is hard to see the ECB accelerating the pace of tapering if the euro goes on rising   said Kit Juckes  a global fixed income strategist at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA   The risk is that we never get escape velocity  
Asian Outperformers
The Chinese yuan had its best performance last year since 2008  the yen gained the most against the dollar since 2011  South Korea s won had its biggest gain since 2004 and India s rupee had its best year since 2010 
Stronger currencies in Asia are already  doing monetary policy tightening that Asian policy makers would be comfortable with   said Rob Subbaraman  head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holdings Inc  in Singapore 
The gains should contain inflation by making exports costlier and imports cheaper  If prices don t pick up  the risk for central banks is that their easy policies end up creating bubbles in asset markets and leave them without ammunition to fight the next crisis 
 If you get dollar weakness that implies strength of emerging market currencies and it means emerging market central banks don t need to be as aggressive themselves in putting their foot on the brake   said Dwyfor Evans  head of Asia Pacific macro strategy with State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong  
Still  the softer U S  dollar could be a reason for the Federal Reserve to push rates up faster than it now anticipates  pressuring Asia s central banks to respond  said Rajiv Biswas  chief Asia Pacific economist at IHS Markit in Singapore 
 Despite the current weakness of the dollar  Asian central banks are likely to remain concerned about upside risks to inflation and of faster than expected tightening by the Fed   he said ",2018-01-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/dollar-drop-could-force-global-central-banks-into-rates-rethink-1061298,1061298

202249,423765,BK,Setback for Trump agenda leaves dollar stranded,news,"By Vikram Subhedar LONDON  Reuters    The dollar fell to a 10 month low on Tuesday  bearing the brunt of a selloff triggered by another setback to U S  President Donald Trump s agenda and scaled back expectations for another rate hike at Federal Reserve this year  The announcement overnight that two Republican senators would not support the latest version of the healthcare bill    had led to speculation that the reform proposal was likely to be withdrawn  It fed into a belief that Trump s tax cuts and spending plans will come to nought  The dollar index against a basket of major currencies  DXY  sank to its lowest since last September with euro  rising above  1 15 against the greenback for the first time since May 2016  In Asian hours  the Australian dollar  surged more than 1 percent after minutes from the central bank s last policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economic outlook   The reform momentum of the Trump administration has received another blow   said strategists at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  led by Hans Redeker  in a note to clients  The strategists  however  added that the  Goldilocks  scenario for the United States    loose monetary policy along with relatively healthy economic growth    was likely to continue  Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter  the latest Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed  A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September   Clearly anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market s negative attitude on the dollar   said Neil Mellor  senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  in London   There s just not enough inflation at the moment  And anything like this  defeat for Trump  is liable to push it lower   Expectations for a rate hike at the Bank of England were also dented  hurting sterling  as British inflation unexpectedly slowed for the first time since last October  The drop in the pound helped the exporter heavy FTSE 100  FTSE  recoup earlier losses and trade higher on the day  Elsewhere in Europe  stocks struggled with European shares off 0 4 percent as a set of disappointing results from the likes of Ericsson  ST ERICb  and Lufthansa  DE LHAG  soured the mood  Regional stocks have rushed back into the limelight this year as foreign investors have piled in on the back of receding political risks  upbeat earnings and an economic recovery gaining traction  Bullish bets on euro zone equities were named as one of three top crowded trades in the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch global fund managers survey  leaving them most vulnerable to earnings disappointments or signs of central bank tightening  The MSCI All Country World index  MIWD00000PUS  was little changed while U S  stock futures   ESc1  were off 0 1 percent  Tempered expectations for Trump s spending plans weighed on European bond yields which edged lower  tracking U S  equivalents  after the collapse of the second healthcare bill  U S  10 year bond yields  fell after the news  while German 10 year yields  dipped 2 basis points to 0 57 percent when European trading started on Tuesday  Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U S  election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world s largest economy  In commodity markets  oil prices steadied as expectations of firm demand  particularly from China  was met ample supply

202250,423766,BK,Doubts about Trump s agenda seen accelerating U S  dollar decline,news,"By Richard Leong NEW YORK  Reuters    The outlook for the U S  dollar turned even more bearish on Tuesday after healthcare reform legislation again failed to pass in Congress  casting further doubt on whether the Trump administration will be able to progress to tax reform  infrastructure improvements  and banking deregulation  The U S  dollar index  DXY  that tracks the greenback s strength against major currencies slid to an 10 month low in the wake of setback to President Trump s agenda   And with the euro and yen both gaining on the possibility that the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will raise interest rates later this year as their economies improve  the dollar s decline of the past five months may well continue   The prospects for the dollar have turned bearish for the rest of year   said Minh Trang  senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara  California   A Reuters poll published earlier in July showed a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters less bullish on the greenback than at the start of the year  TRUMP TRADE TARNISHED After the U S  elections last November  Wall Street stocks and the dollar gained and bond yields rose on hopes that  with the Republican party controlling both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006  the new administration would quickly enact big tax cuts and spend on bridges and roads  driving faster economic growth and inflation   The so called  Trump trade  has steadily eroded though in the first half of the year as infighting in the Republican party stalled the promised reforms  and the collapse of the latest effort to reform healthcare on Tuesday only served to accelerate the dollar s selloff   It pushes out the rest of the agenda  It s hard to do a tax reform in the style that it was campaigned on  The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump s agenda to 2018   said Art Hogan  chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York  As a result  the U S  dollar index  DXY   which tracks the greenback against six major currencies  has fallen 7 48 percent so far this year  making the fall for the year to date the biggest since 2002 when it shed 10 87 percent in the same period  Other indicators are also providing evidence of the market s increasing bearishness on the dollar   Last week  speculators reduced their net long bets on the dollar to their lowest level since last May  according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data  Traders  three month bearishness on the dollar versus the euro hit its most extreme since at least 2010 in late June before retreating a bit  Reuters data showed   ECB AND BOJ ALSO PRESSURE USD However  prospects for U S  economic reform are not the only factor seen pressuring the U S  dollar later this year   The euro  began its latest leg up against the greenback four weeks ago after comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi highlighted the euro zone s economic recovery  stoking speculation the ECB may consider paring bond purchases later this year  pushing up euro bond yields and the single currency  The euro has gained 10 percent versus the dollar year to date  rebounding from a cumulative 23 5 percent drop in the prior three years due to weak economic growth and the region s sovereign debt crisis  Reuters data showed   On Tuesday  the euro  climbed to its highest against the greenback since May 2016 after the U S  Senate failed to bring the healthcare bill to a vote  The Japanese yen has also advanced against the dollar  gaining over 4 0 percent since January   after the Bank of Japan upgraded its economic outlook  increasing the prospects for paring monetary stimulus in the latter half of 2018  The greenback has also weakened against the Canadian dollar and the British pound    The Canadian dollar hit a 15 month high against the U S  dollar on Tuesday at C 1 2581  bringing its year to date gain to 6 0 percent  in the wake of the first interest rate rise in seven years by the Bank of Canada last week   Years of ultra low interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis had spurred a borrowing binge and helped drive Canadian household debt to record levels in recent years  fuelling a housing boom that has only recently begun to falter  And analysts forecast the Canadian central bank will raise rates again in October  according to a Reuters poll   Last week  sterling  also reached a 10 month high against the greenback as rising U K inflation prompted comments from Bank of England officials suggesting interest rates may need to rise  despite slowing economic growth as Britain negotiates its exit from the European Union   Clearly  anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market s negative attitude on the dollar   said Neil Mellor  senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  in London   There s just not enough inflation at the moment  And anything like this  defeat for Trump  is liable to push it lower

202281,423797,BK,Dollar under spotlight as first Trump era G20 eyes FX stance overhaul,news,"By Jamie McGeever LONDON  Reuters    A draft communique prepared for next week s gathering of G20 finance chiefs has dropped the group s standard pledges on the need for flexible yet stable exchange rates and orderly markets  suggesting it could prove a landmark event for currency markets  The world s most powerful finance ministers and central bankers convene in the German spa town of Baden Baden on March 17 18  their first meeting since Donald Trump s U S  election victory in November and his reaffirmation of an avowedly protectionist   America First  stance on international trade  Solid U S  economic activity and rising inflation are pushing interest rates and the dollar higher  But the White House would clearly prefer a weaker currency to help U S  exports  manufacturing and competitiveness on the global stage  Figures on Tuesday showed the U S  trade deficit in January was  48 5 billion  the widest in nearly five years  The draft communique seen by Reuters has removed references to  excess volatility  and  disorderly  FX moves from last year s statement  as well as a pledge to refrain from  competitive devaluations   It has also reintroduced   for the first time in more than 10 years   a reference to  excessive global imbalances   an apparent swipe at hefty trade surpluses in Germany and China  Taken together  these changes could be seen as another indication that Washington   without taking direct action or explicitly saying so   is resisting a strong dollar  which it blames for its stubborn trade deficit and manufacturing decline  The draft communique remains subject to change  And there is unlikely to be any appetite for currency wars  so the pledge to resist  excess volatility and disorderly movements  and refrain from  competitive devaluations  could still get reinserted  Nevertheless  if the final document bears any resemblance to its current guise  it will be a clear sign that the new White House administration is flexing its muscles on currencies and trade    The wording of G7 and G20 statements has been used to justify specific actions or to send specific warnings in the past  If the wording sets the parameters for currency policy  it is therefore significant when it changes   said Simon Derrick  head of global rates strategy at Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK    Derrick pointed to the G7 wording on exchange rate  flexibility  in Dubai  2003  and  global current account imbalances  in Boca Raton  2004  Whatever was said at the time about what they meant  the fact is that Japan stopped intervening in FX markets to weaken the yen in 2004  he said    STRONG MESSAGE  G20 members are unlikely to want their own currencies to appreciate much  if at all  But the reintroduction of the phrase on  global imbalances   at a time when trade is firmly back on the international political agenda   is clearly intended to send a strong message   Derrick added  One G20 government official said the group was still debating exactly what signal it wanted to send on FX   Whatever it is  we want to make sure it s not misunderstood by markets   Since Trump s election victory in November the White House has accused Japan  China and Germany   three of America s five biggest trading partners   of deliberately engineering undervalued exchange rates for competitive advantage  drawing frosty responses and stirring currency market volatility  The dollar hit a 14 year high in January  DXY  and the latest Reuters poll of more than 60 FX strategists shows the bias is for further strength over the coming year    Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  who was only confirmed in his post on Feb  13  has repeated the Treasury s long held mantra that a strong dollar is a  good thing  as it reflects confidence in the relative strength of the U S  economy   But he has warned that  certain aspects are not as positive  in the short term  and also told International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde he expects the IMF to provide  frank and candid  analysis of exchange rate policies  Since G20 finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999  and then leaders in 2008  the role of exchange rates  to reduce countries  vulnerability to economic crises  has consistently been discussed  according to the G20 Research Group at the University of Toronto  SURPLUSES Ernst Welteke  former president of Germany s Bundesbank and a veteran of several G7 meetings  said that if countries want to improve their competitiveness on the international stage they should address their own problems themselves   The German surplus is always a concern for others  but the only way to address this is to become more competitive   Welteke told Reuters   It s not the exchange rate that s responsible for the German trade surplus  it s the quality of the product  What are you going to do   tell China to import less   On March 15  two days before the G20 meeting starts  the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike U S  interest rates again  a move that could further cement the dollar s status as the currency of choice for global FX investors  The greenback has been climbing steadily since 2014  gaining almost 30 percent in the last two years and culminating in a 14 year high on a trade weighted basis in January  But that s almost certainly not enough to warrant any official action  Not yet  anyway  In the early 1980s  the dollar surged 80 percent under then president Ronald Reagan  prompting Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker to forge a rare G7 agreement   although only 5 nations participated   to bring it back down  That was the  Plaza Accord   the most renowned and

202323,423839,BK,Brexit raises questions about pound s elite status,news,"By Anirban Nag LONDON  Reuters    Britain s vote to leave the European Union is raising questions about sterling s place among the small  elite group of hard currencies underpinning the financial system  The pound s 14 percent slide since the vote to 31 year lows against the dollar is the biggest hit taken by one of these currencies in the post 1973 floating exchange rate system   For Britons  the impact may feel slight or even ambiguous  Consumers of imported goods may see them become more expensive and travelers will find foreign trips more costly  Exporters  on the other hand  may find their products more competitive abroad and any overseas earnings get a boost  But a bigger international impact could come if sterling s status as one of the currencies held in reserve savings by central banks and sovereign wealth funds is cast in doubt  risking a weaker and more volatile pound longer term   Reserve currencies are typically seen as dependable and easily convertible long term stores of value  needed to meet emergency imports  service international debt  or to smooth the effects of volatile trade and investment shifts on local currency rates   These hard cash reserves are then often banked back in the assets  mostly government debt  of the currency issuer  This is important for Britain  which relies on an inflow of foreign capital to fund a chronic current account deficit running at 7 percent of economic output   But credit rating agency S P Global warned sterling s role as a reserve currency could  over time  diminish  It said this was one reason Britain s credit rating  which it cut by two notches days after the June 23 vote  could be cut further   Sovereigns controlling a reserve currency benefit from extensive external and monetary flexibility  which supports government creditworthiness   said Frank Gill  director of sovereign ratings at S P   A UK departure from the EU could put sterling s reserve status at risk by deterring foreign direct investment and other capital inflows into the UK   Weaker growth prospects as flagged by the Bank of England  along with a weaker pound could also see reserve managers allocate assets toward other currencies  THIRD HIGHEST SHARE  Sterling  the dominant reserve currency through the 19th century when the British empire was at its height and until World War Two  has ceded ground to the U S  dollar and the euro  It is now the third most widely held   even if a relatively small 4 8 percent of so called allocated reserves in the first quarter of 2016  according to IMF data   But that is around  344 billion or some 13 percent of Britain s gross domestic product of  2 7 trillion and nearly five times its 2015 current account deficit of  73 billion  Sterling s share was dwarfed in the period by the dollar s 63 6 percent and the euro s 20 4 percent but was slightly more than the yen s 4 1 percent slice  S P reckons a drop below 3 percent would challenge its status as a reserve currency  Reserve managers are slow to change the composition of their reserves  and if they do make a shift  act discreetly to avoid undermining the currencies in question  The dollar s share of reserves dipped to about 60 percent in the years after the 2008 09 global financial crisis before picking up as the euro s share fell in the euro zone crisis   Sterling s share has barely moved from a decade ago  though it has gained in prominence from the 3 percent share in 2001  Central banks declined to comment on whether sterling s share would drop  However  one Asian central banker  who did not wish to be identified  told Reuters a decision would be based on macro economic conditions and the currency s short  and long term outlook   There won t be any knee jerk reaction  UK is the world s sixth largest economy and a major trading partner to many countries   said Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  strategist Neil Mellor  In recent years  reserve managers  with an accumulated  11 trillion in assets  have diversified out of the traditional reserve currencies like the euro and yen  seeking higher yields in the likes of the Australian and Canadian dollars  The euro has borne the brunt of this process  and stripping out valuation effects  since foreign exchange reserves are priced in dollars  the single currency s share of overall reserves has retreated from a high of 28 percent in 2009  That coincided with the single currency s fall from  1 38 in mid 2014 to a 12 year low of  1 04 in March 2015 as the European Central Bank cut rates into negative territory  making euro zone government bonds less attractive  Now it could be the pound s turn given expectations that rates could be cut to zero and of more quantitative easing

202327,423843,BK,Midsummer Muni Musings,opinion,"As the summer doldrums roll on  we thought it was a good time to recap where the muni market has come since the Trump sell off of last fall 
A number of factors have helped the overall muni market 
The general level of interest rates has fallen as a result of congressional inertia on tax bills  healthcare  and fiscal spending in general  Markets  both equity and fixed income  generally like congressional gridlock  and we have it now  even with both houses of Congress and the presidency controlled by the Republicans  The charts below show the changes in the US Treasury market and the AAA tax free bond market since the end of the first quarter  The muni outperformance in the long end is evident  The AAA to US Treasury yield ratio is now below 100   though most AA  and A rated bonds are still at yield ratios that are historically cheap   
 Source  Municipal Market Analytics
The original tax bill  which included a cut in the marginal tax rate  is now being discussed with a RISE in the top tax rate and cuts further down the tax curve  For the highest earners  that would means that tax free bonds income would be worth more on a taxable equivalent basis 
Inflation has been dropping  see graph below   The bond markets  and particularly longer dated munis  have benefitted from the turnaround in core inflation  This has been a surprise to the Federal Reserve as well as the bond markets  With post Trump rising yields but falling inflation  extending maturities and durations is a correct strategy  particularly in the muni market beat up by bond fund selling

Increased Municipal Refinancing

 Source  SIFMA  US Municipal Securities Holders  Report   Last Updated 7 06 2017 
Refinancings dominated last year s issuance  particularly as we got into the low yields post Brexit  With the Trump sell off in November  which lasted through January  overall issuance is off this year  as refinancings were not feasible earlier in the year and issuers were put off by the overall rise in rates after the election  However  with the recent drop in yields  refinancings started to come back into the market in March and have continued right through the summer  Though the cost savings are not as dramatic as they were last year and yields are still higher than a year ago  municipalities are not willing to let this second opportunity to refinance and prerefund older  higher coupon debt go by  Plus  there is one less year to call dates than a year ago  which reduces the amount of negative arbitrage  That is the difference between the municipal financing rate and the Treasury rate to escrow older bonds  In other words  longer muni yields are still cheaper than Treasury yields  So  still considerable cost savings combined with less negative arbitrage means that there is a strong propensity among issuers to refinance their debt  To that end  in the current lower interest rate environment  we find that callable  higher coupon bonds that are candidates to become prerefunded offer compelling yields on a risk reward basis  given their shorter duration 
Also  the overall muni market got some good news this month as the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee approved the Municipal Finance Support Act  In a nutshell  this act will allow banks to count more of their municipal bond holdings in the calculation of HQLA  high quality liquid assets   Though the bill still has to clear the hurdle of the Senate  if it goes through it should ensure continued participation of banks in the municipal market and is a large improvement over previous proposals 
Finally  market events in Puerto Rico continue  with a number of noteworthy developments  We now have five entities restructuring under Title III as well as the only FOMB   Federal Oversight and Management Board  approved Title VI restructuring to date  Readers may remember from previous commentaries that Judge Laura Taylor Swain is overseeing Title III restructurings along with a five judge mediation panel appointed to assist with creditor debtor negotiations  We have identified each entity and the restructuring path they are currently utilizing  
 Source  Debtwire
Defaults expanded in July to include the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority  PREPA  and the Convention Center District Authority  CCDA   The default of PREPA follows a stunning decision by the FOMB to reject the authority s restructuring support agreement  RSA   Until a month ago PREPA was considered by many to be the most likely candidate to achieve a consensual restructuring under Title VI  The FOMB s actions imploded a deal that has been years in the making and cost those involved millions of dollars 
Of even more significance than PREPA has been the default and entrance of COFINA into Title III  Following the passage of legislation that would have made COFINA revenues available to the Commonwealth  the trustee  Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   issued a notice of default  COFINA entered into Title III shortly thereafter  leaving questions regarding default unanswered  especially those relating to certain accelerator clauses that senior bondholders want to enforce  Judge Laura Taylor Swain escrowed interest payments for June and July until the questions regarding default are remedied  We expect COFINA s August payment to be escrowed as well 
We continue to watch court proceedings closely and remain confident that the insurers we utilize are capable of meeting their obligations  We would not continue to hold their paper if we thought otherwise

202340,423856,BK,Special Report  A top hedge fund manager that s too hot for some to handle,news,"By Lawrence Delevingne NEW YORK  Reuters    Investing in Glacial Energy Holdings Inc should have been a disaster  Starting around 2010  hedge fund manager Platinum Partners lent the reseller of electricity and natural gas tens of millions of dollars  and then took at least a 20 percent equity stake in the fast growing company  Then  trouble started  By 2013  Texas utility regulators had fined Glacial  100 000 for overbilling customers and not disclosing that founder and Chief Executive Officer Gary Mole s previous energy venture had collapsed  Mole was forced to resign from the company s Texas subsidiary  Mole and his company were also targeted by former employees and a onetime partner in at least 10 lawsuits from 2009 to 2014  alleging  among other things  embezzlement  a hostile work environment  underpayment  and racketeering  Glacial beat back most of the legal challenges  but as debt mounted  the energy retailer filed for bankruptcy in 2014  listing more than  1 billion in unpaid obligations  Platinum s ownership stake in the company wasn t worth much  according to a person familiar with Platinum s history  But the firm had earned as much as  20 million in interest on its Glacial loans  which carried annual rates as high as 22 percent  Then  Platinum delivered the master stroke  snapping up Glacial s assets out of bankruptcy for about  53 million  Since then  Agera Energy LLC  the Platinum backed company that inherited Glacial s customers  has quintupled in value  according to the person familiar with the hedge fund firm  Turning painful situations into profit is the peculiar genius of Platinum founder Mark Nordlicht  The linchpin of his success  the increasingly popular strategy known as asset based lending  The idea is to provide high interest loans to companies other lenders shun and  if the company runs out of cash  take ownership and ultimately flip it for a profit  With that approach  combined with more traditional investment strategies  Nordlicht has generated spectacular results  Platinum s approximately  720 million Value Arbitrage fund has generated average annual returns of about 17 percent since 2003  according to Platinum performance data reviewed by Reuters  The flagship fund s investments are about evenly divided between private debt and shorter term investments in stocks and other securities  The roughly  540 million Credit Opportunities fund  which focuses on debt  has averaged annual gains of 13 4 percent since 2005  making money every month but one  Neither has ever posted a decline for a calendar year  Last year  hedge funds overall dropped an average of about 1 percent  Platinum s Value Arbitrage fund  meanwhile  gained 9 4 percent  far ahead of its sector average of 2 46 percent  The Credit Opportunities fund gained 9 8 percent  trouncing a benchmark credit fund gain of 0 07 percent  And yet Platinum  with about  1 35 billion under management  remains relatively small next to other high performance hedge fund firms  THE RISK FACTOR Platinum has attracted enough pension funds  endowments and other institutional investors to bring their share of the firm s assets to about 35 percent  according to the person with knowledge of the firm  who declined to identify any of those investors  But they remain too few and their investments too small to vault Platinum into the big league  An important reason is what industry insiders call  headline risk   Nordlicht s investments and his approach to them  these hedge fund investors say  come with too many potential public relations challenges  On top of that  some investors worry that many of Platinum s investments are too complex to exit quickly to cover heavy redemptions  A Reuters review of Platinum s investments  interviews with hedge fund investors familiar with the firm  as well as former employees  clients and associates  and a review of marketing and other documents show that Platinum has a history of investing in controversial businesses  In their pursuit of outsize returns  Platinum and Nordlicht have put money into a consumer finance company repeatedly fined for predatory lending before and after Platinum s involvement  a pair of investments that turned out to be Ponzi schemes  and two energy companies that later went bankrupt and are facing criminal charges   Investors looking beyond the impressive headline returns will find a pattern of behavior that raises serious questions about ethics  morals  and a host of other risks an investor must take to achieve those returns   said Ted Seides  the recently departed co founder of hedge fund investment firm Prot g  Partners  The person familiar with Platinum s thinking said the firm was aggressive with its investments  but always within the limits of the law  One longtime Platinum investor  Bernard Fuchs  praised Nordlicht and said he was not concerned about liquidity issues or investments that might generate negative press   I know he s an ethical  honest person   said Fuchs  the former CEO of Lenoxx Electronics Corp who now invests personal and family money   I would mortgage all our houses to invest with him  anything that he would go for   One of the companies Platinum invested in that s now in bankruptcy  Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations LLC  began to unravel after three workers died in an explosion on one of its rigs and oil prices collapsed  Documents reviewed by Reuters  including internal company emails and legal agreements  show how Platinum rescued its investment even before bondholders and contractors were paid  Nordlicht has also maintained ties to associates with troubled pasts  Kevin Cassidy  who has served time in prison three times for fraud and tax evasion  is now a sales executive at Agera  the Platinum owned power supplier  Murray Huberfeld  a financier who was ordered to disgorge profits and fined for violating securities laws at his Broad Capital  provided Platinum with start up money and ran Nordlicht s credit focused hedge funds until Platinum took them over in 2011  He no longer works at Platinum but remains a client  according to 2014 tax filings for his charitable foundation  Cassidy and Huberfeld did not respond to requests for comment  The person familiar with Platinum s history said that the firm has made thousands of investments and that in the few cases that generated negative attention  Platinum was duped by deceptive business partners  STRATEGIES AND SCHEMES In an episode that attracted media attention in 2014  the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission found that Platinum subsidiary BDL Group invested more than  56 million in a scheme operated by two brokers at other firms who exploited the terminally ill  Patients in nursing homes and hospice care were gulled into providing personal information in order to receive a box of candy or a  250 gift  that information was used by the brokers to purchase long term variable annuities that paid benefits to investors like BDL when the patient died soon after  according to the SEC  BDL paid a combined  3 29 million profit disgorgement and penalty on the grounds that it made money on an illegal scheme  The two brokers at the heart of the operation were forced to repay their profits  one s case is on appeal with the SEC  Nordlicht s friend and former colleague  Howard Feder  ran BDL and worked with the brokers to fund their strategy  according to the SEC  In a 2014 settlement with the agency  Feder was barred from the securities industry and paid a penalty of  130 000  At the time  the agency said Feder  understood the key components of the investment strategy   The person familiar with Platinum s history said the firm was not aware that the brokers were engaged in illegal activity  Feder did not respond to a request for comment  With its 2010 investment in Glacial  Platinum got involved in a company that already had a record of questionable spending  In 2007  internal financial statements of Glacial s New York unit  reviewed by Reuters  show that Glacial CEO Mole and his team spent more than  671 000 on travel and entertainment   the same year for which the company ultimately recorded a loss of approximately  5 million  More significantly  the 2007 statements show  17 9 million in  consulting  fees paid to a mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  These dealings were the basis for some of the lawsuits alleging various forms of wrongdoing filed against Glacial and Mole in ensuing years  All of those lawsuits were ultimately defeated  dismissed or pushed off into bankruptcy proceedings  But one allegation gained additional weight in September last year  when Mole was arrested on charges of tax evasion  The New York attorney general alleged that he funneled Glacial profits into the Congo mining company  which operated in a region where illicit mining profits have been used to fund armed conflict  Reuters could not determine whether the Glacial linked mining company was involved in conflict minerals  Mole pleaded not guilty  he faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted  He did not respond to requests for comment  The person familiar with Platinum said the firm was aware of Mole s spending and put protections in place to curtail it  EARLY SCANDAL Nordlicht grew up outside of New York City in suburban Long Island  and graduated from nearby Yeshiva University with a degree in philosophy in 1990  With  11 000 saved from what he had received for his bar mitzvah  he started trading commodity options  In these early years  National Futures Association records show  various New York exchanges fined him small amounts on eight different occasions  mostly for improper record keeping  In the early 2000s  after helping start a small private equity firm  he co founded commodities brokerage firm Optionable  The New York Mercantile Exchange took a 19 percent stake in the fast growing operation in early 2007  Later that year  Optionable collapsed in a trading scandal  Nordlicht  who resigned as non executive chairman soon after  was not directly implicated  His co founder  Kevin Cassidy  was  He was sentenced to prison for the third time in his career  this time for 30 months for deliberately misstating the value of natural gas derivatives in conjunction with an employee of BMO Financial Group   As Optionable imploded  Nordlicht was already building his Platinum business  having launched the Value Arbitrage fund in 2003 with about  30 million  Shortly after his release  Cassidy was hired as managing director of business development at Agera  the successor company to Glacial  along with other former Optionable and Glacial employees  Agera did not respond to requests for comment  The 47 year old Nordlicht lives an unflashy life in suburban Westchester County with his wife and children  usually driving himself to and from work at Platinum s sleek midtown Manhattan offices  He has strong ties in the New York area Jewish community  the source of some of his funds  investors  These include  according to public tax filings for 2014  a charitable trust set up by day trading pioneer Aaron Elbogen  who was fined  1 4 million for illegal trading and bookkeeping while the chief executive of Datek Securities Corp  the Century 21 Associates Foundation  led by department store executive Raymond Gindi  and the SFF Foundation  a non profit controlled by the Schron family  known for its real estate investments  All declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment  Nordlicht has enriched his investors with his focus on higher risk debt that can yield far more than traditional fixed income investments  And after years of near zero interest rates  it s a strategy increasingly sought out by big  otherwise conservative institutional investors hungry for higher yields  Still  many big money investors who have looked at Platinum have walked away  Cambridge Associates  which counsels some of the world s largest pension funds and endowments  recommended to a client around 2010 that it not invest with Platinum and has not changed its stance on Nordlicht s firm since then  according to people familiar with the situation  In an email  Cambridge said it does not  discuss specific investment managers   It added   We can say that we take our due diligence process very seriously   Among institutional investors that have considered putting money with Platinum but ultimately chose not to are the endowment of Yeshiva University  which is the alma mater of several Platinum employees  and large hedge fund allocator GAM  according to people familiar with the institutions  One institutional investor that did get in is New York City s Correction Officers  Benevolent Association  according to two people familiar with the situation  The New York Times reported in June last year that Norman Seabrook  the union s leader  was under investigation by the U S  Department of Justice for potentially using his position to enrich himself  A broad subpoena from prosecutors requested that the union supply information related to Platinum  but the connection was not clear  according to the report  A spokesman for the union declined to comment  The Justice Department and Seabrook did not respond to requests for comment  Nordlicht has tried to polish Platinum s image  In 2010  he hired ING Investment Management veteran Uri Landesman  who as president of the firm courts big investors and serves as its public face  Platinum declined to make Landesman available for an interview  Platinum also has added to its legal and compliance staff  increased information provided to clients  and created a  headline test  for prospective investments to avoid bad publicity  according to the person familiar with the firm  That hasn t stopped Platinum from pursuing investments like CashCall  which lends to people at annualized interest rates that can be in the triple digits  The company has faced legal actions in recent years from multiple states and the federal government for its aggressive marketing practices and charging interest rates above state limits  It has been compelled to pay refunds to customers in some cases  according to regulators  Platinum subsidiary Bayberry CF Management has set up six or more funds since 2009 that have lent at least  193 million to CashCall  according to marketing documents reviewed by Reuters  One CashCall fund expected to pay investors as much as 17 5 percent annually over three years  even after Bayberry took a 2 percent fee and 20 percent of the gains  according to a May 2013 marketing document  A spokesman for CashCall declined to comment  Nordlicht and his team often take positions in messy situations that can be difficult or costly to exit quickly  The perceived liquidity risk has been heightened by Platinum s policy of allowing investors to take money out of its two main funds every three months  That s far more frequently than most hedge funds that focus on private debt  which can lock up capital for several years   The mismatch in assets and liabilities could leave serious problems for those left holding the bag should the fund shrink in size   said Seides  the veteran hedge fund allocator  Platinum has told investors in recent years that it can manage mass redemptions thanks to large chunks of more liquid investments  at least in its main fund  It also believes that its loyal investor base of wealthy individuals and employees won t flee at the first sign of trouble  according to another person with knowledge of the firm  That logic didn t hold up last year  as oil prices plummeted and volatility wracked markets  In response  Platinum extended the redemption notice from three to six months for the Value Arbitrage fund  Then  in December  it put about half the capital of the fund   much of it from the energy sector   in a so called side pocket  meaning investors can t take out their money on the normal schedule  When they can isn t clear  The move may ultimately protect investors from short term losses  but changing liquidity terms is a last resort measure that can turn investor sentiment against a fund  BLACK ELK BLOW UP Platinum s involvement with Black Elk shows just how complicated the firm s investments can get   and how Nordlicht manages to wring profits from them  Houston based Black Elk was founded in 2007 to buy no longer productive offshore wells at discounted prices and then use new technology to squeeze more oil and natural gas from them  Platinum began investing in Black Elk in 2009  first lending to it  Platinum later acquired preferred shares that eventually gave it majority control   and paid annual dividends of 20 percent or more  according to securities filings and an external valuation report reviewed by Reuters  Then  in 2012  an explosion on a Black Elk rig off the Louisiana coast killed three workers  seriously injured three others and spilled oil into the Gulf of Mexico  A 2013 report from the U S  Department of the Interior s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement found that the  safety culture  aboard the rig was  poor at best   Even before the explosion  the company received hundreds of bureau citations for safety violations  The Department of Justice subsequently announced criminal charges against Black Elk and related contractors  Black Elk pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and other charges related to failing to follow proper safety practices  The case is pending  That and other legal challenges after the explosion  combined with the collapse of energy prices  were among the issues that forced Black Elk into bankruptcy proceedings in August 2015  By then  however  the company had sold its main assets to Houston based Renaissance Offshore LLC for  149 million  Most of the proceeds from that August 2014 sale went to a Platinum subsidiary  Black Elk then sold much of its remaining assets to Northstar Offshore Group LLC  a Houston company in which Platinum is a substantial investor  Together  the sales helped Platinum and its investors eke out a modest profit on their Black Elk bet  according to the person familiar with Platinum s history  The position was the largest holding in the Value Arbitrage fund on March 31  2014  worth as much as  186 million  according to the valuation report  Black Elk s creditors were left to wonder how Platinum was paid proceeds from the asset sale before them  Secured bondholders  for example  would normally have had first priority  Documents and interviews with people familiar with the transaction suggest an answer  Just weeks before the sale to Renaissance closed  Black Elk asked holders of  150 million of its high yield bonds to approve a measure that let Platinum receive proceeds of the transaction ahead of bondholders and other creditors  Surprisingly  nearly 75 percent of bondholders consented  according to a Black Elk earnings announcement in August 2014  Reuters could not determine the identities of all bondholders or how they voted   No bondholder in their right mind would ever vote to have their covenants stripped like that   said one note owner  Lawyers and representatives for other secured bondholders did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment  Internal Black Elk emails and legal documents related to its bonds show that various Nordlicht controlled hedge funds owned about 70 percent of the bonds before the vote and at least 47 percent after  The person familiar with Platinum s history confirmed that the firm voted its own bonds to approve the measure  In addition  another large block of bonds was held by affiliates of reinsurer Beechwood Bermuda International Ltd  according to a Black Elk bond modification document from November 2014  Beechwood had hired former Platinum employee David Levy in November 2013 as chief investment officer of structured products  Levy returned to Platinum as co CIO several months after the bondholder vote  Beechwood spokesman David Goldin confirmed that Levy was responsible for Beechwood s purchase of Black Elk bonds and for voting them in Platinum s favor  along with the approval of other covenant changes  He said that those bonds were sold the month after Levy left  Platinum believes that the measure would have been approved even if the firm s votes had not been counted by the bond trustee  Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   according to the person familiar with Platinum s position  The Renaissance sale proceeds  the person added  were used to pay back investors in a private equity fund Platinum created and from which it took no fees  A lawyer for Black Elk declined to comment on Platinum  citing the bankruptcy proceedings  Black Elk founder and CEO John Hoffman left the company shortly after the sale to Renaissance  Black Elk s next CEO  Jeff Shulse  left after the Northstar deal  According to a filing by Black Elk creditors as part of the bankruptcy proceedings  both men left in protest over cash from the sales being used to pay Platinum  The filing alleged  a series of questionable transactions  that allowed  96 million from the Renaissance sale to go to Nordlicht s firm  to the detriment of the company s creditors and estate   Hoffman and Shulse declined to comment  After the sale  some creditors cried foul  For example  in a lawsuit filed in Louisiana state district court in April 2015 against Black Elk  Nordlicht and Platinum entities  contractor Shamrock Management accused Platinum of engaging in an  unethical scheme  to suck assets out of Black Elk and pay itself while stiffing creditors  The lawsuit seeks nearly  1 million for unpaid work and damages  
That lawsuit and more than a dozen others like it remain unresolved in the bankruptcy process  part of 261 claims totaling  1 2 billion  The person familiar with Platinum s position called the lawsuits a frivolous attempt to bilk Platinum of cash   Edited by John Blanton ",2016-04-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/special-report:-a-top-hedge-fund-manager-that's-too-hot-for-some-to-handle-395261,395261

202382,423898,BK,Bakrie Telecom debt ploy exposes new foreign investor pitfall in Indonesia  ,news,"By Eveline Danubrata JAKARTA  Reuters    An Indonesian telecommunication company found a creative way to ensure that its debt restructuring was approved over some creditors  objections  it loaned itself money and then counted its own votes toward approving the plan  The maneuver  which distressed debt investors said was unprecedented  was validated by a Jakarta court  But investors who have sued PT Bakrie Telecom Tbk  JK BTEL  and its subsidiaries in New York over a  380 million bond say they were barred from voting on the restructuring   The bond s trustee Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  said that violated both the terms of the bond contract and the law  without specifying which country s law  according to a letter to Bakrie Telecom seen by Reuters   The dispute has shaken investor sentiment in Indonesian corporate debt just as President Joko Widodo is pushing for more foreign investment and local companies are trying to raise capital to expand  Foreign direct investment in Indonesia totaled 307 trillion rupiah   24 1 billion  in 2014  and Widodo has targeted a 12 percent increase this year  Bakrie Telecom said the bondholders were not eligible to vote on the restructuring plan because they weren t direct creditors  The notes they bought were issued by a special purpose vehicle  SPV  in New York  which then lent the proceeds to Bakrie Telecom  The SPV  representing  380 million of Bakrie Telecom s debt  cast its votes in favor of the restructuring plan  which was overwhelmingly approved on Dec  8  Creditor claims that were recognized by the Jakarta court administrators totaled more than  770 million    They are now the issuer and the creditor   said Hal Hirsch  a lawyer representing a group of Bakrie Telecom investors who collectively own more than 25 percent of the bond that was set to mature in May   They shake their own hands  they enter into their own agreement  and they have now effectively eviscerated any claim that the noteholders have   The next hearing in the bondholders  lawsuit is scheduled on Thursday in a New York state court  Bakrie Telecom does not recognize the bondholders as its creditors because the company and the SPV that issued the bond are  two separate legal entities   Aji Wijaya  a lawyer representing Bakrie Telecom  told Reuters   Whoever the creditor is  the rules of the game here have to be followed   Wijaya said  adding that creditors will not get any money back if the company goes bankrupt  A Jakarta court approved the restructuring vote on Dec  9  Hirsch said bondholders chose not to appeal the decision because  the additional time  cost and delay would have been sadly a waste   RULE OF LAW Bakrie Telecom is part of Indonesian conglomerate Bakrie Group  which has long carried a heavy debt load   Creditors have traditionally tolerated the risk because of generous yields and a belief that the group could sell some assets to come up with cash  However various Bakrie Group companies have instead opted for debt restructurings  causing friction with creditors  Under Bakrie Telecom s restructuring plan  30 percent of large creditors  debt will be paid in cash installments  with the rest exchanged for mandatory convertible bonds with a conversion price of 200 rupiah per share  about four times the current share price  As the conversion price of the bonds is so far above the market price  some creditors say they are receiving a tiny fraction of each dollar they invested    The proposal wipes out the bondholders  If you re in the bond  you re losing everything   said an advisor to a Bakrie Telecom bondholder  who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  Some foreign investors say the rules of the game are stacked against them  and they worry that other heavily indebted Indonesian companies may follow Bakrie Telecom s lead if they run into trouble  Falling commodity prices have left Indonesia s debt laden mining industry exposed   It s definitely troublesome   said one fund manager who specializes in buying distressed debt   Indonesia right now has a lot of credit which could potentially be going into some sort of restructuring  Investors are definitely taking notice of this   Other recent cases of court appointed debt restructurings have already made foreign investors  more cognizant of the weakness of the insolvency regime in Indonesia   Vicky Melbourne  senior director at Fitch Ratings  told Reuters  While the Indonesian government is monitoring foreign private debt  it hopes that any disputes can be settled between the parties involved  Arif Budimanta  special staff to the finance minister  told Reuters  Nevertheless  he added that the government does want to try to improve investor confidence by strengthening law enforcement and institutions such as the civil court    Indonesia needs huge foreign investment to support its growth targets   he said

The U S  Could Choose a Woman President 
The 2016 online election forecast I follow has Clinton winning odds at 66  as I write  Most of you will read this and know the final voting result  With a historic run for the White House by a woman  I want to focus on the long 65 year march of women into the active labor force 
U S  Bureau of Labor statistics show the build  below   In 1950  32  of working age women worked outside the home  earning cash incomes  That number peaked at 60  in the year 2000  Today  it is near 56   A downturn in women s labor force participation came in the 2008 crisis  I find that more than interesting 

As the U S  economy struggles to get more than  2  annual growth out of this business cycle  I think one underlying force holding U S  growth back is the attrition of women in the active labor force 
Once women left the office for raising small children at home  in 2008  many never came back  They might have been forced by poor circumstances to do that  at first  but now the trend is established  and friends and neighbors have followed suit 
The lower presence of 2 cash incomes in households restrains final demand  and hence GDP growth 
Past Presidential Election Cycles
Another issue I would like to raise this month    a prediction past Presidential election cycles makes for U S  stock downturns and recessions 
The Philadelphia Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters has a 10  chance of a recession in Q1 2017 turn into a 20  chance by the end of 2017 
In data from 1945 to 2004 provided by Pepperdine Graziadio School of Business Review 3 of 16 bear market lows occurred in year 1 of a Presidential term 12 bear markets hit in year two  One hit in year three  andNone happened in year four  the election year  Keep the above in mind  The implication   a bear market may well hit in 2018 
Finally  Jim O Sullivan is the respected Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics  He tweeted out this graph  showing your party affiliation matters  to how good you feel about a Presidential cycle 

In the current election moment  Democrats  not surprisingly   with Obama in the Presidency   feel better than Republicans

202398,423914,BK,Citigroup  Argentina bond holdouts argue over  5 million payment  hearing,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Creditors suing Argentina over defaulted debt battled with Citigroup Inc  N C  in a Manhattan federal courtroom on Friday over the bank s request to process a  5 million payment due September 30 on bonds issued under Argentina s local laws 
Karen Wagner  a lawyer for the bank  told U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa that  the plaintiffs have now consented to us making  the  5 million payment 
But bondholders that did not participate in Argentina s past restructurings and want to be paid in full for their bonds  including Elliott Management s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management  have opposed letting Citigroup make the payment  citing an earlier order by Griesa 
Ted Olson  a lawyer for NML  said allowing the payment would  frustrate any effort at settlement  with Argentina  which has been in default on a variety of bond payments for nearly two months  and encourage the country to evade further court orders 

Citigroup has said it faces regulatory and criminal sanctions by Argentina if it cannot process the interest payment on U S  dollar denominated bonds issued under Argentine law following the country s 2002 default

202399,423915,BK,U S  judge holds Argentina in contempt over bond payment plan,news,"By Joseph Ax and Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    In a rare move  a U S  judge held Argentina in contempt on Monday  saying the country is taking  illegal  steps to evade his orders in a longstanding dispute with hedge funds over defaulted debt 
A source at Argentina s central bank nevertheless said the country plans to deposit an interest payment at a local bank on Tuesday  in direct defiance of U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa s admonitions 
Griesa  who has overseen the litigation in New York for years  put off a decision on whether to impose sanctions on the South American country  which defaulted in July for the second time in 12 years after failing to reach a deal with the hedge funds 
But he issued a clear warning that Argentina must stop efforts to get around his rulings by making payments locally 
 These proposed steps are illegal and cannot be carried out   Griesa said  his voice rising  during a court hearing in lower Manhattan 
Those steps  he said  include legislation Argentina passed that would allow it to replace Bank of New York Mellon Corp  N BK  as trustee for some restructured debt with Banco de la Nacion Fideicomiso while allowing a swap of that debt for bonds payable in Argentina under its local laws 
Despite his ruling  Argentina plans to deposit an interest payment of at least  200 million with Banco de la Nacion Fideicomiso on Tuesday  the central bank source said 
The developments followed a familiar pattern in the litigation  in which Griesa criticizes Argentina for disobeying his orders and Argentine officials defiantly continue to do so  They also underscored the uncertain impact of a contempt ruling on a foreign government 
Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman said in a statement late on Monday that Griesa s decision was a  violation of international law  and would have no impact other than to further the fight of the  vulture funds  against Argentina 
 The Argentine government reaffirms its decision to continue defending national sovereignty and asking the U S  government to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice to resolve this controversy between both countries   he said 
Griesa has called on Argentina to reach a settlement with the holdouts  appointing a mediator to oversee talks that have thus far been unsuccessful 
Argentina missed a bond coupon payment in late July after Griesa ruled it could not be made unless the country also paid more than  1 3 billion to a group of U S  funds that rejected previous bond restructurings and are demanding full repayment 
Argentina claims it cannot pay the holdouts  led by Elliott Management Corp s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management  on what would be better terms than the investors who exchanged their defaulted bonds under the so called RUFO clause  Rights Upon Future Offers  
COERCING COMPLIANCE
Despite the interest payment scheduled for Tuesday  it is far from clear that the country will be able to locate bond holders in order to pay them 
Instead  the payment may allow Argentina to continue to maintain it has made its payments as required and is therefore not in default  Argentine officials have made a similar argument since Griesa blocked Bank of New York from processing a  539 million payment Argentina deposited in June 
NML did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Reuters report regarding Tuesday s interest payment 
Griesa s decision to hold a foreign government in civil contempt of court is a rare but not unprecedented move  In typical cases  U S  judges can hold parties in contempt and issue sanctions in order to force compliance with their orders 
The hedge funds had proposed a daily fine of  50 000 
However  Argentina might simply ignore any monetary sanction  the hedge funds conceded in court  In that case  said Robert Cohen  a lawyer for the funds  Griesa could consider non monetary sanctions that would coerce Argentina into compliance 
Cohen did not indicate what those sanctions could be  They might  for instance  include barring Argentina from doing business with U S  banks  though such a ruling would likely engender fresh litigation over whether Griesa has the authority to do so 

Griesa did not set a specific schedule to consider sanctions

202402,423918,BK,Ex Bank of New York Mellon employee pleads guilty to insider trading,news,"By Joseph Ax NEW YORK  Reuters    A former Bank of New York Mellon Corp  N BK  employee on Friday pleaded guilty to insider trading based on tips from a former Merck   Co Inc  N MRK  employee about potential pharmaceutical mergers 
Federal prosecutors in New York said David Post  41  a product manager at the bank  received nonpublic information from a former Rutgers Business School classmate about three companies  Idenix Pharmaceuticals  Ardea BioSciences and ViroPharma Inc  VIRO UL  
Prosecutors did not name the classmate  but on Oct  14 they charged Zachary Zwerko  a former senior finance analyst with Merck  with passing inside tips about the same three stocks to a Rutgers classmate who worked at a bank 
The connection was confirmed when the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday amended a parallel civil complaint against Zwerko to include Post as a defendant 
Ron Gruendl  a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon  said Post s conduct was not connected to his work at the bank 
 We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and regulatory agencies   he said   He is no longer employed here  
According to criminal and civil court filings  Zwerko passed information to Post about Merck s acquisition of Idenix as well as Ardea and ViroPharma  which Zwerko learned were potential acquisition targets  Post then traded on the information and split the profits with Zwerko  authorities said 
AstraZeneca PLC  L AZN  announced a bid for Ardea in April 2012  while Shire PLC  L SHP  announced a takeover of ViroPharma in November 2013 
 Post and Zwerko tried to keep law enforcement authorities in the dark by using prepaid cell phones and a dummy e mail account to communicate inside information  and Post doled out the kickbacks inside his own home   Sanjay Wadhwa  senior associate director of the SEC s New York regional office  said in a statement 
At a court hearing before U S  District Judge Alvin Hellerstein  a tearful Post admitted he executed a series of trades between 2012 and 2014 based on the tips 
He entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud as part of a cooperation agreement with the Manhattan U S  Attorney s office 
Assistant U S  Attorney Jessica Masella said in court that Post is believed to have earned more than  700 000 in illicit profits 

Post  a resident of Livingston  New Jersey  is scheduled to be sentenced in January and faces up to 20 years in prison on each securities fraud count and up to 5 years on the conspiracy charge  although a maximum sentence is unlikely

202414,423930,BK,U S  judge orders Argentina  creditors to meet until deal reached,news,"By Nate Raymond and Joseph Ax NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  judge ordered Argentina and investors who did not participate in the country s past debt restructurings to meet  continuously  with a court appointed mediator until a settlement is reached  warning of the threat of a new default 
U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa in New York told Argentina and lawyers for investors who declined to restructure their bonds after the country defaulted on about  100 billion in 2002 that time was running out to reach a deal and avert a fresh default 
 That is about the worst thing I can envision  I don t want that to happen   the judge said 
Jonathan Blackman  a lawyer for Argentina  Latin America s No  3 economy  said even with around the clock talks  it would be  unlikely  if not impossible  to result in settlement  
 It simply can t be done by the end of the month   he said 
Griesa ordered the parties to meet with Daniel Pollack  a New York lawyer appointed to oversee settlement talks   continuously until a settlement is reached   Pollack scheduled a meeting Wednesday at 10 a m  EDT  1400 GMT  
Pollack  who was appointed June 23 as a mediator  has been holding meetings with the parties  publicly acknowledging talking twice with Argentine officials 
Argentina is sending a delegation to meet with Pollack  but a government source said Economy Minister Axel Kicillof would not be among the group 
The presidency of Argentina said in a statement that  Judge Griesa     resolved absolutely nothing on any of the issues which had been brought before him   A lead holdout creditor  Elliott Management s NML Capital Ltd  said in a statement it was prepared to meet with Pollack to resolve the dispute 
 We are confident this matter could be resolved quickly if Argentina would join us in settlement discussions   NML said 
Argentine over the counter dollar denominated bonds slid following the hearing  before recovering some of the losses  The bid price on the Discount bond was down 1 1 percent on a day earlier at  86 65 at 1725 local time  2025 GMT  while the Par bond was 0 8 percent lower at  50 80 
 Clearly Argentina is running out of time   said Ignacio Labaqui  an analyst for consultancy Medley Global Advisors   Today is the first time I have seen the market believing that Argentina might default  It s up to Argentina to decide what it will do  
Argentina has been pushed to the brink of a fresh debt default by U S  court decisions that it pay  1 33 billion plus interest to bondholders who did not participate in debt swaps in 2005 and 2010  The holdouts are led by NML and Aurelius Capital Management 
The country argues paying the holdouts would open it up to as much as  15 billion in claims from other investors and further strain its financial condition 
At Tuesday s hearing  Argentina renewed its request that the judge stay enforcement of his orders  Griesa said the step was not necessary  as there are  ways to do something to avoid default  
A lawyer for Aurelius  Edward Friedman  meanwhile urged him to reconsider part of a decision last month allowing Citigroup Inc to process payments Argentina made for bonds governed by the country s local laws  Friedman said payments should not be allowed on U S  dollar denominated bonds 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp asked the judge to allow it to hold onto  539 million Argentina deposited last month for a payment to the restructured bondholders  Griesa previously ordered the sum returned  saying it violated his orders 

Griesa on Tuesday issued no ruling on the Citigroup issue  and told BNY Mellon and the holdouts to see if they could reach an agreement

202415,423931,BK,Citi tells court its Argentina banking license at risk,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Citigroup has told the U S  appeals court overseeing the dispute between Argentina and hedge funds refusing to accept terms of the country s debt restructuring that its Argentine banking license may be at risk as a result of the standoff 
That is because under orders from U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa  Citibank Argentina is barred from distributing payments it will receive from Argentina to holders of a class of restructured bonds that are governed under Argentine law  Meanwhile  the Argentine government has demanded that the bank honor its obligations under local law 
Citi expects to receive about  5 million from Argentina ahead of its next coupon payment deadline of Sept  30 
Argentina  whose appeal to the U S  Supreme Court stalled in June when the high court refused to take the case  has flouted orders by Griesa that it may not pay creditors who agreed to the restructuring until it pays the hedge funds the full face value of the bonds they hold  In June it deposited a  539 million payment to those bondholders with its trustee  Bank of New York Mellon 
 It is increasingly apparent that the mandatory payment injunctions directed to the republic cannot be enforced   Citigroup said in a court filing late Monday  adding that the Citibank injunction could lead to the loss of its banking license in Argentina and its takeover by the republic 
Argentina accounts for a small part of Citigroup s business  Its exposure to the country at the end of June from securities and from loans  including those to businesses and consumers  was only  2 7 billion compared with  1 9 trillion in total assets worldwide  according to Citigroup s most recently quarterly filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
Meanwhile  the New York Post reported on Tuesday that Paul Singer  head of Elliott Management  one of the main holdout creditors in the case  intends to widen his hunt for assets connected to Argentina s leaders 
Last week  Elliott won a ruling from a U S  magistrate in Nevada allowing him to push ahead with subpoenas to 123 companies based in the state that have ties to associates of the family of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez 
The Post  citing an unnamed source  familiar with Singer s thinking   said he intends to use the ruling to issue subpoenas to at least two companies controlled by Cristobal Lopez  a friend of Fernandez s late husband and her predecessor as president  Nestor Kirchner 
One of the subpoena targets will be Centenary International   which the Post described as a shell company listed as a penny stock on the U S  over the counter market 
The paper said that Centenary  while it has no operations and reported a loss of about  1 million last year  recently signed a 10 year lease for 4 000 square feet of office space near New York s Museum of Modern Art at a cost of  34 333 a month 
A representative for Centenary could not be located 
A spokesman for Elliott was not immediately available for comment

202416,423932,BK,Argentina aims to skirt U S  court  bring debt under national law,news,"By Sarah Marsh and Walter Bianchi BUENOS AIRES  Reuters    President Cristina Fernandez on Tuesday unveiled legislation that seeks to push bondholders to swap defaulted debt for new notes governed by Argentine law  a move aimed at skirting a U S  ruling that prevented her government from paying its creditors 
Argentina slid into default last month after a New York court blocked an interest payment of  539 million owed to holders of debt issued under U S  legislation that was restructured after the country s record 2002 default 
The judge said Argentina could not proceed with that payment until it had also settled on repayment terms with a group of hedge funds that had rejected the restructuring deal and are demanding full payment 
Fernandez has argued Argentina is not in default and has consistently labeled the adverse U S  court rulings an attack on Argentine sovereignty  The draft bill appeared to be an attempt to bring Argentina s debt management back under its full control 
 If bondholders decide   in individual or collective form   to ask for a change of the legislation and jurisdiction of their bonds     the economy ministry is authorized to implement a swap for new public bonds under local legislation  Fernandez said in a televised statement 
A new bond swap carries legal risks  analysts said  and appeared to kill hopes that Argentina might soon reach a deal with the hedge fund holdouts  enabling it to exit default 
A prolonged debt crisis is seen deepening the country s economic recession  weakening the ailing currency and sapping thin foreign currency reserves 
Fernandez  who has been unflinching in her refusal to pay the holdouts the full face value on their bonds  said a new restructuring would respect the terms of earlier bond swaps in 2005 and 2010  More than 90 percent of creditors accepted large writedowns at the time 
The usually tough talking leader appeared on the verge of tears as she neared the end of her address 
 Excuse me if I get a little nervous  I usually have more poise  However  I really feel that we are living a moment of great injustice in Argentina   Fernandez told the nation of 40 million people 
CONTEMPT
Fernandez said the holdouts   or  vultures  as she described them   could participate in the new restructuring if they accepted the same terms as other bondholders   a proposal the New York hedge funds have repeatedly scoffed at 
The draft bill also proposes removing Bank of New York Mellon  N BK    where the frozen June 30 coupon payment is held in limbo   as the exchange bondholders  trustee  It plans replacing it with the state run Banco Nacion  which would open up an account at the central bank to enable Argentina to service its exchange debt there 
The sovereign debt bill will likely enjoy smooth passage through Congress because Fernandez s faction of the ruling Peronist movement enjoys a strong majority in both chambers 
The debt saga has strained already difficult relations with the United States 
A series of rulings by U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa set off a wave of heated exchanges with Argentine officials  They said Griesa did not understand the complexities of the case and instead blamed Griesa for overstepping his bounds and blocking the payment 
It was not clear on Tuesday night whether the maneuver could succeed in sidestepping the U S  court s rulings and what impact it might have on the country s default status 
 Argentina could end up in contempt   said Alejo Costa  strategy chief at local investment bank Puente in Buenos Aires 
The proposed bond swap reduced the likelihood of Argentina reaching an agreement with the holdouts and dashes hopes of Argentina returning to global capital markets any time soon  said Costa 

Lead holdout hedge funds NML Capital Limited and Aurelius Capital Management did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters

202417,423933,BK,BNY Mellon sucked into center of Argentine debt storm,news,"By Jorge A  Otaola and Nate Raymond
BUENOS AIRES NEW YORK  Reuters    Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  found itself front and center of Argentina s debt battle on Tuesday after the South American country stripped its authorization to operate there and bondholders seeking payment filed a lawsuit against the U S  bank 
BNY Mellon  a financial intermediary between the Argentine government and its bond investors  in June held onto a  539 million interest payment owed to bondholders on the orders of a U S  court 
The U S  District Court in New York had ruled that Argentina could not pay creditors who accepted discounted restructured bonds under U S  legislation unless it also paid the holdout U S  investment funds that rejected bond swaps in 2005 and 2010 
The frozen coupon payment tipped Latin America s No 3 economy into its second default in little over a decade  The Argentine government argued it had met its debt obligations and urged holders of exchange debt to pursue BNY Mellon for payment 
A lawsuit filed in London by four hedge funds said that BNY Mellon s actions  have been consistently designed to protect its own interests  
If the lawsuit   filed at London s High Court by hedge funds Knighthead Master Fund  RGY Investments LLC  George Soros s Quantum Partners and Hayman Capital Master Fund   is successful it may put pressure on U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa  who has presided over Argentina s drawn out debt battle with the holdouts  to exempt bonds that fall under jurisdictions outside the United States 
The plaintiffs  who hold Argentine debt amounting to 1 3 billion euros  argue their euro denominated bonds fall under English legislation and therefore should not be swept up in Griesa s rulings 
Griesa has ruled the bonds should because interest payments made on them pass through New York and therefore fall under his jurisdiction 
A MOVE TO RESUME INTEREST PAYMENTS
On Tuesday  BNY Mellon said the lawsuit filed against it was  without merit  
 We continue to follow the current court order to hold onto the money   a spokesman for BNY Mellon told Reuters 
Argentina s Congress is due on Wednesday to discuss a law that would replace BNY Mellon as intermediary for payments on foreign law bonds with state controlled bank Banco Nacion  as part of a new debt restructuring plan 
The central bank  has revoked BNY s authorization for representation in Argentina   Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said in his daily briefing  The authorization applied specifically to two BNY Mellon officials 
If Argentina s draft legislation is enacted and executed  it would allow it to skirt Griesa s court orders and resume interest payments on an estimated  29 billion in restructured bonds 
The debt crisis has taken a toll on Argentine assets and the peso  which sank to a record low of 14 20 per dollar on the black market on Tuesday despite the central bank s lifting interest rates in an apparent bid to ease pressure on the currency 

A central bank source  speaking on condition of anonymity  said that revoking BNY Mellon s authorization would not prevent it from transferring the frozen  539 million to bondholders if it decided to fulfill the payment

202418,423934,BK,Argentina  Citigroup face tough questioning in bond appeal,news,"By Nate Raymond and Joseph Ax NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  appeals court signaled its displeasure with Argentina on Thursday as Citigroup Inc  N C  warned it faces  serious and imminent hazard  if it follows a judge s order not to process an upcoming interest payment due to bondholders 
The bank urged the 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reverse a judge s ruling blocking payments on  8 4 billion in bonds issued under Argentine law following its 2002 default 
Citigroup faces regulatory and criminal sanctions by Argentina  which defaulted again in July  if it cannot process the  5 million payment by Sept  30  said Karen Wagner  Citigroup s lawyer 
 Citibank Argentina faces a serious and imminent hazard   Wagner said 
 If we obey  we have a gun to our head  and the gun will probably go off   Wagner said   I ask this court  what good will that do  It won t change what Argentina does  
But some panel members questioned why they should consider Argentina s position when the country was taking steps  including passing legislation  to avoid complying with orders that it pay  1 33 billion plus interest to creditors suing for full payment on defaulted bonds 
 I m not sure why we re even listening to this   said Circuit Judge Reena Raggi    Your client is the person or entity holding the gun to Ms  Wagner s client s head  
Wagner said Citigroup will  undoubtedly  get another transfer of money from Argentina by Sept  30  She stressed the risks the bank faced  though she said the bank would follow any order upholding the injunction

202419,423935,BK,U S  court tosses Argentina  Citigroup appeal in bond case,news,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  appeals court on Friday dismissed an appeal by Citigroup Inc  N C  and Argentina of a judge s order blocking the bank from processing payments on  8 4 billion in bonds issued under the country s local laws following its 2002 default 
The 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in New York  in a brief order  declined to find it had jurisdiction because the order Citigroup and Argentina appealed was a  clarification  not a modification  of a prior decision by U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa 
But the appellate court  ruling a day after hearing the appeal  said nothing in its decision was intended to prevent Citigroup from seeking further relief from Griesa 
Karen Wagner  Citigroup s lawyer  told the appeals court on Thursday that the bank faces regulatory and criminal sanctions by Argentina  which defaulted again in July  if it cannot process the  5 million payment by Sept  30 
A Citigroup spokeswoman had no immediate comment  A U S  lawyer for Argentina did not respond to a request for comment  while a spokesman for a lead bondholder plaintiff  Elliott Management s NML Capital Ltd  declined to comment 
Argentina defaulted in July after refusing to honor court orders to pay  1 33 billion plus interest to bondholders suing for full payment on defaulted bonds 
The hedge funds  led by NML and Aurelius Capital Management  had spurned the country s 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings  which resulted in exchanges for about 92 percent of the country s defaulted debt  Investors who exchanged bonds were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar 
The country s most recent default came after the U S  Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina s appeal of a ruling that it must pay the holdouts when it paid holders of the exchanged bonds 
Griesa subsequently blocked Bank of New York Mellon Corp  N BK  from processing a  539 million interest payment on what the country says is over  28 billion in debt 
The order sent Argentina on a course to default after no settlement was reached 
Amid the litigation  Citigroup sought assurances it could process payments it received from Argentina on bonds issued under Argentine law  But Griesa on July 28 blocked Citi from processing payments on U S  dollar denominated bonds issued under Argentine law 
Last week  Argentina s Congress passed a bill intended to allow the government to make payments on about  29 billion in foreign held bonds either in Argentina or elsewhere out of U S  jurisdiction 
Daniel Pollack  a court appointed mediator  said Friday he would  anticipate conducting a continuing effort to find a negotiated resolution to this dispute  
Consultants with Albright Stonebridge Group  co chaired by former U S  Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez  separately have met with Argentine officials on behalf of bondholders in hopes of finding  a mutually acceptable resolution   said spokesman Ben Chang 

He declined to say which bondholders the firm represented and whether they held defaulted or exchanged bonds

202420,423936,BK,Citigroup seeks stay on Argentine debt order  government threatens penalties,news,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    Citigroup Inc  N C  plans to ask a U S  judge to put on hold an order barring it from processing payments on  8 4 billion in bonds issued under Argentine law following the country s record 2002 default  court documents showed 
Citigroup says it faces regulatory and criminal sanctions by the South American country  which defaulted on some of its debt in July  if it cannot process the  5 million interest payment due to bondholders by Sept  30 
Economy Minister Axel Kicillof on Monday threatened Citigroup with  penalties  if the bank failed to make the payment  as the government fights to prevent the debt crisis from spreading to other types of bonds 
A lawyer for the bank told U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa of its plans during a hearing in New York on Friday just hours after a federal appeals court dismissed Citigroup s appeal of Griesa s injunction prohibiting payment 
 As your honor knows  we are facing a payment deadline of Sept  30  so we are likely also to move for a stay   said Karen Wagner  a lawyer for Citigroup  according to the transcript obtained on Monday 
No other parties were present at last Friday s hearing with Griesa  Griesa has since scheduled a new hearing on the matter for Friday at 3 00 p m  EDT  1900 GMT   a court official said on Monday 
Under the terms of a 2012 ruling  Griesa ordered that Argentina must pay in full the U S  investment firms that rejected bond swaps in 2005 and 2010 at the same time as servicing its performing debt  Investors who exchanged bonds were paid less than 30 cents on the dollar 
In a separate order  Griesa said the injunction also prohibited Citigroup from processing payments on bonds issued under Argentine law 
Argentina defaulted in July after Griesa froze a  539 million coupon payment on foreign law bonds  However  he allowed Citigroup to make a one off payment on local law bonds and the bank argues the injunction against local law bonds should be lifted 
Kicillof acknowledged Citigroup had been shackled by Griesa s ruling  but said Citibank s operations in Argentina were governed by local law 
 If Citibank doesn t distribute the money  it will be violating Argentine law   he told local radio station Del Plata   There are a number of regulations that include different penalties  I don t know which path Citibank will walk down  
Wagner had told the 2nd U S  Circuit Court last week that Argentina had put  a gun to its head  and the gun will probably go off  if the bank is unable to process the payments 
Hours after the appeals court tossed out the file on Friday  Griesa told Citigroup it was his view that  the Argentine law bonds issued in Argentina  payable in Argentina  subject to Argentine law  are different from the bonds subject to the  2012  order   the transcript showed 

Danielle Romero Apsilos  a spokeswoman for Citigroup  confirmed on Monday that the bank  will seek to argue our case on an emergency basis in front of Judge Griesa this week  given the impending Sept  30 payment date

Big Banks Team Up to Develop Blockchain System

	Wall Street s increasing focus on digital currency technology has been affirmed yet again with the recent teaming up of a group of financial giants for the development of Utility Settlement Coin  USC   It is a digital cash model based on blockchain that aims to facilitate payment and settlement for global institutional financial markets 

	Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG    and London based Clearmatics initiated USC last September  to validate the potential benefits of USC for capital efficiency  settlement and systemic risk reduction in global financial markets   The successful conclusion of the first phase of this project led to the joining of Deutsche Bank AG     The Bank of New York Mellon Corp      Banco Santander  S A      and brokerage firm ICAP  LON IAP  to develop the concept further  The group also plans to undertake test in a real market environment 
	USC is a series of cash assets implemented on distributed ledger technology and is entirely backed by cash assets held at a central bank  With a version for each of the main currencies including USD  EUR  GBP and CHF  USC would be convertible at parity with a bank deposit in the related currency  According to a joint release  spending a USC will be equivalent to spending its real world currency 
	The group of financial institutions will focus on the financial structuring of the USC and its implications in the broader market  Alongside they will remain engaged in discussions with central banks and regulators to ensure a regulation compliant and efficient framework within which the USC can be implemented 
	Hyder Jaffrey  Head of Strategic Investment   FinTech Innovation at UBS Investment Bank stated   Digital cash is a core component of a future financial market fabric based on blockchain technologies   He further added   There are several digital cash models being explored across the Street  The Utility Settlement Coin is focused on facilitating a new model for digital central bank cash  
	Paul Maley  Managing Director  Institutional Client Group  Deutsche Bank noted   As today s settlement and clearing is a process involving many institutions  it s vital that we collaborate with our peers to develop viable alternatives to current models  creating new digital capabilities for the financial services industry  Blockchain Buzz
	Blockchain  the  digital ledger  or the underlying technology behind Bitcoin  has gained attraction for its significant potential to revamp the extensive and complex network of bank payments as well as settlements  While Bitcoin was one of the first cryptographic currencies that drew attention in 2009  several other cryptographic currencies are currently available including Novacoin  Namecoin and Dogecoin Bottom line

	The latest development tied with Blockchain platform crops up as banks are embracing technology and are continuously looking out for ways to restructure daily operations  update back office functions and making huge investments for auto execution of transactions  While banks and regulators continue to explore prospects and benefits of digital currencies  concerns including security and impact on the broader financial system still lingers

202432,423948,BK,Argentina asks U S  judge to put debt payment order on hold,news,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    Argentina asked a U S  judge on Monday to put on hold an order requiring it to pay bondholders who did not participate in debt restructurings following the country s 2002 default  while it seeks a  global resolution  
Ahead of a July 30 deadline to reach a deal or face a new default  Argentina filed papers asking a New York federal judge to stay a ruling that it pay the holdout investors  1 33 billion plus interest 
Argentina  which has been in settlement talks  said any deal must take into account other bondholders and factor in a clause in its restructured bonds that could open it up to further liability 
 As those risks remain  so does the necessity and appropriateness of a stay   Argentina s lawyers wrote 
The request is not the first time Argentina has asked for a stay  which U S  District Judge Thomas Griesa has previously denied 
Argentina separately filed a notice of appeal of a June 20 ruling by Griesa that prevented it from going through with a proposal by the country s economy minister to swap bonds governed by New York law for those under local jurisdiction 
On Tuesday  Griesa is expected to hear a range of requests by Argentina  bondholders and financial institutions over how to enforce his ruling requiring payment to the holdouts 
The payment to the holdouts  led by Elliott Management s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management  was due at the time of Argentina s next payment to the 92 percent of its creditors who participated in debt swaps in 2005 and 2010 following the country s  100 billion default 
Argentina last month attempted to make a  539 million payment to the restructured bondholders due June 30  But Griesa deemed it a violation of his order and told Bank of New York Mellon Corp to return the money 
A 30 day grace period is now in effect before a default can be declared 
In Monday s court filing  Argentina renewed arguments that the holdouts should not be allowed to put at risk its prior restructurings 
The country s lawyers said any deal needed to resolve not just claims by the plaintiffs but also those of other holdout creditors  Holdout creditor claims total as much as  20 billion globally  Argentina said 

Argentina argued any resolution must also be consistent with a clause in the restructured bonds  contracts that would open it up to billions of dollars in additional claims if triggered before it expires at the end of this year 
Argentina said it continues to participate in settlement talks before a court appointed mediator  Daniel Pollack 
 But that process must take into account these legal and factual constraints   Argentina s lawyers wrote 
NML did not respond to requests for comment and Aurelius had no immediate comment Monday

202434,423950,BK,Before Q2 Earnings Intensify  Sell These 3 Bank Stocks,opinion,"A strong appetite for government bonds has impacted interest rates by driving them lower across the globe   This is good news for borrowers seeking to take advantage of cheaper financing options   Lenders  on the other hand  stand to see less profitability from providing loans   Banks are the biggest lenders in the market  so they stand to see their profits take a beating as more and more investors pile in on bonds and other safe investments  
There are many lingering worries about the broader market  and Brexit has taken center stage this summer   Many believed that a British departure from the European Union would never happen  even after votes were tallied up   Theresa May is the new Prime Minister of the UK  and she has assigned a cabinet that is determined to plan and execute Britain s leave from the EU   Brexit looks like it will surely happen  and it will take a few years before the EU departure is official  
The unpredictable ramifications of Brexit have caused a lot of speculation to brew amongst investors  and as it becomes a reality waiting to take form  it may be wise to expect a low interest rate environment to persist   Banks are bracing for this possibility  and if a low rate environment does end up prevailing over the next few years  you ll be better off reducing your portfolio s exposure to lending stocks 
These 3 banks have yet to report their quarterly earnings results  but momentum has not been going their way as of late   Their short term earnings outlook has seen pessimism from analysts in the form of negative earnings estimate revisions  and this increases the chance that they will miss earnings expectations when they report their quarterly results   Lower interest rates stand to affect their lending operations going forward  and this could lead to lower earnings guidance from these firms 
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK  
The Bank of New York provides comprehensive financial services to individuals  businesses of all sizes  financial institutions  public agencies  and even governments   Their business lines include Securities Servicing and Global Payment Services  Private Client Services and Asset Management  Corporate Banking  Global Markets  and Retail Banking   The bank has a market cap of  42 86 billion  and it is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell    With a beta of 1 47  BK tends to see more volatile trading compared to the broader market 
The Bank of New York has received several negative earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days   Within the last two months  14 analysts have revised their earnings estimates lower for the current year  and no analysts have pushed their current year earnings forecasts higher   For the next fiscal year  analysts have unanimously revised their earnings estimates lower over the last month  and this has driven our EPS consensus lower   Over the last 30 days  the estimate has dropped from EPS of  3 44 to  3 34   BK is expected to report its quarterly earnings later this week 
KeyCorp   NYSE KEY  
KeyCorp is a banking firm that provides investment management  retail and commercial banking  consumer financing  and other services for individual and corporate clients   KEY stock got downgraded to a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  over the last week  and it also gets a grade of  F  for growth in our Style Scores    The company s sales have been stagnating since 2009  and that will be a hurdle for KEY to address if it wants to see its market cap expand 
KeyCorp has seen a lot of negative revision activity from analysts over the past two months   Within that time span  analysts have unanimously revised estimates downwards for this year and next year   9 analysts have negatively revised their EPS estimates on KEY for this year   One of these revisions were made as recently as seven days ago  and this does not bode well for the company  especially since it expected to release its quarterly results next week 
BankUnited Inc   NYSE BK  
BankUnited and its subsidiaries work in providing financial products and services to its clients in the US   The bank provides various types of loans such as mortgages and real estate loans  equipment and term loans  and letters of credit   The company is pretty small  as it has a market cap of just  3 4 billion   Like KeyCorp  BKU saw its rank move lower over the last week  and it is now a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   
BankUnited has a PEG of 3 57  so it may be relatively overvalued compared to its expected growth rate   The company also gets an  F  for value and momentum in our Style Scores   Over the last two months  seven analysts have revised their earnings expectations downwards and three revised expectations upwards for the current quarter   Each of our consensus estimates have trended downwards over the last three months   There has been a notable decline for our current year consensus estimate  and over the last 30 days it has gone from  2 20 to  2 15   BKU is expected to release its earnings results later this week 
Bottom Line
These banks are seeing their EPS expectations trend downwards  and they also stand to be hurt by lower interest rates over the longer term   As long as investors question the health of the broader market  a lot of money will continue to be allocated towards bond investments   Many companies and industries stand to be negatively impacted by Brexit  but banks with a large lending focus seem poised to be affected greatly before a Brexit even takes place
