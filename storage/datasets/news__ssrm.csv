Strength Despite Market Volatility In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

122145,343660,SSRM,5 Breakout Stocks For Astounding Returns,opinion,As popular as it is divisive  a breakout strategy is one of the most frequently used techniques among active investors  The idea is fairly simple   to identify stocks trading within a narrow band and buy them when they move above this channel or sell when they move below  If a stock moves above the channel  it promises substantial gains for investors But critics warn against the risk of timing such a move incorrectly or identifying the wrong breakout level  However  when executed correctly  this strategy can yield lucrative gains  which explains its enduring popularity Picking Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  the demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those that have just breached this level Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10

as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  the demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those that have just breached this level Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or

Strength to Enhance Your Returns In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

122192,343707,SSRM,SSR Mining  Acquisition Of Nevada Properties  Extends Asset Growth Potential ,opinion,"In a June 27 research note  CIBC analyst Cosmos Chiu reported that SSR Mining Inc  NASDAQ SSRM  acquired two past producing mines adjacent to its Nevada project Marigold for  22 million in cash plus the assumption of  23 1 million in long term environmental and reclamation requirements and a 0 5  net smelter royalty 
 We view today s transaction favorably from SSR Mining s perspective as a lower risk and a lower cost way to grow the company s assets   Chiu commented   We expect the company to be able to leverage its existing infrastructure to grow its production n while lowering costs in the Marigold region  
The analyst described the two acquired properties  including their size  location and past production history  Together spanning 8 900 hectares  they take the SSR Mining s total land ownership in the region to 19 800 hectares 
One of the assets  Trenton Canyon  7 350 hectares in size and immediately south from Marigold  was previously run by Newmont Goldcorp Corp   NEM NYSE  as an open pit run of mine  heap leach operation from 1996 to 2001  Past production totaled about 290 000 ounces of gold 
The other asset  Buffalo Valley  comprises 1 550 hectares and sits to the southwest of Marigold  Production  which occurred there from 1989 to 1991  amounted to about 50 000 ounces of gold  The project was a joint venture between Newmont and Fairmile Gold Mining 
Both Trenton Canyon and Buffalo Valley  host the same rock formations as the Marigold mine while displaying more intense host rock alteration   Chiu highlighted 
He noted that upcoming potential catalysts for SSR Mining s stock include a technical study  expected mid year  determining whether Red Dot can expand or extend production at Marigold  Others are a successful ramp up at Chinchillas and a possible decision by SSR Mining on whether to divest of or increase its 9 7  ownership stake in SilverCrest Metals Inc   SIL TSX V  and its Las Chispas project in Mexico 
CIBC has an Outperformer rating and a  16 25 per share target price on SSR Mining  whose stock is now trading at around  13 56 per share ",2019-07-05,The Gold Report,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acquisition-of-nevada-properties-extends-asset-growth-potential-200437139,200437139
122224,343739,SSRM,Majority Of Silver Miners Sustaining Cost Significantly Higher Than Market Price,opinion,"The Primary Silver Miners latest results were quite dismal as their All In Sustaining Costs to produce silver were considerably higher than the market price  Many of the silver miners production costs increased in the third quarter of 2018 due to higher energy  material  and labor costs 
Only one silver mining company out of the group posted a profit of  6 8 million for the quarter  and that was Fortuna Silver Mines  TO FVI   The biggest loser was Coeur Mining which suffered a  53 million loss for the period  Even the largest silver miner in the group  Pan American Silver  reported a surprise loss of  9 million Q3 2018 
Now  according to the silver mining companies All In Sustaining Costs  AISC   only two were lower than the current silver market price 

When I put together this chart  the silver price was trading at  14 02 but has jumped up to  14 17 as the broader markets continue to sell off  However  as we can see  seven of the nine top primary silver miners AISC is higher than the silver market price  BLUE BAR   The highest AISC of  22 39 per ounce is awarded to SSR Mining  NASDAQ SSRM   which changed its name from Silver Standard  SSR Mining is mostly a gold mining company with a very high cost open pit silver mine in Argentina called their Puna Operations 
Back in the heyday  Silver Standard s Piquitas Operation in Argentina was producing nearly 9 million ounces of silver  2012   Unfortunately  SSR Mining shut down operations at Piquitas last year and is now only processing stockpiles  So  with just processing stockpiles  SSR Mining s AISC is  8 more than the current silver market price 
While Pan American Silver and Fortuna published lower AISC s than the silver market price  the average AISC for the entire group was  16 10  Even if I was to remove the highest  SSR Mining    22 39  and the lowest  Fortuna    10 80   the average All In Sustaining Cost of these miners would still be  15 95  Thus  the top primary silver miners average AISC is  2 higher than the present silver market price  
I find it quite interesting that the gold and silver prices continue to show strength during major selloffs in the broader markets  At some point  investors are going to rotate out of falling stocks and real estate and into the precious metals and the miners  However  FEAR has not yet made its way into the investor psyche  but it will 
Furthermore  if we consider the Free Cash Flow in the primary silver miners  they are spending  2 5 more per ounce than they are receiving from cash from operations 

The two miners with positive Free Cash Flow in Q3 2018 was Pan American Silver  NASDAQ PAAS    8 1 million  and Fortuna Silver Mines  TO FVI    5 6 million   However  the majority suffered negative free cash flow with Coeur Mining  NYSE CDE  being the highest at   33 7 million  The net free cash flow for the group was a negative  52 million  Thus  the group was spending  2 6 per ounce more than the cash received from operations 
I calculated that figure by dividing the negative free cash flow of  52 million by the 19 5 million oz produced by the group 
It has been a while since I posted information on the silver miners  If you have read my articles going back to 2012  you will notice that the group is smaller  That is due to the shutdown of the Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO  Escobal Silver Mine in Guatemala  and the removal of SilverCorp Metals and another smaller company  I had 12 primary silver miners in my group  but now am only concentrating on nine 
In the movie  Carson Block of Muddy Waters provides details of why he believed Silvercorp Metals  TO SVM  was not truthful with its data  which is why he shorted the stock  To be clear  I am not negative on SilverCorp Metals  rather I remain neutral in that I d rather not use their data in my analysis  Each investor needs to make their mind up on the matter 
That being said  the primary silver miners are struggling with the low silver price  While the silver price could go lower  I still believe silver is closer to a low than the stock and real estate markets  With that understanding  there is a great deal less risk owning silver today than owning most stocks and real estate 
It s Quite Surprising That Pan American Silver Wants To Buy Troubled Tahoe Resources
Today  Pan American Silver announced its intention to purchase Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO  and its troubled Escobal Silver Mine in Guatemala that has been shut down for more than a year  You can read about my take on the Escobal Mine here  WORLD S 2ND LARGEST SILVER MINE SHUT DOWN  Implications For Company   Market 
The local peoples living around the Escobal Mine have been against the silver project ever since the beginning  The Guatemalan Supreme Court stepped in and revoked Tahoe s Escobal Mining license until a consultation of the indigenous communities had been taken  To me  it is a serious GAMBLE for Pan American to take on this problem 
While the Escobal Mine is the second largest primary silver mine in the world  the evidence I have read suggests that the local people do NOT WANT the mine to reopen  I have read some western articles suggesting that the local people are protesting so that they can be compensated by a percentage of the mines earnings  However  the articles coming from the local papers in Guatemala state the exact opposite  The local people want nothing to do with the mine and would like it to remain closed so they can be assured that the area around them will not be polluted and to also protect their valuable water supply for farming 
So  it will be interesting to see if Pan American Silver can resolve these issues with the local people  but I have my doubts   Of course  anything is possible  but it still surprising to see Pan American Silver acquire such a troubled asset when they could have concentrated on other projects in their pipeline 
Lastly  even though the primary silver miners are currently struggling  I believe it s only a temporary situation  As I have stated over the past year  when the markets crack  the precious metals and the miners will be the GO TO ASSETS  Unfortunately  most precious metals investors have given up on the metals and the miners  but this is precisely the time to start getting interested  Only successful investors buy when the price and sentiment are at an extreme low

122225,343740,SSRM,Gold Has Beaten Market Multiple Times,opinion,"Global uncertainty made gold a holiday winner for investors seeking a relatively safe haven  U S  stocks just logged their worst year since 2008 their worst December since 1931 as fears over global trade  ballooning debt  the end of accommodative central bank policy and a U S  government shutdown unsettled investors  Against this backdrop  the price of gold rallied late in 2018  reversing a trend of negative returns and weak investor demand that prevailed for most of the year 
The yellow metal  after all  has historically had a strong negative correlation with the market  I m pleased to report that this inverse relationship held firm in 2018  proving again that investors continue to see gold as a valuable asset in times of financial instability  As you can see in the charts below  gold beat the S P 500 Index for the month of December  the fourth quarter and the year  
With stocks down  gold s outperformance shouldn t come as such a shock to most readers 
What might surprise you is that the precious metal has also beaten the market for the century  345 39 percent versus 70 62 percent  since December 31  1999 
This tells me that  even though gold is still down from its 2011 peak  investors continue to value it as an attractive store of value 
Strong Gold Investment On Heightened Stock Volatility
Indeed  gold bulls added substantial positions to ETFs backed by bullion in December as the metal headed for its biggest monthly advance in two years  Gold backed ETF holdings surged by more than 100 tons between October and December  helping to boost prices even further  During last Thursday s trading session  ETFs bought 662 080 troy ounces of gold  the biggest one day increase in at least 12 months  according to Bloomberg 
Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU   explains why this buying is no fluke  Speaking to Bloomberg  she said that  the market is questioning whether the  Federal Reserve  is making a policy mistake  and that could not only lead to slower growth  but perhaps to a recession   Krosby went on to say that when you see this heavy selling in equities   it s indicative of fear  and gold  historically  becomes  favored as a relatively  safe haven allocation  
Gold Miners Ended Year On A High Note
It wasn t just bullion that had a good quarter  Precious metal miners  as measured by the FTSE Gold Mines Index  gained a remarkable 15 85 percent in the three months ended December 31  Among the leaders in 2018 were Nevsun Resources  NYSE NSU   up 106 percent for the 12 month period  Kirkland Lake Gold  TO KL   up 81 percent  SSR Mining  NASDAQ SSRM   up 45 percent  and North American Palladium  TO PDL   up 38 percent 
I believe now might be a good time to increase your exposure to the gold market  As always  I recommend a 10 percent portfolio allocation to the yellow metal   with 5 percent in high quality gold stocks and mutual funds and the other 5 percent in bullion and 24 karat gold jewelry ",2019-01-03,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-has-beaten-the-market-over-multiple-time-periods-200372585,200372585
122226,343741,SSRM,SSRM Delivers  Strong End To The Year ,opinion,"A CIBC report specified 2018 production and 2019 production guidance figures 
In a Jan  16 research note  CIBC analyst Cosmos Chiu reported that SSR Mining Inc  NASDAQ SSRM  three producing mines each exceeded the upper end of annual production guidance in 2018  Further  production guidance for 2019 implies growth 
The company s production in 2018 totaled 2 8 million ounces  2 8 Moz  silver  above CIBC s 2 5 Moz estimate  and 301 000 ounces  301 Koz  gold  in line with CIBC s forecast  Of the total  892 Koz silver and 75 Koz gold were produced in Q4 18 
Chiu noted that all of SSR s three producing assets contributed with a strong performance  Seabee achieved record production for 2018  Marigold boasted record tons placed along with  slightly higher grades and consistent recoveries   At Chinchillas  ramp up continued 
For 2019  Chiu relayed  SSR guided to midpoint production levels of 4 9 Moz silver and 312 Koz gold  at  693 per ounce 
Chiu concluded the report with   SSRM remains one of our Top Picks among the intermediate producers for 2019  as we expect strong operational performance once again  
CIBC maintains its Outperformer rating and  14 per share price target on SSR Mining  whose current share price is about  11 63

122252,343767,SSRM,They Call It  Monetary Policy  ,opinion,"The Dow Jones made its last all time high on March 1st  and since then its valuation has been slowly deflating  It closed this week only nine Dow Points away from breaking below its BEV  2 50  line in the chart below 
After the amazing 32 new daily all time highs the Dow Jones has made since the November elections  it s only right we cut the Dow some slack and not presume the current decline is just the first step down in a historic market decline But I can t help it  something in the back of my mind isconstantly nagging me we ll soon be living in historic times 

For one thing  President Trump threatens the established order in Washington and New York  the people responsible for all the market shenanigans of the past four decades  How many times has the taxpayer bailed out Wall Street when one of their highly levered harebrained schemes went bust  Since 1982  three times by my count with the fourth and biggest bust pending 
Geeze Louise  the big NY banks are counterparty to tens of trillions of interest rate derivatives  which only made them obscene profits as long as interest rates went down  But like T bond yields  corporate  Red Plot below  and municipal bond  Blue Plot  yields bottomed last summer and are now rising  Not good for Wall Street 
After a four decade long bull market  it s time for Mr Bear to make his presence felt in the fixed income market  Should bond yields return to where they were in 2008  I expect the big banks will once again come knocking on Congress s door asking for another bail out  And for the same reason   their interest rate derivative positions are underwater by a few tens of trillions of dollars 
With Trump now in the White House  what happens then  With Democrats everywhere calling for his impeachment or assassination  and establishment Republicans doing as little as possible in pushing his agenda forward  they must fear Trump s reaction to the pending panic on Wall Street they know is coming  as well as everything else he stands for 

The above chart of best grade corporate and muni bond yields shows a historic market anomaly  an anomaly that has now gone on for 334 weeks 
Muni bond coupon payments are tax free  while corporate bonds are taxable  For this reason  yields in muni bonds were below those of corporate bonds  and with few exceptions  have always been since 1938 when Barron s began publishing this data Then came November 2010  and as you can see in the chart above  all that has changed 
When the Federal Reserve pushed short term interest rates down to almost zero in 2008  people have been dying for income  Yet the market clearly prefers lower yielding taxable corporate bond income to higher yielding tax free income from muni bonds 
This is the bond market s warning of pending problems in the finances of local and state governments  People purchasing bonds issued by cities like Chicago  or states like California because they currently offerhigher yields to corporate bonds  will one day regret holding the IOUs of the crypto commies running the Democratic Party s political machines 
Of course Wall Street has bundled these muni bonds with a credit default swap  exactly as they did with sub prime mortgages in 2007  And we remember how that worked out  When mortgage defaults began to rise in 2007 08  Wall Street couldn t make good on its obligations to its counter parties to those swaps because they spent all the money instead of holding reserves  People should have gone to prison  Instead Congress and the Federal Reserve came in to bail these criminals out 
Gold is looking pretty good in its step sum chart below  Hopefully it will clear its  1 250 level next week  but if it doesn t  I ll just have to live with that  It looks as if its lows of last December are going to hold  But even if that doesn t  I could even live with that too 
The key thing to keep in mind with holding gold and silver is that our world is heavily indebted by weak credits and rickety banks  and so is pregnant with counter party risk  Gold and silver have no counter party risks  The day is coming when trillions of dollars in flight capital are going to flee the deflating financial asset markets  and attempt to squeeze into the tiny gold and silver markets  I believe a day is coming when the price of gold and silver will rise to levels that are simply unbelievable to people today 
But an ounce of gold  either at  35 or  35 000 is still an ounce of gold  It s the dollar  or euro  or yen that has changed  and not for the better when the price of gold and silver are rising  People who refuse to believe that the entire global political and financial establishments are doing everything possible  legally and illegally to prevent gold and silver from finding their actual free market prices simply don t understand the situation the current monetary system now finds itself in 

Remember that at the beginning of the 20th century gold and silver WERE money  Paper money a hundred years ago was understood by all to be a debt payable in gold and silver bullion  This metallic monetary standard prevented the banking system from inflating the money supply  and created economic stability in the market place  and government finance that is totally missing today 
But after two world wars  and a cold war with Communism  the old monetary metals were demonetized as central banks and politicians monetized the gullible belief in the full faith and credit of a central government 
Of course central banks in our current monetary system have issued an excess of dollars  euros  and yen  they ve issued more money than can ever fit into the tiny gold and silver markets in a financial panic  And come that day you ll be glad you have a nice position in the precious metal miners too 
In such a market a precious metals exploration company could go from pennies to dollars over night  So  staking 5  of your allocation for precious metals investments in a mineral exploration company in today s market is warranted 
As I ve said before  I like Eskay Mining  V ESK   Silver Standard Resources  NASDAQ SSRI  will soon begin a multi million dollar drilling program on Eskay s flagship property in British Columbia this coming summer  Hopefully  owners of Eskay Mining will receive some good news next autumn 
Moving on to gold and the Dow Jones  step sum and 15 count table below  we see selling pressure for both gold and the Dow has increased in the past month  But gold s response to its stagnating step sum and declining 15 count has been to increase its valuation  and that is darn bullish 
The Dow Jones response to its overwhelming down days has been to lose 2 46  from its last all time high of March 1st  Look at March 21st  The Dow Jones saw a big down day  and has slowly lost altitude since  Things can change in the next week  Being less than 2 5  away from its last all time high  the possibility of the Dow Jones making a new all time high next week can t be ruled out  But I think that would be unlikely 
What I think is likely is that the Dow Jones  15 count of  11 seen from February 28th to March 3rd  was a market extreme marking the high water mark of the March 2009 to March 2017 market advance  I expect we ll find the Dow Jones and the other major market indexes much lower six months from now and gold  silver and their miners higher 

Main stream economists and  market experts  stand in awe of the FOMC as they  execute monetary policy   But what is  monetary policy   At its most basic level it s actually very simple   monetary policy  is how best to direct the monetary inflation flowing from the Federal Reserve System into  economic growth  as seen in rising asset valuations  rather than flowing into consumer prices  inflation  
It s no more complicated than that  And since the creation of the Federal Reserve in December 1913  the FOMC has been responsible for all too much  economic growth  and consumer price inflation 
At its birth  the Dow Jones was at 78 11  A hundred and four years later the Dow broke above 21 000  In December 1913 US first class postage for a letter was  0 02  today its  0 49  And both the tremendous  growth  as seen in the Dow Jones and the terrible inflation in the cost of US first class postage stems from monetary inflation flowing from the Federal Reserve 
 Liquidity  flowing from the Federal Reserve goes everywhere  like into the earnings of the Dow Jones  as seen below  But look at the table on the chart  CinC has increased by a factor of 392 since 1929  while earnings for the Dow Jones has been up by only a factor of 75  And since 1982  every time the Dow s earnings rose up to the CinC plot in the chart  earnings for the Dow Jones has crashed  and appears to be doing so again 

Here s an interesting chart I haven t published for some time  plotting CinC indexed to 1 00   1953  I then use these indexed values of CinC to construct a ratio with the weekly prices of silver to derive silver s valuation in 1953 dollars 
In nominal dollars  the published price of silver   silver traded for  0 83 an ounce in April 1953  and closed this week at  17 76  In nominal dollar terms silver s price increased by a factor of 21 39 over the past sixty four years  However  CinC  paper money inflation  has increased by a factor of 51 39 over the same period of time  To convert this week s silver s closing price into constant 1953 dollar terms  divided this week s closing price by CinC s factor increase 
 17 76   51 39    0 34  1953 dollars 
One might say that silver today can be purchased for less than half of what it sold for in 1953  And when one is buying something for investment purposes  cheap is good 

 Investment professionals  have always been strong proponents for investing in America via the stock market  not gold and silver  But after taking CinC inflation into consideration  more often than not  since 1929 the stock market has been a mug s game for retail investors 
Of course  the trick to all this is that the financial media has allowed these same people managing  monetary policy  to define what  economic growth  and consumer price inflation are 
 Economic growth  is the success of the  policy makers  to divert their  liquidity   monetary inflation  into a financial market s valuations  such as stocks  mortgages or anything else Wall Street peddles to money managers and the public as  investments  
Consumer price inflation is exactly what they say it is  as defined by the Labor Department s bogus Consumer Price Index  CPI   which as currently constructed has little relationship with our current rising costs of living 
The past seven decades of US Treasury Long Bond Yields and Fed Funds Rates are plotted in the chart below  Using this data  it s not hard discerning where monetary inflation flowing from the Federal Reserve System has been flowing to  and what the FOMC s reaction has been 
I ve divided the chart area into three epochs of  monetary policy  
Where the  policy makers  were fighting inflation  1954 to 1982  
Where the  policy makers  were fighting deflation  1983 to 2007 
Where the  policy makers  are fighting for their lives  2008 to present 
In the epoch where the FOMC was fighting inflation  we know that their monetary inflation was flowing into consumer prices because bond yields  Red Plot  were rising The fixed income market began demanding an inflation premium to compensate bond buyers for the loss of purchasing power of the US dollar  The  policy makers  response to rising consumer prices is seen by the frequency  extremes and durations their Fed Funds Rate  Blue Plot  has been raised above bond yields 
Note  when the FOMC sets its Fed Funds Rate above bond yields they ve inverted the yield curve and  monetary policy  is called tight  By intent  inverting the yield curve brakes business activity and pushes up the unemployment rate  And the higher the Fed Funds rate rises above bond yields  the more extreme the curve inversion  the more extreme is the resulting recession in the economy 
The first inversion in the yield curve occurred in the mid 1960s  a mild inversion resulting in a mild recession  But bond yields in the following years continued rising in response to rising consumer prices  forcing the FOMC to invert the yield curve to increasingly greater degrees of tightness for longer periods of time 
By October 1981 the US Long Bond Yield had rose to 15  as the Federal Reserve increased its Fed Funds Rate to 22  in their effort to force their inflationary flows away from consumer prices  and channel their expanding money supply into financial asset valuations 
After three decades of failed attempts to inhibit their monetary inflation from flowing into consumer prices  the  policy makers  were finally successful 
Bond yields peaked in October 1981  marking the beginning of a four decade long bull market in bonds  In August 1982 the stock market began its best advance of the 20th century as monetary inflation flowing from the Federal Reserve System now flooded into financial assets instead of consumer prices 

The next epoch in  monetary policy  seen above spans from 1983 to 2007  an epoch best described as the  policy makers  fightdeflation in the financial markets whose valuations they ve inflated  Economists don t like to speak of it  but the simple fact is that someone can t  deflate  anything until they ve first inflated it  And from 1983 to 2007  what the  policy makers  have been inflating were bubbles in the stock  bond and real estate markets 
The first market bubble deflated was the Leveraged Buyout  LBO  mania of the mid 1980s  Oliver Stone s movie Wall Street nicely sums up the era  except he omits where Gordon Gekko got all the money he used in his leveraged buyouts  loans from the Federal Reserve system via Wall Street banks 

Unlike the huge yield inversions of the era when the  policy makers  were fighting inflation  the yield inversions from 1983 to 2007 were small but devastating when they occurred  With the tiny yield inversion of the late 1980s  the LBO bubble began deflating  along with the bubbles in the Japanese stock and real estate markets  Times on and off Wall Street were bad  So in the early 1990s Alan Greenspan lowered his Fed Funds Rate down to  at the time an incredible  3 00   thus igniting a bubble in the NASDAQ High Tech shares 
But this bubble too was doomed to deflate when from January 2000  to March 2001 Greenspan increased his Fed Funds Rate above the Treasury s long bond yield  Go up and take a quick look at the yield inversion of 2000 01  It wasn t much of an inversion  But unlike the LBO era  the 1990s High Tech bubble was a true mania that swept in the public  making the resultant deflation that much more damaging 
The  policy reaction  chosen by Greenspan in response to the Tech Wreck of the early 2000s was identical to his response to the deflation in the LBO bubble he lowered his Fed Funds Rate far below the long bond yield  But this time Greenspan  fully supported by Congress  inflated a bubble in the sub prime mortgage market 
The economy saw incredible  growth  as seen in rising prices in single family homes  until as was the case with the LBO and High Tech bubbles  the FOMC increased its Fed Funds Rate above long bond yields from July 2006 to September 2007 
As seen in the chart above  the 2006 07 yield inversion wasn t much of an inversion in the yield curve  In fact it was the smallest yield inversion since 1954  But market valuations in real estate  the stock and bond markets had become so grotesquely bloated by decades of  economic growth  flowing from the Federal Reserve System that the resulting deflation threatened to take down the entire global banking system 
The  policy makers  response to the credit crisis was exactly the same  except even more so  Which brings us to the third epoch of monetary policy  where the  policy makers  are fighting for their lives  Since December 2007 the FOMC has implemented the most inflationary monetary policy since its creation in 1913  as seen in the chart above and tables below 

Looking at the totals at the bottom of the tables tells the tale  When the  policy makers  were fighting inflation from 1954 to 1982 they implemented tight money policy for 30  of the 1487 weeks in the sample  When fighting deflation from 1983 to 2007 tight monetary policy was implemented in only 14  of the 1305 weeks in the sample  But since January 2008  the  policy makers  haven t implemented tight money  increase their Fed Funds Rate above the long bond yield  for a single week for fear of the deflationary consequences in the financial markets they know would result 
Speaking of dysfunctional messes  the main stream FAKE NEWS media continues stumbling over its coverage of President Trump  Not long ago the Donald tweeted that his conversations were wiretapped by the government  Well  when his conversations to world leaders were leaked to the MSM  where else could they have come from 
Then on March 21st  this from the  conservative  WSJ on the government s wiretapping Trump Tower 
 Wall Street Journal  Trump to  a drunk  clinging to  an empty gin bottle  in scathing editorial 
How embarrassing for the editorial board of the WSJ that only three days later the chair of the House s Intelligence Committed admitted that  that Trump was right 
What  the Journal doesn t follow the WikiLeaks disclosures  The CIA has access to every conversation on any phone call on the entire planet  as well as audio and video access to people s living rooms via some high end flat screen televisions people purchase  And the CIA during the Obama Administration has done all this completely without legislative authority  Where did the money to fund all this come from  the heroin and cocaine markets 
And the accusations of collusion between the Trump organization and Putin have been going on since last August  which thanks to the illegal intelligence gathering by the CIA and NSA  to which the MSM apparently has full access to  everyone in March now knows is a fiction  Still  the MSM and politicians continue beating this now very dead horse in full view of the public 
This week FBI Director James Comey in Congressional testimony refused to say that the FBI closed its investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election  Why  Because Comey  of the Clinton   Obama political machine that is currently working overtime to bring down President Trump 
This is so outrageous  but only to be expected after the  New Left  of the 1960s took over the Democratic party in the street riots outside the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago  And the Republican establishment currently entrenched in Washington aren t any better  Last year many  conservative Republicans  urged members of their party to vote for Hillary 
So what are we to do  Well I know what John Brown below would do  With a gun in one hand and his bible in the other  he d urge the good people of Kansas to rush the walls surrounding Obama s new headquarters located two miles from the White House Washington s new den of inequity 
But history records what happened when Brown and his followers did precisely that at the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry  Virginia in 1859  Those who weren t killed in the action were later given a fair trial and then hanged  No one escaped  so I d advise my readers against any rash action against Obama s new bunker 
Hopefully  what s happening is that President Trump is giving the minions of Clinton   Obama political machine who are currently entrenched in the Federal bureaucracy all the rope they need to hang themselves  Apparently  Trump s plan is working out better than anyone could have anticipated  We do live in interesting times ",2017-03-26,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/they-call-it-“monetary-policy”-200180165,200180165

122256,343771,SSRM,How Cheap Is Silver Producer Golden Arrow Resources ,opinion,"After reading a few articles   interviews of Chairman  President   CEO Joseph Grosso  I m struck by the lack of investor appreciation of Golden Arrow Resources Corporation  V GRG   of it entering into a 25  75  JV with mid tier gold   silver producer Silver Standard Resources Inc  NASDAQ SSRI   In the 18 month period since agreeing to evaluate a combination of Silver Standard s Pirquitas mine and Golden Arrow s  in Argentina  it invested  US  16 M  plus a C  2 M option payment  into the Company  Among other things  this capital paid for 24 000 m of drilling  engineering studies and metallurgical test work  culminating in a Pre Feasibility Study   PFS    Overnight  Golden Arrow jumped from explorer to 25  owner of a producing mine and Mill 
Does the Company s valuation embrace this monumental de risking event 
I believe there are 3 primary reasons for the under appreciation of the  Chinchillas   Pirquitas Mine  JV  At first blush  the PFS for a proposed 8 year mine life at the Company s  with a post tax NPV of US  178 M left investors underwhelmed  25  of US  178 M   US  44 5 M   C  60 M  equal to about C 0 60 share   Second  the PFS used a fixed  long term Ag price assumption of US 19 50 oz vs  the current spot price of about US 17 25 oz 
Third  there s uncertainty as to how management will fund Chinchillas  estimated US  20 25 M capital requirement over the next 18 months  and also be able to fund other important exploration activities  such as at Antofalla  see below   Although not the focus of this article  Golden Arrow controls  25 other land packages totaling  214 000 hectares  NOTE   Please see  for more info 
Tackling the idea of a funding challenge is not difficult  Once the JV transaction closes the Company will have roughly C  27 M   US  20 M in cash  On top of that  there s an additional C  7 M from in the money options   warrants  plus an estimated C  11 M stretching out into mid 2018 from its share of cash flow from processing stockpiles at the Pirquitas mine 
Combined  that s C 45 M   US  33 3 M in cash  equal to C 0 40 per fully diluted   fd   share  If readers are still not comfortable with Golden Arrow s ability to fund both its 25  JV Interest obligations and exploration of other exciting projects  there s little else I can say  the numbers speak for themselves 
Is the PFS a Good Measure of Potential Upside in Golden Arrow s Share Price 
Regarding the PFS  there s a substantial amount of upside to the NPV  The following factors could have a large impact on the NPV 

The PFS is just the beginning of a valuation exercise  not the end of it  Touching briefly upon the above bullet points  it s very important to recognize that Silver Standard s Mill at Pirquitas operated at an average of 5 175 tpd in 4th qtr 2016  That s  30  above nameplate capacity  All else equal  incorporating this single change  from a 4 000 tpd assumption to 5 175 tpd  in the NPV calculation found in the PFS would increase the economics by  40   To be clear  this represents only the operational potential of the Mill with respect to Chinchillas  it s not a sure thing  otherwise it would have been reflected in the PFS  
Regarding extended mine life  the PFS conservatively includes  71 M Ag Eq  ounces  but Chinchillas has a NI 43 101 resource of 140 M Ag Eq  ounces  Proven Probable Measured Indicated   Continued drilling will upgrade a portion of M I to P P  There s also 63 M Inferred ounces  plus ongoing exploration that could result in new discoveries  Therefore  mine life could be meaningfully extended  and or annual production increased  With this in mind   in my opinion only   a mine life beyond 8 yrs is the expectation  not the default 

The last 2 bullet points  high grade ore feed from select veins and the re evaluation of underground opportunities at Pirquitas are noteworthy as well  These are tangible scenarios that make a lot of sense with the Pirquitas Mill operating at high utilization  but would never work on a standalone basis 
Various Scenarios Suggest a Higher Company Valuation
Readers might have noticed I don t mention potential upside in the NPV from silver  lead or zinc prices  I leave that out because the PFS already incorporates a strong Ag price assumption of US 19 50 oz  vs  a current spot price of  US 17 25 oz  NOTE   lead   zinc prices in the PFS economics were set close to spot  offering potential upside in those metals relative to the Ag price  
Another factor possibly under appreciated by the market is the robustness of this PFS compared to that of other PFS stage projects around the world  How many PFSs have an established  operating Mill   tailings facility in them  How many PFS stage projects are fully funded  NOTE   Silver Standard also has strong liquidity  C  582 M in cash and marketable securities   I believe the Chinchillas project is more de risked than it appears  especially if one accepts that the cash liquidity estimate mentioned above will satisfy Golden Arrow s share of upfront capital 

In the above chart I take a stab at quantifying the potential value per share under 3 simple scenarios  I start with the base case  which takes the PFS at face value  25  of US  178 M   US  44 5 M   C  60 M   adds existing cash  incl  proceeds from warrants   options of C  14 M      US  15 M   C  20 M  in  look back  JV cash flow   Golden Arrow s 25  share of Pirquitas stockpile processing cash flow  estimated to be a total of C  11 M  from April 1  2017 through June 30  2018   That total value is C  105 M  but it ascribes zero value to an additional 214 000 hectares of prime exploration property in Argentina  including the highly prospective Antofalla Ag Au Base Metal project  For that I attached an amount equal to 20  of the calculated valuation of Golden Arrow s 25  Interest in the Chinchillas   Pirquitas JV  In the  base case   that s C  12 M  C  117 M divided by 111 3 fd shares   C 1 05  The current share price is C 0 65 

If one looks no further than the base case  one is missing the real opportunity here  In the scenarios that I show  all calculations my own  based entirely on extrapolation of the cash flow model on page 210 of the PFS   the value per fd share ranged from C 1 28 to C 1 82  These are indicative figures only  and of course the market does not always give companies 100  credit on underlying valuation 
Scenarios are derived from assuming an 8 to 12 yr mine life and 4 800 tpd throughput at the Mill  20  greater than the assumption in the PFS   To reiterate  the Pirquitas Mill operated at 5 175 tpd in 4th qtr  2016  Should GRG v shares be trading at a 60  discount to the indicative value of C 1 57 share  based on a 10 yr mine life at 4 800 tpd  That s for readers to decide  but I ve been investing in Golden Arrow in recent weeks as I think it offers a compelling risk reward opportunity 
Finally  consider a bullish scenario not included in the chart  In the eyes of a prospective acquirer of Golden Arrow s 25  stake in the JV  a potential mine life of even greater than 12 years would be contemplated in their overall due diligence  The JV interest is arguably worth more to a suitor with multiple mines  as it would serve to diversify its asset portfolio and the suitor could more efficiently spread overhead expenses across the entire enterprise  Not to mention a lower cost of capital and other prospective synergies 
Readers paying close attention may have noticed that I ve sneakily switched a PFS with an 8 yr mine life for one extending 15 years   That s not the point at all  I m not saying that Chinchillas will be a 10 15 year mine  just that it could  under very reasonable assumptions  be longer than 8 years  The upside optionality of Chinchillas is valuable  but might not be priced into shares at C 0 65

122259,343774,SSRM,Is Silver Standard Resources A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Silver Standard Resources Inc    NASDAQ SSRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Silver Standard Resources has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Silver Standard Resources  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Basic materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Silver Standard Resources has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 24 8  which is higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Silver Standard Resources has a P S ratio of about 2 2  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  SSRI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Silver Standard Resources currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Silver Standard Resources a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 9  which is far better than the industry average of 10 7  Clearly  SSRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Silver Standard Resources might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives SSRI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period As a result the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by over 100  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has also increased by 21 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Silver Standard Resources Inc  Price and Consensus   The company does not have any expected long term expected earnings growth  This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSilver Standard Resourcesis an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 15  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Computer Mini industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

122260,343775,SSRM,The Dow Jones Moves From One New All time High To Another ,opinion,"Somehow I contacted a bad case of cellulitis  a bacterial infection in my left leg  I feel better  but between the infection and the antibiotics  the past three weeks haven t been pleasant  I don t want to miss this week s article  as I enjoy writing them  but I expect it will be shorter than my usual articles 
The last article I sent out was on the weekend of July 15th  and since then the Dow Jones has seen many new all time highs  In fact  since July 11th the Dow Jones has increased from 21 409 07 to 22 092 81 at the close of this week  making twelve new all time highs in the past eighteen NYSE trading sessions as it advanced 684 points  3 19   
The thing that bothers me with the Dow Jones  BEV chart below is it s been a long time since the Dow Jones has seen a correction of just 5   5  corrections  and greater are pretty routine in a bull market  but we ve haven t seen one since July of last summer  And to get the Dow Jones to correct by 5  from its current lofty levels  it would have to decline 1 100 points 
That s going to be a shock to many people when that happens  But central banks have been  injecting  their  liquidity  into the financial markets to where the Dow Jones is now over 22 000 points  so that s the way things are 

Since 2000  up to last November  the relationship between the Dow s valuation  Blue Plot chart below  and its trading volume  Red Plot  had become inverted to what it was from 1900 to 2000  And what was that  Well  trading volume is demand for what Wall Street was selling the public  and like anything else an increase in demand resulted in an increase in price   until the high tech bubble of the 1990s began to deflate in the first two years of the 21st century  From 2000 to 2002  trading volume  demand  increased as valuations for the stock market deflated 
It was worse than just that  market valuations were also going to new all time highs as trading volume  demand  collapsed  It s not hard to figure out what was happening  the Federal Reserve was supporting the market on market declines  and withdrawing their support on market advances  This is clearly evident from 2011 to November 2016 in the chart below 
Then the November 2016 election came  where after almost seventeen years the market was once again advancing on rising trading volume  What should we make of this  Something big has changed  exactly what I don t know  I m not going to predict what trading volume for the Dow Jones is going to do when it sees its first 10  correction since February 2016  BEV chart above   But a 10  correction in the Dow Jones also means a big 2 200 point decline in the Dow Jones  something that I suspect many people will be painfully aware of 

If the Federal Reserve is still in the market manipulation business  on the next big market decline we should see trading volume for the Dow Jones increase to new all time highs in the charts above and below  If that doesn t happen  we may have finally arrived at the point where the  policy makers  have decided to stand back and allow their inflationary bubble in the market crash and burn 
With Donald Trump as president  someone these people absolutely hate  making him their fall guy may be their plan  If so we ll see trading volume collapse with the valuation of the Dow Jones exactly as it did in the depressing 1930s  One thing is for sure  the main stream media will say nothing about central banks being responsible for what is to come  and as a group will parrot the party line about President Trump being responsible for the coming calamity 
Here is a better chart showing the bizarre trading volume for the Dow Jones  Blue Plot  during the high tech and subprime mortgage bear markets  Since 1900  when taxis in New York City were pulled by horses  there has been nothing like it  Now for the first time since 2000  Dow Jones trading volume is going up with the Dow Jones beginning last November 

Here s the chart for the earnings for the Dow Jones  I m not an accountant  but looking at the data plotted below  I note how after the 1929 crash it took twenty years before the earnings for the Dow Jones returned to where they were in 1929  After the Dow s earnings crashed in 2007  they were actually above to their highs of 2007 in 2011 and that seems a bit odd to me 
Also  I plotted US currency in circulation  CinC   Red Plot  along with the Dow Jones earnings below  It wasn t always so from 1929 to 1980  but typically the Dow Jones generated a dollar in earnings for every  1 billion in CinCduring these five decades  But after 1980  earnings for the Dow Jones decoupled from CinC  Looking at the chart below  something happened to the Dow Jones  earnings  something that made them unstable  I believe this instability in the Dow s earnings to be a result of the US Government taking the dollar off the Bretton Wood s  35 gold peg in August 1971 

It goes without saying that  market experts  would disagree with this  But then you ll never see a  market expert  discussing the chart above on CNBC for the publics  benefit  while examining historical data such as this is what I do 
Look at the table in the chart above  Since April 1929  when Barron s first began publishing earnings for the Dow Jones  CinC is up by a factor of 400 while the Dow Jones  earnings is up by a factor of only 83 44  What could that indicate  Obviously the FOMC is having increasing difficulty getting their  liquidity  flowing into corporate America s earnings  and the valuations of publicly traded stocks  Looking at the widening gap between CinC and the earnings for the Dow Jones  expect more instability to follow 
I m expecting the current earnings for the Dow Joneswill crash exactly as they did from 2007 09 sometime in the not to distance future  Also  that the usual suspects in the financial media will blame all on President Trump  and call on the experts in the FOMC to fix the stock market once again They ll do this as this is what they do for a living 
At the close of the week  the Dow Jones Total Market Group  DJTMG  s top 20 was at 47  The Dow Jones may be making new all time highs  but the broad market is just running in place  and has been for well over a year 

Next are two tables for the major indexes I follow  On July 14th the Dow Jones made a new all time high  as did eleven other of the major indexes  Today  August 4th  only two other major market indexes closed the week at a new all time high 
This could all change by next week or next month  By October the top 20 above could find itself over 50  and the Dow Jones  along with most other of the indexes seen below rising to new all time highs in a solid front 

But as sure as night follows day  as bull markets mature  they increasingly become more and more selective of what stocks and major market indexes are able to make new all time highs  until at the top exhaustion overwhelms the bulls and that s it  At that point Mr Bear returns and begins taking out the garbage left over from the partying bulls  see photo below   For an advance that began in March 2009  how much longer can this  liquidity  driven bacchanal on Wall Street go on 
Moving on to gold s BEV chart below  gold made an important bottom in December 2015  To be sure  nothing exciting is happening with gold  or silver  so far in 2017  but looking at its BEV chart below gold is far above its BEV 44  of nineteen months ago  Now all it has to do is break above the BEV 27 5  of last summer and the bull market resumes  but when 
I expect when Mr Bear begins mauling the financial markets the FOMC is currently manipulating  we ll see some real excitement in gold s BEV chart below  The key metric to follow will be bond yields and interest rates  Rising bond yields  capital flight from the debt markets   will become the prime mover for the gold and silver markets  Maybe we ll see some excitement before Christmas 

Gold s step sum chart below isn t being helpful  In my last article I anticipated that a bear box was in the making  and that the next thing to happen was for gold s price and step sum plot to both turn down before we d see the price of gold break upward  As you can see below  that didn t happen  But since 2014  gold s step sum boxes have been failing one after another  I m going to blame it on the  policy makers  interfering in the market 

Not surprisingly  the bull box in the Dow Jones step sum chart below resolved itself exactly as most of the bull boxes I ve studied have  From March to May of this year the Dow Jones  valuation ignored the steeply declining step sum plot  What makes a step sum plot go down  More down days than up  yet the valuation for Dow Jones refused to follow  That s bullish Then in late July  the Dow s step sum plots broke sharply upward  finally following the Dow s rising valuation plot closing the bull box 
Looking at the Dow s step sum chart below  the next few weeks and maybe months could be very bullish  but no guarantees on that 

Here s gold s and the Dow Jones step sum and 15 count tables  Gold s step sum is advancing  and so is the price of gold  but it s mostly a holding action  Gold isn t ready to make a big break out just yet 
Look at the Dow Jones  In the past twenty five trading sessions it has closed down in only seven of them  and in the advancing days the Dow Jones is moving up nicely  Look at all the BEV Zeros  new all time highs  in the BEV column 

The Dow Jones hasn t seen a down day since July 24th  Are we going to see the Dow with a rare double digit 15 count by next Friday  I wouldn t doubt it  Since February 2016  the Dow Jones has on four occasions seen its 15 count in the double digits  As you can see in the chart below   that s a lot of them in such a short period of time  Maybe by next Friday we ll see history being made  and for the fifth time in eighteen months we ll see the Dow Jones 15 count in the double digits 

If you can believe it  the national debt peaked in early January at  19 952 trillion and since then in the past few months  has slowly gone down to  19 844  But I don t believe it as I ve seen this farce happen before 
Since January 2010  this is now the fourth time this has happened  see chart below   If this pattern holds true  we ll see Congress  currently dominated by Republicans  once again raise the debt ceiling this coming autumn  resulting in a spike in the national debt immediately after the debt ceiling is raised 

Here s a link to a Politico article on this exact topic  The Republican leadershipunder Mitch McConnell in the senate and House Speaker Paul Ryan is completely worthless  Between them and their RINO  Republicans In Name Only  followers in the capital  our constitutional system could come tumbling down and they wouldn t care as long as they continue getting their perks of office 

What are they spending all this money on  They ll never tell us for fear of what the public would do to them if we actually knew  I ll tell you why the Wall Street   Washington establishment universally hate President Trump   he s not a member of their club  and is completely capable of severing their connections to the US Treasury  If he can finally establish his control over the Federal Government  he s the guy that would put an end to this corruption 
And these people now in control over the leavers of power in Washington are corrupt  that s why they wanted Hillary Clinton in the White House  and now fear Trump  Here s Scotland s Keven Baker interviewing Susan Lindaueron the corruption of the Clinton political machine now fighting for it life to maintain itscontrol of Washington  It s a 50 minute interview  and well worth your time to listen to 

This makes me so angry  Why isn t the Republican leadership demanding a special prosecutor to investigate the Clinton Foundation  Because an honest investigation into the Clinton political machine would exposes them too

122290,343805,SSRM,4 Shining Silver Mining Stocks With Solid Momentum,opinion,Silver rose to a fresh 2016 high in the second quarter driven by stronger investor and speculative demand amid a supportive macro environment for precious metals  Overall  this year  silver has been a star performer  The white metal outshone the bullion as well  clocking a 37  gain compared to gold s 22  rise Worries over the global economy  Brexit induced equity market volatility  the Federal Reserve s stance of keeping interest rates steady  and the introduction of negative interest rates by several central banks gave a boost to safe haven assets like silver and gold  Silver might continue to outperform gold in the coming months due to heightened uncertainty over rate rises after the recent disappointing data from the U S Demand Supply Imbalance Favors SilverSilver has varied industrial applications which drive its demand significantly  Industrial demand for silver is set to increase from 54  last year  Increased interest in safe haven assets will also drive physical silver investment demand  Demand in jewelry fabrication will remain strong and India will emerge as a major consumer courtesy of increased investor interest and growth in jewelry  decorative items and silverware fabrication However  global mine supply production is projected to fall 5  in 2016   the first drop in global silver mine production since 2002  The soft price environment in the prior years had deterred producers from investing in expanding capacity at existing operations  Global silver mine production is anticipated to decline through 2019 as primary silver production from more mature operations starts to wane Thus  we are looking at a potential silver deficit  which in turn provides a solid ground for silver price gains this year  Price appreciation will also be supported by a flight to safety amid volatile equity markets  The uptrend in silver prices has ignited a massive rally in silver mining stocks this year  most of which have trebled  Among others  Alexco Resource Corp    NYSE AXU   and Athena Silver Corp  are the major movers year to date  gaining 477  and 327

122294,343809,SSRM,6 Surging Silver Mining Stocks To Buy As Fed Maintains Rates,opinion,"After much speculation on  Will it or won t it   on Wednesday  the Fed announced its decision to keep interest rates unchanged  It sent precious metals on a high with gold trending upwards to a two week high of  1 337 50 an ounce and silver closing 3  higher at  19 80 Fed Stays Put on Rate HikePer the statement  factors have improved since its July meeting with solid job gains and increased household spending  However  business fixed investment remains soft and inflation is trending below the committee s 2  longer run objective  partially exhibiting earlier declines in energy prices and prices of non energy imports The Fed  chaired by Janet Yellen  stated that though that the case for a rate hike has strengthened  the committee has decided to wait for the time being  to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives  The Federal Reserve is thus maintaining the current target rate for the federal funds rate at 0 25  to 0 5  The Fed anticipates economic activity to expand at a moderate pace and improved labor market with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy  Though inflation will remain low in the near term  it will eventually rise to 2  over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices wane and the labor market strengthens further Impact on Markets and MetalsThe markets cheered the Fed s dovish stance  As of Wednesday close  the Nasdaq hit a record high  adding 53 83 points to 5 295 18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 163 74 points to close at 18 293 70 and the S P 500 shot up 23 36 points to 2 163 12  Precious metals gained on the back of the dovish stance and a weaker dollar  It s a known fact that a delay in raising interest rates works in favor of precious metals like gold and silver which produces no income but rather relies on price appreciation to attract investors Silver Will Continue to ShineWe believe silver will continue to outperform gold in the coming months riding on the uncertainty of rate hikes in the future as the Fed has kept the possibilities open for a rise this year  Further  Silver has varied industrial applications which drive its demand significantly 
On the other hand  global mine supply production is projected to fall 5  in 2016   the first drop in global silver mine production since 2002  Thus  a potential silver deficit provides a solid ground for silver price gains this year  Price appreciation will also be supported by a flight to safety amid volatile equity markets MINING SILVER Industry Price Index

122297,343812,SSRM,4 Mining Stocks That Are Must Adds To Your Portfolio,opinion,"Last year was particularly challenging for the mining industry as miners suffered heavy losses due to the slowdown in China and the subsequent crash in commodity prices  To stay afloat mining companies had to up the ante in their productivity efforts  while some found themselves fighting for survival  by disposing underperforming assets or closing operations 
This year  the mining industry seems to be on a better footing  having staged a comeback  with gold and silver being the major movers so far this year  Worries over the global economy  Brexit induced volatile equity markets  the Federal Reserve s  Fed  stance to maintain steady interest rates and the introduction of negative interest rates by several central banks boosted growth of these safe haven assets However  on Oct 4  gold lost its bearing  slipping 3 3  to  1 266 an ounce  Prices came below the  1 300 threshold for the first time since the Brexit induced high in June  The plunge was triggered by higher than expected U S  manufacturing data and the subsequent climb in the US dollar  According to the Institute for Supply Management  the ISM Manufacturing Index  which is a measure of production activity  stood at 51 5 for September  after a 49 4 reading in August  The upbeat data renewed the speculation that a rate hike by the Fed seems imminent this year Further  with Agence France Presse reporting that the Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  is close to reaching a settlement with the U S  Department of Justice raised optimism and risk appetite among investors and lead major equity benchmarks upward  This took buying interest away from the safe haven metal Silver followed suit slumping 5 8  in a day  The dips notwithstanding  prices of the yellow metal and silver are still up roughly 19  and 29   year to date respectively All eyes are now on the much anticipated monthly non farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  on Oct 7  Weekly initial jobless claims have been steady and lower than historical averages of late  analysts are thus expecting a healthy jobs number at the end of this week However  as we are at the last quarter of the year  gold prices are seasonally stronger aided by retail demand for the metal  due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China  Robust industrial demand and dwindling supplies for silver also sets the stage for silver prices to rise further As per the Zacks Industry classification  the mining industry is grouped under the Basic Material sector   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  Though sector growth will remain in the negative territory in the third quarter  a dip of 1 9  projected for the quarter is not that steep compared to the 11 6  decline witnessed in the second quarter

122300,343815,SSRM,Tired Of Caution  Here Is A Bullish Case Of S P 500 ETF Investing,opinion,"In the last few months  all that we heard was warnings about the impending crash in the S P 500 index  Be it Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   HSBC  billionaire investor George Soros or Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  s David Bianco   many have raised the yellow flag in front of S P 500 investing time to time  read    
Everyone had their share of reasons  After all  stocks saw an astounding start to Q3 despite Brexit  still soft corporate earnings  weaker business investments in the U S  and global growth issues  Especially  Goldman Sachs has long been vocal on this issue 
Most recently  the  indicated that investor enthusiasm has now peaked and  points to a 2 percent near term S P 500 fall   The sentiment indicator  which looks to track the S P 500 futures positioning  now stands at its maximum level of 100 and thus is due for a reversal  read    
Goldman also believes that corporate buybacks   one of the main factors in pushing up the stocks   will slow down in the second half of 2016  causing an upheaval in the market and expects the S P 500 to slip by  by December  On the other hand   sees  the possibility of a severe fall in the stock market is now very high   They have all repeatedly cautioned about overvaluation in the market  read    
Against such a scenario  one  reasons out why the S P 500 may close out the year with a double digit return  His target for the S P 500 is 2 325  up 8 7  from the close on October 26  2016 
Bullish Arguments for S P 500 Further Rally 
According to the strategist   the stock market and the high yield market almost always move in sync   and  the high yield market is up 18 percent this year   He also went on to explain that  the S P  any time the high yield market has been up 10 percent  has averaged a 22 percent gain   Since the index is now up about 4 7   it has further room to run going by history 
On the earnings front  Lee indicated that  it s been actually one of the better earnings seasons   On this front  we would like to note that Q3 earnings season is on its way to deliver positive earnings growth for the first time in six quarters 
As per the  report issued on October 26  2016  earnings growth of the S P 500 in Q3 is expected to be 1 4  on 1 4  higher revenues  Earnings growth momentum would pick up with 4 9  growth expected in Q4  11 2  in Q1 of 2017 and 10  in Q2 of 2017  Revenue growth for Q4 of 2016  Q1 of 2017 and Q2 of 2017 are expected at 4 6   7 1  and 6 1   respectively 
If this is not enough  expected strong sales in the upcoming holidays and the Halloween Effect may also contribute to the rally  The Halloween Effect means buying stocks six trading days before Halloween and selling on May 1  Historically  this period has brought bountiful returns for the stock market 
So  if you want to go against the tide and cash in on the above said arguments  you can play the below mentioned ETFs 
There are several regular S P 500 ETFs including SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY    AX SPY    iShares Core S P 500 ETF  and Vanguard 500 ETF   There are leveraged ETFs too  These are Ultra S P500 ETF   TO SSO    UltraPro S P 500 ETF   MCX UPRO   and Direxion Daily S P 500 Bull 3x Shares ETF   read    
SSO gives twice the daily performance of the S P 500 while UPRO and SPXL deliver triple the daily performance of the S P 500  see  here  
Bottom Line
As a caveat  investors should note that leveraged products are risky in nature and suitable only for short term traders  Plus  election uncertainty is looming large in this fourth quarter  which may foil the usual wining trend  read

122301,343816,SSRM,Silver Market Poised For Big Reversal As Institutional Investors Move In,opinion,"The Silver Market is going to experience a big reversal when the Hedge Funds and Institutional investors rotate out of highly inflated stocks and into precious metals investments  This is not a matter of if  it s a matter of when  And the when  could be much sooner than we expect due to the huge problems with the  
As I mentioned in my previous article    I posted this chart of the 2 000 point drop in the Dow Jones early in 2016 versus a huge spike up in gold and silver 

At the beginning of 2016  the Dow Jones Index fell to a low at 15 600 level  5 000  points lower than what it is trading currently while the gold and silver price surged higher   The fundamentals of the Dow Jones Index is more rotten than ever  Wolf Richter wrote about this in his article   
Furthermore  the Dow Jones Index is seriously overdue for a correction 


According to the economic contraction cycle that occurs about every six years  the Dow Jones Index is severely overdue for a good  ole fashion beating  If we assume that a normal correction for the Dow Jones would be for it to fall to about 8 000 points  the index is overvalued by at least 60   And that is just for starters 

So  when the Dow Jones Index and the broader stock markets finally crack  we are going to finally see Hedge Funds and Institutional investors rotate out of the majority of highly inflated stocks and into the precious metals and mining sector  This will have a profound impact on the price of gold and silver as well as their mining companies share prices 
To get an idea how this will impact the Primary Silver Mining sector  I compared it to the largest U S  oil company in country  ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   ExxonMobil is listed on the Dow Jones Index as one of 30 industrial stocks and has the highest market cap of all the energy companies in the United States 
What Will The Impact Be When Hedge Funds   Institutional Investors Move Into The Silver Market 
According to Michael Belkin of the Belkin Report  he put out a buy signal on his top Primary Silver mining companies during an interview on King World News last month  Now  Michael was one of the few who made a call back at the end of 2015 advising his clients  and those who subscribe to his new gold stock newsletter  to get into the gold mining sector  And at the beginning of the year  the price of gold and the gold shares shot up considerably  Then a month later  he made a call advising his clients to get into his group of Primary Silver mining stocks  Over the next several months  the Dow Jones Index crashed while the price of silver and the silver stocks surged higher 
Belkin  who has large institutional clients is now advising them to get out of the most of the broader market stocks and into other assets such as the precious metals  especially the silver stocks  He is one of the few analysts that I respect as he does not get paid by the mining companies to promote their stocks  He suggests certain stocks through his own analysis and models  Belkin believes the broader markets are going to finally correct BIG TIME this year and that one of the few sectors to move into will be the precious metals 
If we look at the market cap of ExxonMobil versus the ten top primary silver mining companies in the world  we can plainly see how much potential there is in the primary silver mining sector 

ExxonMobil has a market cap of  344 billion  at the time when the chart was created  compared to  27 billion for the top ten primary silver mining companies  These top ten primary silver miners include  Fresnillo PLC LON FRES   Pan American Silver Corp  NASDAQ PAAS   Tahoe Resources Inc  NYSE TAHO   Hecla Mining Company  NYSE HL   Coeur Mining Inc  NYSE CDE   First Majestic Silver Corp  NYSE AG   Silver Standard Resources Inc  NASDAQ SSRI   Fortuna Silver Mines Inc  TO FVI   Endeavour Silver Corp   TO EDR   and Silvercorp Metals Inc  TO SVM  
Actually  half of the total market cap of the group was from Fresnillo PLC which is  13 billion  This means  ExxonMobil s market cap is nearly 13 times greater than the total of the top primary silver mining companies in the world 
NOTE   There are other large silver producing companies in the world such as Hochschild out of Peru  However  I wanted to focus on the largest  Fresnillo  and those mainly trading on the U S  exchanges 
Next  lets compare the total outstanding shares between ExxonMobil and these top primary silver miners 

Currently  ExxonMobil has 4 15 billion outstanding shares versus a total of 2 5 billion for the top ten primary silver miners  Thus  the largest oil and gas company in the U S  and on the Dow Jones Index has two thirds more outstanding shares then the top 10 primary silver miners put together 
So  how do the stock prices of these two compare to each other  When I put together these charts last week  ExxonMobil s share price was  82 90 versus an average  10 90 a share for the top ten primary silver miners 

With the oil and silver price lower this week  these figures shown above are lower  but still reflect about the same ratio  Regardless  the top primary silver miners average share price for the group is about eight times less than ExxonMobil  However  the interesting thing to understand is that any significant amount of funds flowing into the primary silver miners will cause their share prices to move up a lot higher and faster than ExxonMobil 
If the market cap of each doubled  this would be the result on their share prices 

It would take  344 billion to double the market cap of ExxonMobil to  688 versus just  27 billion  to  54 billion  for the top ten primary silver miners  Which means  it wouldn t take much in the way of funds moving into the primary silver mining sector to double its market cap  and share price compared to ExxonMobil  While it is impossible to know how much money or trading volume would be needed to double the market caps of the two listed above  logic suggests that the primary silver miners will experience a much higher surge in share price with much less in the way of total funds versus ExxonMobil 
Furthermore  a weakening economy and falling Dow Jones Index would likely result in lower oil prices  This will be bad news for ExxonMobil and the energy sector shares 
Now  one of the most fascinating comparisons between ExxonMobil and the top ten primary silver miners is their percentage on total production in their various industries  ExxonMobil produced approximately 2 5  of total global liquid oil production in 2016  compared to the top primary silver miners producing 18  of total world silver supply 

As we can see in the chart above  ExxonMobil s portion of total world liquid oil production is that tiny sliver of white at the bottom of the bar graph  However  these top 10 primary silver mining companies produced 18  of total global silver mine supply last year 
Yes  it is true that the value of liquid petroleum that ExxonMobil produced last year was much higher than the total value of silver produced by these top ten primary silver mines  but guess what    All that oil has been either burned or consumed by the market  while a good portion of that silver was acquired by investors or is used as jewelry or silverware that could be brought back into the market as a high quality STORE OF VALUE 
While oil is strategically important to our modern society  it is nothing more than a mere commodity  burned and consumed  Gone forever  On the other hand  while silver does act as a commodity due to its industrial uses  a large portion of its demand is based on investment demand  Which means  silver still functions as a store of wealth  just like it did 2 000  years ago 
When the markets finally crack and the Dow Jones Index falls off a cliff  Hedge Funds and Institutional investors will move into the precious metals with even more leverage and a greater amount of funds than what took place during the beginning of 2016  Of course  the Fed and Central Banks could postpone the market correction for a while  but the longer they do so  the harder and faster the inevitable decline 
I believe Michael Belkin s analysis is correct that there will be few decent stocks or sectors to move into when the highly inflated markets finally tank  Thus  when BIG MONEY moves in the silver market  it will cause the silver price and the silver mining shares to surge  How high will be anyone s guess 
Lastly  I wanted to compare some of the top U S  oil and gas producers market cap versus the same ten primary silver mining companies 

These top ten U S  oil companies market cap was  855 billion compared to the top ten primary silver miners at  27 billion  The combined market cap of the top U S  oil and gas producers is nearly 32 times higher than the top primary silver miners 
In the future when demand for physical silver overwhelms supply  investors will move into the next best thing   the primary silver mining shares  Because there are so few primary silver miners  any significant amount of funds moving into this sector could reach insane levels never imagined today

122322,343837,SSRM,Pretium  Canadian Golden Elephant,opinion,"Elephants are the world s largest land animals  And though there aren t many  they can still be found scattered across the planet  In the mining industry  super large sized deposits are often referred to as elephants  Like the animal  these deposits aren t all that common  But also like the animal  they can still be found 
Elephant country is somewhere miners tend to gravitate towards in their hunt for meaningful discoveries  as elephants can usually be found in herds  And one of the world s most prolific gold herds is found in British Columbia s Golden Triangle 
The Golden Triangle  also known as the Stewart district  is located in northwestern BC  I ve seen several different illustrations of this triangle drawn out on a map  but they re all very similar with the long end stretching south to north from the town of Stewart to Dease Lake  roughly 300km 
I won t go into a ton of geological detail  but the Golden Triangle resides in what is known as the Stikine terrane  It is generally believed that this terrane s hydrothermal systems were seasoned longer than most  And the effect is a cornucopia of mineralized deposits including the volcanogenic massive sulfide  alkaline porphyry copper gold  and transitional epithermal intrusion related precious metals types  This favorable geology has yielded several elephants 
The Golden Triangle has seen mineral exploration for over a century  And modern methods over the last half century or so have unearthed some of its greatest treasures  The best known as measured by yield is the famous Eskay Creek Gold Silver deposit  This Barrick run mine was once the world s highest grade gold mine  48 g t  and fifth largest silver mine by volume  Eskay Creek closed due to depletion in 2008  and over its life produced 3m  ounces of gold and 160m  ounces of silver 
While Eskay Creek was quite impressive  the Golden Triangle s largest elephants are still in the ground  Towards the north are the massive Galore Creek and Schaft Creek projects  These projects  majority owned by Novagold and Teck Resources  hold two of the world s largest undeveloped copper gold deposits  Their combined resources of 22b  poundsof copper and 21m  ouncesof gold  along with substantial byproducts of silver and other base metals  are astonishing 
Moving south closer to Stewart we find the KSM  Snowfield  and Brucejack projects  These polymetallic projects also hold a smorgasbord of metals  but with higher concentrations of gold  Seabridge Gold s KSM project is the largest of the bunch  a 70m ounce 23m pound gold copper behemoth  Snowfield and Brucejack are much smaller relatively speaking  containing around 30m ounces of gold resources each  But these elephants still rank within the top 5  globally in terms of size 
So as you can see  the Golden Triangle is host to one of the world s most robust elephant herds  But while elephants are highly desirable assets for miners to have in their portfolios  they do have their drawbacks  And the most onerous is the massive amount of capital it requires to develop them 
In order to profitably mine large lower grade polymetallic deposits  they typically need to operate on economies of scale  large scale production   Once up and running proposed operations at such projects as KSM  Galore Creek  and Schaft Creek would indeed deliver high margins profits  even at today s metals prices  But getting them up and running is no easy task since large scale mines come with large scaleprice tags 
According to the latest feasibility studies  the pre production capex required to develop each KSM  Galore Creek  and Schaft would well exceed  3b  It would be difficult to raise this kind of capital when the commodities markets are hot  And in today s environment  when commodities are highly out of favor  I suspect it would be nearly impossible 
Really the only way an elephant will see production any time soon is if it is developed on a smaller scale  thus requiring less capital investment  But while this unfortunately isn t an option for most elephants  there is a rare breed where it is  And Pretium Resources  NYSE PVG  has found this breed in its excellent Brucejack project 
Brucejack is located about 20km south of Eskay Creek  in an area that saw its first hard rock exploration about 50 years ago  Folks were excited early on  but the lower mineral grades didn t offer much intrigue on the development front  This all changed though upon the discovery of the higher grade West zone in 1980  And the operators at the time ended up putting about  40m into exploration  feasibility  and development work over the next decade or so 
Brucejack s West zone had actually seen 5 0km of underground development and was fully permitted for a mine build  But falling gold prices in the 1990s pinched its economics  and ultimately forced the operators to abandon it  Interestingly Silver Standard ended up acquiring Brucejack and the nearby Snowfield project as silver plays  And its exploration work years later uncovered this elephant s rare breed 
Former Silver Standard  NASDAQ SSRI  CEO and industry titan Robert Quartermain saw something special in the handful of holes that were drilled about 450 meters to the south of Brucejack s West zone  And his newly formed company Pretium Resources acquired the project  including Snowfield  in 2010 betting that this high grade discovery would materialize into an Eskay Creek type find 
Pretium s aggressive follow up drilling delivered one multi kilogramintersect after another  And after several years and nearly 1 000 holes  Brucejack s Valley of the Kings zone has grown to become one of the world s premier high grade gold deposits 
Per the latest resource estimate  this golden elephant contains nearly 14m ouncesof the yellow metal  More impressive than the Valley of the Kings  girth though is the quality of its ore  Core to this resource is 6 9m ounces of proven and probable reserves that grade an astounding 15 7 g t 
Pretium was able to recognize the Valley of the Kings  mining potential very early on  Its transitional epithermal gold occurrence  which is hosted in stockwork veining  had simple incomplex metallurgy  And this as well as the geological model was confirmed in a recently completed 10k metric ton bulk sampling program that pulled out 5 865 ounces of gold  thus equating to 18  g t   
The data from this bulk sampling program along with assays from additional underground drilling fed the Valley of the Kings  latest and greatest feasibility study  which was announced in June  And it revealed a mining plan with huge economic potential  even at lower gold prices 
Mining would occur via conventional underground methods  with the ore processed at an onsite mill at a rate of 2 7k metric tons per day  With anticipated mill feed grades of 14 g t and an average gold recovery of nearly 97   via gravity and flotation   VOK would produce 504k ounces per year over the first 8 years and an average of 404k ounces per year over the life of the mine  18 years  
And VOK s economics make mine development exceptionally compelling  The super high grades among many factors allow Pretium to build this large scale gold mine for only  747m  And with all in sustaining cash costs estimated at only  448 ounce  VOK would be producing its gold in the lower cost quartile of industry average 
At  1100 gold this mine comes with an after tax internal rate of return of 29  and a sub 3 year capital payback period  With figures like these  I suspect Pretium won t have a problem procuring construction financing  And it is now pushing forward with the ever important permitting process  the final step to be completed before closing on financing and mobilizing for construction 
Ultimately with VOK s straightforward process flow  small footprint  and minimal environmental impact as well as Pretium s good standing with the regulators and locals  there isn t expected to be any problems procuring the necessary permits  PVG anticipates the receipt of final permits in H1 2015  And following a production decision and financing  it hopes to be building this mine by mid year 
If all goes according to plan the Valley of the Kings will pour its first gold in 2017  easily beating out the rest of the Golden Triangle elephants to producerdom  This is one of the most highly anticipated development projects not only in Canada  but in the world  And if Pretium executes as it hopes  investors are likely in store for a highly profitable ride 
The best way for investors to play Pretium s bright future is via its stock  And like nearly all precious metals stocks  PVG has had a rough ride amidst gold s post apex consolidation and ongoing cyclical bear market as you can see in the chart below  But this beaten down state offers what may prove one of the best PVG buying opportunities ever seen 

Pretium s stay in the stock markets has mostly been fraught with peril  And this peril was a symptom of gold s bear market behavior following its Q3 2011 all time nominal high  Despite the last few years being its most successful as it grew its elephant  PVG couldn t break away from gold s oppressive downtrend 
A junior mining company without cash flow is obviously more susceptible to downward pressure than its producing counterparts  so PVG leveraged gold to the downside  But on the rare occasions over the last few years when gold did show signs of life  it usually provided investors with great positive leverage 
Since its 2011 high gold has had four meaningful uplegs  And in three of them PVG performed like a champion  In the Q1 2012  Q3 2013  and Q1 2014 uplegs PVG positively leveraged gold s 16 6  average gain by 3 3x  with a 55 1  average gain of its own  It didn t perform so well in gold s Q3 2012 upleg  But since this was endemic of nearly the entire mining stock sector  we ll chalk it up as an anomaly 
Pretium really is poised to pop as soon as gold pulls out of its funk  It showed incredible strength to soar 200  off its 2013 low in this weak market  And I suspect we ll see positive leverage much better than we ve seen in recent years once investors return  They ll find a mining company vastly different than what it looked like the last time gold had a bull run  And they ll want to get a piece of what has grown to become one of the world s finest undeveloped gold deposits 
Given their risk reward paradigms  Pretium Resources and the top gold juniors are in line to outperform the entire PM sector once gold gets rolling  And now is a great time to make the ultimate contrarian bet while they are still universally loathed  Yes the pool of quality juniors has diminished amidst the recent carnage  but there are still plenty of good ones out there 
At Zeal we help investors zero in on the good ones with our popular sector reports  Our two most recent reports pulled from extensive proprietary research on the universe of gold juniors that trade in the US and Canada  And we narrowed the pool down to 24 producers and advanced stage explorers that are poised to lead the way  Buy your reports today to have Pretium and the detailed fundamental profiles of our 23 other favorite junior gold stocks at your fingertips

The bottom line is pretium is the Latin word for  value   And this is precisely what Pretium Resources will give shareholders as it advances its Golden Triangle elephant  PVG has determined that Brucejack s high grade core can be developed at a reasonable cost  And the latest mining plan outlines an operation with huge potential for profits even at lower gold prices 
Pretium is currently awaiting permitting before it can pull the trigger on its mine build  And amidst pre development work it will continue to explore a Valley of the Kings deposit that remains open to the east and west along strike and at depth  PVG s near term prospects are sure to capture investors  attention once gold turns around  And it ought to be one of the top performers as capital chases the sector elites ",2014-11-02,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pretium:-canadian-golden-elephant-231047,231047

122332,343847,SSRM,Mexico s Silver Production Declined Over Past 2 Years,opinion,"In a surprising update  the world largest silver producer actually experienced a decline in silver mine supply over the past two years  This is quite remarkable as several analysts and official sources reported or perceived that Mexico continued to shown an increase in silver production  I wrote about this in my precious article  Biggest Silver Supply Losers for 2015 
In that article  I showed how the  reported a growth in Mexican silver production  Jan Aug  this year  while the official data from Mexico s INEGI published a decline  I contacted the folks at World Metals Statistics  and they replied by saying they were looking at different figures and didn t realize Mexico s INEGI had updated their data  Since that article  the World Metals Statistics revised their figures and now show a decline in Mexican silver production  Jan Aug  
While World Metals Statistics and the GFMS Team at Thomson Reuters show an estimated decline in Mexican silver production in 2015  they will have to revise their data lower for 2014 as well  Why  Because Mexican silver production has been falling for the past two years  
I decided to write this article in response to Smaulgld s newest pieced called   

Peak silver doesn t seem to be coming to Mexico  the world s largest silver mining country  Primary silver miners with operations in Mexico and the U S  are reporting increases in silver mining production and some cases  record production 

The folks at Smaulgld then published data from several primary silver mining companies showing increased or record Q3 production compared to the same quarter last year  While some of these mines did show an increase in Q3 production  their overall production for the year was lower 
For example  Pan American silver did show a rise in Q3 silver production of 7  compared to Q3 2014  however their total production  Q1 Q3  is actually down a little from 19 37 million oz  Moz  in 2014 versus 19 33 Moz during the first nine months in 2015  Furthermore  one of the companies Smaulgld used in their example  Silver Standard Resources Inc  O SSRI   is not even located in North America  Silver Standard s Pirquitas Mine is operating in Argentina 
Now  I am not trying to NIT PICK here  just trying to provide the public with the correct facts and data  Smaugld also stated in the title of their article  their was   Well  if we look at the facts provided by Mexico s INEGI  silver production in country has fallen from a peak in 2013 

According to Mexico  s Instituto Nacional de Estad stica y Geograf a  INEGI   Mexico s silver production peaked in 2013 at 5 821 metric tons  mt   fell to 5 765 mt in 2014 and is estimated to decline to 5 634 mt in 2015  Even though some primary silver mining companies are showing increases in 2015  some are suffering losses  This low price is impacting the higher cost marginal mines in Mexico 
To provide actual proof of Mexico s declining silver production  here is the spreadsheet downloaded directly from the Mexican Government INEGI website 

The spreadsheet starts in 1986  so I just highlighted the last three years  The silver production figures are shown in kilograms  The totals for the year are highlighted in yellow  What the data tells us is this  Mexican silver production continues to decline even though some primary silver miners are experiencing growth 
If we convert these metric ton silver production figures to troy oz  this is the result 
Mexico Silver Production 2013 2015 est 
2013   187  1 Moz
2014   185 3 Moz
2015   181 1 Moz Est
If Mexico estimated silver production falls to 181 Moz in 2015  it will be down 6 Moz  or 3  from its peak in 2013 
Has Mexico Peaked In Silver Production  
Now  this is the ultimate question  Has the world s largest silver producing country peaked  Maybe  maybe not  it depends  There are several new Mexican mines slated to come online to bring on more silver production in the next several years  Fresnillo  L FRES  LLC  the world s largest primary silver mining company in Mexico is forecasting to increase production to 60 65 Moz by 2018  up from 44 45 Mo in 2015 
While these new mines may bring on new silver supply  it may not add to Mexico s total production  Why  because Fresnillo LLC newest Saucito Mine  brought online in 2009   silver production is offsetting the declines in its flagship Fresnillo Mine  The Fresnillo Mine produced 38 Moz of silver in 2009  but will fall to 15 16 Moz in 2015  So  even though the newer Saucito Mine may produce 21 Moz in 2015  the Fresnillo Mine silver production has fallen 22 Moz since 2009  Basically  the new mine offset the decline in the other 
NOTE  Fresnillo LLC has several silver and gold mines It s old flagship Fresnllo Mine is just one of them 
I believe this will continue to take place as older and more high cost marginal mines suffer production declines  That being said  I don t think Mexican silver production has peaked  but that depends on several factors going forward  I will discuss these in future articles 
Lastly  the folks at Smaulgld need to look at more data before making assumptions that may or may not be true  As for 2015  Mexican silver production continues to decline from its peak in 2013  even though some primary silver miners are experiencing some growth 
Global peak silver production is coming  or is here   However  that all depends on what happens in 2016 and its impact on the base metal mining industry  The base metal mining industry  zinc lead   copper  supplies 58  of world silver supply ",2016-01-13,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mexico’s-silver-production-declined-over-past-two-years-379753,379753

be pretty dramatic  A weakening U S  economy would be bullish for gold because it s bullish for continued QE  and that s the real factor for gold going forward  TGR  Besides the jobs numbers and the Fed meeting minutes  what indicators are you watching to get some insight into whether the economy really is improving  BL  People need to listen to the Fed  The Fed is trying to be more open and transparent  despite the typical central banker doublespeak  But it is looking at two numbers right now  jobs and inflation  The jobs number is predominant because every indicator that economists currently use to measure inflation is showing no significant inflation  Now  the consumer price index  CPI  is not the CPI of our fathers  and it has been jiggered here and there to underreport price inflation  Regardless  until we start seeing price inflation in the CPI  the Fed will be more conducive to easing  The unemployment numbers  however  are where we ll see some real action or perhaps some tapering if the unemployment rate starts to improve  TGR  What s your take on the price behavior in the precious metals markets  Where do we go from here  BL  I think the big price action that s happened in gold over the last six weeks or so is a big revelation  It has revealed the character of the modern gold market  which has developed into a West versus East or paper gold versus real gold market  In the West  there are speculators who invest in the future exchanges primarily  They are more concerned about the short term direction for gold and the other precious metals  The future exchanges are really nothing more than an opinion poll on the price of gold  It s not really a place where real metal gets bought and sold but  rather  the futures market is a place to trade derivatives  In a real sense  it is fractional reserve investing  In mid April  when we had the big smackdown in gold  over 400 tons sold on the Comex  In a matter of an hour or two the amount of metal sold exceeded  by over 100 tons  the amount of gold in the Comex warehouse  The Comex trading on that day had no relation to the physical markets  Conversely  the price drop resulting from that selloff spurred physical demand throughout the world  but particularly in price sensitive markets in Asia  One of the things people looked at throughout all of this was the big drawdown in the exchange traded funds  ETFs  of physical gold  Since the beginning of the year  the remarkable drawdown in the ETFs amounted to around 370 tonnes of gold  Over that same timeframe  I estimate that more than 600 tonnes of gold have been consumed in China alone  And that doesn t include the huge demand in India or the rest of Asia  It also doesn t include the surging physical demand for gold in the Western markets or the renewed central bank demand  If you add it all up  I think that price smash in April did nothing but increase global gold demand  TGR  How does an investor get data on increased physical consumption worldwide  BL  It s tough  I ve tried to compile these numbers many times before  You get some information from the World Gold Council  Now  you get some information from the Shanghai Gold Exchange  which  although it s a futures market  represents more of a physical market in China  You look at imports through Hong Kong into China  Indian import data is more difficult  And you have anecdotal reports of demand  The World Gold Council is the only group that actually tries to sum up all of these totals  and it doesn t offer much in the way of real time information  So it s really tough  but there are seasonal trends that investors or retail investors need to keep in mind  Unfortunately  although we ve had tremendous physical demand providing an underpinning for the market recently  we re entering the seasonal slow period of early to mid summer for physical gold demand  One of my concerns is that as physical demand lessens  we may see some resulting price weakness in gold  TGR  That was the commodity  but what about the miners  During this pullback  have most miners mirrored the underlying commodity  BL  Yes  mirrored and magnified  The good thing about the mining equities is that they tend to leverage the moves in gold and silver  The bad news is that they tend to leverage the moves in gold and silver  In this cycle  as the metals have dropped  the equities have absolutely been lambasted  I tell my readers that there is too much uncertainty in the near term  The longer term picture remains very bright for the metals because the world s governments are going to continue to float their economies on an ocean of new liquidity for the foreseeable future  So the fundamental economic backdrop for gold and  ultimately  the equities remains bullish  But in the near term  especially as we get into the seasonal slow period for physical demand  too much risk exists out there  I m advising people to keep their heads low  be patient and wait for mid to late summer before they make any new purchases  TGR  It s a little bit of a risk off trade for the mining equities  Does that mean you are weighted toward producers rather than explorers  BL  In a very general sense  the producers will benefit much more quickly from a rebound in the precious metals  With that said  there are specific juniors that are hot on the trail of big  new discoveries and or are expanding discoveries with the drill bit right now  The juniors have always been more of a news driven sector  So looking at the broad sector  it will take a while for enthusiasm to filter down through the producers  through the majors and down to the juniors  but specific companies could have significant and company making news in that meantime  TGR  You mentioned juniors and then producers  One company that has attributes of both that you have followed for a long time is New Gold Inc   NGD TSX  NGD NYSE MKT   It was a junior several years ago  and grew into a midtier  It recently acquired Rainy River Resources Ltd  Is this the start of a new trend in consolidation in the sector  BL  I hope so  but New Gold is kind of a special case  It s a very well run  very aggressive company  Our readers in Gold Newsletter have benefitted from that for years  as that company has been one of our recommended producers  It is much more aggressive than the rest of the producer flock  but that s really not saying a lot because nobody has been very aggressive recently  I hope it s the beginning of a trend  but New Gold has always been a bit of a special case  It has been able to move quickly to secure companies and projects that have turned out to be very economic  You see the opposite by some of the larger majors having reached  in the past  too far and too aggressively and paid too high a price for projects that did not turn out to be as economic  I m very bullish on New Gold  and I do hope it s the beginning of a trend  TGR  What are your thoughts on silver  BL  I m very bullish on silver  Silver offers optionality to gold  Silver equities offer optionality to silver  so you can really get a lot of bang for the buck through some really well run  well positioned silver producers  I like Silver Standard Resources Inc   SSO TSX  SSRI NASDAQ   SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT   Endeavour Silver Corp   EDR TSX  EXK NYSE  EJD FSE  and Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TSX  GPL NYSE MKT   There is a nice selection of companies out there on the smaller end of the scale  companies that have good  solid production growth profiles  TGR  Do you have a forecast or an expectation of silver prices  BL  Not to any decimal places  but silver will track gold  And silver will move more quickly than gold in whatever direction gold is headed  I m bullish on gold  so I have to be bullish on silver  TGR  Across the industry  pundits are talking about the death of the junior mining sector  Is the death of the junior mining sector exaggerated  BL  I don t think the junior sector is dead  although it may be comatose  The thing that will surprise the people who are waiting for further and further levels of capitulation in the junior market is how quickly this market can wake up  I ve seen worse days  If you look in the late 1990s and even the very early 1990s or late 1980s  you ll see times when the market was comparatively worse off  In those days  the financing infrastructure was limited relative to where it is today  Since then  capital markets have matured  With the money available from the previous rounds of QE  a lot of money is available to come into the junior market when that market turns around  TGR  Positives include financial infrastructure  a large investor community  positive fundamentals and money on the sidelines  BL  Absolutely  but first we need a turnaround in prices to start a rally  TGR  For juniors  where do you see good risk reward opportunities now  BL  I see the best investments in the sector on a case by case basis  I don t do a lot of macro level analysis because once you start off with the big picture  then drill down to a more focused picture and down to the project level  there are lots of places to make false assumptions  Rather than top down  I like to take things on a story by story basis and see if a company  particularly in the juniors  has a shot at finding an economic deposit  That analysis is somewhat independent of the global economic picture  A good deposit or a great deposit can overcome a lot of other problems  With that said  I m turning more bullish on uranium lately  After looking at that story  I believe that we re going to go into a supply deficit toward the end of this year or early next year  That s a very powerful story that we ll start seeing develop over the coming months  TGR  The big player in uranium is Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE   which has a large majority of the production globally  Apart from it  most of the other players are explorers  Does that mean that you re interested in uranium explorers  BL  To some degree  as I say  the ones that have very good individual stories  The last time we had a really rollicking bull market in uranium and uranium juniors was about five years ago  They called it uranimania back then  and any company that had some version of the word uranium in its name and its property position could have a  20 million   20M  market cap  The companies that have survived from then are the better run companies with the better prospects  and a number of them are in production or are about to get into production  So they are very highly exposed to the uranium price  Uranium Energy Corp   UEC NYSE MKT  is one  as is Uranerz Energy Corp   URZ TSX  URZ NYSE MKT   On the exploration front are the Alpha Minerals Inc   AMW TSX V  and Fission Uranium Corp   FCU TSX V  stories  And I think that s going to get much bigger  One of the better stories out there  and a story many are overlooking  is Kivalliq Energy Corp   KIV TSX V   TGR  You re not concerned  with the names that you just mentioned  that near term or short term new production will come on line to flood the market  BL  No  I don t think that a big flood of new production will swamp the market  at least not enough to overcome the deficit position  The Highly Enriched Uranium agreement with Russia that s ending this year is going to take 15 20 million pounds off the market and most likely put the global market into a significant deficit position  TGR  Besides uranium  you like the fundamentals for platinum  Do you want to talk about that  BL  I cover Prophecy Platinum Corp   NKL TSX V  PNIKF OTCPK  P94P FSE   Where else in the world do you have a high grade  bulk mineable  platinum palladium project  There isn t one  especially in a geopolitically reliable region  Wellgreen is an extraordinary project  plus  platinum and palladium have positive fundamentals that are tremendously powerful right now  The key to that project is that the preliminary economic assessment  PEA  that came out was good and was economic  However  the size of the project assumed in the PEA presented challenges  It was neither small and quick to production nor large enough to bring long term production forward  It was right in the middle and showed a mine life of 37 years  For Wellgreen to work best  it needs to be either much larger or significantly smaller than what the PEA showed  In this market  I think it needs to rework that plan to show it as a smaller project with lower capital expense and  therefore  a much higher rate of return  With that said  it s still very large and still has the potential to grow significantly with this season s drill targets  The deposit has a lot of allure for a major company  TGR  What would Wellgreen s path to production look like  BL  Prophecy itself could develop and finance a smaller project focused on some higher grade starter pit scenarios  and it has gone a long way in trying to identify those starter pits  It could end up joint venturing with a major to develop a slightly larger scenario or it could get sold off to a major for a much larger scenario  TGR  You also cover several companies with projects in Mexico  What are the highlights there  BL  Mexico is a great place geologically and a fairly good place politically  The country has a long history of mining and mining laws are well established  The business climate helps companies work and secure land title  Its more streamlined path to production is a great benefit to the smaller producers  Mexico offers a lot of great opportunities and many discoveries are yet to be found  TGR  Any specific names  BL  I like   For a junior  Cayden offers a lot to like  including a good share structure and money in the bank  The company sold a small portion of its project in the Guerrero Gold Belt to  for approximately  16M  That will fund exploration on its primary projects for the next two years  One highlight is the El Barque o project  which is showing impressive trench results  including 21 meters at 8 3 grams per ton  Cayden should be able to start drilling that target in the near term  TGR  You also watch companies in the Yukon  The latest Yukon gold rush  which started in 2009  brought high expectations that haven t been fulfilled  Can you give us an update  Are there some exploration opportunities that have stood the test of time  BL  When the Yukon erupted with Underworld Resources Inc  s Golden Saddle discovery  Gold Newsletter was the only publication to recommend Underworld  and we did it before that discovery  It turned out to be a very profitable experience for our readers  Along with a couple of other projects  Golden Saddle really ignited a gold rush in the Yukon  Along the way  there were some speed bumps  People didn t realize how long it takes to develop prospects and get them to drill ready status  In that environment  the shortened drill season affects project speed you can only explore one season a year  As a result  development has taken longer  and it is much more difficult than people had imagined  When you combine the slow project progress in the Yukon with the correction in the junior market  the net result is that some companies that have already made discoveries are selling for fractions of what their ultimate worth will be  One example of this is  with its Coffee project  At today s prices  it represents real value  Eventually  I believe it will be taken out at a multiple to today s price  I m interested in and have been recommending  as well  I m a fairly large shareholder in the company  Comstock s project is interesting for many reasons  including that it may be an extension off the same structure as Underworld s Golden Saddle discovery  It had interesting drill results last year  Comstock is following up with its VG zone this year and  hopefully  will be able to advance some of other targets to drill ready status before the season is over  TGR  If investors were looking for  in the best possible sense  the next Yukon or the next underappreciated region that has potential to be a world class district  where would they look  BL  Let me share some of the key takeaways of going through a few cycles in the precious metals market  One of the things we saw in the early 1990s was the perception of a revolution of freedom across the world  New regions opened to modern mineral exploration  Two examples were Southeast Asia and Indonesia and then came the Bre X scandal  Another example was Venezuela and then came the leftist Hugo Chavez  The Next Big Thing is a moving target  Success breeds  in some cases  envy and expropriation  I stress to investors that they don t need to be pioneers it s the pioneers who get the arrows in the back  Investors don t have to take on added geopolitical risk when we have well positioned companies with proven deposits and proven exploration teams that are selling at huge historic discounts  TGR  Is there anything else you want to say  BL  Looking at the general market  the concern I have right now is that we re beginning to see speculative demand in the West come back into gold  We re beginning to see some short covering by Western speculators  While that is positive in the short term  we may see a falloff in physical demand as we get into summer  I m not sure that the strong physical demand that we re seeing now will be handed off in an orderly fashion to the Western speculators  If so  we could have some further weakness in gold going into midsummer  And that s why I am targeting around the end of July as a good time for investors to come back into the market and pick up some bargains  TGR  I noticed that you have expanded the scope of attendees that you are welcoming to the next New Orleans Conference  As Father s Day approaches  can you talk about this  BL  A few weeks ago  I was on the phone with   the CEO of U S  Global Investors  discussing ideas for the next New Orleans Investment Conference  Frank came up with an idea that hit me like a thunderclap  Let parents bring their kids to the conference for free  I love the idea  This would encourage more attendees to bring along their kids  to show them the benefits of free markets  expose them to the constant threats to their liberty  reveal the hidden dangers of on going monetary debasement and teach them how to protect their money and freedoms  I m always searching for ways to expand our unique experience and outlook to younger people who rarely get exposed to the free market ideals that we promote  We wrapped up the idea as a limited time special opportunity between Mother s Day and Father s Day  but I decided to extend it through the end of June  And  incidentally  it also applies to children who want to bring along their parents  Interested investors need to call our offices at 800 648 8411 to take advantage of this special opportunity  TGR  That s a great way to get the next

122386,343901,SSRM,What  Exactly Does  Quasi Oversold  Mean ,opinion,T2108 Status  57 8 VIX Status  14 7General  Short term  Trading Call  HoldCommentary The S P 500 came roaring back yesterday from   The index reversed all those losses and closed the day with a 1 3  gain  T2108 did not increase as much as I would have expected on such a rally  and it fell three percentage points short of recovering all of its losses from Monday  a few stocks are getting left behind in this bounce    Given I am still targeting an imminent retest of the 50DMA for the S P 500  I went ahead and reloaded on ProShares Ultra S P 500 ETF  SSO  puts  This trade is not technically a T2108 trade given the indicator has not yet flipped to overbought  The trade is also particularly aggressive given a new month starts in just two days  the start of months tend to produce large upside performances  Moreover  the VIX is in full retreat again  After pulverizing three levels of resistance on Monday  the VIX is now already resting on the first level of  former  resistance  the 50DMA   The VIX is once again below the critical 15 32 level and is in danger of more meandering toward its multi year lows My losses on VXX shares exceeded the gains on VXX puts and proved that I did not buy enough puts on the VIX spike  Clearly  I still have some fine tuning to do on that VXX trading strategy This bounce also had me wondering even more whether I need to take the concept of  quasi oversold  even more seriously  On Monday  T2108 dropped 20  in one day  almost as much as the two day drop that proceeded the one day bounce in the S P 500 that I accurately foretasted last week  This time around  I waved off the possibility even though the VIX spiked in historical proportions   11 all time    I simply lacked the trifecta of strong signals that I had last week  but maybe  just maybe  the large spike in the VIX was enough My preliminary analysis has not yet uncovered a smoking gun for quasi oversold  First  there is absolutely no correlation between the daily change in T2108 and the subsequent daily change in the S P 500  This holds true even when I filter to days where T2108 declines or even to just those days when T2108 declines by 10  or more or even when T2108 declines on two consecutive days  I also found no correlation when looking at occurrences where T2108 declined for two days and ended up between overbought and oversold extremes  Again  no correlation when I further filtered to 2 day declines of 15  or more  In all these cases  I also looked at the percentage of up versus down days  Based on history  there was a 56  chance last week of the S P 500 trading up after last week s steep 2 day decline in T2108  That is enough for a trading edge over a long period of time  but I am looking for a much stronger performance to justify creating a whole new trading strategy for T2108 This all left me scratching my head  wondering what to make of all this  Was last week s call pure luck or did the extra context provide true determining factors  I think it was context  And I think this week I overly discounted the context of an extreme in the VIX  My next step for the quasi oversold analysis is to combine daily changes in the VIX to see whether that adds more color  Stay tuned  For the techies out there  note that I tried a classification algorithm on the dataset  rpart in R   This too provided no insight  I am taking a class in data mining and hope to use such techniques to further refine the study and trading on T2108  Finally  the currency markets have bounced away from the edge of a major bearish swoon  Most notably  the Australian dollar bounced back strongly on Wednesday after cracking the 1 02 mark  The Aussie is still holding tight to the 2010 2011 closing levels  The yen has also refused to follow through on Sunday Monday s strengthening  In fact  all the yen pairs are now printing what look like sustainable bottoms  Most notably  USD JPY held its 50DMA  I am watching the currency markets even more closely than usual for early clues on the market s short term sentiment Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Disclosure  long VXX shares and puts  long SSO puts  long USD JPY  short AUD USD,2013-02-28,Dr. Duru,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/what,-exactly-does-'quasi-oversold'-mean-157132",157132
122390,343905,SSRM,When You Think Your Exchange Traded Fund Is Broken ,opinion,Frequently I see people complaining that their Exchange Traded Fund  ETF  or Exchange Traded Note  ETN  is broken  Occasionally they re right  but most of the time they re not  Before complaining  here are some things to look at  Are you looking at the right index All Exchange Traded Products  ETPs  track an index  which is identified in their prospectus  and in the fund s fact sheet  Don t assume what the index is  For example  the index that VXX tracks is not the    and  the 2X volatility fund is not designed to track 2X the VIX None of the volatility funds track the VIX  they all use other indexes  because the VIX itself is not investable  Some funds  e g   UVXY  CVOL  do a semi decent job of tracking the VIX in the short term  but nobody does a good job in the medium to long run  In fact it s a killing field Investigate the index once you ve determined what it is  It s often not easy  sometimes even getting quotes on indexes is hard  But similar to the hunter s credo of eating what they kill  investors should understand what they trade Is the fund leveraged geared  e g   2X  3X   or an inverse fund Leveraged or inverse funds typically do a good job of delivering their target performance on a daily basis  but usually fall far short with longer time frames  The reason is compounding error  or path dependency  It erodes the value of these funds in choppy markets For example if a non leveraged fund  e g   SPY  goes up 10  one day and down 9 09  the next it ends up even  However the 2X fund  SSO  and the inverse fund  SH  both end up down 1 8 2X Fund   10  2 10   12  12  2  9 09     9 82 1X Fund   10    10    9  9    9 09     9 82In strongly trending markets compounding errors can boost the return of a leveraged   inverse fund beyond its multiplier  What are the timestamps of the quotes you are looking at Unless your fund is very active the quote you re using might be older than you think  For example the fund s closing value might reflect a trade that happened hours before market close  If you look at an intra day chart of your fund including volume you should be able to see when the trades occurred and the quotes updated  Typically the intraday indicative value   IV   quote is a more accurate way of getting the actual fund value  It s updated every 15 seconds during market hours The IV quote tickers are not standardized  Yahoo finance uses a     prefix and a   IV  suffix to get the IV value  e g    VXX IV  Are the markets you re comparing closing at the same time VIX futures markets at the CBOE Futures exchange trade for 15 minutes after the equities markets close  The volatility ETPs are based on volatility indexes that are based on futures settlement values so their IV value at 4 15 ET is the real closing value for the volatility funds Is the trading value of the funds diverging significantly from its index or IV value If this is the case  your fund might be broken  but before we pursue that there are a couple thing to check Are the markets for the underlying assets closed  e g   Asian or European stocks   If so those indexes can t update so some divergence during USA trading hours should be expected Are the securities for the underlying assets illiquid or rarely traded  e g   high yield corporate bonds   If so the trading value might reflect the market s estimation of what those assets are worth  rather than the last trade  or published bid ask quotations If you ve checked through all the items above and things still look wrong  your fund may indeed be broken  Historically the only pathology for ETF ETNs is to have their share creation process halted or somehow limited  Some of the stated reasons for doing this are  Market closures  e g   the Egyptian stock market closed for 2 months in 2011 which had a serious effect on the Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF  EGPT Regulatory hurdles  where permission to issue new shares is delayed the United States Natural Gast ETF  UNG   United States 12 Month Natural Gas ETF  UNL   United States Short Oil ETF  DNO Issuer  internal limits on the size of ETNs   VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX ST ETN  TVIX Commodity position limits  where the exchanges won t allow the funds to accumulate more contracts  UNGSelf imposed market cap limits  JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN  AMJ In all these cases the share redemption process has been left intact  In practice if share creation is stopped and redemption is working  the ETP s price can rise higher than the index  but not drop significantly lower than the index  Both UNG and TVIX were expensive object lessons for the people that didn t understand this  NYSE EURONEXT has a good  that lists all the funds that currently have suspended or put limits on

122419,343934,SSRM,Roger Wiegand s Method Of Precious Metals Investing,opinion,The major financial markets are dominated by large funds that behave like lemmings follow the herd and suffer the consequences  Investors should not fall for the commonly held myth that all professionals have an edge over smaller institutional and individual investors  In this exclusive Gold Report interview  Roger Wiegand  editor of Trader Tracks Newsletter  discusses the criteria he uses to select the best mining and exploration companies  He then explains how moderate trading within a mostly buy and hold portfolio can lead to superior returns without the downsides that lemming behavior can cause  The Gold Report  We are going to talk about  lemming investing   the theme of your most recent newsletter  Who or what are lemmings and how does their behavior drive the market  Roger Wiegand  The lemmings that drive the market primarily are the big funds  typically mutual funds that manage 401 k  and individual retirement accounts  Most of those funds are set up on a buy and hold basis  There are hedge funds with lemming behavior as well  but the hedge funds are more often traders  They are creating a track record of lemming investing as well because of their huge size billions and billions of dollars  The other sector of the market is the retail investor  with approximately 30  of the market  The lemming investor market would be most all of the funds and all of the smaller investor s money  The large funds primarily invest money for the smaller investors  being the lemmings   They really control what s going on  and they compose 70  of the market  And they do  in fact  establish the trend  Non lemming investors are those with large accounts who trade for their own pockets and the pockets of the seven figure and larger trader investors  This is the sector leading driving the market with mutual fund managers investing lemming money  TGR  In your recent newsletters  you discuss commonly held investment myths  Near the top of the list was that the largest  professionals  always have special insight unavailable to smaller professionals and individuals  Is that what you re stating here  RW  That s correct  The reason we wrote the article about the lemmings is that we think the old paradigm of buy and hold forever is not a good way to go  That s not to say that you can t buy stocks and hold them for an extended period  What we like people to do on our recommendations in our Trader Tracks Newsletter is to purchase stocks on a buy and hold basis and then trade in and out up to twice a year based upon the two annual cycle changes  One of those  of course  would be to sell in May and go away  The other would be the re entry after the summer  but then you have to deal with the September October period when the stock markets tend to have a risk of large corrections  We called the correction this fall  and we hit it right on the day  We said it would be on Sept  24  It was a mild correction  In other words  the buying stopped  and prices fell a bit  The presidential election is interfering with market direction right now  People are confused as to what may or may not happen  We have the overriding negative problems of a slowdown in Asia  a major slowdown in Europe and a mild slowdown in the U S  The U S  broader stock market has generally been holding up pretty well  We think that it will be propped up and levitated at least until the voting is over on Nov  6  After that  reality may hit home in many markets depending upon who is elected president  I don t think it realistically matters in the short term in any way  except for the psychology of the market  While there will clearly be an impact  it is not clear what that impact will be  Wall Street favors a Romney election but historically the markets have done better after a Democrat has been elected  This time is indeed different on numerous factors  Resolution of the European debt situation is also adding to the overall market indecisiveness  Spain and some of the other neighboring countries have serious problems and we don t fully know how bad is bad  Since we talked on this interview  new meetings and media outflow from Europe tell us they are frightened and afraid to remark on the true status  However  the International Monetary Fund stated a very dire warning on Oct  8  2012  using the word  alarming   TGR  So the lemming behavior you re witnessing now is that the larger funds deploying capital are ignoring or glossing over the major macroeconomic problems worldwide  RW  The big players understand fundamental problems  but they also have so much power that they can move the market  for example  by buying the S P 500 for market support  Other strategies they use to keep markets artificially high include not selling off entire positions or very selective selling of the weakest issues  The funds can also protect long positions by buying put options  They have been doing this for years and have a lot of computing power to back up their analysis  For example  if they felt the market was going to sell off 10  in October  they would want to buy options to the extent they could cover themselves on just that 10   That sounds like a lot of money  but it s not really because the puts are leveraged  This is like buying an insurance policy to protect the overall investments  TGR  You advocate a  modified  buy and hold strategy to your subscribers  That is  a traditional buy and hold strategy with seasonal trading  Does that mean you are biased toward the long side with minimal short exposure  RW  That s correct  We like to trade  We trade both stock and futures  and we prefer the long side  Occasionally  we will short  Our short trades haven t been bad  but they haven t produced the kinds of returns we have gotten on the long side  Our strategy is focused on the long side  When we see downside pressure coming  we recommend put options  profit taking and scaling back positions to reduce exposure and lock in profits  Once the correction is done  we go back in and buy  TGR  This month s newsletter had a multi decade chart of the Wilshire 5000  which you called bearish  Are you negative on equities in general  RW  The Wilshire is getting near a peak  and that chart is a very long  yearly  chart  I prefer to use monthlies for the big picture  The monthly is telling us we have a bear market in front of us  The question is how much of a bear market is it  I m not totally against stocks  but our preference is in precious metals and energy stocks  as well as some currencies  I believe we are in a rotation away from junior stocks and moving toward intermediates  That doesn t mean there aren t good juniors out there  We have many good juniors in our newsletter and on our list  and we do prefer them  But we also suggest that people trade them and be very selective  TGR  What is your strategy with juniors  RW  We look for the junior explorers with these criteria  1  Superior management  2  Well financed   Juniors in the fall of 2012 need to be well financed because if a junior company has to go back into the market and raise more capital  it could be vulnerable   If it s sitting with enough cash to work with a burn rate that will help it manage the business for two or three years  I think it is going to be in good shape  We have several stocks in that category in the newsletter  3  Good geopolitics and geography  We ve gotten very selective about geopolitics and geography  There is much of the world where we prefer not to go anymore  We currently favor most of Canada  part of Alaska  northeast Nevada  and we like Mexico  It is a relatively short list  4  Proximity to a major operator  This is really important  If you re going to hang on to a junior stock and a company follows the rules  we really prefer that it s sitting next door or in close proximity to a senior miner that s in operation  Mine building is tough work  It is best to follow a successful company that has worked out the infrastructure and politics  We all know what s happened to the cost of building mines and infrastructure over the last 6 to 12 months  One of my suggested companies had an initial estimate of  95 million  M  to build its mine  It went back and reconfigured it then all of a sudden  95M became  440M  That s a drastic increase due to inflation  availability of money and many other factors  If you have the first three criteria worked out  this point becomes critical   you need an obvious buyer for that property  We have had several examples of this situation that have worked out quite nicely    TGR  Having a built in exit strategy for a junior is a great way to cap off a winning investment  How about entry strategies  Are you more interested in silver or gold at present    RW  We like both  From a futures trading standpoint  gold may be easier  However  given the high gold to silver ratio  there is probably more upside in the silver market  For stocks  there are a lot of companies to choose from  Because we spend a lot of time analyzing these companies  we are comfortable recommending silver juniors for greater leverage  But we have some gold companies that are doing exceedingly well  too    TGR  Are there specific companies that you think highlight all these points  management  financing  geopolitics and exit strategy in the precious metals sector    RW  I have several that I know well  The first is a fairly new one for us Global Minerals Ltd   CTG TSX V  DPF FSE   It has a property in Eastern Europe  which is out of our preferred geography  but I would call this a  special situation  on that criterion  Global is located in Slovakia  which is not only Westernized  it is also mining friendly  Global Minerals has an old mine that has millions of ounces of silver  The mine was inoperative  but is being re opened and dewatered  It has expanded underground exploration and is increasing resources  The development is progressing nicely  We got on it at approximately  0 30 share  The last I saw  it s about  0 44 share  It has so much metal in that mine  and all the conditions are set up for a great operation mining friendly community  good country  a lot of good things going on    TGR  Are there any companies closer to your mostly North American geography criterion that you think are interesting    RW  One of our favorites is Pretium Resources Inc   PVG TSX  PVG NYSE   We know the management  We know the property  Robert Quartermain is the president and CEO of the company  He completed very successful development projects with Silver Standard Resources Inc   SSO TSX  SSRI NASDAQ   He bought these Pretium properties from Silver Standard and is building up Pretium  Next door is Seabridge Gold Inc   SEA TSX  SA NYSE MKT  with 42 million ounces  Moz  gold Proven  There is no senior miner in that district  I believe that a senior will come in and buy Seabridge and Pretium all in a package  I think that it s looking like probably a minimum size of 50 Moz gold  if not more  Pretium is well financed and has extremely strong management with great experience  It went in there with a plan this last summer  with 50 geologists and engineers  three helicopters  and it was planning 70 000 meters of drilling  The company continues to find glory holes in that property  When Pretium bought it from Silver Standard  many glory holes were proven already and on the books by top geologists  Of course  Bob Quartermain is a geologist as well  We think that one could be at least a double or triple    TGR  Regarding geopolitical risk  overall  Canada is a low risk jurisdiction  but portions of British Columbia might be riskier than some people are comfortable with  Is the political climate of B C  better than most investors think  RW  I think that the question about having problems with political situations was more of a concern in past years  maybe even as recent as a year or two ago  But a lot of that is starting to fade away  I think much has to do with the fact that communities are looking for jobs  The mining industry is labor intensive  Consequently  if they can start up a mine and be successful  it s a real plum for the local community economically  Political pressure that drives job creation and tax revenue to the province is an advantage for the Pretium property    TGR  Pretium already has a large market cap  do you still think there s an upside    RW  Pretium has many advocates  A top New York analyst several months ago  when the stock was around  8 9 share  did a fine report and was looking for a price on the shares of around  33 share  We re looking at a price of about  38 share  We re not that far from where he is    TGR  What other junior companies are you keeping your eye on    RW  Another of our favorites was a junior  and it is now more of an intermediate  That is MAG Silver Corp   MAG TSX  MVG NYSE  in Mexico  MAG Silver also has joint ventures with another company on this list  Canasil Resources Inc   CLZ TSX V   MAG Silver s idea is to build a very large property position  It is looking to build a 100 Moz silver property  which would rival Pe oles  BMV PE OLES   which is one of the top miners in Mexico and the world  MAG Silver has a lot of cash  Management is composed of very smart people and is very experienced  Mexico  especially northern Mexico  is one of the top places to be for silver  We like the company  We like the whole situation  That one is a recent recommendation in our letter  We came in last July at about  8 77 share  The stock is up at around  12 share and still going up  If the silver prices continue to rise  it will continue to do better    TGR  Do most of its projects wrap up into one district play  because the company website lists many projects  How do you interpret it    RW  It has many scattered projects  but the main area of interest is really one senior type play  It is advancing several projects on its own and with partners  We just think it s a fabulous opportunity  Peter Megaw is the top geologist there  He s a colleague and a friend  a person whom I admire greatly  He has a fantastic reputation in the business and knows Mexico like the back of his hand  The company has been very responsive in explaining every facet of the project to investors and we think it s great    TGR  Any other interesting companies that you want to mention    RW  One is Timmins Gold Corp   TMM TSX V  TGD NYSE MKT   It s in northern Mexico  Bruce Bragagnolo is the CEO of that company  He has done work as an attorney with many mining companies in Vancouver for many years  Obviously  that experience showed him a lot of the pluses and minuses of the industry  and he started this company not that long ago  It is an operator  but I would call it a junior based upon price  which is running around  3 share  We recommended it back in February at  1 22 share  That particular company and that stock have been excellent for our readers  traders and investors  We ve had some of them in and out of Timmins four or five times  Some people just buy it and sit on it  If you re going to do a buy and hold  that would be one of the few that I would put in that category simply because it is a producer now  It employs about 650 people  The mine continues to expand  It has done everything right from the standpoint of starting and running a business  Timmins  management is superior  We would look for that stock to do much better  It s what I would call a good  growing stock    TGR  Would a producer be more conducive to your modified buy and hold  limited trading strategy because a producer might track the underlying bullion price closer without some of the drill result type spikes that you would see with others    RW  That s a good point  That s one of the reasons why we like Timmins  Normally  with a company like Timmins  the shares might be  10   15 or  20  but it is a young company  and it is growing quickly  But  as a producer  not just an explorer  Timmins has everything in position to continue to produce and to grow  yet is priced today somewhat like a junior company would be  It s common for us to see these junior stocks in the  1 3 range and we see a lot of growth on the upside  Its advantages include superior management  solid financing  low risk geography and being a producer  By being a producer it doesn t have to go out and raise money  even though it is priced like an explorer    TGR  All the midtier and senior miners need to start somewhere  Do you have any other examples    RW  We are excited about Gold Standard Ventures Corp   GSV TSX V  GDVXF OTCQX  in Nevada  It has a property next door to the big senior miner  Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   in the Carlin Trend  That is Newmont s Rain mine and it is doing well  Some years ago  its chief geologist told management that it was trying to buy this property  In fact  Newmont was trying to get it for 15 years  but somebody else won the prize  The group that owns it now has done a fabulous job in exploration and startup  Not only that  it hired the senior geologist from Newmont to be the consulting geologist on this project  I view the Gold Standard Ventures property as an extension of what Newmont is already mining  That s just the way it s viewed    TGR  What is the name of that district    RW  It s called the Railroad area    TGR  And it just added the Pinion property to the south of that  correct  RW  Yes  As you know  that whole region  generally for the big operators  has been an incredible producer  I can t remember the number on the amount of gold and metals they ve pulled out of that region  but it s just fabulous  It s the southern end of the Carlin Trend  Another point on Gold Standard Ventures  which encouraged me early on  is the fact that there s a very wealthy Canadian investor who bought in early  who owns 20  of the stock  He has a history of success in investing in these companies  By owning 20  of the stock  that stock probably isn t going to move until there is a merger  a sale or a something  Consequently  that s a big floor underneath the price of the shares  We think that one is a top opportunity  We like it a lot    TGR  Even though it ran quite a bit over the last year  you still think there s upside  RW  Yes  In our opinion as non geologists  the property could offer a lot more in values    TGR  In a situation like this  how would you build a position given that you are periodically trading your buy and hold strategy  Do you wait for pullbacks or jump in right away    RW  We wait for a pullback  Normally  when we recommend a junior company  we are looking to find in our technical work we are technicians an opportunity that appears to offer a position for the shares to appreciate 25  in three months  That s our minimum goal when we initiate a position  Sometimes the price runs faster sometimes we get 100  or more  Then you have another decision  and that is  are you going to sell part or all  But the core of the strategy is the 25  target  Over the longer view  if you had a company like Timmins  if you wanted to hold it  and that s one of the ones that I would prefer to hold  I would be looking to make at least 100   but you re probably going to have a longer timeline  You re going to have to look at maybe a year to two years  However  based upon Timmins  performance over time  they can run fast with the gold price too  TGR  You ve given the readers some really good ideas  Do you want to summarize what you think investors should keep in mind when they re trying not to be lemmings    RW  One important consideration investors need to keep in mind is the volume of trading in juniors  If you re going to sell  you re going to have to sell into strength  If you wait for a peak in gold or silver  you may not have many buyers for a junior mining stock  With certain juniors  you want to buy and hold  knowing full well you could get a 50  haircut  but then it will turn around and go right back up again  The other thing is if you buy the stock and you make a triple and you see a correction coming  it may be a good time to go in and take all the money off the table  There are also individual tax questions  and variations depending on the specific company and position  but you get the idea  I m very wary of the broader stock market for this fall for at least a  20  correction  After the election  we could encounter some very serious problems in credit and in stocks worldwide  It s no secret that some of the very wealthy people  the billionaires  are selling millions of shares of general market stock right now  Some of them have been interviewed to the extent they re afraid of another 1929 event  Nobody can really call that for sure  but as a technician  I see the charts are looking like a markets sell off after the election  Regardless  if an investor follows a well thought out strategy of stock analysis with occasional trading  that investor will outperform the large number of lemmings over time    TGR  Thanks so much for your time

122422,343937,SSRM,Rodney Steve  How To Gamble On Precious Metals Without Getting Ruined ,opinion,Rodney Stevens  portfolio manager at Wolverton Securities  believes investors speculating in precious metals must be disciplined to avoid gambler s ruin  While  disciplined speculation  may seem like a contradiction  it is key to Stevens  approach  Through both technical analysis and fundamental analysis  and a careful read of intermediate trends  Stevens has developed a concentrated portfolio of precious metal companies held both long and short  In this Gold Report interview  he shares where the sweet spot in the mining space is and advises how to limit portfolio risk  The Gold Report  Rodney  in July 2007  StarMine rated you a top analyst for the metals and mining space based on stock recommendations and market analysis that generated a return of about 8  over the industry benchmark  The metals and mining space has changed a lot since 2007  What are some key ways your approach has changed in the five years since that rating  Rodney Stevens  Since being an analyst at Salman Partners  my strategy has developed into a more disciplined approach to speculating  which now includes the use of technical analysis in security analysis overall and short selling  The disciplined approach involves having a concentrated portfolio of securities both long and short in conjunction with progressive stop losses  The concentrated portfolio  while adhering to progressive stop losses  helps control company specific risks  Being both long and short provides a natural hedge to protect the gains from extraordinary market risk such as a market collapse collapses when stop losses are breached  This disciplined approach allows us not to fall into gambler s ruin even though we still are looking for stocks with great potential  TGR  What do you look for in stocks to short  RS  We look primarily for ideally topping formations  so we can benefit from the downward trend when it begins  The ideal shorting scenario is picking a company that goes bankrupt  That may be rare  but we also look for certain catalysts that may be divergent from what management is saying  TGR  What would a chart look like on a stock that you would consider shorting  RS  There  s a classic head and shoulders formation that looks like a head with two shoulders on the top of a chart  which breaks through a neckline  In general  you re looking at topping formations  downward trends and even some consolidation formations  A right angle triangle of the descending formation could lead to a continued drop in share price  We look for cues for timing  but then also look for the fundamentals to get an idea of how much downside there might be and for catalysts  TGR  What s your typical weighting of shorts to longs  RS  It depends on the degree of bullishness  We could be 50 50  80 20  20 80  depending on where we think we are in the intermediate trend  Right now we re about 80  bullish on gold and silver stocks  We are interested in capturing as many intermediate trends on the upside and the downside  The problem with the intermediate trend  however  is often there is little notice as to when the trend changes direction  Despite being 80  bullish  there s still a risk that the intermediate trend can drop  so we want to be partially hedged  perhaps having a 20  allocation of stocks that we are shorting  Then if the intermediate trend halts and goes down sharply  we d be cutting our longs short through stop losses  but allowing our shorts to ride  which could make up for some of the loss from the unexpected change in trend  Of course  we also look for stocks with homerun potential and are happy to ride out the gains as long as we don t get stopped out of our positions  TGR  Is it fair to say that the intermediate trends are where you really make your money  RS  We look at the intermediate trends because if we could capture a fair share of these intermediate trends  we might be able to do better than just playing the long term trend alone  We use Dow Theory to put the long term Primary Trend into perspective  The tools we use to identify the intermediate trends are other technical indicators  such as important reversal patterns  trend lines  trend channels and support  and resistance levels  All those help assess the intermediate trend  We really make money on our stock picks  but we have to gear our portfolio in the general direction of the market  TGR  Please explain what Dow Theory is  RS  Dow Theory was originally developed by Charles Dow to gauge the overall health of the global economy  It is based on technical analysis  It identifies a bull market and bear market depending on if one sees higher highs  or lower lows in the Averages  It uses the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average  If both averages are confirming that we are in a bull market by higher highs  then we can be confident that we re still in a bull market  If the indexes contradict each other  then we may be heading for a bear market and the onset of lower lows in the Averages  TGR  What is it currently indicating  RS  Basically Dow Theory is saying that we are still in a bull market but with the caveat that it might be turning  There s been a divergence between the Dow and the Transport Average  we may be on the cusp of a change in direction over the long term from a bull market to a bear market  That tells us to be a little more cautious  There are no time limits as to when the Transports and the Dow have to confirm each other  TGR  You recently launched a weekly newsletter called The Disciplined Speculator  and the investment strategy says   The portfolio is speculative  suitable for those investors who can afford the substantial risk associated with seeking capital growth through trading a concentrated portfolio of speculative securities  Volatility of 50  or greater may be experienced   What s your read on investor appetite for that type of risk right now  RS  It may sound somewhat contradictory to be a  disciplined speculator   I would argue that being disciplined is the most important thing about speculating so that it doesn t lead to gambler s ruin  For example  if the average stop loss were 10  on a rolling 10 stock portfolio  one would have to get stopped out of many losing trades in a row before losing 50  of one s principal  We only note the extreme volatility because we don t want people to believe that our disciplined approach is not speculative  It is designed so that investors shouldn t fall into gambler s ruin  but it is speculative  Investors should always have an appetite for some level of risk  the degree of which should depend on personal circumstances  For example  investors who rely on their investments primarily for income  then only a small portion of their portfolio should be allocated to this type of strategy  TGR  A lot of what you do involves the junior resource space  Are these typically good stocks to be long on  RS  It depends on the market  If we re in a bear market  resource juniors are the worst  and when we are in a bull market uptrend  they can be the best  We look for stocks that are volatile enough that they make trading worthwhile  but hold them both long and short  For the smaller cap issues that are below  5 share  we might only venture into that category when we re in a bullish trend  Right now we re in a bullish trend  we feel that there is sufficient liquidity and the tides are going in our favor so that we can venture into this market  TGR  Given the current intermediate trend and the long term trend  what s the sweet spot in the junior mining space  Is it the precious metals explorers  the precious metals development stories  or are the junior producers the place to be at the moment  RS  The sweet spot is new high grade gold discoveries or near term production opportunities in the mining space  but only when the market is in a bullish trend  These opportunities are some of the riskiest  so it s also good to round out your portfolio with some established producers with good growth prospects  Another reason to add the larger cap stocks is for liquidity because you want to be able to reverse your position if necessary  TGR  What  s your top pick in the junior precious metals space now  RS  Right now my top pick is Roxgold Inc   ROG TSX V   It s still in the early stages of a new high grade gold discovery in Burkina Faso  There s a lot of potential to drill off a large high grade ore body of sufficient size to be attractive to the majors  Successful drilling could garner takeover speculation  From a technical perspective  the shares of Roxgold have just actually broken out of a nice upside down head and shoulders bottoming formation and in a breakout  So that s also very bullish Upside down head and shoulders formation chart for Roxgold  NL  Neckline  LS  Left Shoulder  H  Head  RS  Right Shoulder TGR  What s the upside in ounces at Yaramoko  RS  The mineralization can extend for kilometers at depth for these types of systems  Right now Roxgold is about 250 meters  m  at depth and is going to test down to 700m  The current roughly 500 000 ounce resource has potential to triple from the current drilling program  it still could extend below 700m at depth as well  There is large potential and the key takeaway is that if the company can expand the resource maybe to the 3 million ounce  Moz  range the sweet spot that makes it attractive to the majors then we could look for it to be a potential takeover target  TGR  Does Roxgold have sufficient cash to continue that drill program to find more ounces through the drill bit  RS  It has enough cash for its current drill program  but after that it would need to raise more money to continue expanding the resource  TGR  Is Roxgold getting any value for its other projects at Bissa West or Solna  RS  No  but it is not working those properties and it shouldn t really because to get the best bang for its buck  it should be targeting the expansion of the high grade area  which is what it is doing  TGR  Is Roxgold going to joint venture  JV  those properties  RS  Roxgold could but I don t think it would receive much value unless it did a number of drill passes that resulted in a great discovery  Burkina Faso typically has low grade 1 gram per ton deposits and Roxgold s Yaramoko property is somewhat of a freak of nature in that area  Roxgold may not find a similar resource in its other properties  so it wouldn t be the optimal use of its money  TGR  What are some other gold and precious metals explorers you have positions in  RS  We have a position in Tirex Resources Ltd   TXX TSX V   which has a volcanogenic massive sulphide  VMS  deposit in Albania  and this is a near term production play  The company recently received its mining permit to commence commercial production on Mirdita  its JV property with the Turkish company Ekin Maden  which is actually mining its deposit underground up to the border of Mirdita  The joint venture could announce a production decision imminently  and within a week or so  we could have a little more clarity on the production guidance  But  in theory  it could start at 500 tons per day  tpd  initially and have potential to grow to 2 000 tpd within the next two years  There s near tem production and Tirex won t have to spend anything on capital expenditures  The mine is already in operation so it s a good risk reward play  TGR  Ekin Maden is a private Turkish company and how important is that relationship to Tirex shareholders  RS  It s extremely important  The first question is does Ekin Maden s mill have extra capacity and the answer is it does  Does it want to bring the JV property into production or would it mine other deposits where it doesn t have a JV and doesn t have to split the profits  Ekin Maden recently finished a  40 million development plant expansion and it has more than enough excess capacity and wants to feed its hungry mill  In theory  Ekin Maden s motivation to mine this ore is presumably equal or stronger than Tirex s alone because Ekin Maden actually makes more money on the mining than the milling  TGR  Will Tirex effectively be toll milling  Would it be feeding the mill and getting a percentage of the value of the metals recovered  RS  Yes  The other thing is that Tirex is not responsible for any of the maintenance capital or expansion capital that may be required  It s somewhat like a royalty agreement but Tirex is exposed to operating costs  It s my understanding that Ekin Maden has been operating for a number of years and Tirex has been able to thoroughly analyze Ekin Maden s operations and costs so Tirex has a good indication of what those costs are and what the profits might be  While Tirex has exposure to operating costs  the flipside is it has a proficient operator that has been achieving cost controls  TGR  Any other precious metals explorers that you would like to talk about  RS  Dalradian Resources Inc   DNA TSX  is one that we actually don t own but it s been on our radar and we re looking for an entry point  It has a high grade 2 7 Moz deposit in Northern Ireland and it has a lot of cash and a significant drilling program  which might expand the resources by 50   Dalradian has good management and a good property with good resource growth potential  Its management has a track record of drilling up properties and selling them  so there s potential for takeover speculation  TGR  Dalradian is certainly in a very safe jurisdiction and quite close to infrastructure  being about 150 kilometers outside of Belfast  RS  The other thing is the grade  If we are heading toward a bear market  companies are going to look for this type of grade and size potential because it could sustain their cash flows in any market  that s what s going to be desirable for a takeover  TGR  What are some producers in your portfolio  RS  The producers provide a little more liquidity  We have some producers right now  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM NYSE  FVI TSX  FVI BVL  F4S FSE   Eldorado Gold Corp   ELD TSX  EGO NYSE  and Silver Standard Resources Inc   SSO TSX  SSRI NASDAQ   Both Fortuna and Eldorado have relatively high growth potential compared to their peers  so I like that in the near term  They also have good management to be able to achieve those production targets  Silver Standard doesn t really have much production growth over the next 12 months  but the initial production hiccups have for the most part been resolved and the worst of the Argentina currency controls have already been factored into the company s share price  A near term catalyst for Silver Standard might be the potential for a weakening peso  which would lower its operating costs  The charts of these companies have all gone through a consolidation phase from an uptrend and appear to be positioning to outperform the general market in the continuation of this uptrend as well  TGR  For Fortuna  where s the growth going to come from  RS  Right now its San Jose project in Mexico is ramping up production to the 5 Moz year range by the middle of next year  That s part of the near term potential  TGR  Are you generally more bullish right now on silver than gold  RS  It s hard to actually time the performance of gold and silver over an intermediate trend  They tend to track each other  Without trying to be too cute on timing  I m weighted toward silver but I think they will both rally nicely and outperform the general market  TGR  You hold Silver Standard  which is one of the biggest silver names out there  Why do you choose that over a company like Pan American Silver Corp   PAA TSX  PAAS NASDAQ   How do you choose between those two  RS  I look for catalysts and I look at the charts and at the time Silver Standard s chart looked to be stronger than Pan American s  although they both tend to trend together when nothing is going wrong  They both have good management and good growth  When I am looking at two good companies that both have good fundamentals  I look for catalysts and which chart appears to be stronger than the other  Catalyst wise  if the Argentine peso can t be held up by the Argentine government  which we are not sure whether it will happen  that could be a good catalyst in Silver Standard s favor in the near term  TGR  What s your advice to investors playing this space  RS  Investors face some tough decisions in this market  If we are toward the end of a long term bull market  then investors can be completely out of the market because buy and hold may be over  Another thing investors could do is to trust someone to actively manage their money if they can t do so for themselves  They have to take a wise  disciplined approach and it is a little more dangerous market to be in  My newsletter gives advice on avoiding a single stock commitment that could wipe an investor out  avoiding being frozen in a market that has turned against the investor and also informing the investor on how to take profits while limiting losses  Learning how to maneuver through the risks that there are in the market would be a first step  TGR  Is there one thing that made you more disciplined as an investor  RS  It s been the losses that I ve sustained  I m known for some good stock picks such as Silvercorp Metals Inc   SVM TSX  SVM NYSE  when it was under  1 share and rallied to  30 share and more recently Canaco Resources Inc   CAN TSX V  at  0 30 share rallying to  6 share  As part of a group we ve helped finance Ventana Gold Corp  at  0 30 share and we got taken out at  12 share  so I do look for these great opportunities  but I have had a tendency to be a less disciplined gambler  I ve learned from hard knocks of the risks that are involved to develop a belief in this more disciplined approach  The typical gambler s ruin  which we try to avoid  is if investors are taking a 40 50  risk in any commitment  it doesn t take many wrong calls before the capital is wiped out  In our disciplined speculator approach  we re limiting risk to a more reasonable level so that investors have ample time to turn it around and make good calls  TGR  Thanks for your insights  Rodney    CFA  is a registered representative and

122423,343938,SSRM,The ABCs Of Mining Catalysts  Jocelyn August,opinion,Investors need to know their catalysts and their potential effects good and bad on precious metals mining companies  Jocelyn August  senior analyst at Sagient Research  knows her catalysts from pre exploration to production  In this Gold Report interview  she describes eight catalysts and gives examples of upcoming catalysts for seven small cap companies  The Gold Report  Jocelyn  your expertise lies in crunching the numbers and quantifying the catalysts that affect equity values  Generally speaking  high commodity prices benefit the companies that mine them  Are commodity prices also important to the valuation of pure exploration companies  Jocelyn August  The difficulty in valuing a pure exploration company is the lack of revenue from actual mining operations  You have to consider commodity prices in valuation because the higher the price a company will be able to get for its commodity  the better  However  if the company s projects are several years from production  the current and near future commodity price is not that relevant  For pure exploration companies  catalysts or share moving events are likely to be events that demonstrate how well the company s projects are meeting important milestones  Being aware of these catalysts can make an investor a better judge of the amount of risk involved and of how much time remains before the company will be generating revenue from a project  TGR  Is it fair to say the commodity price is useful for arriving at a net present value  NPV  to be used in a preliminary economic assessment  PEA   but that you need to be open to revision over time  JA  Yes  Companies often do a lot of sensitivity analysis in calculating the NPV for their PEAs  Lately  gold companies have been using a  1 200 1 250 ounce  oz  gold price  even though it is now trading at  1 700 oz  Companies tend to be conservative because they realize that price may not hold until they take a project to production  TGR  Which catalysts in the life cycle of a precious metals company do you track  JA  There are catalysts  or predicted events  with a specific timeframe that we expect will affect the stock price of a company  At CatalystTracker  we researched which catalysts move stocks more than others do  For the most part  we found that the catalysts are generally the same across different types of companies  exploration and production versus pre exploration  for example  Most precious metals projects move from pre exploration to exploration and then feasibility  followed by development or construction and finally into production  The catalysts in pre exploration typically involve testing the project area for the presence of minerals  usually without having to drill  Companies do a lot of airborne geophysics to determine good mineral targets  The catalysts here are successful results from the Z Axis Tipper Electromagnetic  ZTEM  system or the Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic  VTEM  system  Companies use them to identify where to begin exploratory drilling or to determine if the area has good prospects at all  Other catalysts at this stage include assaying or geochemical surveys to test for the presence of mineralization  When these catalysts occur  we see varying effects on the stock price  depending on the characteristics of the company  size  market cap  exploration and production versus a pure exploration company  the number of other projects in its pipeline  For a small company  such as Liberty Star Uranium   Metals Corp   LBSR   successful ZTEMs could be a very positive event for the stock price because they signify the value of further exploration and progress toward project milestones  TGR  So the ZTEM and VTEM could affect share price  JA  Definitely  in particular if they show noticeably positive or negative results  For smaller exploration companies just getting started  ZTEM and VTEMs could be very important  TGR  Which catalysts come into play during exploration  JA  The exploration phase involves evaluating the resources to quantify the grade and the tonnage of a mineral prospect  The ultimate aim is to generate enough drilling to satisfy the economic and statutory standards of an ore resource  in the form of an NI 43 101  Typically  indicated and inferred resource carries the least geological confidence  Indicated resources are economic mineral occurrences that have been sampled to the point where an estimate can be made regarding the resource characteristics and the contained minerals  An Inferred resource is simply the amount of the mineral that can be estimated with a low level of confidence  Generally  the indicated and inferred information comes out in the initial resource estimate  Our research shows that the initial resource estimate catalysts have a fairly large impact  moving the stock price up or down 7   on average  TGR  What is the effect of a company issuing a measured resource  JA  With a measured resource  the company has done further testing in the ground and can say with much higher geological confidence that there is an ore resource  Compared to the iInferred and indicated catalyst  the measured resource announcement tends to move the stock only 6   You can see that an initial announcement would be more volatile for the stock versus a release that simply confirms continued exploration and progress  We also see in the exploration phase a lot of different exploratory drilling being completed and results released  These announcements can move the stock price up or down 8  on average  We consider drilling results to be large impact catalysts  It makes intuitive sense that the smaller market cap companies or the pure play exploration companies would experience larger stock price movement upon the announcement of these drilling events compared to a larger company that already may have projects in production  TGR  What are the catalysts in the feasibility phase  JA  This is when the company defines its reserve  quantifies the grade continuity and the mass of the ore and determines the economic feasibility of actually extracting the mineral  The elevation to reserve status is very important because it allows the deposit to be called bankable and to be an asset upon which loans and equity can be drawn  In this phase  we see a lot of bulk sampling  metallurgical test work  and engineering studies and assessments  So here are announcements of the results of these tests and of feasibility study completion results  Feasibility studies tell investors whether it is economically feasible to produce the precious metal from this location  We break feasibility catalysts into three different types  1  initiation  2  completion and 3  a go no go or a final round decision  We find that all three have above average impact  with 6 4   7 2  and 9 2  movements  respectively  Because companies at the feasibility stage are determining how economically viable the prospect is and deciding whether to proceed with the construction and infrastructure  it makes sense that these types of announcements  positive or negative  would have a large effect on their share price  There are often regulatory catalysts as well  environmental impact assessments  government approvals or permits  Environmental Protection Agency decisions and aquifer exemptions throughout the exploration  feasibility and development phases  These regulatory events can vary depending on the location of the project and the amount of regulation  the degree of concern over environmental issues or the presence of an indigenous population  Although it can be difficult to follow all of these regulatory events  we follow them in CatalystTracker  We have determined that on average  government approval or permit decisions are catalysts with an up or down 7 26  move  TGR  These environmental licensing events are included in feasibility studies  correct  I would assume environmental licensing would be an important event  JA  It definitely is important  The economics of a project may work in getting the mineral from the ground  but permitting and governmental approvals may be too expensive  When this catalyst happens depends on the project  Some companies may need permits to begin exploration or not until later on  They may be able to do the feasibility studies concurrently with environmental or approval permits  TGR  And next comes construction  JA  After feasibility and permitting  we move into the mine development  or construction  phase  Depending on the type of mine  open pit or underground  as well as existing infrastructure  the timeframe for construction can vary  We have identified the completion of construction as a large impact catalyst  with an up or down 8  move  Interestingly  construction moves stock prices more than the start of production  which moves the stock just over 5   TGR  Does that mean that when construction is done  the start of production is already baked into the price  JA  At first  it seems a bit odd  but once construction is completed  the start of production soon follows  and  in effect  has already been priced into the share price  TGR  Once construction is completed  what is the next catalyst  JA  Once companies are generating revenue from production  they often look to expand  This could be in the form of adding mill capacity or a new deposit  In some cases  a company starts production with an open pit mine and adds underground mining infrastructure later on  These types of expansion add to a company s revenue stream  but usually do not result in very large stock movements  about 5 5 8  on average  TGR  Next  let s look at how the catalysts you just described might affect the valuations of some real companies  Where would you like to start  JA  This will be a big quarter for   BRD   It will announce a PEA for an expansion of its Black Fox project  looking at the 147 and Contact zones there  We also expect a PEA for Grey Fox  which is highlighted in our Q4 Outlook Report  That PEA will incorporate its October 25 resource estimate announcing its Indicated and Inferred categories  TGR  Those Indicated and Inferred numbers were dramatically higher than the December 2011 announcement  However  the stock is down 10  since then  How might an investor play an event like that  JA  It is extremely important for investors to be aware of these potentially market moving  binary events  It can be hard to discern what will be a positive and what will be a negative  but you can use it multiple ways with multiple trading strategies  For example  you may want to capitalize on catalysts before they are fully baked into the share price  If you think it will be a gray area  going up or down  you may not worry about trading that stock at that point  You can also hedge your bets up or down using stock options  At CatalystTracker we track these future events to identify potentially large impact events that will affect the share prices of the companies involved  Many of our clients use the CatalystTracker to minimize their risk or to better understand which events to capitalize on and which events to avoid trading on  TGR  Do you expect the PEA on Grey Fox will move the market for Brigus  JA  That is hard to say without knowing more about Grey Fox  It could be a great addition for Brigus because it would use the Black Fox mill and infrastructure  That lowers the cost of Grey Fox  We need to find out how big Grey Fox actually is  Brigus also has the Goldfields project  which it has kept on the back burner while getting Black Fox into production  If it does go ahead  Goldfields will at least double Brigus  production to an expected 100 000 oz  100 Koz  year gold  TGR  Brigus is a very small company  with a  215 million  M  market cap  These events could really make a difference in a company this small  for example  Goldfields would triple its production  JA  What Brigus actually said was that it wanted to wait on a Goldfields decision until Black Fox was producing 25 Koz quarter gold  which works out to 100 Koz year  Once it got to that point  it would be doubling  TGR  What other companies are expecting catalysts  JA  We expect a PEA from MAG Silver Corp   MVG  for its Pozo Seco deposit at Cinco de Mayo very soon  MAG Silver previously announced an initial resource estimate  but we want more information regarding the project s NPV  as well as estimated costs  A positive PEA might encourage MAG Silver to commence the permitting process and do feasibility studies to provide more evidence for Pozo Seco  TGR  Its stock is up 36  over the past 12 weeks  despite having delayed its PEA for the Pozo Seco portion  Delayed PEAs can be the kiss of death  JA  The difference is that MAG is working on so many projects  it has not put all of its eggs in one basket  As a result  there is less risk in this one project  compared to Brigus  where the company only has a few projects  Speaking of having more than one project  we are looking for permit approval of MAG Silver s Juanicipio project  If the company can get permit approval  which we have been waiting on for a couple of months and is now expected in Q4 12  it could start construction at the beginning of 2013  That could be a big event for it  TGR  Is there another company you want to mention  JA  We expect another environmental impact decision for Taseko Mines Ltd   TGB  on its New Prosperity mine  a gold and copper mine in Canada  Two catalysts for Taseko depend on approval of the environmental impact assessment the construction start and production start catalysts  The company submitted its environmental impact assessment on Sept  20 and a decision should be made between now and mid December  If the environmental impact statement is denied or delayed  it could be bad for Taseko  TGR  Is that within the time range for a decision  JA  I believe the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency  CEAA  has 365 days to issue the final assessment decision from the initiation of the process  The process officially commenced in November 2011  In November 2010  Taseko was denied federal authorization  and the stock definitely reacted negatively to that  TGR  You mentioned Liberty Star as an example of how a catalyst can affect a small company  Can you tell us more about its upcoming catalysts  JA  We are looking at the ZTEM survey for Liberty Star s Tombstone project  which is a copper mining project in Arizona  It received permit approval for access roads to Tombstone in late September  but the permits require an archeological survey to ensure that the access roads or drill sites did not destroy any antiquities  TGR  What does Liberty Star mine  JA  Its North Pipes Super Project is uranium  but drilling exploration there is suspended  The company expects to restart drilling in 2013 if uranium prices stabilize  Tombstone is copper  It looks like phase 1 drilling on the Hay Mountain area of Tombstone will start in the fall  Liberty Star seems to be doing a lot of exploration at this point  TGR  Do you have one last name to share  JA  Silver Standard Resources Inc   SSRI  expects to issue a bankable feasibility study on its Pitarrilla project  a silver mining prospect in Mexico  before year end  In late 2011  it filed a mineral resource that demonstrated probable mineral reserves of 91 7 Moz  measured  indicated and inferred  If the feasibility study is positive  the company could draw loans and equity against that asset  Right now  Silver Standard has just one producing mine  so the addition of another would improve its portfolio  TGR  Jocelyn  thank you for your insights into
