Prepared Remarks 
OperatorWelcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Stanley Black   Decker Earnings Conference Call  My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today s call  At this time  all participants are in a listen only mode  Later  we will conduct a question and answer session  Please note that this conference is being recorded I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations  Dennis Lange  Mr  Lange  you may begin Dennis M  Lange    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Shannon  Good morning  everyone  and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black   Decker s fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call  On the call  in addition to myself  is Jim Loree  President and CEO  Don Allan  Executive Vice President and CFO  and Jeff Ansell  Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools   Storage Our earnings release  which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation  which we will refer to during the call  are available on the IR section of our website  A replay of this morning s call will also be available beginning at 11 00 AM today  The replay number and the access code are in our press release  This morning  Jim  Don  and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and various other matters  followed by a Q A session  Consistent with prior calls  we re going to be sticking with one question per caller And as we normally do  we will be making some forward looking statements during the call  Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may or may not prove to be accurate  and as such  they involve risk and uncertainty  It s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward looking statements that we might make today  We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8 K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent  34 Act filing I ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO  Jim Loree James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dennis  and good morning  everyone  As you saw in this morning s press release  we successfully closed out the year with an in line 4Q performance  Quarterly revenue was up 2  to  3 7 billion with organic growth of 2  amid a mixed global macro  Our total Company adjusted operating margin rate was 13 6   up 30 basis points year over year  and adjusted EPS for the quarter was  2 18  up 3  Full year revenues were  14 4 billion  up 3  with a solid 3  organic growth performance  Our operating margin rate was quite resilient at 13 5   just 10 basis points under last year  despite absorbing  445 million of external pre tax headwinds from tariffs  FX  and the like  a significant portion of which were not and could not have been anticipated at the beginning of the year  Adjusted EPS for the year was  8 40  a 3  increase versus 2018  a notable accomplishment under the circumstances And finally  we were thrilled to deliver  1 1 billion of free cash flow for a conversion rate of 113  and a CFROI of 14   Working capital turns improved to 9 8 turns  up a whole turn versus prior year  And this strong cash performance helped us support our growing dividend and enabled us to finish up the year with the balance sheet in great shape with a debt to EBITDA of approximately 2 0 times while absorbing  900 million of capital allocation to M A in 2019 And in this regard  we closed on two previously announced transactions during 2019  First  our 20  minority partnership with MTD provides a path to enter the  20 billion plus outdoor power equipment market with an industry leader in a financially prudent way  Beginning in July 2021  we have an option to purchase the remaining 80  of MTD with the potential to add approximately  3 billion of revenue at an all in EBITDA multiple in the range of 7 to 8 times  This option remains in place for 10 years  giving us maximum flexibility to enter the market at an appropriate time of our choice We also closed on the acquisition of IES Attachments  a leading provider of off highway specialized attachments for prime moving equipment  doing business under the Paladin and Pengo brand names  This transaction almost triples the size of our infrastructure business unit while further diversifying our presence in the industrial markets  The business features high profitability  good growth and is heavily weighted to the aftermarket  which represents approximately 60  of revenues In addition  today we announced that we have reached an agreement to acquire Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing  or CAM  which gives us an exciting platform for growth in the aerospace components and fasteners market  And I ll provide a bit more color on that in just a moment Another highlight from 2019 was the progress made by our Security business  4Q was a significant step forward in the turnaround as we generated our best Security organic growth in recollection  at 4  with all major regions and businesses contributing  North America electronic security was up 10   a very encouraging indication of the power of our new business model Security also demonstrated its ability to accrete its operating margin rate  which was up 20 basis points for the year  And so we appear to be in an inflection point  with increasing positive momentum in organic growth and a stable operating margin rate poised for accretion in 2020  And as for the future of Security in our portfolio  we look forward to providing you with a mid year update as promised  However  we are confident in the value we are creating through this transformation regardless of whether we choose to retain or to monetize the asset at some point So looking back at 2019  a lot of progress was made against a volatile uncertain backdrop of tariffs and other external headwinds  Despite the  445 million of pressures  we more than held serve with our financial performance  We continue to execute on our growth catalysts  including FlexVolt  Craftsman  e commerce  DEWALT  Atomic  and Xtreme  and acquisitions  We continue to enthusiastically embrace the growing importance of ESG and multi stakeholder capitalism  recognizing the power of purpose driven performance and the importance of diversity and inclusion to the success of the corporation Our 60 000 employees  our Board members  and the many business partners in our ecosystem gave it their all and we emerged well positioned to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the 2020  And I want to personally thank each and every one of them for their contributions  Our performance this year was no small accomplishment and I am very appreciative And with that said  I want to move to another development that we announced today  As indicated in our release  today  we re sharing plans for a leadership succession in our Tools   Storage business  And after 20 years with the Company  Jeff Ansell has made the personal decision to step back from his responsibilities as President of Tools   Storage and take a less intensive role in our organization  And we re pleased that we are able to share a seamless transition plan today with Jaime Ramirez  currently Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Tools   Storage  assuming leadership responsibility for the entire unit over the course of the first half of 2020 Jeff has been an incredible colleague  team mate and leader of Tools   Storage for 15 years now  In fact  over the last two decades  few have contributed more to the growth and success of this Company than Jeff  He was integral to the historic Stanley and Black   Decker integration that created enormous growth for the Company  And during his tenure leading Tools  that unit grew from a  600 million revenue hand tool business to a  10 1 billion industry leader  His passion for customers  brands  products  and innovation is truly remarkable And even with that track record and all those accomplishments  we were supportive when Jeff approached us about his interest in making this change  We are grateful for his many years of dedication and high performance  but also completely respect his desire to spend more time on personal and family endeavors  Further  we appreciate his willingness to remain a major contributor to the Company s success in the coming years So effective July 1  he will transition his current operating responsibilities to Jaime and will assume the leadership of a major and exciting organic growth program involving the revitalization of the Black   Decker brand  He will continue in this role through the end of 2021  and at that point  will stay on as a Strategic Advisor to the Company through the end of 2023 And as I mentioned  Jaime will assume full leadership of the business by mid year  He is a 27 year veteran of Stanley Black   Decker  cutting his teeth in the emerging markets  The agility  adaptability  and drive to win necessary to succeed in those high growth volatile markets will serve him well  And in addition to his strong and proven execution skills  Jaime is a champion of innovation  technology  and digital transformation with a socially responsible approach  We are confident that he is the right leader to take Tools   Storage into the future and he will bring that transformative focus along with his passion for the business to the role And many of you have met Jaime before and we look forward to you spending more time with him in the months ahead and the years to come  And so on behalf of the Board and our entire management team  I want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to Jeff for all his contributions and impact in leading our Tools business to become the largest  most innovative and most trusted tools franchise in the world And now I ll turn it over to Jeff to make a few remarks Jeffery D  Ansell    Executive Vice President   President Global Tools   StorageJim  thank you for the kind words  It is with tremendous pride that after more than a quarter of a century in this Company and a decade and a half leading the Tools business  I share with you my decision to transition my responsibilities  15 years ago  I set out to establish our Tool business as the biggest and best in the world  That mission has more than been accomplished At this point  I want to share more time with my wife and children as they so willingly shared me all these years  This transition allows me to do just that  and at the same time  remain professionally connected to the Company that I love  through 2023  A great deal has been accomplished in the past 15 years by the Tools   Storage team and me  And while I m in transition  the team that remains has delivered incredible results  including increasing the size and profitability of the Tools business by more than 17 times  making us the world s largest tool Company  developing over 10 000 new products and growing our flagship brand to their largest size in the history  including Stanley Black   Decker  Irwin  Lenox  Craftsman  and DEWALT I leave the Tools business with excellent care  The management team is the absolute best in our industry and I ve known and worked alongside Jaime Ramirez for more than a decade  His long tenure and successful track record in this wonderful Company have prepared him well for this role  Our strength in every major geography in the world and our unparalleled stable of brands combined with our robust pipeline of innovation  as well as pervasive faith in Jim  Don  and our entire management team instill tremendous confidence in me that this organization s best days are ahead  I will always be indebted to our customers and employees for making all this possible And with this  I turn the call back to Jim James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jeff  It s been a great journey and not over yet And before I turn it over to Don Allan  I just wanted to cover a little more detail on CAM  Growing and diversifying our industrial business through M A is a priority for the Company and a key element of our strategic capital deployment  Our vision presented at our 2019 Investor Day is to create a  3 billion to  4 billion global industrial platform that is made up of highly engineered application based solutions  We are looking for businesses that have the attributes you see on the left side of this slide  strong engineering capabilities with technology that is industry leading  customer recognized and trusted brands  and a recurring revenue component or heavily weighted aftermarket element Additionally  we want businesses that are global in scale  can differentiate through innovation and operate in strong end markets and have the potential for robust growth over the long term  Consistent with this strategy  we are very excited about today s announcement of the CAM acquisition  CAM is a leading manufacturer of specialty fasteners and components for the aerospace and defense end market  This acquisition is an ideal bolt on to our existing Engineered Fastening business and further adds to our industrial portfolio in a new high growth  high margin market The transaction is valued at up to  1 5 billion with  200 million held back and contingent upon the 737 MAX receiving timely FAA authorization to return to service and Boeing achieving certain production levels  When adjusted for approximately  185 million net present value of expected cash tax benefits  the net transaction value is approximately  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion  CAM has LTM revenues of approximately  375 million and attractive profitability characteristics  This business has strong brands  a proven business model  deep customer relationships  and an experienced management team  which will create a pathway for profitable growth and value creation Given the favorable characteristics of the asset  the year five cash flow returns are within our 12  to 15  target and is expected to add  0 30 to  0 40 of EPS accretion by year three  This acquisition of CAM also gives us a platform asset in aerospace to add on future bolt on acquisitions  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and we are excited to welcome CAM and its 1 600 employees to the Stanley Black   Decker family as soon as possible and are ready to get to work on the integration and synergy plan once closed And as you take a step back to look at what we ve accomplished in industrial over the past three years  it is notable that the acquisitions of Nelson  IES Attachments  and CAM align closely with our strategy and have increased our exposure to new end markets  while diversifying our industrial portfolio beyond automotive OEM  These three high quality assets in the aggregate represent approximately  1 billion in revenue and  2 6 billion in strategic capital allocation  each carry strong prospects for revenue and profit growth  as well as compelling cash flow returns and EPS accretion And now  I will turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2020 guidance Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Jim  and good morning  everyone  I would also like to express my gratitude to Jeff Ansell and let him know how much I enjoyed working with you for over 20 years  We worked together to drive our Company forward operationally  I will miss having you in those moments going forward  but I am so excited for you and the next stage of your SBD journey  Thank you Jeff for being an amazing leader through this wonderful transformation of Tools   Storage Now I will take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter  Tools   Storage delivered 1  total revenue growth  with 2  organic growth and a 1 point headwind from currency  Price was modestly positive in the quarter  but slightly below our expectation  as we saw our promotional mix increase in North America  which partially offset the continued pricing benefits we are receiving across the global business  The operating margin rate for the segment was 16 5   up 110 basis points versus prior year  The benefits of significant margin resiliency actions taken  volume  and price were partially offset by tariff and currency headwinds  as well as unfavorable product mix and plant under absorption related to significant inventory reductions Total tariff and currency headwinds amounted to approximately  85 million for the entire Company  with 95  impacting Tools   Storage  The unfavorable product mix was caused by reduced levels of hand tools  accessories  and storage revenue versus the prior year  which of course has higher levels of profitability combined with the increased promotional activities in the power tools SBU We took the opportunity within the quarter to begin to normalize our inventory levels following the completion of the Craftsman rollout and other various brand transitions we have been executing across the marketplace  This effort resulted in a very strong cash flow performance  but the lower production volumes created a non recurring P L headwind that we were able to overcome  These last two areas of operational pressures combined with lower than expected volumes emerged during the quarter and drove a negative impact on our segment operating margin  However  we were mostly able to offset that with significant margin resiliency actions On a geographic basis  North America was up 3  organically  US retail continued to see strong momentum with mid single digit growth in the quarter  The US commercial channels posted low single digit growth  while the industrial focused product lines and automotive repair channel were both down high single digits  We believe there was some ongoing customer inventory corrections that occurred during the quarter  which constricted our shipment growth in this particular area  This is the second consecutive full quarter we have experienced this negative impact in the channel North America s growth continue to be fueled by our brand rollouts  including Craftsman and new product innovations such as DEWALT  Flexvolt  Atomic and Xtreme  The sell through continue to be robust across North American retail with the fourth quarter once again delivering double digit POS  resulting in a double digit performance for the full year as well  It is rewarding to see these growth catalysts generating such a positive response from our end users and delivering such a strong performance once again Europe delivered 3  organic growth in the quarter with 7 out of the 10 markets growing organically  This performance was led by the UK  France  Central Europe  Greece  and Iberia  which more than offset weaker markets in Italy and the Nordics  The team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of new products and commercial actions to produce above market organic growth Finally  emerging markets declined 3  organically  Weaker market conditions within Latin America more than offset the benefits from price  new product launches  and e commerce expansion  The Latin American market pressure was most acute in Chile  Mexico  and Central America  which in some cases  you are seeing the political environment or social disruption beginning to impact the business confidence and the underlying GDP  We saw strong performances in Brazil  India  and China  which posted mid single digit growth  while Russia  Turkey  and Korea  all posted strong double digit growth Now let s take a look at the Tools   storage SBUs  Power tools and equipment delivered 6  organic growth  benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions  User response to our new innovations within FlexVolt  Atomic  and Xtreme has been very positive and continues to translate into share gains for us and our customers  Hand tools  accessories  and storage declined 3   as new product introductions were more than offset by the aforementioned customer inventory corrections and a shift to more promotional items such as power tools  In addition  the Craftsman comps are getting more difficult and this will cause a temporary pressure to organic growth for a few quarters In summary  a strong quarter and an incredibly successful year for Tools   Storage  generating mid single digit organic growth and an OM rate expansion despite taking on most of the  445 million of externally driven cost headwinds that came our way in 2019  An incredibly impressive performance by the team  which continues to be resilient and act with agility to position the business for future growth and margin expansion in 2020 and beyond Turning to Industrial  this segment delivered 9  total revenue growth  which included 13 points of growth from the IES acquisition  partially offset by 4 point decline in volume  Operating margin rate increased 40 basis points year over year to 13 6  as productivity gains and cost control more than offset the impact from lower volume and externally driven cost inflation Our Engineered Fastening revenues were flat organically as higher system shipments and fastener penetration gains were offset by inventory reductions and lower production levels within industrial and automotive customers  Our industrial end markets remain challenged due to ongoing inventory reductions and slowing trends across these particular areas  However  despite underlying automotive production declining for a sixth consecutive quarter  our auto fastener business continued to benefit from penetration gains  outgrowing global production by 410 basis points  The Infrastructure businesses declined 17  organically as volumes were impacted by challenging oil and gas pipeline  and scrap steel markets Now let s turn to Security  I m pleased to report we delivered 4  organic growth  marking the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth  North America was up 7  organically  driven by increased installations within commercial electronic security  and higher volumes in healthcare and automatic doors  a very impressive performance in North America  Europe posted 1  organic growth led by France and Sweden  which was partially offset by continued market weakness in the UK In terms of profitability  the segment operating margin rate was 11 2   down 80 basis points versus the prior year as organic growth and cost containment were more than offset by the impact from the Sargent   Greenleaf divestiture and investments to support organic growth  The investments are significant and will begin to pay dividends in 2020 as the 2019 revenue impact was modest  but building momentum  Without the impact of these two items  Security would have experienced significant margin rate expansion It was encouraging to see Security organic growth accelerate in the fourth quarter and we expect the top line momentum to continue into 2020  The business will look to balance organic growth and OM rate expansion on a consistent basis as we leverage our targeted investments in commercial electronic security  We feel the business is well positioned for success  which is low single digit organic growth with consistent operating margin dollar and rate expansion Let s take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page  As you can see  our free cash flow for the full year was excellent as we generated approximately  1 1 billion in 2019  up  312 million year over year and a free cash flow conversion of 113  of our net income  The improvement was due to higher cash from operations  driven by our working capital improvements  as well as modestly lower capital expenditures  As it relates to working capital  we delivered 9 8 working capital turns  up 1 turn year over year As I mentioned earlier  we made the decision in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory levels within our Tools   Storage business as the heavylifting from our brand transitions are complete  As we look ahead  we still see opportunities to improve working capital back above 10 turns in the coming years  We are very pleased with this result  As many of you know  we have been very focused on getting our annual free cash flow back above  1 billion  And now that we ve completed these significant brand transitions  we were able to achieve that objective in 2019 So let s move to the 2020 guidance on Slide 8  We are expecting an adjusted earnings per share range of  8 80 to  9 00  up approximately 6  versus prior year at the midpoint  On a GAAP basis  we expect the earnings per share range to be  8 05 to  8 35  inclusive of various one time charges related to restructuring  M A costs  as well as the Security business transformation and key margin resiliency initiatives  As a reminder  this guidance does not include the impact of the CAM acquisition  In addition  we expect the free cash flow conversion will approximate 90  to 100  in 2020 So let s turn to some of the drivers of core EPS growth as you see on the left hand side of the chart  We expect approximately 3  organic growth  which will generate  0 40 to  0 50 of EPS accretion  The actions associated with our cost reduction program announced in October are broadly complete and expected to deliver approximately  0 95 of EPS  These items will be partially offset by  0 60 to  0 70 of carryover tariff and currency headwinds Finally  below the line  we expect a net  0 25 EPS headwind year over year  This includes a tax rate of approximately 18   which is up 2 points year over year as certain benefits experienced in 2019 will not repeat at the same levels in 2020  Additionally  we are seeing about  0 05 of net headwind  which includes share pressure related to previous financing activities  partially offset by favorable interest expense Just to clarify our tariff assumption  we are assuming the benefit within our guidance from the recently announced trade deal  So this means List 4A is at 7 5  beginning in the middle of February and Lists 1  2  3 remain in place at 25  rate  This resulted in a net benefit of about  0 10 in our guidance  which includes a reduction in our tariff expectation as well as lower than expected pricing benefits  As it relates to pricing  we have benefits built into the plan across all our businesses  But since the tariff environment has deescalated for the time being  much of the new 2020 pricing we achieve will be generated by executing margin resiliency actions So let s turn to margin resiliency  We are now in full execution mode and expect to generate  300 million to  500 million of cumulative benefits from this program over the next three years  As a reminder  the margin resiliency program is generating accelerated productivity by applying technology to our manufacturing and procurement processes  as well as our back office  This was developed as a response to the dynamic nature of the external operating environment  which we now view as our new reality As such  we are leveraging the program as additional contingency to offset any incremental headwinds or market dislocations that may come our way throughout the year  Should the external environment stabilize or in the event we start to see some tailwinds  we will leverage this program as an opportunity to outperform our guidance or reinvest into our businesses I would now like to review our expectation for the next quarter  We expect first quarter s earnings to be approximately 14  of the full year performance  which is about 300 basis points lower than last year  The first factor driving this lower percentage of full year delivery is that we expect a little more than half of  115 million of full year external headwinds to impact the first quarter Next  we will anticipate organic growth to be relatively flat in the first quarter  We are planning for the global industrial environment to continue to be choppy and we are facing more difficult comps in Tools due to the Craftsman rollout  While we expect Craftsman to still deliver about 2 points of growth within the Tools   Storage segment in 2020  the first quarter discreetly is one of the toughest comparisons for the load in which started to intensify in the first quarter of 2019  These two factors represent approximately two thirds of the reduced first quarter contribution  resulting in a relatively consistent operating margin rate and dollars versus last year  The remaining one third of the first quarter difference is related to higher than expected tax rate and the impact from consolidating MTD s full winter season Now we re going to turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page  Organic growth within Tools   Storage is expected to be at mid single digits in 2020  There are multiple catalysts supporting growth including core innovation  benefits from our breakthroughs such as FlexVolt  Atomic  and Xtreme  e commerce  and the continued contribution from the brand transition with Craftsman  Stanley and Stanley FatMax  Margin rates are expected to be positive year over year as we realized the benefits from volume  our cost actions  and productivity  which will more than offset the carryover impacts from the external headwinds In the Industrial segment  we expect relatively flat to modestly negative organic performance  This outlook reflects the current slow market conditions within the automotive and industrial end markets  as well as the oil and gas pipeline and attachment tool markets  Our expectation is that the front half will continue to carry similar market pressures as what we saw in the back half of 2019  Once we get to the second half  we do see the opportunity for better performance and potentially modest growth as the comps ease  Operating margins in this segment are expected to be positive year over year as productivity and cost actions are partially offset by modest tariffs and currency headwinds Finally  in the Security segment  we are expecting organic growth to be up low single digits in 2020  With the investments we have made over the past year  the team has positioned the business for more consistent top line performance  This is expected to translate into improved operating margins year over year as we leverage volume and deliver on our focused initiatives to lower our cost to serve One last matter as it relates to guidance  With the recent virus outbreak in China  we are anticipating some questions as it relates to our manufacturing footprint  First  our major facilities and suppliers are not located in the affected area  Our largest tools and engineering fastening facilities are located in the broader Shanghai area  We also have plants that are in Mainland China adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau  as well as a plant along the eastern coast We are staying close to the situation and the team is working through contingencies for manufacturing and for our supply base  With what we know thus far about the one week extended shut down for Chinese New Year  we feel this is an impact that is contemplated in our guidance  Of course  this is a very dynamic situation and our teams will react and respond as conditions change and we will update you as we know more throughout the quarter So  in summary  for our total Company  we expect a 3  organic growth  5  to 7  adjusted EPS expansion  inclusive of a 2 point tax headwind  a solid result and a balanced view that focuses on delivering margin expansion by realizing the benefits of our cost actions and generating volume leverage to successfully overcome the carryover impacts from tariffs and currency  We believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the Company for success in 2020  The organization is focused on leveraging our organic growth catalysts  executing margin resiliency  generating strong free cash flow  and successfully integrating the CAM and IES acquisitions With that  I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Don  One last look at 2019  It was a successful year considering the environment  The performance was possible due to the agility  passion  and dedication of our workforce  and I thank our people for their commitment  It s their extraordinary dedication  passion  teamwork and sheer will to win that makes this Company so special  Our teams acted with speed and determination while facing into  445 million currency commodity and tariff headwinds  as well as very dynamic end markets  We delivered 3  total revenue growth  including 3  organic growth  and our OM rate remained strong at 13 5  and adjusted EPS expanded by 3  On a really positive note  free cash flow was  1 1 billion  with very strong conversion and a CFROI consistent with our long term financial objectives  And as we turn to 2020  our leadership team will act with agility  leveraging our proven ever evolving operating system to successfully navigate the underlying external environment  And additionally  we re continuing to execute on our margin resiliency initiative of  300 million to  500 million over several years to get our margins back on an upward trajectory  despite whatever headwinds might appear on the horizon  We re looking forward to another successful year in 2020  continuing to achieve our vision to deliver strong financial performance  become known as one of the world s great innovative companies  and elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility We are ready for the 2020s and now we are ready for Q A  Dennis Dennis M  Lange    Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  Thanks  Jim  Shannon  we can now open the call to Q A  please Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners  Your line is open Brett Linzey    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystHi  good morning  This is Brett Linzey in for Jeff  Hey  just want to come back to the incremental revenue opportunity  I think you said 2 points contribution from Craftsman  but if we include some of the other key programs  Flexvolt  Atomic  Xtreme with Craftsman  what are you contemplating in the guide in terms of incremental growth from those programs  Thanks Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would say that the 2 points for Craftsman obviously I stated in my prepared remarks  we expect mid single digit performance for the overall business on a global basis  You ll have the other share gains that we ll achieve above market GDP  which is probably in the high 1s  if you look at our global mix anywhere from 1 8  to 2   And so any other share gains that we gain along there will add to that And then we do have some pressures  as I mentioned  in emerging markets that we expect to continue in the first half and then some of the industrial tool channels as well  In the first half  there will be a bit of a drag on that that    those are the main categories  So  I would expect share gains  some of those innovations  Craftsman  market growth of close to 2  and then you re going to have some drag in the areas that I mentioned that kind of get you to that mid single digit number OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Your line is open Jason McKenzie    Barclays Bank    AnalystHi  this is Jason McKenzie on for Julian  Just a question around the first quarter guidance  particularly around the margin rate  I think last year there was about a  40 million to  50 million inventory charge taken as a result of commodity cycles in the Tools business  Is there a reason why despite that theoretically being a non repeat in Q1  20  the operating margin rate is going to stay sort of flat year on year  Can we get a little bit more color as to what the offsets are  and then maybe just any guidance around what the total commodity headwind tailwind is for the full year Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So the first quarter  I mean  as I mentioned in my comments  we do have an incremental tariff and currency headwind of    the annual number is about  115 million  I said  about half of that is going to hit in the first quarter  So that s clearly of the magnitude of very similar to the number you mentioned related to the item in the first quarter of 2018  So that s a significant drag that we re seeing  So you had a one time now that    last year that goes away  but then you have this particular issue that comes in If you look at the split for the full year  I said  115 million of headwinds  the tariff numbers   80 million to  90 million  and then the rest is currency  Commodities  at this point  we expect to be neutral  but of course that s an opportunity as we go throughout the year to see if we get a little bit of deflation as the year goes on OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird  Your line is open Tim Wojs    Robert W  Baird    AnalystYeah  Hey  guys  good morning James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Tim Wojs    Robert W  Baird    AnalystI had a two part question  if I could  So I guess the first  just the guide for Q1 implies acceleration through the year in Tools and some more meaningful margin improvement through the year  So  I guess  what s your line of sight to both of those within the Tools segment  And then the other side of this is  just  Jim  you talked about Black   Decker revitalization  I was hoping you could give us just a little color on what exactly that means James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerDon  you take the first part Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So   James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe really respect and appreciate you so much we are actually going to take your two part question even though it s really two questions  Don Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI think it s very cool how he addressed that two part question  so it s really one question  Yeah  so the cadence for Tools is that  we expect in the first quarter kind of relatively flat  maybe down slightly for organic growth  but I feel like it will be close to relatively flat  And then as we go throughout the year  this comp issue that we re dealing within the first quarter for Craftsman is quite significant  It s almost 3 points in the quarter And so  when you factor that in and you factor in some of these slower markets I mentioned in emerging markets and industrial  that s kind of how you get to that number  That s going to start to regulate in Q2  And then obviously  when you get to the back half  you don t have those types of pressures you re dealing with year over year and we expect nice growth from the program of Craftsman for a full year as I mentioned  2 points And I will remind everybody  the POS continues to be very strong for Craftsman and it s double digits  That has been double digits throughout 2019  and we expect to continue to be strong as we go through 2020  And the success of this rollout will help us drive that type of performance  And then we expect some of these markets to get a little better in the back half and that s probably the right way to think about the cadence James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the revitalization of the Black   Decker brand  this is an opportunity that has been in front of us for a long time and it s taken a lot of thought and preparation and we ve had so many other priorities in revitalizing brands that it was a little bit lower on the list  but it truly is a remarkable brand  one of the great consumer brands in the world and it s an opportunity to unlock great value from this asset Jeff  as you know  was the mastermind behind the Craftsman revitalization and execution of that and now he tackles this Black   Decker project and he is actually working    done a fair amount of work on this already  has a fair amount of definition for what it is  but how much of that he and we want to share right now is not very much  because there is always the element of confidentiality and to some extent  surprise when it comes to these sort of things and    but I will turn it over to Jeff and you can tell them whatever you d like to disclose at this point in time recognizing that it won t be too much Jeffery D  Ansell    Executive Vice President   President Global Tools   StorageSo  well  to add on to what Jim said  I guess the genesis of this was that Black   Decker in any survey  any study you do is iconic    remains iconic from aided and unaided awareness perspective  And we looked at the progress across our tremendous stable of brands these past 10 years and I ll give you rough ranges  but we had growth like 70  in the Stanley brand  9  and 10  with Lenox and Irwin since we acquired it  over 250  in DEWALT and 500  in Craftsman  We love those numbers  we re really excited and it s fueled that growth Black   Decker is also at the biggest    the larger size in history  but it s only been up about 3  in that time frame  So we look at it as a really opportunity cost  We could do so much with that brand  we haven t had the time to do it  I now have the opportunity to do just that  And we re excited about what can happen in the next few years here James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerSo you can see  we re not disclosing a whole lot right now other than it s a big opportunity  But more to come on that  You ll see it over the coming quarters  should have some impact by next year and really material impact beyond that OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  thanks  Good morning  guys James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystMy question is around free cash conversion  If you guys could talk a little bit about the differences between the low and the high end of the guidance for 2020  and I guess what s the scope to get to 100  plus conversion sustainably from here Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  Yeah  I would say that  for 2020  that range of 10  of 90  to 100  is really dependent on probably primarily two factors  One would be working capital  We did end the year at close to 10 turns  And so we will continue to drive improvement in that number  But to get a positive impact in your free cash flow related to working capital  you need at least 0 5 to 0 7 tenths of a turn improvement for the whole company to make that happen  So we might get close to that  but it might actually be closer to neutral than a positive impact from working capital And then capex will be something that continues to be between 3  to 3 5  of our revenue  but we also know that probably at the higher end of that range in 2020 as we start to work through some of these China supply chain mitigation strategies  as we move production to other countries in certain cases  as well as we will be building our Craftsman plant in Fort Worth  Texas as well and there will be a fair amount of costs in 2020 related to that  So those are really the two factors that kind of result in that variation  Our goal is clearly to get to 100  or more  and always is  But we occasionally  on an annual basis  will manage that to achieve these other strategic objectives OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan  Your line is open Michael Rehaut    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Mike Michael Rehaut    JPMorgan    AnalystFirst question    I guess first and only question I have is on just kind of parsing out the 2020 guidance a little bit more  Specifically just wanted to revisit the margin resiliency initiative  You referred to it in the prepared remarks as something that you expect to continue to materialize  And just wanted to get a sense of how you re thinking about that flowing through and the timing of that benefit flowing through in 2020  if you re still thinking about the  100 million to  150 million type of benefit for the year and how it would hit the P L  And then just as a slight clarification  the  200 million cost reduction  I m coming to that being about  1 05 in EPS benefit  I just didn t know if my math is off or there is something different between that and the  0 95 Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  The last part of your question is really just kind of timing of that particular    certain things    certain parts of the world  you can t do it as quickly as you d like  So you ll have a little bit of an impact of that  That s why it s about  0 10 different than what you re calculating for your math  But that obviously will carry over into 2021 Margin resiliency  I m glad you asked that question  If you remember from the October earnings call when we gave you some initial thoughts about 2020  we really had the objective of trying to position the Company with an EPS growth that was reasonable  given the headwinds that we were going to experience as a carryover into 2020 and I think we ve done that with the guidance today at 6  midpoint  But we also wanted the margin resiliency to get about  100 million to  150 million of value in 2020  But we wanted that to be more of a contingency  And I mentioned that in my comments earlier and that s really the plan So it s not baked into our guidance right now  It s therefore    if other headwinds come our way that we have to deal with  like this virus in China as an example  might be a little bit of a headwind for a period of time  Currency might be a headwind that emerges  Or it doesn t emerge  these headwinds don t happen  and there is an opportunity for us to outperform and as I mentioned  reinvest in the business  The cadence by quarter is relatively consistent  It s not going to be back end loaded in a big way  So I would expect you could be pretty close to evenly split maybe 40  in the first half  60  in the back half James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerAnd if I could just add  When we look at the environment that we re in  over the last three years  the external headwinds have averaged about  300 million a year  And if you look at the five years preceding the  17 to  19  which would be the last three years  when you look at the previous five years  they averaged  135 million a year  So we had a step function change in headwinds and most of those headwinds at the beginning of the year or a significant proportion of them were    it was impossible to plan for them And so I think we re sitting here at this juncture with the potential that we could have headwinds of hundreds of millions of dollars  like we had over the past few years  and obviously  we have some of that in the plan  or not  or something less  And so it s only prudent to reserve a pretty significant contingency for the potential that we could have really  really significant headwind similarly we ve had over the last three years  And so that s kind of the way we re thinking about it  And if they don t come  then we have a fantastic opportunity to outperform our earnings as well as reinvest in the Company s growth OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is open Deepa Raghavan    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHey  good morning  Thanks for taking my question James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Deepa Raghavan    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHey  Question is on capital deployment  It s a good start especially purchasing some defense exposure with CAM  But  Don  how should we think about deployment pace    the pace of deployment going forward given it s  1 5 billion cash deal  it takes up much of the excess cash availability over the year even as you re deleveraging  Any thoughts there  And thank you James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerI m going to tackle that question because Don has had so many questions about guidance  I want to give him a break  But also  we both think about capital deployment quite a bit and we happen to agree on our approach  So  as most of you know  our long term capital deployment strategy is to allocate 50  of our excess capital to M A and 50  to giving back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases  And over the last 20 years  you will    if you calculate that  you will find that it actually turns out to be 50   50 50  And so we ve been true to that and we will continue to be true to that  because we think that    for this Company  that is the best value creation strategy for the long term And so we shouldn t look at these things necessarily in isolation  But from a tactical point of view  we were at 2 0 debt to EBITDA at the end of the year  This will take us up to 2 6 for a period of time until we work it down again  So there won t be a lot of M A activity of significant M A activity this year  unless something really significant comes along and then we look at what are the options  And going forward  we have the Security business  which is a potential asset to monetize if something really down the fairway came along our way  We also have the MTD options in front of us  but we have 10 years to execute that  So there is no pressing need to have probably about  2 billion of  when we finally implement    execute that option  It would be about  2 billion if we did it in the  21  22 time frame So I think we re in a great position from a tactical point of view too  We have the opportunity to create excess capital if we see something really great that we want to execute on in terms of M A  We also have the opportunity to kind of take 2020 as sort of a rebuild the balance sheet year back to where we want it to be for the dry powder and we ll go from there OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman   Associates  Your line is open Justin Speer    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThanks  guys  Just wanted to just follow up on the comments on the promotional cadence and channel inventories  You mentioned them being full for at least a portion of the Tools   Storage business  you mentioned promotions being a little bit more elevated in parts of the power tool business  I just wanted to get a sense for what s going on there and I m thinking about the incremental tariffs  incremental pricing  If these elements are going to make it really difficult to get incremental pricing to at least partially offset the carryover tariffs and currency Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I ll take that  The promotional activity  I would kind of summarize that as an intense holiday season  there were a lot of things going on in the power tool space and we ran probably higher level promotions than originally expected as we went into the quarter  which that can happen sometimes in a holiday season like the fourth quarter or even in the second quarter occasionally  as we go into the late spring and summer  So  I would just say that s things that happen and nothing really unusual about that I would also say that we did have a little bit of a reduction in the inventory in the channels by our customers  And so not a massive reduction in weeks on stock  but there was a little bit of a reduction in some of our major customers  which is good  because that s just managing their inventories appropriately  And as you know  in the case of one of our customers  in particular  they ve built a higher level of inventory due to a significant launch of Craftsman and that s going to have to continue to be something we monitor  But we re going to manage that throughout the year as we go through 2020 and still achieve 2 points of growth  as I mentioned  for Craftsman as we manage that dynamic  And if the POS continues to be strong the way it has been in double digits that    amount that we have to manage in inventory will become smaller and smaller As far as tariffs go  the  85 million carryover  a lot of that is tariffs that we ll put in place in the back half with some pricing put in place in that period as well  So there is a little bit of carryover price  but we re going to manage price more through the margin resiliency initiative versus specific pricing actions for tariffs  So  it will be a little bit of that associated with 4A  but that s not a large number OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America  Your line is open Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerHey  good morning Donald Allan    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI was just wondering  can you give little more details on CAM  like how profitable is the business  One of the transactions actually closed and so why is the accretion so far out  I realize these are series of same questions  but a number of questions  but just really some more color on CAM aftermarket versus OE and Boeing exposure and whatnot James M  Loree    President   Chief Executive OfficerSure  I mean  we re not disclosing the actual profitability level at the request of the CAM folks  However  suffice it to say that it s a high growth  high margin business and the substantial EBITDA and EBITDA growth potential ahead of it  The aftermarket is a pretty significant part of the revenue base  It has grown approximately 6  organically over the long term  So a very nice asset  high growth  high profitability  good aftermarket content and a lot of engineering content  which a lot of these components are in critical functions on the airplane  So we re very  very happy to have made this acquisition  It s a strategic platform  There are multitude of bolt on opportunities as well as some larger opportunities that may or may not become available over time  So  it just gives us a great runway for future growth OperatorThank you  This concludes the question and answer session  I would now like

158389,379905,SWK,Amid 737 MAX Woes  Stanley Black   Decker Buys Into Boeing s Supply Chain,news,"Toolmaker Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  is spending up to  1 5 billion to acquire privately held Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing  CAM   diving headfirst into the aerospace supply chain at a time when the industry is reeling due to Boeing s 737 MAX issues 
The move is not without risk  given the current state of the MAX  but Stanley B D has a history of making bold acquisitions work  The company was forged in 2010  just as the U S  economy was recovering from the Great Recession  via the merger of Stanley Tool Works and Black   Decker 
Stanley B D has added other tool brands in the years since  notably the storied Craftsman brand from Sears Holdings  but the company of late has turned its attention to new end markets  The company bought the Nelson industrial stud welding business for  440 million and the attachments business of International Equipment Solution for  690 million  but the CAM purchase is by far the biggest move in Stanley B D s push into new areas 
A new platform for growth
CAM is a manufacturer of specialty fasteners and components for aerospace and defense applications  generating about  375 million in revenue over the trailing twelve months  The deal creates a new platform for growth at Stanley Black   Decker  with aerospace revenue expected to go from zero in 2017 to 15  of pro forma sales this year 
The target generates about 87  of its revenue from commercial aerospace  with 9  coming from defense and the remainder from industrial applications 

Stanley B D CEO James M  Loree  on a call with investors  said that the company has been on the prowl for businesses with a global presence  strong engineering capabilities  and the potential for recurring revenue thanks to aftermarket  or spare part  sales  Aerospace parts businesses can be particularly profitable because the fasteners must meet exacting specifications and cannot be easily replicated  limiting competition and pricing pressure in many cases 
 This business has strong brands  a proven business model  deep customer relationships  and an experienced management team  which will create a pathway for profitable growth and value creation   Loree said   We re very  very happy to have made this acquisition  It s a strategic platform  There are multitude s  of bolt on opportunities as well as some larger opportunities that may or may not become available over time  
The buyer did not disclose exact CAM profitability figures  but Loree said    I t s a high growth  high margin business and has substantial EBITDA and EBITDA growth potential ahead of it  
Aerospace is flying into headwinds
The deal comes at a difficult moment for commercial aerospace suppliers  as the industry grapples with Boeing s move to shut down 737 MAX production as it awaits recertification of the plane 
In mid January  Spirit AeroSystems  maker of the plane s fuselage and other parts  announced the layoff of 2 800 employees as it looks to cut costs and preserve cash  And earlier in the month suppliers Woodward and Hexcel announced plans to merge and create a  6 4 billion entity better able to manage through the ups and downs of the industry 
Stanley B D did not detail how exposed CAM is to the 737 MAX  but the supplier is definitely affected  Terms of the agreement to buy CAM include  200 million held back and contingent on the 737 MAX receiving  timely  authorization to return to service and Boeing achieving certain  unspecified  production levels 
Despite its current problems  it still seems likely that Boeing will eventually be able to get the 737 MAX airborne and the plane will end up being a roaring success for the company  Airlines are expected to increase capacity by about 3 5  annually over the next 20 years  according to the International Air Transport Association  and Boeing enjoys a duopoly with Airbus that gives customers few alternatives if they need new aircraft 
Stanley Black   Decker  in doing this deal for CAM  is trying to take advantage of near term turbulence and uncertainty on the belief that Boeing and the 737 MAX will fly high eventually  And the company has the resources to be a consolidator and aggressively add businesses to its new CAM platform should the grounding last longer than expected and suppliers become more distressed 
A powerful collection of tools
Shares of Stanley Black   Decker have outperformed the market over the past five years  but back in October  the company warned that macroeconomic headwinds including  commodity inflation  currency  and tariffs  were taking their toll  The company managed to hit its targets in the fourth quarter  but its 2020 earnings guidance midpoint was  0 10 per share below the consensus estimate 
Late last year the company announced a cost reduction program aimed at generating about  200 million in annual savings  but there is only so much that can be done with its mature tool business  Stanley B D was a company in desperate need of new ways to generate growth  and CAM is its solution to that problem 

SWK vs  S P 500 data by YCharts
Acquisitions are fraught with risk  especially as buyers move into new areas outside of their traditional expertise  To its credit  Stanley Black   Decker has an established track record of doing deals well  and it helps that CAM s experienced management team will be there to help build the aerospace business 
The bull case for Stanley Black   Decker heading into 2020 was that a thawing of trade tensions  coupled with stable commodity prices and the company s efforts to restructure and reboot some of its tool brands  would help drive earnings higher  With CAM coming on board  the company potentially has a new way to win  It s going to take some time to play out  but I like the direction Stanley Black   Decker is heading ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq153,2073884

158457,379973,SWK,In Kenmore sale  Sears  pension liabilities come back to bite,news,"By Jessica DiNapoli  Reuters    Sears Holdings Corp  O SHLD  is facing a familiar foe in its bid to sell off the Kenmore appliances brand  the U S  government body that oversees the pensions for the company s 100 000 retirees  Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert s hedge fund  ESL Investments Inc  submitted bids last week of  400 million and  70 million for Kenmore and the department store s home improvement business  respectively  ESL hopes to have a final agreement as soon as Aug  24  which would end Sears  nearly two year search for a buyer  It is unclear if the Sears special committee selling the businesses will accept Lampert s offer  Lampert s strategy in bidding for the two businesses is to entice another potential buyer to the table  according to a person familiar with his thinking  Barring that  the goal is to help the 125 year old department store operator continue to fund its operations as it faces a cash crunch  the source said   But the government agency known as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  plans to use its right to effectively veto the Kenmore sale in order to negotiate a share of the anticipated proceeds from Sears  according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations  A spokeswoman for the PBGC declined to comment on the sale of Kenmore  known best for its refrigerators and washer and driers  But she said in a prepared statement   We continue to monitor Sears  financial situation    Sears declined to comment   The PBGC move mirrors its own successful tactic last year with Sears  when it won future cash payments from the company in exchange for agreeing to the sale of Sears  Craftsman tool line   The PBGC  funded in part by insurance premiums paid by companies  is responsible for covering workers  pensions if their former employer cannot  When companies face financial distress and are at risk of leaving the agency with a pension funding gap to cover  the PBGC can intervene to protect itself  pushing the employer to contribute more to worker retirements  The PBGC s stance could jeopardize Sears  efforts to raise money to stay in business  The retailer  which also runs Kmart discount shops  is burning through  1 billion to  1 5 billion annually  according to analysts  as it struggles to compete with online retailers such as Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and discount chains including Walmart Inc  N WMT    Sears has taken other measures to boost cash  inking a  425 million credit card deal with  Citigroup  Inc  N C  in May and selling  290 million in real estate in the first quarter  Sears cautioned investors last year that it may not be able to carry on as a going concern  The retailer  with  5 2 billion in borrowings on May 5  will aim to keep as much of the cash from the Kenmore sale as it can to help make it through the holiday season  the people said  Sears retirees  pensions face their own funding shortfall of  1 5 billion   For a related graphic  click  The PBGC now must strike a delicate balance between squeezing as much cash from Sears upfront as it can to plug its pension funding gap  without pushing the company into bankruptcy and jeopardizing any prospect of future payments as well as the jobs of the company s 89 000 workers  the sources said   Sears has contributed over  4 billion to its pension over the last decade  but this could be the PBGC s last chance to try to cover the shortfall it faces from Sears  Following the upcoming wave of divestitures  Sears will be left with assets including its battery label Diehard  roughly 100 Kmart and Sears stores not already used to back debt  and auto centers and home services businesses  a Fitch Ratings Inc analyst and sources said  If  Sears gets to bankruptcy  there s a chance that all of the choice assets will have already been sold   said Stephen Lubben  a Seton Hall law school professor who specializes in bankruptcy   The PBGC needs to keep their eye on the sale proceeds   The value of the remaining businesses and real estate has deteriorated as Sears has struggled to turn a profit  the people said  Sears is now a shadow of its former self  with a market capitalization of just  132 million  versus close to  30 billion in 2007   Lampert has invested and lent to Sears many times over the years  making him the company s largest shareholder with a stake just shy of 50 percent  as well as its biggest creditor  with about  2 1 billion owed to him or funds he controls  PBGC STRATEGY The PBGC plans to use its handling of the Sears sale of its tool line Craftsman last year as a blueprint for its negotiations on Kenmore  the sources said  Stanley Black   Decker Inc  N SWK  moved forward with its  900 million acquisition of Craftsman from Sears only after the PBGC gave its blessing  the sources said  In exchange  the PBGC won a  250 million payment  rights to a 15 year revenue stream stemming from new sales of the tool line  and liens on  100 million of the retailer s real estate   The PBGC s claims to Craftsman  Kenmore  and Diehard came after Sears spun out some of its real estate assets into a separate company   Seritage Growth Properties   N SRG   in 2015 in a  2 7 billion deal  The move in part led the agency to cut a deal with Sears giving it recourse to the retailer s other assets  one of the sources said  Selling Kenmore is part of Sears  transformation to an integrated online retailer  But as Sears sells off its crown jewels  the PBGC s chances of being repaid in full dwindle  leaving the agency to pick up the balance in a potential future bankruptcy  
 When a company gets into financial trouble  creditors try to improve their position  lending more money  giving more time  in exchange for a security interest  a better chance to be repaid   said Lynn LoPucki  a University of California  Los Angeles Law School professor  explaining that the PBGC has taken this tactic   We call this the dance of death  ",2018-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-kenmore-sale-sears-pension-liabilities-come-back-to-bite-1582534,1582534

158545,380061,SWK,Sears shares sink as investors fret over going concern risk,news,"By Nathan Layne and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Reuters    Sears Holdings Corp s  O SHLD  shares tumbled as much as 16 percent on Wednesday as bondholders and investors questioned how long the storied retailer could remain in business after it flagged doubts that it could continue as a going concern  For several years  the parent of Sears  Roebuck and Co and Kmart has taken on big losses  closed stores and divested businesses as it faced stiff competition  A changing retail landscape in which many brick and mortar retailers have gone bust and e commerce has boomed has also plagued the retailer   The warning on Tuesday added a new element of uncertainty for a company that has  13 19 billion in liabilities and said it could have difficulty obtaining merchandise from vendors  Bondholders are watching to see whether Sears will have the cash and credit needed to stock its shelves for the crucial 2017 holiday season  Sears Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar wrote in a blog post on Wednesday that the company had boosted its liquidity by up to  1 billion through loan agreements and amended an existing credit facility to provide an additional  250 million  among other steps to improve performance and finances   As 2016 proved to be another challenging year for most  bricks and mortar  retailers  our disclosures reflected these developments   Hollar wrote   While historical performance drives the disclosure  our financial plans and forecast do not reflect the continuation of that performance    Many question the company s chances for survival  however  Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011   The retail industry is just too competitive  the brand value of Sears has diminished dramatically  the seismic shifts in consumer spending both in terms of the move to e commerce and to experiences don t bode well for Sears   said Ken Perkins  president of industry research firm Retail Metrics   We have seen a spate of Chapter 11 filings in recent months  and it is difficult to see how Sears avoids the same fate   Shares of Sears were down 11 9 percent at  8 02 in late afternoon after falling to  7 60  their largest one day percentage decline since an 18 79 percent drop on Nov  16  2012  THE FATE OF AN AMERICAN RETAIL ICON Sears  Roebuck and Co   and its famed catalog   was once an American retailing icon  The company traces its origins to 1886  when Minnesota railroad station agent Richard Sears bought an unwanted shipment of watches  then sold them  at a nice profit   according to the company s website   The company was also a mail order pioneer  selling a wide variety of goods to farmers and others in far flung rural areas  By 1895  its 532 page catalog s offerings included a treasure trove of offerings  It was not until 1925 that Sears opened its first retail store   and that was an experiment  according to the website  But keeping up with the times has been costly as nimbler competitors  internet shopping and empty malls have taken a toll and the company has had to restructure  Some analysts and industry experts wonder if the efforts can pull it out of its current situation   They would need to make so many cost cuts  the business wouldn t exist anymore   said Neil Saunders  managing director of retail at research firm GlobalData   They can t make all of those cuts because they have lease obligations and contractual obligations  The business is fundamentally broken  Its liabilities outweigh its assets   The only way it could survive is enter bankruptcy protection and have a fundamental restructuring  which would be extremely painful   he added   There s no other option   The company has been controlled by its billionaire chief executive  Edward Lampert  who has cut U S  stores by nearly a third  reduced holdings in Sears Canada and spun off the Lands  End clothing chain  The company has also placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust  sold its Craftsman line of tools and repeatedly raised debt from Lampert s hedge fund   This revelation in their annual report that they may not be able to continue as a going concern is really just another step towards what is inevitably going to be a financial collapse   said Mark Cohen  former CEO of Sears Canada and director of retail studies at Columbia Business School  BLOW TO LAMBERT The news is a blow to Lampert  who took command of Sears after merging it with Kmart  which he controlled  in 2004  Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the REIT that paid Sears  2 6 billion in 2015 for the stores it purchased  many of which were then leased back to the retailer  The company had said that actions taken to boost liquidity  including the Craftsman sale to power tool maker Stanley Black   Decker Inc  N SWK   could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year  But in a filing on Tuesday it also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic  As part of the Craftsman sale  Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp that puts a claim on some assets to protect pensions of retired employees  The agreement  contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets   the company said  Already  the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a  250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March 2020  and the pension board has a 15 year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products   As the 2017 holiday season nears  Sears will need cash  Retailers typically book orders for merchandise for the vital fourth quarter from now through midsummer  The company said continued operating losses could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement  Since 2012  Sears  annual revenue has fallen 47 percent to  22 1 billion  and the company has posted  10 54 billion in losses  including  2 22 billion in the year ended Jan  28   The company has  286 million in cash on hand  down from  609 million in 2012  At the same time  receivables  which retailers in distress often use to fund operations  fell to  466 million from  635 million   Saunders said Sears would probably have a hard time meeting its obligations as the year progresses

158546,380062,SWK,Sears  plan to sell brands no salve for financial woes,news,"By Jan Wolfe  Reuters    Sears  plan to avoid bankruptcy in part by selling off or licensing brands including Kenmore and DieHard may prove difficult because of changing consumer tastes and possible legal roadblocks  Sears Holdings Corp  once the largest U S  retailer  warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales  The Kenmore brand for appliances and the DieHard brand for car batteries are among the best known remaining assets of the U S  retailer  whose roots date back to 1886  In January  Sears sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black   Decker Inc  NYSE SWK  for  900 million  Sears  which also owns Kmart Corp  has dozens of other in house apparel and houseware brands  Analysts in the past four years have collectively valued the Craftsman  Kenmore and DieHard brands at up to  3 billion  However  several industry consultants and restructuring experts said the worth of those assets has declined as Sears has fallen out of favor with consumers  Like their parent  Sears brands are hampered by a perception that they are yesterday s names   Sears is serving a customer base that is over the age of 50 or 55   said Doug Stephens  an independent retail industry consultant  As younger consumers increasingly embrace  smart appliances   they do not perceive the 90 year old Kenmore brand as being at the cutting edge of technology  he said  Sears declined to comment  Fitch Ratings said in January Sears would need to raise  2 billion in 2017 to avoid bankruptcy and another  2 billion in 2018   NOT A THROWAWAY BRAND  Because of Sears  shaky financial situation  potential buyers of Sears  brands would have to confront some unusual hurdles  Any asset sale would need approval from the U S  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp  a government agency that protects retirement incomes for American workers   Sears made a deal with the PBGC in March 2016 to use certain intellectual property and real estate assets to fulfill its pension obligations  The agency signed off on the Craftsman sale only after securing a promise from Sears that its pension plans would receive a  250 million payment and a 15 year income stream from Stanley Black   Decker s sales of Craftsman products   Another obstacle to selling the Kenmore and DieHard brands is the prospect that Sears could end up filing for bankruptcy  If it does  unhappy creditors could retroactively challenge a sale and ask a judge to void it as  a fraudulent conveyance  intended to hide assets  David Tawil  president of the hedge fund Maglan Capital  which invests in distressed companies but does not have a stake in Sears  said that was unlikely  but the risk might deter some buyers  Kenmore was once the top U S  appliance brand  But its share of the home appliances market fell from 17 4 percent in 2011 to 12 7 percent in the twelve months ending in March 2016  according to the Stevenson Company  a market research firm  DieHard s share of the auto battery market dropped to 5 2 percent from about 7 percent during the same period  the firm said  Sears itself has lowered the book value of its intangible assets  which include the brands and other items like internet domain names and customer goodwill  from around  4 5 billion in 2011 to  1 8 billion in January   Greg Portell  a retail industry consultant with A T  Kearney  said he believes Sears brands can still command a strong price  He said big box retailers or hardware superstores might take over the Kenmore brand to launch an in house line  And lesser known foreign manufacturers might see it as a way to gain a foothold in the U S  market    This is not a throwaway brand that someone is going to shut down   Portell said  The company has already raised some money from the Kenmore name  In February  Sears announced it reached a licensing agreement with the grill manufacturer Permasteel Inc that allows the company to sell Kenmore branded grills  Financial terms of that transaction were not disclosed  Gene Baldwin  a restructuring expert at the financial advisory firm CR3 Partners  said it is unlikely Sears can generate the liquidity it needs just from selling or licensing its brands  The retailer s most valuable assets are its real estate holdings  he said

158564,380080,SWK,Melker Schorling  Sweden s quiet tycoon with the Midas touch,news,"By Mia Shanley and Niklas Pollard STOCKHOLM  Reuters    Business tycoon Melker Schorling  one of Sweden s most prominent investors  says he is well positioned to expand his 60 billion crown   7 billion  investment empire even as he prepares to hand over affairs to his daughters  MSAB  the holding company he set up in 1999 which spans a diverse set of companies from measurement technology to locks and guards  has consistently outperformed larger rivals  Investors attribute Schorling s success to a knack for picking small specialists which go on to become global market leaders  In a decade  MSAB has had returns of over 500 percent  outperforming rivals such as Wallenberg backed Investor AB and Industrivarden and leading Swedish media to dub Schorling  King Midas  of the Stockholm bourse  MSAB investors include H M chairman Stefan Persson and  BP   LON BP    AB Volvo Chairman Carl Henric Svanberg  But while Schorling s path to success has had few bumps  some analysts are beginning to question the future of the group which has not made a single new investment in a decade  Schorling turns 70 next year and although his daughters have become more involved they have not yet stepped into high profile executive roles  and he recently lost one of his closest team members  MSAB CEO Ulrik Svensson  who leaves at year end to join Lufthansa as CFO  Svensson s departure raises some questions about the group s direction and stability  analysts say  Schorling  who shies away from media appearances  is not planning major changes   We are very long term oriented and it is highly likely that our holdings will be the same for many years to come   he told Reuters in an email  But opportunity may be on the horizon for MSAB which has six listed companies like Assa Abloy  the world s biggest maker of locks  Securitas  the world s second biggest provider of guards  and Hexagon  market leader in precision measurement technology   For the time being we have actually divested a bit from our holdings to make sure that we have enough dry powder for future investments   he said   Valuation multiples are high at the moment and we believe there could be interesting investment opportunities in the future   While Brexit worries have hit shares   the STOXX Europe Industrial Goods   Services Index is down 8 5 percent on the year   the S P 500 remains at record highs  Nordea analyst Elias Porse reckons Svensson s departure could trigger a  generational renewal  of MSAB  with one of the daughters stepping in as CEO  though a CFO from a portfolio company could be appointed instead  Both Sofia and Marta are board members for MSAB and its investment companies   Ultimately they will take over but we do not have a specific timing for that   Schorling said  Schorling and his CEO proteges are bellwethers for investors who will be watching any investment moves closely   Last year  when Schorling and Hexagon CEO Ola Rollen bought into fingerprint sensor maker Next Biometrics through their high tech focused Greenbridge Partners  shares nearly doubled on the day  Shares in mining gear maker Sandvik jumped when Assa Abloy s CEO was named chair  Those near Schorling say he has an eye for talent  He insists his leaders take large stakes  so they reap the benefits or bleed together  Rollen s own wealth has multiplied since taking the job in 2000  when he took an unsecured loan equal to two years  salary to buy options   a large bet by Swedish standards   Had I been older  wiser and been able to do the math better at the time  I would probably never have done it   he said with a laugh  reflecting on his financial gamble  Just his Hexagon B shares are now worth almost  50 million  Schorling believes he may have  a good gut feeling for people   He looks for entrepreneurship  long term thinking and a  very healthy lack of bureaucracy  in all his CEOs  Unlike the current generation of Wallenbergs who inherited vast investment empires  farmer s son Schorling built his fortune on a first bet on Securitas for which he took a massive bank loan for  Last year  he was the sixth wealthiest Swede  according to magazine Veckans Affarer  His group s net asset value falls just short of Industrivarden s  It and Investor are the traditional investment behemoths of Swedish business  Still  MSAB struggled through the 2008 crisis when debts at Hexagon  its crown jewel at over half its portfolio  sent shares in both tumbling  Hexagon s net debt to equity ratio has since more than halved  Instead of transforming cash handling business Loomis early on as countries like Sweden moved towards being cashless  MSAB whittled down its holding in March this year  Another misstep came when Securitas spun off its hi tech Niscayah unit in 2006 and wound up getting outbid by Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  when it tried to buy it back five years later  MSAB is closely tied to the highs and lows of the industrial cycle  Asked about this  Schorling said there were no plans to change the asset mix to even things out   We do not think in diversification terms   he said   Some of the companies are affected by the industrial cycle but they have been well tested in the financial crisis   MSAB will likely keep growing through M A by its holdings   They do have the benefit of synergies which means it is much easier for them to make a good return on an acquisition   Schorling said  A senior banker who has worked with some of Schorling s companies described his style as highly effective   It would have to be a really big investment or M A deal for it to be raised up centrally to top management   he said  Schorling may be in the driver s seat for some time to come  Carl Bek Nielsen  an MSAB board member and chair of United International Enterprises   its third biggest shareholder   said Schorling was not stepping down anytime soon   I bet you if he were a car and you opened up his bonnet  there would be a fantastic V8 engine well lubricated and ready to go another 400 000 kilometers   he told Reuters

158658,380174,SWK,Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tool company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 16 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 78 billion  up 3 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 25  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black   Decker 
For Stanley Black   Decker  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Stanley Black   Decker will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stanley Black   Decker would post earnings of  2 02 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 13  delivering a surprise of  5 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Stanley Black   Decker appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stanley-black--decker-swk-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200500678,200500678

engineered fastening systems and motion control systems  Arc welding products  oxy fuel cutting equipment  plasma cutters  storage system and other related products are also produced by some tool makers The highly advanced tools are used in industrial  commercial  oil   gas  mining  automotive  and other industries  Providers of electronic security solutions cater to demand in the commercial  retailers  government  financial and healthcare markets  Two important players in the industry are Lincoln Electric Holdings  Inc   LECO  and Sandvik AB  SDVKY  Here are the industry s three major themes The industry is suffering from adverse impacts of global uncertainties  including those related to Brexit   strained trade relations and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  among others  It is worth noting here that the International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth projection for the global economy by 20 basis points  bps  for 2019 and by 10 bps for 2020  The companies are facing headwinds from disturbed trade relations of the United States with other nations  especially China  Notably  imposition of tariffs by the United States on the import of steel  aluminum and an array of other products triggered the tensions  Tariffs have been hurting corporate margins  as a result of escalation in raw material costs  over the past few quarters  Commodity inflation  high labor costs and freight charges have also added to the woes  The industry s cost of sales increased 10 1  year over year in 2018 and 3 7  in the first nine months of 2019  Meanwhile  the government s efforts to lower tariff related woes by reaching a phase one trade deal with China might be a relief  Focus on infrastructural development in the country  increasing use of sophisticated technologies in manufacturing process and demand for remodeling activities are aiding the industry  Also  the growing adoption of e retailing has created business opportunities for tool makers  Added to these  the corporate tax overhaul  introduced in December 2017  will continue to aid industry players  Further  month over month gain in industrial production in November 2019 is a healthy sign for manufacturing companies  The industry s revenues increased 7 6  year over year in 2018 and 1 4  in the first nine months of 2019 Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe Manufacturing Tools   Related

outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of dull earnings prospects for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimates have declined 10 8  Before we discuss a few stocks in the industry  let s take a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation Industry Outperforms S P

158692,380208,SWK,Should Value Investors Pick Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Stanley Black   Decker  Inc    NYSE SWK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Stanley Black   Decker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 79  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 49  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Stanley Black   Decker s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 49  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Stanley Black   Decker has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 12  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Stanley Black   Decker stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Stanley Black   Decker has a P S ratio of about 1 56  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 26 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  SWK is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Stanley Black   Decker currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Stanley Black   Decker a solid choice for value investors    What About the Stock Overall    Though Stanley Black   Decker might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives SWK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen eight estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen six downward revision compared to one upward in the same time period     This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 9 4  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has declined by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Stanley Black   Decker  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Stanley Black   Decker is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 4  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Manufacturing   Tools   Related Products industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best

158696,380212,SWK,Why Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  in Focus
Based in New Britain  Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 15 49   The tool company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 69 per share  with a dividend yield of 2   This compares to the Manufacturing   Tools   Related Products industry s yield of 1 96  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 9  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 76 is up 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Stanley Black   Decker has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 07   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Stanley Black   Decker s current payout ratio is 32   meaning it paid out 32  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
SWK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 58 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 28  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  SWK is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-09-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-stanley-black--decker-swk-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200467894,200467894

While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  SWK is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-stanley-black--decker-swk-could-be-a-great-choice-200455496,200455496

158747,380263,SWK,Earnings Preview  Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tool company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 31 billion  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 6  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black   Decker 
For Stanley Black   Decker  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 97  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black   Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stanley Black   Decker would post earnings of  2 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Stanley Black   Decker doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-stanley-black--decker-swk-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200407699,200407699

What s Next for Stanley Black   Decker 
While Stanley Black   Decker has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

158751,380267,SWK,All Time Stock Highs  Risk Renting Will Outshine Risk Taking,opinion,"There has been a great deal of media hype surrounding new all time highs in the U S  stock market  For that matter  there has been a fair amount of puffery when it comes to how well stocks are performing overall 
In actuality  we have seen similar levels for the S P 500 twice before  The S P 500 traded around the 2925 level in September of 2018 and the 2875 level back in January of 2018  The last 16 months  then  have not been quite as productive as some would have you believe 

Granted  a genuine breakout can still occur  The Federal Reserve s astonishing flip flop from quantitative tightening  QT  to neutrality may continue to reward indiscriminate risk taking 
In truth  the financial markets are responding in a similar fashion to the way that they did two decades ago  Back in 1998  the Fed acted to arrest the development of a bearish shock from the Asian Currency Crisis  The monetary policy easing stoked irrational exuberance for nearly two additional years 

It is worth noting  however  that the  Fed Put  has a checkered past  It worked during 1998 s Asian Currency Crisis  2011 s Euro zone sovereign debt calamity  and 2018 s quantitative tightening  QT  quandary  Yet the  Fed Put  failed miserably throughout the tech wreck  2000 2002  and the housing collapse  2008 2009  
Specifically  the Federal Reserve eased aggressively in attempts to stop the stock carnage in the previous two bears  To no avail  Once the investment community began doubting the ultra cheap cost of capital story  those asset balloons lost 50  of their hot air 

Supposedly  the Federal Reserve exists to moderate inflation and to maximize employment  In reality  the chief circumstances that matter to members of the Open Market Committee  FOMC  are higher stock prices as well as lower bond yields to help corporations support those stock shares 
How can we be sure  For one thing  researchers have provided the empirical evidence   Read the Economics of the  Fed Put  by Duke University s Anna Cieslak  
For another  the Fed responded to the precipitous decline in stock prices last year by vowing to terminate balance sheet reduction and to refrain from any rate hiking this year  These promises came in spite of meeting inflation targets and employment objectives 
Many are cheering the rally off of the December stock lows  Yet others are less confident about its sustainability on this go around 
Consider margin debt  When the investment community is confident that stocks will rise  participants often employ leverage  They ve been less inclined to do so in 2019  In fact  the S P 500 is charting new record highs at a time when margin debt is not 

Perhaps margin debt users do not wish to be burned the way that they were in 2000 s dot com disaster  At that time  80  of initial public offerings  IPOs  came from unprofitable companies  In 2018  81  of IPOs posted negative earnings 

One additional sign that things may be too far out of whack is the relationship between growth stocks and value stocks  When examining the price ratio of iShares Russell 1000 Growth  NYSE IWF   iShares Russell 1000 Value  NYSE IWD   one sees the type of valuation gap folly that occurred back in the tech bubble days 

So how might one manage the current risk reward scenario s   With the S P 500 trading at record levels  With increasingly questionable common stock valuations  Rent modest risk 
For instance  if one is carrying a 60 40 stock bond allocation  rein in the nature of the  stock  and the  bond  in the mix  Modify the stock component such that  value    dividend  and  non cyclicals  play larger roles  We own exchange traded trackers like S P 500 SPDR High Dividend  NYSE SPYD   SPDR S P 500 Value  NYSE SPYV  and Invesco Mid Cap Low Volatility  NYSE XMLV  
Another way to moderate the aggressiveness of one s stock is to shift from common shares to preferred shares  The Fed s neutrality gives a lift to higher quality preferred stock shares like Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK   Inc  5 75  Junior Subordinated Debenture due 2052  SWJ   VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF  NYSE PFXF  is another worthy contender for ETF fans 
Additionally  far too many companies carry poor quality debt profiles  If you re holding too much high yield  junk  debt  shift to higher quality  iShares Aaa A Rated Corporate Bond ETF  NYSE QLTA  is a reasonable consideration  In the same vein  ultra short term debt in JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Ultra Short Income  NYSE JPST  that yields 2 4  is safer and smarter than overplaying one s pursuit of 5 5  in B or C rated junk 
Finally  rebalancing to a more modest posture may require additional risk reduction measures  If you believe as I believe that an  Everything Bubble  exists  you ll require a technical approach for raising cash  Financial talk radio listeners  1998 2005  and online readers  2005 present  know that I employ the slope of the 10 month SMA  its monthly close and the NYSE Advance Decline  A D  Line to sidestep the bulk of bearish declines

Barron s has an interesting article How Investors Should Navigate Globalization s Decline 
A decadeslong drive toward freer trade across borders has begun to reverse  Globalization is being overwhelmed by populism  nationalism  and protectionism

 I probably never would have said it was going to end  but I m starting to wonder   says Don Allan  chief financial officer at Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK    The trend seems to be heading that way  Countries are becoming more focused on protecting their world and less on how to work together as a global economy  

China Decreasing Influence Percentagewise


GoerTek   a Chinese company that makes Apple s AirPods  reportedly told suppliers last year that it was moving production to Vietnam  It will join companies like LG Electronics  066570 South Korea  and Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   SSNLF   And it s not just tech  Chemical company Huntsman  HUN  announced last summer that it had opened a plant in Vietnam  its first in Asia outside China  In fact  manufacturing grew more in Vietnam than in any other major Asian country last year  IHS Markit has calculated 

Misleading Percentages
The above chart and a focus on percentages are misleading  The US trade deficit with China has been hitting fresh highs 
Tariffs  Robotics  Wages  Transportation Costs
The article concluded  The tectonic plates of global trade are in motion  Even a handshake between Trump and Xi won t stop that shift  
I agree  but shifts were underway before Trump became president  But as the article notes  Trump s tariffs definitely accelerated the trend 
It was a rise in labor costs in China that led to China losing manufacturing jobs not only to robots but to Vietnam 
Manufacturing Employment

Thanks to robots  some manufacturing has returned  but without the jobs  It takes fewer and fewer people to do anything  Minus wages and transportation costs  it makes sense for manufacturing to be close to the end buyer 
Yesterday s Battle
Trump is fighting a losing battle  Manufacturing those jobs are gone and they won t return 
Real Problem
Trump has his eyes in the rearview mirror  He wants to bring back manufacturing jobs when those jobs are in decline for the long haul 
More problematic for the US is China s new focus on high end technology as opposed to routine assembly 
The US needs to focus on the jobs of the future  not the jobs of the past 
Trade talks with a spotlight on soybeans  phone assemblies  etc will not help the US  Tariffs have not and will not solve a single problem 
Meanwhile  somehow the US has fallen behind on 5G  That s not good  to say the least

158775,380291,SWK,Top Research Reports For Verizon  Goldman Sachs   Kinder Morgan,opinion,"Thursday  March 21  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon  VZ   Goldman Sachs  GS  and Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Verizon s shares have gained  21 6  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of  4  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Verizon remains poised to benefit from the upcoming 5G boom as it aims to launch the 5G Ultra Wideband network in Chicago and Minneapolis in April  
Subsequently  it plans to increase the tally of 5G Ultra Wideband mobility cities to 30 in 2019  It further combines end to end fiber network with a large deployment of small cells for improved connectivity and millimeter wave bandwidth  Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising should also stoke growth 
However  Verizon continues to struggle in a competitive and saturated U S  wireless market  where spectrum crunch has become a major issue  The wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers and aggressive triple play offerings by cable firms  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts  contracting its margins 
 You can   
Shares of Goldman Sachs have gained  24 8  in the past three months  outperforming the  18 8  gain of the Zacks Investment Banking industry  Further  the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  outpacing expectations in all the trailing four quarters 
The Zacks analyst thinks the company s well diversified business and focus to capitalize on growth opportunities through strategic moves  along with cost control efforts  will continue to strengthen the overall business  Also  its focus on digitization initiatives bode well 
However  declining revenues from the Institutional Client Services division remain a hindrance to the bottom line expansion  Notably  Goldman has been embroiled in the heightened scandal related to the multibillion dollar 1Malaysia Development Bhd  1MDB   which is a major concern 
 You can   
Kinder Morgan s shares have gained  11  in the six months  outperforming the  6  increase of the Zacks Oil   Gas Pipeline industry  The Zacks analyst emphasizes that Kinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America that spreads over almost 84 000 miles

benefit from the upcoming 5G boom as it aims to launch the 5G Ultra Wideband network in Chicago and Minneapolis in April Subsequently  it plans to increase the tally of 5G Ultra Wideband mobility cities to 30 in 2019  It further combines end to end fiber network with a large deployment of small cells for improved connectivity and millimeter wave bandwidth  Focus on online content delivery

158799,380315,SWK,Analysts Estimate Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tool company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 60 billion  up 5 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 44  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black   Decker 
For Stanley Black   Decker  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black   Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stanley Black   Decker would post earnings of  2 02 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 08  delivering a surprise of  2 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Stanley Black   Decker doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-stanley-black--decker-swk-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200375731,200375731

158831,380347,SWK,Here s Why I Like Stanley Black   Decker ,opinion,"Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK  is a leading manufacturer of hand tools  home security systems  industrial solutions and general hardware  In the following analyze out loud video I will illustrate that this Dividend Aristocrat has generated an above average record of operating growth  As a result  the company has also produced dividend growth averaging 5 8  per annum since 1999 
Moreover  Stanley Black   Decker was an overvalued Dividend Aristocrat in 2015  2016 and 2017  However  since the beginning of 2018  the company s stock price has fallen roughly 20   Although this has created a better value than we ve seen in several years  I do think the stock remains moderately overvalued  On the other hand  if the company meets future expectations and the market values the stock at historical norms  then SWK would represent an attractive dividend growth stock at current levels 
The following video takes a by the numbers look at Stanley Black   Decker  which includes a resurgence in earnings growth that has transpired since the beginning of 2013  Growth over this timeframe has been better than the long term historical average  which likely explains why it became overvalued the last couple years  and perhaps why its current valuation might make economic sense today 

Summary And Conclusions
I believe that Stanley Black   Decker is a Dividend Aristocrat offering the potential for above average total return over the next several years  Although the current dividend yield is moderate  its expected operating growth should also translate into continuous dividend growth  I see the stock as a fairly valued long term investment opportunity with an above average total return potential through a combination of sound valuation  dividend growth and capital appreciation

158912,380428,SWK,U S  Manufacturing Activity Hits 13 Year High  Top 5 Winners,opinion,A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13 year high in September  thanks to two major hurricanes  Increased demand for rebuilding supplies somewhat drove manufacturing activity The improvement was largely driven by strength in new orders  while other survey components including measures of production  export orders and employment grew at a faster clip in September  Banking on such bullish trends  investing in stocks from the manufacturing sector might prove lucrative now  Factory Activity Surged in SeptemberAccording to the Institute of Supply Management  ISM   the manufacturing index climbed to 60 8  in September from 58 8  in August  scaling the highest since May 2004  Notably  17 of the 18 industries reported growth last month  led by textile mills and machinery  Only one industry  furniture manufacturing  witnessed a decline Nevertheless  such an unusually high number of industries reporting expansion reflected underlying economic strength that s been developing over the last eight years  The economy  in fact  expanded 3 1  in the second quarter due to an uptick in consumer spending on strength in the labor market Any reading above 50 indicates increased factory activity  which accounts for 12  of the U S  economy  The ISM survey  in fact  showed that the manufacturing index has remained above the desired level for the last 13 months  Here s a look at how the index fared this year Average for 2017   57 1High   60 8Low   54 8 Source  Institute for Supply Management Inside the ReportNew orders  production  new export orders and hiring increased last month  The index of new orders jumped 4 3 points to 64 6   Orders are also expected to remain strong in the coming months as inventory level remained at a six year low   Timothy R  Fiore  Chair of the ISM  added that  order input continues at a strong pace averaging 61 6 percent since December 2016 setting the pace for production activity   The nation s production has been strong  courtesy of higher global demand and U S  capital outlays  The production index increased 1 2 points to 62 2   The ISM survey also showed a pickup in its measure of exports since producers benefitted from a weaker dollar this year  which made U S  products less expensive in foreign markets  Meanwhile  the ISM s order backlogs index surged to its highest level since April 2011  which explains why more manufacturing hubs are stepping up hiring  The ISM survey indicated that a measure of employment rose to 60 3   its strongest reading since 2011 What Lifted Manufacturing Activity U S  factory activity hit record highs last month after hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted supplies but drove demand for manufactured goods  Harvey  the first major hurricane to hit the U S  mainland in almost 12 years  had put vast areas under water  The onslaught of the torrential rainfall followed the storm  which originated in the Gulf of Mexico  The rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4  Harvey had forced the shutdown of Houston area refineries and chemical plants  while several car dealerships and merchandise were destroyed While Houston  Texas and other parts of the Gulf reeled under the effects of Harvey  Irma hit the Sun Shine state of Florida  Irma is the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record  which has caused widespread devastation in Florida as well as the French Caribbean island territories 5 Top Manufacturing

158977,380493,SWK,Newell  Game Plan In Action  Inks Deal To Sell Tools Brands,opinion,The Sharpie producer  Newell Brands Inc    NYSE NWL   made a series of announcements last week with regard to a strategic business review performed after its acquisition of Jarden Corp  As part of the review  the company had revealed intentions to sell nearly 10  of its current portfolio  including a major chunk of its Tools segment Progressing along those lines  Newell inked a definite deal to sell its Irwin  Lenox and Hilmor brands of the Tools segment  to Stanley Black   Decker Inc    NYSE SWK    This deal  anticipated to conclude in the first half of 2017  is expected to generate gross proceeds of about  1 95 billion that will be utilized to repay the company s debt  This  in turn  will take Newell closer to its leverage ratio target of 3 3 5 times EBITDA  by the end of 2018 The units that are put up for sale generated net sales of roughly  760 million over the last 12 months  thus contributing decently to the company s overall results  However  management at Newell believes that its Tools business is likely to benefit more by being part of Stanley Black  which is one of the international leaders in that space  Nonetheless  the company decided to retain its Dymo Industrial labeling business  of the Tools segment  within its portfolio Apart from Irwin  Lenox and Hilmor  Newell had unveiled plans to divest many other businesses  including the Outdoor Solutions Segment s Winter Sports businesses  the Heaters  Humidifiers  and Fans operations within the Consumer Solutions Segment  and the Home Solutions Segment s Consumer Storage Container unit  These divisions generated sales worth approximately  700 million in 2015 Notably  all these divestitures constitute nearly  100 million of the company s previously announced plan of exiting product lines with annual sales of  200  300 million across its combined business with Jarden  over the next two to three years Further  the divestiture forms part of Newell s new growth game plan of transforming into an operating company  from a holding company   with fresh investment plans and new ideas for its combined portfolio with Jarden  Accordingly  Newell had announced plans to make its operating structure simpler  by reducing its existing 32 business units by exactly half   thereby creating 16 operating divisions  This will also include the establishment of an all new e commerce unit that operates internationally This underscores Newell s efforts toward keeping pace with the evolving consumer environment  where digital and physical stores go hand in hand  Also  these changes reflect the company s focus on simplifying its operating structure  alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential   Incidentally  following these divestitures  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company will align its resources to more profitable areas like Writing  Home Fragrance  Baby  Food Storage   Preparation  Appliances   Cookware  and Outdoor   Recreation  This in turn is likely to position the company for a better future with stronger prospects Management had earlier stated that these changes will not have any material impact on Newell s core sales or normalized earnings per share  EPS  outlook for 2016  However  the company now expects normalized EPS dilution of roughly 15 cents on an annualized basis  if the aforementioned Tools segment brands are divested by Dec 31  2016  Otherwise  the company maintained its core sales growth outlook of 3 4  for 2016  while normalized EPS for the same time period is expected in the range of  2 75  2 90  NEWELL BRANDS Price     Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also count on other well ranked consumer stocks like Tupperware Brands Corporation   NYSE TUP   and Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ OLLI    each with a Zacks Rank  2  You can see Ollie s Bargain has to its credit a spectacular earnings trend as the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise over the past four quarters  Moreover  its long term EPS growth rate of 20 2  and positive estimate revisions over the past 60 days help it stand strong against the industry Tupperware  with a long term EPS growth rate of 11   has delivered back to back positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/newell:-game-plan-in-action,-inks-deal-to-sell-tools-brands-200158528",200158528

159028,380544,SWK,Finding Value In Today s Market   Sector By Sector ,opinion,Introduction I think the market is overvalued now   is a common refrain that I m hearing from most of the individual investors I have recently been coming in contact with  Consequently  many of these same investors are also currently eschewing investing in common stocks because of that fear  Although I do not agree that the market is currently overvalued  I believe I understand why so many people think it is  Individual investors currently believe the market is overvalued because of two common fallacies that at first blush appear to be logical This is the first  of what will be a sequence of 10 subsequent articles designed to show how retirees  or pre retirees  can construct dividend growth portfolios comprised of high quality blue chip stocks all purchased at fair value  in spite of what many believe to be an overvalued market  I do not believe that investors should be denied the opportunity to create sound and prudent portfolios capable of producing long term capital appreciation and a growing dividend income stream at reasonable levels of risk because of unsubstantiated fears based on the fallacy that all stocks are overvalued Simply stated  I will clearly illustrate that they are not  Some are  but many are not  Moreover  I further intend to demonstrate that there are a more than adequate number of undervalued stocks with which investors can build conservative high quality and properly diversified dividend growth portfolios in today s environment The First Fallacy  Stocks Are At All Time Highs And Therefore OvervaluedThe first fallacy is based on what appears to be the logical conclusion that since many stocks are trading at all time highs that they must simultaneously be overvalued  In truth  a stock can be trading at an all time high  and still be reasonably priced or even undervalued  Below I offer two clear examples  one that is undervalued and one that is fairly valued  to illustrate my point  For the sake of balance  I will also add a third example of a stock that actually is overvalued  As I will elaborate on later  is a market of stocks not a stock market International Business Machines  IBM  Is Undervalued But Price Is At An All Time HighI offer the following 21 year earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on IBM as a case in point of an undervalued stock trading at an all time high  Clearly  IBM s stock price is the highest that it s ever been  even though its current P E ratio of 13 is below its historical normal P E ratio of 16 8  Therefore  even though IBM is trading at an all time high price  its current valuation is historically low because earnings  the orange line  have actually grown faster than the stock price The following graph plotting IBM s historical year end P E ratio is another way to see this clearly  A quick glance shows that the historical fiscal year end P E ratios on IBM  the black squares on the dark blue line  show that IBM s P E ratio has actually been falling since 1999  and is currently on the low end of normal  To repeat  IBM reflects a situation where earnings growth has been much stronger than price appreciation  and therefore  the shares remain undervalued even though share price is at an all time high  The above graphs illustrate that IBM is undervalued based on historical earnings growth rates  The following estimated earnings and return calculator graph shows that it is also moderately undervalued based on current consensus forecasts  Stanley Black   Decker Inc  Is Fairly Valued But Price Is At An All Time HighThe following 21 year earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on Stanley Black   Decker  SWK  clearly illustrate that the company is currently fairly valued  The black monthly closing stock price  the black line  is sitting right on the orange earnings justified valuation line indicating fair value  Consequently  in this example  we not only see that price clearly tracks earnings over the long run  we also see several examples when the stock was overvalued  the price is above the orange line  and when the stock was undervalued  the price was below the orange line   But more importantly  we see that price always returns to fair value  whether it is over or under  Nevertheless  Stanley Black   Decker is trading within its all time highs  but yet the company remains fairly priced with a P E ratio of 15 5 A review of the historical fiscal year end P E ratios of Stanley Black   Decker show that its current P E ratio is clearly within its normal range of valuation  In other words  although the stock price is near an all time high  current valuation is well within its earnings justified levels  and even arguably slightly on the low side of normal value  The consensus 5 year earnings forecast for Stanley Black   Decker expect earnings growth to accelerate to 12  per annum  This rate of growth justifies a 15 to 16 P E ratio  which is precisely where the company is currently valued at today by the market place Lowes Cos  Inc   LOW  Is Both Overvalued And At An All Time HighThere are several lessons that the Lowes  graph teaches us  However  the most important one is that the company is clearly currently overvalued as its price is significantly above the orange earnings justified valuation line  A second important lesson is that in the long run price  the black line  tracks earnings  In other words  where earnings go stock price soon follows  The third important lesson is that we see a legacy of the company s price rising above the orange earnings justified valuation line  only to see it soon return to fair value  A similar pattern occurs when the price falls below the orange earnings justified valuation line Interestingly  Lowes Cos  Inc  is expected to continue growing future earnings at a rate that is very consistent with its historical growth  However  even considering that the consensus of analysts expects earnings growth of 16 4   Lowes is clearly overvalued at today s 22 1 P E ratio  Perhaps even more interesting  because of this high growth expectation  Lowes could still actually be a very good long term investment even at these high valuation levels  The 5 year estimated total annual return  including dividends  is expected to be 13 6  On the other hand  based on the historical patterns discussed above  prudence might suggest that over the shorter term you might be given an opportunity to buy this company at a better valuation  which could actually reduce long term risk while simultaneously enhancing your long term rate of return  My point being that overvaluation does not necessarily indicate a bad investment or future losses  Instead  as in the case of Lowes  it might simply be indicating that you are taking higher risk than you might need to in order to achieve an acceptable future return The Second Fallacy  After a 3  Year Run Stocks Must Be OverpricedThe second fallacy is based on the misconception that since the market had a very strong run  not only this year  but over the past 3  years  many people automatically assume that it must be overpriced  However  the truth is that the market  just like the IBM and Stanley Black   Decker examples above  has had a rise that closely correlated to its earnings growth coming out of the great recession of 2008  In other words  the market may be at an all time high  but not necessarily overvalued The overall stock market as represented by the S P 500 is well within its 200 year historical normal P E ratio average of between 14 to 16 times earnings  The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on the S P 500 illustrate that its price is well within its historical earnings justified valuation  If the overall market is high  it s only by a smidgen  and certainly not beyond reason or fair value norms  The Greatest Investor Fallacy Of AllWhat has been written thus far leads me to a discussion on what I believe to be the greatest investor fallacy of all  This is the fallacy of making investment decisions based on predictions about the general state of the stock market  In other words  I do not believe in predicting markets  instead  I believe in analyzing individual companies based on their own merit and then building my portfolios one company at a time Moreover  my years of experience and research have led me to conclude that whether the market is a bear or bull  there will always be fairly priced  overpriced and underpriced individual companies to be found  Therefore  I believe that investors are better served by looking for good businesses at sound valuations  regardless of what they believe the market may currently look like  In the long run  the evidence clearly supports the idea that it is time in the market  not market timing that matters most To be clear  I m talking about owning great individual businesses bought at sound valuations and held for the long run  With this philosophy  I am rarely concerned about what the general state of the market might be  Instead  I am greatly concerned about the fiscal health and valuation of each of the individual companies I own  Moreover  this is where I spend all of my time  energy and effort  Once I buy a great business I like  at a good price  I continuously monitor and research that business with little concern about the general state of the markets  or the economy for that matter A Methodical Approach To Finding Value In This MarketI believe in diversification as a risk minimization tool  However  in the context of this article  I m going to discuss sensible or prudent diversification within the dividend growth stock asset class  In other words  I m going to present a logical and methodical approach to creating a diversified portfolio of dividend growth stocks purchased at fair value in our current market environment For starters  I believe a dividend growth portfolio can be properly diversified with only 20 to 25 stocks  However  I would add that with this amount of concentration  it s critical to continuously monitor the fundamentals behind each of the businesses in the portfolio  This is the old adage that if you only put a few things in your basket  then you must watch that basket very closely  But I believe that continuous monitoring is a good practice regardless of how many names in your portfolio  My point being that it is much easier to watch and closely monitor 20 to 25 stocks  than it would be 100 or more For those that would be uncomfortable with such high concentration  I would acquiesce that 30 to 50 stocks would also work  With 50 stocks  you would only have a 2  exposure to your overall portfolio in the event that any one of those stocks actually went completely bankrupt  On the other hand  if you re careful with your selection in the first place  the odds of that occurring are very rare  To repeat  the problem with holding this many companies is the time  complexity and amount of effort required to monitor your portfolio efficiently and effectively Regardless of whether you like a concentrated  or are more comfortable with a more broadly diversified portfolio of stocks  what follows is my logical and methodical approach to putting one together today  First of all  I will utilize the screening function of the F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool and search each of the 10 major sectors for potential candidates  My initial search is very simple and straightforward  The Global Industry Classification Standard  GICS  was developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International  MSCI  a leading provider of global indices  and Standard   Poor s  S P   There are 10 sectors designated by 2 digit codes as follows 10   Energy15   Materials20   Industrials25   Consumer Discretionary30   Consumer Staples35   Health Care40   Financials45   Information Tech50   Telecommunications55   UtilitiesAdditionally  under each of these major sectors there are several subsectors  anyone interested in seeing all the information on all sectors and subsectors you can   Consequently  in searching for dividend growth stocks at fair value within each sector  I utilized the following simple screen  I searched by sector  and then for companies within each broad sector that have a minimum of a 2  dividend yield  Then I reviewed each company that the screen produced and hand picked only those companies that had reasonably consistent historical earnings growth  and that were plus or minus at fair value  The reason I included stocks that might be slightly overvalued  was because they could quickly become attractive candidates with only a moderate correction  Summary and ConclusionsWithin this article  I provided a sneak peek at the sectors  45   Information Tech with my IBM example  20   Industrials with Stanley Black   Decker  and finally 25   Consumer Discretionary with Lowes  In the subsequent articles in this series  I will provide samples of prescreened companies that I believe are currently at fair value or close to it  in each of the 10 broad sectors in the order that they are listed above  Therefore  the first of my 10 future articles will cover the energy sector  Incidentally  there are numerous companies in the energy sector that are undervalued in comparison to equivalent quality companies within the other sectors  I will provide a portfolio review  covering a hand selected list of companies in each sector that I feel are currently fairly valued  and worthy of consideration and a more comprehensive due diligence effort  I will also include specific examples that I feel represent two general types of dividend growth opportunities  The first I will categorize as Conservative Growth and Income  and the second I will categorize as Aggressive Growth and Income When I started my career in the financial services industry in 1970  it was prior to Modern Portfolio Theory s coming in to vogue and ubiquity  It was a time that I now refer to when investors practiced  Ancient Portfolio Reality   In these  what I consider to be more sane and rational times  portfolios were constructed and designed based on the unique and specific goals  objectives  risk tolerances and needs of the individual investor  Instead of asset allocation  and its highly profitable  to the professional providers  policy of continuous rebalancing that generated lots of new commissions each year  portfolios were built to get a specific job done Instead of spreading as much mud up on the wall  regardless of whether an asset class made prudent sense or not  the approach was more intelligent  at least in my humble opinion  Investors were given the choice of having their portfolios constructed on investing principles and strategies such as conservative  moderate or aggressive growth  Other choices included conservative  moderate or aggressive growth and income  Accordingly  portfolios were constructed in such a manner that the investor could understand  embrace and sleep well at night with Consequently  since this series of articles is focused on dividend income  and the growth thereof  I will provide aggressive and conservative examples covering each of the 10 sectors  What I ve already learned from this exercise  is that a portfolio of quality blue chip dividend growth stocks  all trading at fair value  can be properly constructed today  in spite of the market s recent run up  There is a lot of value left in quality common stocks  if you re willing to look  and smart enough to think specifically rather than generally  Regardless of the market  there are always fairly valued  undervalued and overvalued stocks available  As a result  no investor needing income and safety  need ever feel left out Disclosure   No positions at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a

159029,380545,SWK,SWK  139 Consecutive Years Of Dividend Payments,opinion,"Stanley Black   Decker  N SWK  has paid its dividend for 139 consecutive years and increased it for the past 48 consecutive years  In two years  SWK will join the exclusive dividend kings list  which consists of companies that have raised their dividend for at least 50 straight years 
These businesses are rare and typically possess numerous competitive advantages  In the case of SWK  the stock has also sold off by 15  since mid December 2015 and trades at about 15x forward earnings  making the investment case even timelier for consideration in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewSWK was founded in 1843 and has grown into a diversified global provider of power and hand tools  products and services for various industrial applications  and security systems  The company sells over 500 000 products including power drills  saws  toolboxes  wrenches  fasteners  measuring tools  compressors  nail guns  outdoor power equipment  sanders  lamps  mowers  vacuums  workbenches  polishers  grinders  cordless tools  air tools  and more  Some of the company s biggest brands are Stanley  DeWalt  Black Decker  Porter Cable  and Bostitch 
SWK s largest end markets by 2014 revenue are residential   repair   DIY  20    new residential construction  15    non residential construction  17    industrial   electronics  17    automotive production  8    and retail  5   
By segment  SWK generated 62  of its 2014 revenue from Tools and Storage  20  from Security  and 18  from Industrial 
By geography  SWK generated 49  of its 2014 revenue from the U S   25  from Europe  17  from emerging markets  and 9  from the rest of the world Business AnalysisSWK s primary competitive advantages are its strong brands  product innovation  and global distribution channels 
SWK s brands and reputation for quality were established a long time ago  The company obtained the world s first patent for a portable power tool in 1916 and has since amassed an unparalleled family of brands  products  and industry expertise  Before going further  it s worth mentioning that Stanley Works acquired Black   Decker in early 2010 to create the biggest toolmaker in the U S  This deal combined the leader in consumer and industrial hand tools and security with the leader in power tools 
Today  SWK has over 13 000 active global patents and introduces about 1 000 new tool products per year  including many of the  world s first  each year  The company has noted that new products drive over 85  of its organic growth  and NPD Data recognized the company for receiving the 8th most patents in the world from 2010 2014 
Innovation is a clear driver for the business  and SWK is able to leverage its brand equity into adjacent product categories for easy expansion  Most of its markets are extremely large and fragmented because they require so many different types of products  e g  a home remodeling project could require saws  measuring tools  nail guns  vacuums  tools  drills  and more  
SWK can develop or acquire new products where it has gaps and market them under its famous brands  The company invested over  6 billion in acquisitions since 2002 to advance its growth opportunities  and we expect more of the same to continue over the next decade as it continues consolidating its markets 
SWK s extensive distribution channels and shelf space are also advantages  Its products are in practically every home center and mass merchandise retailer because they have loyal customers  cover the broadest number of applications  and are proven to sell 
As a result  SWK has number one global market share across power tools and hand tools and number two market share in engineered fastening and commercial electronic security services  With leading market share positions  SWK s scale also helps it manufacture products at competitive costs  although the company typically focuses on the higher end of the market where there is less price competition  
In the company s Security  20  of sales  and Industrial  18   segments  SWK s business benefits from a partial recurring revenue model  It is tied to several large automotive companies that have selected SWK s highly engineered fasteners for their models  and around 40  of the Security segment s revenue is recurring in the form of software and monitoring services 
The company s Stanley Fulfillment System  SFS  is another big advantage that has enhanced SWK s operating discipline  SFS has five primary elements that work together  sales and operations planning  operational lean  complexity reduction  global supply management  and order to cash excellence  SWK develops business processes and systems to reduce costs and improve the company s return on capital 
As an example  SWK was able to improve its working capital turnover by 56  from the end of 2010 to the end of 2014  This frees up more cash that can be used for acquisitions or returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividend increases 
Over the next three years  SWK targets 4 6  organic sales growth and expects to resume acquisitions  during 2013  SWK placed a moratorium on acquisitions to focus on near term priorities of operational improvement and deleveraging   With continued margin expansion and operating leverage  SWK expects earnings to grow by 10 12  per year Key RisksWith strong brands and a well diversified portfolio of products in slow changing markets  it s no surprise that SWK has successfully been in business for more than 175 years 
In our opinion  most of the risks faced by the company are related to currency fluctuations and macroeconomic trends  Construction and remodeling projects are two major business drivers which tend to move in cycles  In the U S   2015 was the best year for existing home sales since 2006  which suggests some of SWK s business has been benefiting from unusually strong economic tailwinds  Should the housing market unexpectedly roll over  there could be a great buying opportunity 
However  we don t see any secular themes playing out that would necessarily challenge long term demand for SWK s product offerings  If anything  the company s capital allocation decisions are possibly its greatest risk 
After taking several years off from major M A to fix an underperforming security business  improve operational efficiency  and deleverage  SWK expects to resume its acquisitive strategy over the next few years 
If management makes an untimely deal  takes on too much debt  buys a bad company  or unfavorably alters the company s business strategy  the stock could suffer  For example  SWK acquired European security company Niscayah in 2011  The business started losing customers throughout the integration process and forced SWK to later miss earnings guidance 
Otherwise  we think SWK s continued branding and product innovation investments will continue serving it well across its large and fragmented markets  It s worth monitoring if customers begin switching to lower priced products  especially in emerging markets  but brand loyalty seems to be pretty high across most of SWK s product categories Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
SWK s dividend Safety Score of 66 indicates that the company s dividend is very safe  With such an impressive streak of paying dividends  this should not come as a surprise 
Over the last four quarters  SWK s dividend has consumed 43  of its earnings and 40  of its free cash flow  As seen below  the company s payout ratios have generally remained between 30 40  over the last decade  which is in line with management s 30 35  target  This is a relatively low payout ratio that provides plenty of dividend safety  Even if SWK s cash flow was unexpectedly cut in half  it would still be more than enough to cover the dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Observing a company s performance during the last recession is also helpful when it comes to evaluating the safety of a dividend  We can see that SWK s sales fell by 17  in 2009  and its earnings were down nearly 30   The company clearly has some sensitivity to the broader economy  which isn t too surprising given its exposure to construction markets Source  Simply Safe Dividends
SWK s economic sensitivity isn t as big of a risk to the dividend payment because the company s payout ratios are relatively low and it has been a free cash flow machine over the last decade  As seen below  SWK has generated positive and stable free cash flow each of the last 10 fiscal years  the sign of a very healthy business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The business also generates a decent return on invested capital  which helps gauge the profitability and efficiency of a business  Companies with competitive advantages will generally earn returns in excess of 10   Prior to the financial crisis and its acquisition of Black Decker in 2010  which brought down SWK s return on invested capital because it added substantial goodwill to the balance sheet  SWK earned double digit returns Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Really the only strike against the safety of SWK s dividend is the company s balance sheet  While SWK does have an  A  credit rating from S P  it has about  3 9 billion in debt compared to  293 million in cash on hand  which is less than the amount of dividends it paid last fiscal year   321 million   The company needs to continue generating free cash flow  but its track record is excellent Source  Simply Safe Dividends
SWK s relatively low payout ratios  consistent free cash flow generation  and firm commitment to paying its dividend make it one of the safer payments available in the market  While we would prefer to see further deleveraging  SWK is still very healthy financially Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
SWK s dividend Growth Score of 72 is above average and suggests that the company should be able to deliver solid dividend growth for many years to come  With 48 straight years of dividend increases  this probably comes as no surprise 
Dividend growth has averaged around 5  in recent years  but SWK s 40  payout ratio and solid free cash flow generation provide plenty of room for continued increases  However  the company has a target payout ratio of 30 35  so near term dividend growth will likely remain in the 4 6  range if we had to guess Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationSWK trades at about 15x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2 3   which is in line with its five year average dividend yield 
Management believes SWK s earnings can grow at 10 12  per year over the next three years  We think a mid  to upper single digit earnings growth rate is reasonable over the long term considering the size of SWK s markets and its many opportunities to leverage its brands and distribution channels 
Under this scenario  the stock s valuation looks very reasonable and appears to offer 7 10  annual total return potential  For such a high quality business in today s market environment  that doesn t sound too bad ConclusionAs a blue chip dividend stock  SWK has one of the best dividend track records an income investor will find  Few companies have existed for 175 years  much less paid a dividend for 139 consecutive years  With continued product innovation and brand investment  we believe SWK s products will be in demand for many years to come  The company will face its ups and downs depending on currency exchange rates and macro trends in key markets such as construction  but we expect its profits to continue marching higher over long periods of time  Given its long term prospects  SWK appears attractively valued today ",2016-01-27,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/swk:-139-consecutive-years-of-dividend-payments-381924,381924
