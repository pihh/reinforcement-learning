8326,229841,COWN,Exclusive  China s CEFC in early talks to buy Rosneft stake   sources,news,"By Kane Wu and Chen Aizhu HONG KONG BEIJING  Reuters    CEFC China Energy  which has grown from a niche oil trader to a sprawling energy conglomerate  is in talks to acquire a stake in Russian state oil giant Rosneft  MM ROSN   three people with direct knowledge of the discussions said  The people said senior executives at both companies were in preliminary discussions  though there have already been two meetings between CEFC Chairman Ye Jianmin and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin since July  It was not immediately clear how much CEFC would invest in Rosneft  nor if the Chinese group would buy new shares or existing stock in the parent company  One person familiar with Rosneft said it would be open to selling CEFC a stake in its retail business  which includes almost 3 000 filling stations  around 150 oil storage complexes and over 1 000 gasoline tankers  Russia has overtaken Saudi Arabia as China s biggest oil supplier  and Rosneft is by far Russia s biggest and most influential oil company  with strong ties to the Kremlin   Having access to Rosneft s reserves and refining capacity would boost CEFC s ambitions to become a major international energy merchant and rival to traders like  Glencore   L GLEN   CEFC  which has a rare contract to store part of China s strategic oil reserve  has expanded aggressively  hiring officials from state owned energy firms and acquiring a series of overseas assets since 2015   The Russian government  through holding company Rosneftegaz  owns 50 percent of Rosneft  after it sold a 19 5 percent stake to Glencore and Qatar Investment Authority  QIA  for more than 10 billion euros   11 8 billion  in December  It would need to issue a special government decree if it were to lower its holding in Rosneft below 50 percent   BP   L BP  owns 19 75 percent of Rosneft  Asked to comment on the stake acquisition talks  a CEFC spokesman said the two firms signed a cooperation agreement on Aug  2  when Sechin visited CEFC s headquarters in Shanghai  That deal was a broad cooperation on everything from oil and gas exploration to financial services  according to CEFC s website  The spokesman did not comment on whether those discussions involved a stake purchase  A Rosneft spokesman said the company saw China as a strategic partner and was cooperating with a wide range of Chinese companies  including CEFC   We consider the Chinese market as the most promising and actively developing  The company will increase its cooperation with Chinese partners in all business areas and make public statements accordingly as joint projects are developing   the company said in an email   Rosneft does not hold its shares and  therefore  does not sell its shares    Reuters could not immediately reach Rosneftegaz for comment  Glencore  QIA and BP declined to comment  CHINA RISING CEFC would be the first privately held Chinese firm to invest in a major oil giant  Usually  Beijing would tap China s three big state owned oil players for strategic investments  With ambitions to become China s next oil giant  CEFC paid nearly  900 million for a 4 percent stake in an onshore field majority owned by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co  ADNOC   and has agreed to buy a 51 percent stake in KMGI  a unit of Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz  and a 20 percent stake in New York based financial services firm  Cowen Group  Inc  O COWN   The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine  Rosneft  whose CEO is seen as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin  is the only company sanctioned by both   The sanctions will be a key concern for CEFC before any further serious decision  and could pose financing challenges  said one senior Chinese source familiar with the discussions   The company is now engaging lawyers to evaluate thoroughly the legal hurdles sanctions may bring about   the person said  adding it was too soon to discuss valuations  CEFC and Rosneft have over the past 3 4 years discussed various cooperation opportunities from upstream investment in Russian oilfields to oil trade  but only recently did Rosneft initiate the idea of a stake investment  said another senior Chinese source briefed on the matter  CEFC has assigned a task force of around 40 people to work on the investment  a third person said  The two companies could announce a deal as soon as early next month  when senior Russian officials are expected to visit Beijing  that person added

8330,229845,COWN,Sector Detector  Bulls Prepare For New Buying Opportunity,opinion,"Of course  all eyes have been on Greece in an ongoing saga that  although critical to the Greeks  is mostly just an annoying distraction for global investors   partly because it has been going on for so many years  with the proverbial can of inevitability continually being kicked down the road  and partly because there can be no winners in this intractable situation  Predictably  the electorate chose to follow the advice of the communists that they elected and reject the rigid bailout offer  calling the bluff of the IMF  ECB  and Eurozone  and betting they will do whatever it takes to avoid losing one of its members  These are uncharted waters  and with the resultant shadow of uncertainty hanging over the markets  traders fled to the safety of cash  and the S P 500 has relied upon support from its 200 day simple moving average to kick in  both last Monday and again today   But the technical picture may be firming up for the bulls  Moreover  I would characterize the resulting market action as an orderly retreat rather than panic selling  as traders appear to be simply taking risk off the table while preparing for a buying opportunity 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 

Market Overview 
At the close of 1H2015  among the U S  business sectors  top performers for the first half were Healthcare and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   particularly the homebuilders like the SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSE XHB   while income oriented Utilities and REITs  as well as Energy  and Metals and Mining have been big laggards  The 10 year US Treasury yield hasn t moved much  closing last week at 2 39  

Although Puerto Rico has thrown itself into the mix of debt calamities  the major crisis of the moment has been Greece and the Eurozone  After all  the whole concept of a single currency shared by such diverse cultures and politics effectively set up certain countries for failure  But although Spain  Portugal  and Ireland previously demonstrated that structural reform can work  Greeks are reluctant to endure any further pain and now are appealing to the charity and humanitarian nature of their creditors  Greek polls had been showing that a large majority of Greeks want to remain in the Eurozone  but trust that they can win the game of chicken and reach a deal without the tax hikes and pension reform demanded by lenders and rejected by Prime Minister Tsipras and his communist Syriza party  If a so called Grexit is indeed in the cards  that does not  and probably will not  mean an exit from the EU  but only from the Eurozone 

Despite the ongoing Greek saga  stocks in Europe  Australasia and the Far East  aka EFA  have continued to outperform the US and emerging markets  However  China has given back much of its huge gains   after rising as much as 110  from November to a peak on June 12  Shanghai shares have fallen around 30   and in the process  has wiped out about  3 trillion in market capitalization  It might be hard to put that amount in perspective  so for comparison  it is more than the value of Germany s entire stock market  Nevertheless  the Shanghai index remains up  14  YTD and  80  over the past 12 months  In an effort to staunch the bleeding and continue to facilitate the conversion of huge debts into equity  China cut interest rates for the fourth time since November  lowered required reserve ratios  allowed pension funds to invest in Shanghai shares  injected massive liquidity at lower rates  loosened margin trading rules and gave margin lenders enhanced liquidity  threatened the  mostly foreign  short sellers  put a moratorium on IPOs  and bought up shares every day in late trading to prop up prices  Most global investors look at China as the biggest risk to the global economy 

The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last week at 16 79  after nearly hitting 20 a couple of times earlier in the week  So  it has reflected fear  but not panic  The behavior of the VIX indicates traders simply taking some risk off the table  but perhaps also preparing for a buying opportunity  rather than hibernating with the bears 

SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed last week at 207 31  after getting a solid bounce last Monday at the important 200 day simple moving average  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all emerged from oversold territory and seem poised to rise higher   with  of course  some inevitable news driven bumps along the way  Although the large bullish ascending triangle that had been forming  resistance at 212 and rising support line from the long standing uptrend line  has broken to the downside  strong support was nearby and could serve as a new launch point  Some technicians are saying that the uptrend line could now serve as prior support turned resistance  but I think bulls will be eager to retake that line if the global news allows it  Minor resistance at the moment is the 208 level of prior failed support  Next major support remains the critical 200 day SMA  approaching 206   followed by earlier in year support at 204  then round number support at the 200 price level 



Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 

In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 

Outlook score is forward looking  while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 


Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 

1  Utilities takes first place with a strong Outlook score of 90  primarily due to its low  best  forward P E  relatively solid Wall Street analyst support  net upward revisions to earnings estimates   and reasonable insider sentiment  Financial takes second with a score of 85 and displays the next lowest forward P E  as well as reasonably good sentiment among both Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates  and insiders  buying activity   Healthcare takes third place with a score of 75  followed by Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  and then Technology 

2  Energy is in the cellar with an Outlook score of 5  while Telecom takes the second spot in the bottom two with a 15  Both sectors score poorly in most factors of the GARP model across the board 

3  Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare displays the top score of 63  followed by Technology and Financial as the only other sectors above 60  Energy has the lowest Bull score of 42 and is the only one below 50  The top bottom spread is 21 points  reflecting low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 

4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities and Telecom display the top score of 51  followed by Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  at 50  which means that stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Technology scores the lowest at 40  The top bottom spread is 11 points  which reflects high sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 

5  Utilities displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the best  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Energy by far the worst 

6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings have taken a defensive turn  with Utilities at the top and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  in the top four  ahead of Technology  Industrial  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   and Basic Materials  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 

Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   now reflects a neutral bias and suggests holding Utilities  Financial  and Healthcare  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below its 50 day but still above its 200 day simple moving average  

Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Utilities  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLU   iShares US Broker Dealers ETF  NYSE IAI   and Market Vectors Biotech ETF  NYSE BBH  

For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Utilities  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include SCANA Corp  NYSE SCG   The AES Corp  NYSE AES   Cowen Group  NASDAQ COWN   Raymond James Financial  NYSE RJF   Receptos  NASDAQ RCPT   and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ REGN  

If you prefer to play a bounce and maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Technology  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare  in that order 

IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio
