196665,418181,MYL,Mylan Issues Nationwide Recall for Contaminated Ulcer Medication,news,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  announced today that its American based business issued a voluntary nationwide recall for its ulcer medication after discovering trace amounts of carcinogens in some of its old batches  Three different lots of nizatidine capsules  including both the 150mg and 300mg dose variants  were found to contain small amounts of N Nitrosodimethylamine  NDMA   and the company has since issued a voluntary recall for all capsules suspected to be contaminated  
NDMA is a known carcinogen  a type of substance that causes cancer in living tissues  NDMA is especially harmful to the liver  with high levels of exposure to the compound causing internal bleeding  liver damage  cancer  and death  Mylan s stock is up slightly since its opening price today 

The contaminated batches in question were distributed across the country between June 2017 and August 2018  Mylan hasn t heard of any adverse reactions from these contaminated batches so far 
Previous contamination problems
Nizatidine is used primarily as a treatment for stomach ulcers  but also can be prescribed for heartburn as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease  GERD   which occurs when acid from the stomach flows back into the esophagus 
It turns out that nizatidine has a history of having elevated NDMA levels  The Food and Drug Administration issued a report in November that found that nizatidine exceeded acceptable concentrations of NDMA for human ingestion  While overall levels were relatively low  equivalent to eating a smoked or grilled piece of meat  the FDA deemed that it still surpasses acceptable limits for daily consumption and that Mylan should recall any batches of nizatidine that it finds to have excessive levels of contaminants  
The FDA recommends patients consider alternative pharmaceutical medications that haven t been shown to have impurities  such as Pepcid  Tagamet  and Nexium ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfk-k,2055370
196666,418182,MYL,Here s Why Mylan Fell 26 6  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  fell over 26  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  The generic drug manufacturer struggled to overcome its negative association in the national discussion related to drug pricing practices and became embroiled in an industrywide price fixing lawsuit brought by 44 state attorneys general  
The performance of the pharma stock looks even worse when considering that the S P 500 delivered a 28 8  gain in 2019  Can plans to combine with Upjohn  the generic drug division of Pfizer  NYSE PFE   provide relief to shareholders in 2020 

So what
Most of the stock s terrible performance last year can be traced back to the day  May 7  Mylan reported first quarter 2019 operating results  The update made it clear that the business was still struggling to overcome severe headwinds facing generic drugs in the United States  which are being pressured by unsustainable levels of competition  manufacturing missteps  and changing distribution models  
The barrage of bad news continued a week later when 44 state attorneys general alleged that generic drug manufacturers from Teva Pharmaceuticals to Lannett Company to Mylan engaged in a far reaching price fixing scheme covering dozens of drug products  
In the final days of July  investors finally had something to look forward to  Mylan and Pfizer s Upjohn division agreed to combine operations  The idea is that bigger is better when it comes to successfully navigating the headwinds of the generic drug industry  The combined company  which will be called Viatris  is expected to generate pro forma revenue of at least  19 billion in 2020  
Now what
For Mylan  the merger with Upjohn is also a rebranding effort  which could help given all of the negative news swirling around the company s current name  Whether it will be enough to respond to difficult market conditions for generic drug manufacturers or allow the combined company to more easily access Chinese markets  and whether that pays off as expected  remains to be seen ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgijh,2057092
196667,418183,MYL,Is Mylan Stock a Buy ,news,"Shareholders of drugmaker Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  are off to a good start this year  with an 8 4  gain after last year s 27  loss  The market may be thinking of the company s planned combination with Pfizer s Upjohn business  which focuses on off patent branded drugs and generics  The deal is expected to close around the middle of this year and is a bright spot among challenges that haven t gone away 

Mylan  a company best known for generic drugs  watched its stock slide last year after it was named along with other generic drug manufacturers in a case alleging price fixing  The lawsuit  brought by more than 40 state attorneys general  describes an industrywide conspiracy to fix prices of generic drugs  Rather than one quick blow to the stock price  this could be a drawn out process that weighs on the shares periodically as the case unfolds 
Climate for generics
The climate for generic drug pricing in the U S  is another headwind that isn t about to go away  According to an AARP Public Policy Institute report  generic drug prices have generally declined over the past 15 years  In 2017  the retail prices of 390 common generic prescription drugs fell by 9 3  from the previous year  the data showed  And the average annual cost for one generic used on a chronic basis was  365 in 2017  down considerably from  751 in 2013  A new initiative by California  meant to lower healthcare costs for residents  could lead to further pressure on generic drug prices  Gov  Gavin Newsom is proposing that California create its own generic drug label and negotiate with manufacturers to provide the medications  If the state follows through on this plan  it would be another door leading to lower prices 
In addition to the generic drug climate  earnings haven t been much of an incentive to buy shares of Mylan  Though Mylan beat analysts  earnings per share expectations in the third quarter  sales of  2 96 billion missed some analysts  forecasts for  3 01 billion  The company also narrowed its full year total revenue outlook to the range of  11 50 billion to  12 billion  The highest end of the range was  12 5 billion  according to Mylan s earlier prediction 
Upjohn and Mylan
Against this backdrop  the combination with Upjohn and Mylan s launch of a biosimilar to rival Roche s Herceptin are two positive elements 
Mylan launched Ogivri  a biosimilar of trastuzumab to treat breast cancer and gastric cancer  in December  Biosimilars are biological drug products that are similar to another biological drug that has already been approved  Roche s Herceptin is a drug that brought in about  7 billion in sales in 2018  Ogrivi is a positive addition to Mylan s portfolio  but its importance shouldn t be overestimated  as it isn t the only biosimilar rivaling Herceptin  It is set to face competition from at least four others  including Kanjinti  a Herceptin biosimilar from Amgen and Allergan that was approved last year 
Returning capital to investors
In the Upjohn transaction  each Mylan share will be converted into a share of the new company  which will be called Viatris  and Mylan shareholders will hold 43   Shareholders of Pfizer will own 57  of the business  Pro forma 2020 revenues for the combined company are expected to be between  19 billion and  20 billion  Pro forma 2020 adjusted EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  is expected to be in the range of  7 5 billion to  8 billion  With a focus on returning capital to shareholders  the plan is to start with a dividend of about 25  of free cash flow beginning the first full quarter after the deal closes 
All of this sounds favorable  but investors should keep in mind Upjohn s latest earnings results  Third quarter revenue fell 26  operationally as generic competitors for nerve pain drug Lyrica entered the U S  market  and excluding the Lyrica impact  operational revenue fell 6   Though Upjohn predicted growth in China  the picture in the U S  remains lackluster 
Is Mylan a buy 
For investors specifically seeking to invest in a generic drug maker  Mylan is a better prospect than competitor Teva  the main drugmaker cited in the price fixing lawsuit noted above  Mylan s combination with Upjohn may bring investors dividends and a chance at better growth  That said  companies with a strong position in generics    considering the environment for generics in the U S     are not the best place to be these days  Mylan isn t a buy right now  but if you re interested in investing in healthcare  you might want to keep an eye on Viatris  first couple of quarters to see if this new company can make it past the headwinds blowing in the direction of generic drug makers ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmpty,2067703
196668,418184,MYL,Pfizer s Q4 Earnings Fall More Than Expected,news,"Investing com     Pfizer    NYSE PFE  said it expects underlying revenue growth of around 8  this year as it carves out another of its main divisions into a separate company

Analysts polled by Investing com anticipated EPS of  0 58 on revenue of  12 61 billion  
 

Analysts are expecting EPS of  0 72 and revenue of  11 7 billion in the upcoming quarter 

 Pfizer   NYSE PFE  stock is currently 10  below the record high it set last July  amid fears about the loss of patent protection for key drugs in the coming years 
 The biggest challenge that Pfizer is facing over the next few years is how to make up for the pending loss of patent protection   said Investing com analyst Haris Anwar   Some of its top revenue generating products    Xeljanz  Ibrance  Xtandi  Eliquis and Tafamidis    all are losing patent protection from 2025 to 2029 
To mitigate the impact of revenue loss  Pfizer is trying to reorganize its business  spending heavily in developing new drugs and buying companies whose success is uncertain 
 In the short run  the company s revenue growth is dependent on its more established prescription drugs and cancer drugs that now make up more of Pfizer s revenue than any other segment    Anwar added

196677,418193,MYL,New tuberculosis treatment for developing countries to cost  1 040,news,"By Manojna Maddipatla and Manas Mishra
 Reuters    A newly approved three drug treatment for tuberculosis will be available in 150 countries including India and South Africa  priced at  1 040 for a complete regimen  more than twice the cost proposed in the past by advocacy groups for other treatments 
The United Nations backed Stop TB Partnership said on Monday that BPaL would be obtainable in eligible countries through the Global Drug Facility  GDF   a global provider of TB medicines created in 2001 to negotiate lower prices for treatments 
Tuberculosis was responsible for 1 5 million deaths in 2018 
BPaL is an oral treatment which promises a shorter  more convenient option to existing TB treatment options  which use a cocktail of antibiotic drugs over a period of up to two years 
The new cocktail  which will treat extensively drug resistant strains of the illness  consists of drug developer TB Alliance s newly approved medicine pretomanid  in combination with linezolid and Johnson   Johnson s  N JNJ  bedaquiline 
Pretomanid  which will be available at  364 per treatment course  is only the third new medicine for drug resistant tuberculosis to be approved in about 40 years  after J J s bedaquiline and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd s delamanid 
Advocacy groups have long criticized the cost for bedaquiline and delamanid  Not for profit M decins Sans Fronti res  MSF  has waged a running battle in public with J J over its  400 price tag for a six month course for bedaquiline 
MSF has argued that bedaquiline could be produced and sold at a profit for 25 cents per day  and that the price of treatments for drug resistant TB should be no higher than  500 for a complete treatment course 
Leena Menghaney  the South Asia head for MSF s Access Campaign  said it was a cause of concern that pretomanid was priced just below the price of bedaquiline 
But Stop TB Partnership says costs of other regimens for extremely drug resistant TB range from  2 000 to  8 000 for courses of at least 20 months 
TB Alliance in April granted a license to U S  drugmaker Mylan NV  O MYL  to manufacture and sell pretomanid as part of certain regimens in high income markets  as well as a non exclusive license for low income and middle income countries  where most tuberculosis cases occur 
Stop TB Partnership said it would start supplying the regimen following World Health Organization s guidance on using the drug  Mylan  however  said it will also sell the drug directly to countries 
Prices in low income countries would be in line with the price offered through GDF  but would be decided on a case by case basis where the drug is not supplied through GDF  it said 
The drug will be available in bottles of 26 tablets  with a six month treatment requiring seven bottles 
India based Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd has also been granted a non exclusive license to make pretomanid as part of the BPaL regimen  TB Alliance said on Monday

196690,418206,MYL,Mylan deal puts future of its beleaguered EpiPen in spotlight,news,"By Carl O Donnell and Tamara Mathias
 Reuters    Mylan NV s  O MYL  planned merger with  Pfizer  Inc s  N PFE  off patent branded drugs business may have boosted its share price on Monday  but one of its most pressing problems remains  shortages of its flagship EpiPen emergency allergy treatment 
For the past year  Mylan has been struggling to address an ongoing EpiPen shortage that could potentially worsen as thousands of school children with allergies need to restock EpiPen supplies ahead of the school year 
Now  the planned tie up will bring together two businesses that have long collaborated on making EpiPens  For years  Pfizer has manufactured EpiPen on Mylan s behalf through its Meridian Medical Technologies unit 
It was not yet clear if the combination will help ease the shortages by simplifying the company s complex manufacturing processes 
Although Meridian will not be merged with Mylan as part of the transaction announced on Monday  the companies were in talks to transfer Meridian to the newly created generics business  a Pfizer spokeswoman said 
The discussions are still ongoing and there is no guarantee that a deal will be reached  but the parties are aiming to reach a final decision before the close of the larger Pfizer Mylan deal in 2020  Pfizer said 
 We ve had some conversations with Mylan about that potentially transferring to Mylan as a supplement to the existing transaction  but nothing has been finalized to date yet   Frank D Amelio  Pfizer s chief financial officer told Reuters 
If the company is transferred to the new Mylan Pfizer spinoff  it could potentially help streamline a fix to the manufacturing issues that have led to shortages 
 Over the long term  having all EpiPen operations under one unified company would reduce complexity   said Ashtyn Evans  an Edward Jones analyst 
Meridian  which produces all EpiPens sold globally at a single plant near St  Louis  has been hit by a series of manufacturing problems since at least 2018 that resulted in shortages in the United States and elsewhere  The company said in early July it anticipates further supply shortages over the coming months 
Canada s national health agency said earlier this month it continued to experience EpiPen shortages as well 
Mylan  a generic drugmaker that came under fire from mothers and politicians over steep EpiPen price hikes  has been facing new competition for its emergency allergy treatment

196691,418207,MYL,Mylan reaches  30 million settlement in SEC s EpiPen probe,news," Reuters    Mylan NV  O MYL  has reached a tentative agreement to pay  30 million to resolve a probe by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission related to its emergency allergy shot EpiPen  which became the center of a firestorm over price increases 
The drugmaker in a regulatory filing on Monday disclosed that it had reached an agreement in principle with the SEC s enforcement staff to resolve the investigation that dated back to 2016  Mylan said it will neither admit nor deny wrongdoing as part of the accord  The EpiPen  which Mylan acquired in 2007  is a handheld device that treats life threatening allergic reactions by automatically injecting a dose of epinephrine 
Mylan came under fire in 2016 after raising the price of a pair of EpiPens to  600  from  100 in 2008  enraging consumers and putting it in the center of the ongoing U S  debate over the high cost of prescription medicines 
In 2017  the drugmaker finalized a  465 million settlement resolving U S  Justice Department claims it overcharged the government for EpiPen 
The deal resolved claims that Mylan avoided higher rebates to state Medicaid programs by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic product  even though it was marketed and priced as a brand name product 
In 2016  Mylan revealed the SEC had launched its own investigation related to EpiPen and sought copies of its communications with the U S  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and documents related to the Medicaid rebate program 
Mylan said the settlement with the SEC is subject to approval by the agency s commissioners 
Separately on Monday  Mylan confirmed that it would merge with  Pfizer  Inc s  N PFE  off patent branded drugs unit  a move that will help it diversify its business as it continues to be pressured by falling prices of generic drugs in the United States 
Shares of generic drugmakers have suffered over the past several years and  this year alone  Mylan shares had lost one third of their value through Friday  before news broke of the Pfizer tie up

Mylan reported first quarter earnings of  0 82 a share  beating estimates from Investing com for earnings of  0 79  but revenue of  2 5 billion missed estimates of  2 7 billion  sending the shares down more than 18   Because of the stock price slump  Mylan shares are now down nearly 16  for the year and are off 46  from their 52 week high 
The company also revealed that attorneys general from several states intend to file a complaint against the drug maker alleging anticompetitive practices concerning some of its generic drugs 
But it s not the first time Mylan has ended up on the wrong side of antitrust laws 
The drugmaker is facing a class action suit over its EpiPen allergy treatment as plaintiffs claim the rebate program  blocked Sanofi  PA SASY  from accessing a significant portion of the market for epinephrine autoinjectors   U S  District Judge J  Paul Oetken ruled late last year 
There was more drama to come as the company  during the post earnings call  said that conclusions from its strategic view should be available in the  near term   after previously announcing last quarter that the review was in the final stages 
That seemingly has sparked speculation among investors that the company is still undecided on the best way forward amid falling sales of generic drugs in North America and slowing sales of its EpiPen 
Analysts have touted three possible options available to drug maker  including a classic restructuring  a leverage buyout or an acquisition or merger 
Sales in North America fell 6  to  922 9 million in the first quarter  primarily driven by changes in the competitive environment and the impact of the Morgantown plant remediation activities   Mylan said 
Yet  there are some on Wall Street who continue to back the drug maker 
 While Q1 sales growth was well below our expectation  we still think 2019 revenue can increase about 5  vs  2018 on strong ramps of generic Advair  biosimilar Neulasta and several other new launches in 2H 2019   said CFRA  the independent research provider 
 We continue to think shares are an attractive value with the low end of 2019  free cash flow  guidance representing a 16  yield on current market cap  and FCF growth expected over the long term

196794,418310,MYL,Another antibiotic crisis  fragile supply leads to shortages,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    Shortages of some life saving antibiotics are putting growing numbers of patients at risk and fuelling the evolution of  superbugs  that do not respond to modern medicines  according to a new report on Thursday  The non profit Access to Medicine Foundation  AMF  said there was an emerging crisis in the global anti infectives market as fragile drug supply chains   reliant on just a few big suppliers   come close to collapse  The result is shortages of products like piperacillin tazobactam  an antibiotic combination used intravenously in intensive care  which has been in tight supply since a 2016 explosion at a Chinese pharmaceutical ingredients factory  Another antibiotic  benzathine penicillin G  BPG   faces shortages in at least 39 countries  including Germany and Brazil  BPG is a key drug for preventing transmission of syphilis from mother to child and the shortage frustrated Brazil s efforts to bring a disease outbreak under control between 2012 and 2015  BPG is also used to fight rheumatic heart disease  In absence of the right drugs  patients may take less effective or poor quality medicines that increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance developing   Things are getting worse because the market is not fixing the problem  despite the expansion in the need for such specialist antibiotics   said AMF Executive Director Jayasree Iyer  Global demand for antibiotics has grown by two thirds since 2000  driven by population growth and the need for medicines to fight infectious diseases in low  and middle income countries  Most antibiotics are cheap  off patent generic medicines  which is good for affordability  But that also means they have very low profit margins   particularly compared to modern drugs for diseases like cancer   offering manufacturers little incentive to invest in new production facilities  The rise in shortages has gone hand in hand with a wave of consolidation among the companies making generic drugs   which range from global pharmaceutical giants to smaller firms in countries such as India   reducing the number of suppliers making individual product lines  Sporadic drug shortages are not unique to antibiotics  Recently  for example  there has been a worldwide shortage of Mylan s  O MYL  market leading EpiPen emergency allergy device   But antibiotic shortages can have especially dire consequences  since doctors have to resort to sub optimal treatments that are less efficient at killing specific pathogens  leading to the rise of resistant bacteria or so called superbugs  
An estimated 70 percent of bacteria are already resistant to at least one antibiotic that is commonly used to treat them  making the evolution of such superbugs one of the biggest threats facing medicine today ",2018-05-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/another-antibiotic-crisis-fragile-supply-leads-to-shortages-1469724,1469724

venture with Glaxo  the Array acquisition  July 2019  and the pending merger of Upjohn unit with Mylan  if successful  will make Pfizer a smaller company with a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines  The smaller Pfizer should see better revenue growth as the Lyrica LOE cliff goes away  Pfizer expects strong growth of key brands like Ibrance  Xeljanz and Eliquis to continue to

196810,418326,MYL,Biogen Soars On Patent Win For MS Drug Tecfidera Over Mylan,opinion,"Shares of Biogen Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   rallied 17 5  on Wednesday after the Patent Trial and Appeal Board  PTAB  of the U S  Patent And Trademark Office  USPTO  gave a favorable ruling to the company over a patent dispute with Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   for its best selling multiple sclerosis  MS  drug  Tecfidera 
Mylan in an inter partes review  IPR  was challenging Biogen s  514 patent  which covers the treatment of multiple sclerosis with 480mg dose of dimethyl fumarate  DMF   the active ingredient of Tecfidera  The patent provides market exclusivity in the United States until 2028 
Per the statement from the PTAB  generic drugmaker Mylan failed to demonstrate that some claims were not patentable 
Though Mylan announced its intention to appeal against this decision  the favorable ruling raises hopes for Biogen s chances of maintaining Tecfidera s exclusivity until 2028  Tecfidera constituted 39  of the company s total product revenues in 2019 
The news removes a short term overhang from the company  Biogen also faces a generic litigation in a court case related to the same patent  The favorable ruling increases the chances of winning the court case 
Shares of Biogen have increased 7 8  in the past year versus the  decrease of 0 1  

Notably  in 2017  Biogen strengthened its patent position for Tecfidera through a settlement and licensing agreement with Danish biotech Forward Pharma A S regarding the same patent  Per the settlement  Biogen agreed to pay  1 25 billion for buying the license to Forward Pharma s intellectual property covering DMF 
Meanwhile  last week  Biogen delivered better than expected fourth quarter 2019 results  The company beat on both earnings and sales in the reported quarter 
Revenue growth in the quarter was principally driven by higher sales of its key MS drugs  continued global growth of its spinal muscular atrophy  SMA  drug Spinraza and expansion of its biosimilar business 
Notably  Tecfidera has been one of the top revenue drivers for Biogen over the years  The drug generated sales worth  4 4 billion in 2019  reflecting an increase of 4  year over year 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked stocks in the biotech sector include Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ XENE   and Kala Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ KALA    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

196830,418346,MYL,Is Mylan  MYL  Doomed To Witness A Terrible 2020 Too ,opinion,"The year 2019 has not been a smooth one for Mylan N  V    NASDAQ MYL   due to challenging business conditions in North America and pricing pressure  Year to date  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have lost 28 6  against the  s growth of 8 3   Let us look at some of the challenges  which plagued the company this year  and whether or not it holds any promise going into the next 

 
A Close Introspection
Generic maker Mylan has not seen the best of 2019 for a few reasons  The company s North America segment witnessed lower sales of existing products due to changes in the competitive environment  including the loss of exclusivity on tadalafil 
It also faced legal issues  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  announced charges against the company in connection with its EpiPen product probe  The SEC charged Mylan for accounting and disclosure failures relating to a Department of Justice  DOJ  probe into whether the company overcharged Medicaid by hundreds of millions of dollars for its largest product  EpiPen  The SEC stated that investors were kept in the dark about EpiPen misclassification and the potential loss the company faced as a result of the pending investigation into the misclassification  Consequently  Mylan has agreed to pay  30 million as charges for the same  Moreover  the complaint alleges that Mylan produced documents and other information to DOJ  including potential damage calculations and offers for settlement  The allegations of misclassification and resultant charges further added to Mylan s woes  
Moreover  rival Teva Pharmaceutical   NYSE TEVA   has already won FDA approval for the first generic version of Mylan s EpiPen and EpiPen Jr  which  in turn  will unfavorably impact sales further 
Earlier  there were allegations against Mylan and Teva for inflating the prices of generic drugs  Both companies were also accused of obstructing a probe on the same by a few lawmakers 
Can the Stock Stage a Comeback in 2020 
In July  Mylan announced a merger agreement with Upjohn  Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   off patent branded and generic established medicines business  includes Lipitor  Celebrex and Viagra   to create a new global pharmaceutical company   Per the agreement  which is structured as an all stock  Reverse Morris Trust transaction  each Mylan share would be converted into one share of the new company  Mylan had previously undertaken a strategic review of its business due to challenging business conditions in North America and pricing pressure  The decision to merge with Upjohn comes as a result of this review 
Pfizer s shareholders would own 57  of the combined entity  while Mylan s shareholders would own the remaining 43   The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies 
The new company will be named Viatris upon the closing of the merger  which is expected in mid 2020  Viatris will boast a diverse portfolio across many geographies and focus on key therapeutic areas 
This merger looks encouraging for the company  The transaction will allow the new company to meaningfully expand the geographic reach of Mylan s existing broad product portfolio and future pipeline   including significant investments in complex generics and biosimilars   into new growth markets where Upjohn has existing sales infrastructure and local market expertise 
Thus  with this merger  Mylan could see a brighter 2020 
The company also launched a few key products in 2019 
Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd  launched Ogivri  trastuzumab dkst   a biosimilar to Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG s   OTC RHHBY   blockbuster breast cancer drug Herceptin  in the United States 
These new launches along with the company s key products  including Yupelri  Copaxone  Fulphila and Wixela Inhub  are likely to help revive  growth

depositary share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents  Adjusted earnings were up 9  reportedly and 1  at constant exchange rate   CER    year over year Shares of Glaxo were up almost 2 4  on Oct 30  The stock has gained 19 4  so far this year compared with the  s 2 5  increase Quarterly revenues rose 16  reportedly and 11  at CER to  11 56 billion   9 4 billion   driven by strong performance across all segments  The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 34 billion                                                           All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at CER Glaxo reports financial figures under three segments  Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Recovers  Respiratory Drugs Sales Strong    After a weak performance in the second quarter  the Pharmaceuticals division registered 3  increase in revenues at CER  However  sales in the United States were down 2   The downside was due to lower sales of Established Pharmaceuticals  partially offset by strong growth of Respiratory segment  Sales in European and international markets were up 9  and 10   respectively Respiratory sales were up 19  at CER mainly driven by increase in sales of Trelegy Ellipta and Nucala across European and international markets  Nucala sales were up 33  at CER during the quarter  Sales of Nucala grew 29  and 39  in the United States and Europe  respectively  In the International markets  sales of Nucala increased 56   Trelegy Ellipta sales more than doubled year over year driven by an increase in market share in the United States In September  Nucala s label expansion application to include severe eosinophilic asthma patients aged six to eleven was approved by the FDA  Glaxo stated that Nucala continues to be the leader in terms of total sales in the asthma biologics market across major markets worldwide Relvar Breo Ellipta registered a decline of 8  in sales during the third quarter  Sales of Relvar Breo Ellipta decreased 32  in the United States due to impact of Advair generic and competitive pricing pressure  The launch of generic versions of Glaxo key respiratory drug  Advair  is  has created significant pricing pressure in inhaled corticosteroid   ICS   long acting beta agonist   LABA   market in the United States  However  sales of Relvar Breo Ellipta increased 19  and 22  in European and international markets  respectively HIV sales remained flat year over year at CER as growth in the dolutegravir franchise was completely offset by decline in sales of remaining drugs in the HIV portfolio  The dolutegravir franchise comprises two three drug regimens   Triumeq and Tivicay   and two two drug regimens   Juluca and Dovato  Dovato was launched in the United States in April followed by launch in Europe in the third quarter of 2019  The growth in sales of Juluca and Dovato was more than offset by decline in sales of Triumeq and Tivicay due to transition of patients from three drug regimens to two drug regimens Sales of the dolutegravir franchise were flat in the U S  market as transition to the new two drug portfolio was offset by a net price benefit  However  sales of this franchise were up 3  in Europe and 9  in international markets  mainly driven by Tivicay in Europe and Triumeq in international markets  Please note that Glaxo markets Juluca in collaboration with J J   NYSE JNJ   Sales of Established Pharmaceuticals declined 5  due to lower sales of Advair  partially offset by strong uptake of authorized generic version of Ventolin  Advair lost 64  of sales year over year in the United States while Seretide sales were down 9  in Europe due to generic competition  Glaxo moved Advair to its Established Pharmaceuticals portfolio starting first quarter of 2019  Sales of Ventolin were up 27  during the quarter We remind investors that Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   launched the first generic version of Advair  Wixela Inhub  in the United States in February  The steep decline in sales of Advair is expected to continue in the fourth quarter Immuno inflammation drugs like Benlysta rose 35  in the quarter  In April  Benlysta s label was expanded to include children with lupus aged five years or older in the United States  Earlier this week  the drug was approved in Europe for a similar indication Oncology sales were  64 million  comprising sales of PARP inhibitor  Zejula  which was acquired from TESARO this year  compared to  57 million in the second quarter Consumer Healthcare Sales UpSales in the Consumer Healthcare segment increased 25  at CER primarily driven by Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   legacy brands  Glaxo has formed a new joint venture   JV   with Pfizer to create the world s largest Consumer Healthcare business  Third quarter sales of this segment include nine weeks of legacy Pfizer brand sales  arising after the creation of the JV  Sales of Wellness  Oral health and Skin health categories increased 22   10  and 9   respectively  in the quarter  Nutrition sales more than doubled in the third quarter On a pro forma basis  sales in the Consumer Health segment were up 3  at CER on the back of strong performance in Oral health  Pro forma growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to divestments and the phasing out of low margin contract manufacturing Vaccines Segment Growth Continues Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive  up 15  at CER  primarily driven by strong growth of new shingles vaccine  Shingrix and impressive performance of meningitis vaccine  Bexsero  Shingrix sales were up 76  to  535 million in the reported quarter  driven by strong uptake in the United States Although growth trend of Bexsero continued this quarter with sales increasing 19  on the back of strong demand across all markets  sales of another meningitis vaccine  Menveo fell 1  due to lower demand in international markets  Sales of influenza vaccine Fluarix were up 15  on the back of market share gain and reversal of provisions made for prior year returns  Sales of Established vaccines declined 1  year over year Operating Expenses UpSelling  general and administration  SG A  costs increased 16  year over year to  2 8 billion  The rise in SG A costs was driven by increased commercial activities to support launches and costs related to the acquisition of TESARO  partly offset by cost saving initiatives and benefits of restructuring in Pharmaceuticals segment Research and development  R D  expenses were up 18  to  1 16 billion  reflecting increased investments to support progress of clinical studies  especially those on Zejula  Glaxo has 41 new medicines  including 17 vaccines  in different development stages 2019 Guidance Glaxo raised its guidance for adjusted earnings in 2019  It currently expects earnings to remain flat year over year at CER  indicating an improvement over previous expectation of a decline of 3 5  at CER in 2019  The new guidance reflects improvement in operating performance  lower expected effective tax rate and increased investment in R D Our TakeGlaxo beat on earnings and sales in the third quarter  The company s new products from every segment performed well in the reported quarter  especially Shingrix  This prompted the company to raise its expectation for 2019 earnings We are encouraged by Glaxo s restructuring initiatives to focus on strengthening its pharmaceutical portfolio  The company boosted its oncology portfolio with the acquisition of TESARO in January and a collaboration agreement with Germany based Merck KgaA  in February  Following these two transactions  the company has 16 oncology pipeline candidates including in house candidates These transactions along with restructuring initiatives related to the Consumer Health segment will help the company to offset slowdown in legacy businesses  However  loss of Advair sales due to generic competition and competitive pricing will continue to hamper revenues

196871,418387,MYL,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Mylan  MYL ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this generic drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 11   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Mylan was expected to post earnings of  0 95 per share  but it reported  1 03 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 42   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 79 per share  while it actually produced  0 82 per share  a surprise of 3 80  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Mylan  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Mylan currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 88   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-mylan-myl-200472321,200472321
196872,418388,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This generic drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 03 billion  up 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 61  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mylan 
For Mylan  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Mylan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mylan would post earnings of  0 95 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  8 42  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Mylan appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-myl-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200479542,200479542

196888,418404,MYL,Forget Pfizer  Add These Big Drugmakers To Your Portfolio,opinion,"Pfizer   NYSE PFE    one of the biggest drugmakers in the world  is witnessing tough times in 2019  The company s stock has declined 19 7  this year so far   Pfizer has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Its earnings estimates have declined 1 7  for 2019 and 11 5  for 2020 over the past 30 days Pfizer lost exclusivity for its key drug Lyrica in the United States in July  Loss of exclusivity  LOE  of Lyrica and some other drugs is Pfizer s main cause of concern in 2019  LOEs are expected to hurt 2019 sales by  2 6 billion In July  along with the earnings  Pfizer lowered its previously issued sales and earnings guidance for 2019 to reflect the formation of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with Glaxo   NYSE GSK   and the Array BioPharma acquisition Pfizer merged its Consumer Healthcare unit with Glaxo s unit to form a new joint venture  JV   Pfizer owns 32  stake in the JV  In July  Pfizer bought Array BioPharma for  48 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately  11 4 billion in a bid to strengthen its cancer portfolio Other than this business development activity  incremental negative impact of foreign exchange and unfavorable product developments in case of Prevnar  vaccine  and Xeljanz  autoimmune diseases  also resulted in the guidance cut In July  Xeljanz s prescribing information in the United States was updated by the FDA to include two additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indication and dosing for ulcerative colitis indication  following review of a post marketing study   Pfizer stated on the second quarter call that the label update may have some negative impact on prescribing and hurt sales in the future quarters Meanwhile  due to some unfavorable revisions in Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices   ACIP  pneumococcal vaccination guidelines for Prevnar 13 in adults in the United States  Pfizer expects some decline in demand for Prevnar  which can hurt sales in the future quarters Meanwhile  Pfizer s sterile injectables portfolio is seeing lower revenues since the past few quarters due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the United States  Pfizer is facing supply shortages for sterile injectable products mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues Importantly  in July  Pfizer announced a definitive agreement to spin off its Upjohn unit and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction to create a new generic pharmaceutical company  Upjohn is Pfizer s global  off patent branded and generic established medicines business  The news did not go down well with investors and Pfizer s stock declined after the announcement  probably because the drugs being divested were key cash flow generators for Pfizer and funded its R D efforts  The divestiture of Upjohn will significantly lower Pfizer s cash resources even though it might boost growth and also take away the Lyrica LOE cliff How is the Large Cap Pharma Industry Performing The Zacks industry  comprising some of the biggest drugmakers in the world  has declined 2 1  in 2019 so far  probably due to poor performance of big names like Pfizer  Bristol Myers and Lilly  However  the industry features in the top 11  of the 256 Zacks ranked industries and there are many attractive investment options in the space We believe that new product sales ramp up as a result of rising demand  driven by growth in ageing population  successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas  strong clinical study results  and frequent FDA approvals  26 new drugs approved so far in 2019  have helped the big drug giants to do well this year despite broader macro issues or the industry s own challenges  The industry is likely to perform well even if the global economy slows in the remainder of the year  as is widely expected  This is because it is a defensive sector  which is almost insulated from broader macroeconomic factors  Also  the spate of pharma M A deal announcements this year so far has provided impetus to drug stocks Meanwhile  most big pharma companies are resorting to restructuring activities  which is increasing their financial capacity  The funds can be used to re stock pipelines with promising new drug candidates bought from smaller innovative drug biotech companies However  the sector faces its share of headwinds like government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  generic competition for blockbuster treatments  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and most importantly major pipeline setbacks Nonetheless  we believe pipeline success  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A and collaboration activity and appropriate utilization of cash should keep the sector afloat through the rest of this year In this scenario  investing in stocks with a large market cap is a prudent move  given the fact that they control a large portion of the industry Here we have highlighted three bigshot drugmakers  which may prove to be good buys  All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   have outperformed the industry this year and witnessed positive estimate revisions in the past 60 days You can see  A chart showing the share price movement of the three stocks and the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry this year so far is given below   3 Stocks to BuyMerck   NYSE MRK  Shares of Merck have risen 13 2  this year so far  Earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020 have risen 3 2  and 1 3   respectively over the past 60 days  Merck has a Zacks Rank  2 A significant part of Merck s outperformance this year so far has been driven by strong performance of its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda and positive regulatory updates related to it  Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally  The drug generated sales of almost  5 billion in the first half of 2019  reflecting a massive 56 6  surge year over year The Keytruda development program is also progressing well with Merck spending billions for research and development of this medicine to secure more approvals in earlier lines of treatment  Undoubtedly  Keytruda has strong future growth prospects based on increased utilization  approval for new indications and expectation of additional approvals worldwide  In addition to Keytruda  Merck s other new products  Lynparza  and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to its top line Merck gained FDA approval for its new combination antibacterial injection  Recarbrio  a fixed combination of relebactam with imipenem cilastatin  and a new indication   two types of pneumonia infections   for its antibacterial medicine  Zerbaxa  It also gained several label expansion approvals for PARP inhibitor Lynparza  for which it has partnership

Earlier this month  Roche gained FDA approval for personalized medicine Rozlytrek  entrectinib  for the treatment of adults with ROS1 positive  metastatic non small cell lung cancer Moreover  the pending acquisition of Spark will enable Roche to gain a foothold in the promising gene therapy space as it faces stiff competition from biosimilars of key drugs such as Avastin  Rituxan and Herceptin

oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor  Exjade  Jakavi  Zykadia  Tasigna  Promacta and Jadenu  Solid performance of new drugs like Cosentyx  Entresto and Lutathera has boosted results in recent times  The strong uptake of biosimilars boosted performance of the generic division  Sandoz  and offset the weakness in generics  New launches like Zolgensma and Piqray should further bolster

196909,418425,MYL,Theravance  TBPH  Q2 Loss Narrower  Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Theravance Biopharma  Inc    NASDAQ TBPH   incurred a loss of 72 cents per share in second quarter 2019  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 22 but wider than the year ago quarter s loss of 76 cents 
Total revenues of  26 2 million in the quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  14 million  Revenues also increased 11 5  year over year  The increase was mainly due to licensing revenues of  18 5 million received from Mylan as an upfront payment related to the expansion of their present development and commercialization agreement for Yupelri to include China and certain adjacent territories 
In November 2018  Theravance completed the sale of its only marketed drug  Vibativ  to Cumberland Pharmaceuticals  As a result  the company was not able to generate any revenues from product sales in the second quarter of 2019  Collaboration revenues were  7 7 million in the quarter 
Shares of Theravance have lost 18 5  in the year so far versus the  growth of 7 8  

 
Research   development expenses were  46 4 million  down 4 5  from the year ago quarter  primarily due to lower employee related expenses and a decrease in share based compensation 
Selling  general   administrative expenses declined 11 2  to  22 2 million due to lower Vibativ related external expenses and lower share based compensation 
Product   Pipeline Updates
Theravance has collaborated with Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   for the development and commercialization of Yupelri  revefenacin  as the maintenance treatment for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   which was approved by the FDA last November 
The company stated that  in the second quarter  Yupelri witnessed strong customer acceptance and brand performance across key market metrics 
Notably  Theravance has an economic interest in royalties earned from GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   on triple combination COPD treatment Trelegy Ellipta s global sales  In the second quarter of 2019  Glaxo recorded sales of 151 4 millionfrom Trelegy Ellipta  Theravance is eligible to receive 5 5 8 5   tiered  of the product s worldwide net sales 
The company also has a collaboration agreement with Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   subsidiary  Janssen  to develop its JAK inhibitor  TD 1473  for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases  A phase II study on TD 1473 for treating Crohn s disease and a phase IIb III study for ulcerative colitis are ongoing 
Theravance is evaluating ampreloxetine  TD 9855  in a phase III program for treating patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension  nOH  
The company is also developing inhaled  lung selective pan Janus kinase  JAK  inhibitor  TD 8236  in a phase I study for the treatment of various serious respiratory diseases  The company plans to provide the biomarker data of TD 8236 in the third quarter of 2019 after evaluating healthy volunteers and asthma patients

196910,418426,MYL,Acorda  ACOR  Q2 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates,opinion,Acorda Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ ACOR   reported second quarter 2019 loss per share of 55 cents  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 06  However  the figure came in against the year ago earnings of  1 40 Meanwhile  the company generated total revenues of  50 1 million in the second quarter  comprehensively beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  26 2 million  However  sales tumbled 67 3  year over year due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis  MS  drug Ampyra Shares of Acorda have plunged 61  so far this year  outperforming the  decrease of 0 4  Quarter in DetailInbrija generated sales of  3 million in the reported quarter  reflecting a significant sequential increase Notably  last December  the FDA approved Acorda s Parkinson s disease  PD  drug Inbrija  Following this nod  the product became the first and the only approved inhaled levodopa for treating OFF periods in patients suffering Parkinson s and receiving a carbidopa   levodopa regimen  Inbrija was launched in February this year Last month  the European Medicines Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  rendered a positive opinion recommending the approval of Inbrija in Europe  A final decision is expected by the end of 2019 The company believes that Inbrija sales will pick up in the future quarters  having received an encouraging feedback  both from doctors and patients since its launch  An approximately 4 500 prescription request forms for Inbrija were received through July 2019 Although majority of Acorda s net product revenues were drawn from the company s MS drug Ampyra  which raked in sales of  44 2 million in the quarter  the sales figure nonetheless suffered a huge 70 6  slump year over year due to generic competition  However  sales improved 10 2  sequentially  On a positive note  Ampyra sales were higher than the company s internal projections in the second quarter because sales erosion due to generic launches was less severe Last September  Ampyra lost its exclusivity as generics entered the market including Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   authorized generic version  Consequently  Acorda believes that Ampyra sales will see a sharp decline in the quarters ahead in 2019 Meanwhile  royalty revenues were  2 8 million in the quarter  almost in line with the year ago reported figure Acorda s research and development  R D  expenses  excluding share based compensation expenses  were  18 2 million  down 25 4  year over year Selling  general

 2019 compared with  343 3 million as of Mar 31  2019 We would like to remind investors that the successful commercialization of Inbrija is imperative for long term growth at Acorda  especially as generic competition looms large on Ampyra  Although Inbrija is off to a promising start  it still remains to be seen if the product can deliver the desired results and be a worthy replacement for Ampyra in the long run Notably  more than 350 000 people in the United States are suffering OFF periods related to Parkinson s disease  Acorda estimates Inbrija s market opportunity to be more than  800 million in the United States 2019 GuidanceAcorda expects Ampyra revenues to exceed  140 million for the full year  Previously  the company decided not to provide any outlook for Ampyra due to its waning revenues  induced by the entrance of generics The company expects full year R D and SG A expenses  excluding share based compensation  in the band of  70  80 million and  200  210 million

196912,418428,MYL,Should Value Investors Pick Mylan N V   MYL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Mylan N V  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 4 48  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 75  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Mylan N V   current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 8 76  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 98  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Mylan N V  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 4 45  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Mylan N V   stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Mylan N V  has a P S ratio of about 0 90  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Mylan N V  currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MYL a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 20  which is slightly better than the industry average of 3 78  Clearly  MYL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Mylan N V  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives MYL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 1 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Mylan N V  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMylan N V  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 26  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion

196918,418434,MYL,Exclusive  Africa to get state of art HIV drugs for  75 a year,news,"By Kate Kelland and Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    Makers of generic AIDS drugs will start churning out millions of pills for Africa containing a state of the art medicine widely used in rich countries  after securing a multi million dollar guarantee that caps prices at just  75 per patient a year   Global health experts hope the deal will help address two looming problems in the HIV epidemic   the rising threat of resistance developing to standard AIDS drugs  and the need for more investment in manufacturing capacity   Bill Gates  charitable foundation will guarantee minimum sales volumes of the new combination pills using dolutegravir  a so called integrase inhibitor that avoids the drug resistance that often develops with older treatments   In return the drugmakers  India based Mylan Laboratories  O MYL  and  Aurobindo Pharma   NS ARBN   will agree the maximum price of about  75 per patient for a year s supply   less than the list price for one day s supply of a dolutegravir combination in the United States  The agreement  which will make the treatment available to 92 poor countries  starting in Africa  will be formally announced during the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Thursday   We need to make that guarantee because  of  the fixed costs of everybody gearing up to make high volume   Gates told Reuters in a telephone interview   That just wasn t going to happen unless we put forward a very substantial volume guarantee   The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation s pledge is a central plank of a new partnership   the largest of its kind in global health   that also includes the governments of South Africa and Kenya  the Clinton Health Access Initiative  and American  British and U N  agencies   Under the deal  Mylan and Aurobindo will ramp up availability of a new fixed dose combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  lamivudine and dolutegravir  TLD    Health ministries and other public sector purchasers will be able to buy TLD from next year at the capped price  The agreement could potentially save them more than  1 billion in drug bills over the next six years  the partners estimate   As well as improving treatment  the drug combination should also reduce the need for more expensive second  and third line drugs   TREATMENT AND RESISTANCE  Around 37 million people around the world are infected with HIV  according to the United Nations AIDS agency UNAIDS  Just over half of them   about 19 5 million patients   get antiretroviral therapy medicines to keep their disease in check  That represents remarkable progress in the past 20 years  driven by the availability of a first wave of cheap generic drugs from Indian companies  But rising levels of drug resistance are now a growing concern  while low prices have cut the incentive for investment in generic drug making capacity  In six out of 11 countries surveyed recently in Africa  Asia and Latin America  researchers found that more than 10 percent of HIV patients starting antiretroviral drugs had a strain of HIV resistant to the most widely used medicines  Once the 10 percent threshold is reached  best practice calls for switching to different drug regimens  Dolutegravir is already being used on a limited basis as a single drug in Kenya  Nigeria  and Uganda  The drug was originally developed by ViiV Healthcare  the HIV business majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK   ViiV has offered licensing deals to generic companies to sell low cost versions of the medicine in poor countries  Clinical trials have shown that treatment regimens including dolutegravir work faster  have fewer side effects and demonstrate greater potency against drug resistance than standard HIV drugs used in Africa and other poor countries  The TLD combination pill developed by Mylan and Aurobindo has already received tentative approval from the U S  Food and Drug Administration under the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program  In Western markets  makers of patented AIDS drugs  such as GSK and arch rival Gilead Sciences  O GILD   notch up billions of dollars of highly profitable sales each year   But the picture is very different for low price generic companies in India  which have very low margins   The market is always on the edge where these guys don t make enough money to stay in the business   said Gates  With the HIV positive population still growing   there were an estimated 1 8 million new cases of infection in 2016   the number of patients needing treatment is steadily increasing   Industry experts like Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels question the feasibility of maintaining lifelong treatment for a patient population that could reach 50 million

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8 42   A quarter ago  it was expected that this generic drugmaker would post earnings of  0 79 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of 3 80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Mylan  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  posted revenues of  2 85 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 97   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 81 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Mylan shares have lost about 32 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 7  
What s Next for Mylan 
While Mylan has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Mylan was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 17 on  3 06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 25 on  11 65 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

196941,418457,MYL,Stock Exchange  Brilliant Trading Or Is The Market Just Up ,opinion,"The Stock Exchange is all about trading  Each week  we do the following

Review  Do You Evaluate Your Trading Mistakes 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Do You Evaluate Your Trading Mistakes  We reminded traders that it is important to evaluate your past trading mistakes  and to do so objectively  Specifically  leave your emotions and excuses at the door  Rather  try to learn from your mistakes  and improve systematically 
This Week  Brilliant Trading Or Is The Market Just Up 
It s easy to feel smart when the overall market is up  But just because your account balance is getting fatter  does that mean you are a brilliant trader  or is their something else going on 
Some investors point out that the market goes up over time  whereas others are deathly afraid of market volatility so they cluster their nest egg in cash or highly rated investment grade bonds  regardless of the disgusting low interest rates  
Others offer trading strategies that have lower correlations with the overall market so they can can earn strong returns over time that also offer some important diversification benefits versus straight stock market investment strategies 
On the other hand  perhaps you do deserve some credit for being brave enough to be in the market thereby benefiting your nest egg with a higher balance  And then of course there are those who only brag about the their successes when the market is up  but  crickets  when the market is down 

A classic 60 40 mix of stocks and bonds works for some  and you can cater those percentages up or down based on your preferences  And you can also mix in a trading strategy that offers long term return potential with less  stock market risk   or  beta risk   depending on who you re talking to

Expert Picks From The Models
Note  This week s Stock Exchange report is being moderated by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  I bought shares of Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings  OLLI  on 6 14  You can see the chart below 

Blue Harbinger  I know you re a  dip buyer  Holmes  and I can see the dip in the chart 
Holmes  Yep  that s correct  I use a mean reversion approach to identify stocks that have moved  abnormally  far from their recent price history  And Ollie s did  and I also identified the additional conditions necessary for me to purchase  Sometimes market conditions may impact my trades  but since these mean reversion stocks are often at a low recent price point  they are generally less impacted by market  beta  as you say  Besides  beta is a longer term horizon metric anyway  and I typically hold for around only 6 weeks 
BH  Interesting  but with the market up so much in the last few years  I think a premium high end store could be a better idea than something called  bargain outlet   but alas you are the dip buyer  By the way  Ollie s other brands are called  Ollie s Bargain Outlet  Good Stuff Cheap  Ollie s Army  Real Brands Real Cheap   Real Brands  Real Bargains  Sarasota Breeze  Steelton Tools  American Way  and Commonwealth Classics names   Anyway  here is a look at the FastGraph 

Road Runner  I recently bought some shares of Planet Fitness  PLNT  on 6 12  I like to purchase stocks in the lower end of a rising channel and then hold them for about 4 weeks  What do you think about that 

BH  Well I think Planet Fitness is probably getting some good rent concessions because every time I hear about a struggling shopping mall REIT  management is always talking about renting the former space of bankrupt retailers to fitness franchises  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

RR  The Fast Graph and fundamental data are nice  but as we ve discussed previously  I look for a certain type of situation  some call it a pattern  others may call it a setup  etc   where the probability of a particular action is not a matter of chance  50 50  but has been historically noted to result in a greater tendency towards a particular outcome   Trending in a channel  is one such situation  An equity will often  cycle  between the upper and lower bounds of that channel for substantial periods of time  My model design attempts to take advantage of this property by identifying stocks trending in an upwards channel and waiting until the stock price drifts to the lower bound  making it a candidate for purchase  These types of situations have a relatively high probability of positive outcome with a reasonable profit potential  Planet Fitness can be seen to be in this type of a situation  This is a short term trade that has traditionally shown profitability when the right conditions have been met  One way or another  I ll be out of it shortly   usually after about 4 weeks 
BH  Thanks for that explanation  And how about you  Athena   do you have any trades to share this week 
Athena  I bought shares of Tableau Software  DATA   How do you feel about that 

BH  I think that is a powerful growth stock that you ought too hold for many months  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Athena  Well  for your information  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Tableau  A quick look at the chart makes the strength of the trend fairly obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or a stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
BH  Thanks Athena  that is interesting stuff and a nice trade idea  And how about you  Felix   anything to share this week 
Felix  No trades  but I do have a ranking to share  This week  I ran the stocks of the Nasdaq 100 through my technical trading model  and my top 20 are ranked in the following list 

BH  Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Felix  Really  That s a pharmaceuticals company  and together with its subsidiaries  it develops  licenses  manufactures  markets  and distributes generic  branded generic  brand name  and over the counter  OTC  pharmaceutical products in North America  Europe  and internationally  I suppose that s in the healthcare sector  which is down this year   and it seems like long term demographics eventually need to drive the sector higher  Thanks for sharing that list 
Oscar  This week I ran the stocks of our comprehensive and diverse ETF universe through my model  and my top 20 are ranked below 

BH  I swear  Oscar you ve had that Invesco Solar ETF  TAN  ranked at the top of your list for a while now  But I suppose it is up over 50  year to date  Thank you for sharing 
Conclusion 
The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   is up over 17  this year  so it s easy to feel like a genius if you ve just been holding stocks  But how were you feeling during Q4 of 2018 when the market was down sharply  Less of a genius  Many traders focus on alpha  but beta can be a far bigger driver of performance if you re not careful  Choose your beta wisely  And on the other hand  if you are a long term investor beware of beta disguised as alpha  Just because the market is up  that doesn t mean you are a trading genius ",2019-06-20,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-exchange-brilliant-trading-or-is-the-market-just-up-200433118,200433118

196956,418472,MYL,After Mylan Lost A Quarter Of Its Value  Look For A Bounce,opinion,"Summary 
Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  sank 24  on Tuesday after the company posted earnings that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings but missed on revenue 
As this move is coming toward the end of its current market cycle  we expect a small bounce  but expect this to be followed by more downside risk 

The company reported earnings per share of  0 82 and total revenue of  2 5 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  0 79 and  2 7 billion  Management also reaffirmed its guidance  which is in line with expectations 
Facing an array of problems  CEO Heather Bresch had announced a strategic review on which   There is a tremendous amount of work being done   However  she was unable to give an update or a specific date on which she would provide the results  This did not assuage investor concerns

Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA    Mylan   NASDAQ MYL    Novartis   NYSE NVS   and Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog Generic Drugmakers Face Antitrust Suit Alleging Price FixingShares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  fell almost 15  on May 13 following media reports of an antitrust lawsuit filed by 44 states against the company and several other generic drugmakers for allegedly artificially inflating prices of generic drugs  in some cases exceeding 1000   Other companies named in the 510 page lawsuit were Mylan  Sandoz  the generic arm of Novartis   Dr  Reddy s Laboratories and a subsidiary of Pfizer among others  While shares of Mylan were down 10   Novartis  stock declined around 2   Dr Reddy s was down more than 4  and Pfizer declined slightly The group of 44 states was led by Connecticut attorney general William Tong  The lawsuit  filed in Connecticut federal court  alleged that these drugmakers conspired during lunches  dinners  golf outings and other social events  to inflate the prices of more than 100 generic drugs  The lawsuit alleges that these companies perpetrated a multi billion fraud on Americans by manipulating prices of generic drugs  which are supposedly cheaper  copycat  versions of the branded drugs  The generic drugmakers allegedly  systematically  divided the market so that they do not compete with one another and at the same time can charge high prices  If the allegations are true  the companies will be slapped with huge damages and penalties   Teva alone allegedly increased prices of more than 100 generic drugs Teva denied the charges saying that these were just allegations and that the company has not engaged in any conduct that will result in civil criminal liability The lawsuit comes amid attempts by both President Trump and Congress to keep prices of drug prices low and ensure affordability of high cost drugs  Trump has  time and again  criticized pharmaceutical companies for steep pricing of medicines  Industry players have been reeling under pressure for quite some time now as they fear that Trump s pharma plan could dent their profits Though the industry has been constantly warned by Trump to keep prices of drugs affordable  it is probably not doing anything about it  On his part  the President can take several steps in this direction  He can push for faster generic approval  which he is already doing  He can also ask for discounted rebates to be disclosed  put limitations on promotions advertisements of the drugs and mandate Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers It is high time drug companies take steps to provide relief to consumers by keeping cost of medicines affordable  Until then  the drug pricing controversy will remain an

196975,418491,MYL,Earnings Preview  Mylan  MYL  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This generic drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 79 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 69 billion  up 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 31  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mylan 
For Mylan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mylan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mylan would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 30  delivering a surprise of  2 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Mylan doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-mylan-myl-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200413104,200413104

growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at CER Quarterly HighlightsGlaxo reports financial figures under three segments  Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare The Pharmaceuticals division registered 2  increase in revenues at CER  Sales in the United States were up 1   The upside was driven by HIV drugs and new respiratory disease drugs  Nucala and Trelegy  Glaxo has stated that Nucala continues to be the leader in terms of total sales in the asthma biologics market Sales of Established Pharmaceuticals declined 6  due to lower sales of Advair  partly offset by launch of authorized generic version of Advair and Ventolin Glaxo moved Advair to its Established Pharmaceuticals portfolio starting this quarter  The launch of Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   generic version of Advair   Wixela Inhub   the first Advair generic in the United States  in February resulted in 27  decline in Advair sales  The steep decline in sales of Advair is expected to

increased 30  Immuno inflammation drugs like Benlysta rose 15  in the quarter under discussion  In April  Benlysta s label was expanded to include children with lupus aged five years or older Oncology sales were  43 million  driven by the recently added PARP inhibitor  Zejula  with acquisition of TESARO Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment increased 1  at CER as growth in Oral health and Nutrition was partly offset by decline in the Wellness and Skin health category  International markets drove sales of the segment higher  However  the company is facing increased competition in Europe Divestment of Horlicks and MaxiNutrition along with other smaller brands in the United Kingdom unfavorably impacted overall sales by a percentage point Late last year  Glaxo announced a joint venture with Pfizer   NYSE PFE   to create the world s largest Consumer Healthcare business  The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019 Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive  up 20  at

progress of clinical studies  especially oncology  This increase was partly offset by lower clinical activity related to HIV products 2019 ViewGlaxo still expects its earnings to decline 5 9  at CER in 2019  including the impact of Advair generic and costs related to the acquisition of TESARO  The guidance assumes the closure of the joint venture with Pfizer for Consumer Healthcare business and

196978,418494,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Surpasses Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 79 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 96 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 80   A quarter ago  it was expected that this generic drugmaker would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 30  delivering a surprise of  2 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Mylan  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  posted revenues of  2 50 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 32   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 68 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Mylan shares have added about 3 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17  
What s Next for Mylan 
While Mylan has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Mylan was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 02 on  2 92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 38 on  11 98 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Generic Drugs is currently in the bottom 33  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-myl-surpasses-q1-earnings-estimates-200418191,200418191

196995,418511,MYL,Careful With Mylan,opinion,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  is currently downtrending and trading within a descending triangle having it s base on the  26 mark  This short term support was tested effectively ending December and then in late February and it appears it s headed towards that price again 

However  since the price is getting more and more closer to the angle closing the triangle  it might not be such a good idea to test this support again  Now  the stock might bounce once it hits it  but it doesn t seem to have much space on the upside 
Other technical tools like MACD and Ichimoku Cloud  also show bearish signs weighing on the pharmaceutical company 

Ichimoku Cloud is pretty effective cause it anticipates the stock s movement in a 26 term  this case days   time period  When the price is trading in this case below the cloud and below it s base line  red line   you have a bearish scenario  And lastly  RSI shows it still has room for a further decrease without entering yet in oversold territory

figures under three segments  Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare The Pharmaceuticals division registered 4  increase in revenues at CER  The upside was driven by HIV drugs  Tivicay and

increased 6  at CER on the back of 7  and 18  growth in the Europe and International markets  respectively  U S  sales were up 3  at CER  These encouraging numbers were driven by continued sales growth for Triumeq  Tivicay and Juluca  The company continued to hold 27  of the HIV vaccine market share in the United States during the fourth quarter  However  sales of another HIV drug named Epzicom Kivexa tumbled 31  at CER due to severe generic competition Notably  the company s latest product from the HIV portfolio is Juluca  dolutegravir   rilpivirine   the first two drug regimen

the United States  which is expected to be launched by the end of this month  Glaxo expects the generic launch to severely impact the already declining sales of Advair in 2019  Moreover  Glaxo will move Advair to its Established Pharmaceuticals portfolio starting with the first quarter of 2019 Immuno inflammation drugs like Benlysta rose 34  in the quarter under discussion Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment increased 1  at CER as strong performances in Oral health and Nutrition were partly offset by decline in the Wellness and Skin health category  Although the segment performed well in the United States and International markets  it is facing increased competition and slowing demand in Europe Unfavorable impact of Horlicks and MaxiNutrition divestment along with other smaller brands in the United Kingdom was offset by growth of Transderm Scop in the United States as it benefited from supply constraints faced by its generic competitors In December 2018  the company announced the divestment of renowned brands      in the emerging markets  which is expected to be closed by the end of 2019  In the same month  it announced a  with Pfizer   NYSE PFE   to create the world s largest Consumer Healthcare business  Glaxo expects to eventually spin off the business in the next three years following the closure of the deal in the second half of 2019 Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive  having increased 18  at CER  primarily driven by higher sales of new shingles vaccine  Shingrix and strong performance of influenza products  However  sales of meningitis vaccines Bexsero and Menveo were down 3  and 37   respectively  Shingrix sales more than doubled to  221 million in the reported quarter driven by market expansion in new patient population The company  however  expects its meningitis portfolio to return to strong growth in 2019 Influenza vaccine  Fluarix grew 69  due to improved European sales and stronger sales in the United States Selling  general and administration  SG A  costs increased 3  year over year to  2 5 billion due to increased commercial activities to support launches  partly offset by cost control initiatives Research and development  R D  expenses were down 1  to  1 billion  reflecting benefits of re prioritization of the R D portfolio  which was partially offset by increased investments to support progress of clinical studies  especially oncology 2019 OutlookGlaxo expects its EPS to decline 5 9  at CER in 2019  including the impact of Advair generic and costs related to the acquisition of TESARO  The guidance assumes closure of joint venture with Pfizer for Consumer Healthcare business and divestment of certain nutrition brands in India Bangladesh in 2019Loss of Advair sales in the United States due to generic launch is expected to result in a slight decline in sales in Glaxo s Pharmaceutical segment in 2019  Novartis   NYSE NVS   and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are also looking to get approval for its Advair generic  A potential approval of their drugs will further erode sales of the branded drug Our TakeWe are encouraged by Glaxo s restructuring initiatives to focus on strengthening its pharmaceutical portfolio  The company boosted its oncology portfolio with the acquisition of  in January and a collaboration agreement with Germany based   announced this month  Following these two transactions  the company will have 16 oncology pipeline candidates including candidates developed in house These transactions along with the restructuring initiatives related to

197009,418525,MYL,Mylan  MYL  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 26  after the market closes 
The company s performance has been mixed so far  with earnings missing estimates in two of the last four quarters  Mylan reported average negative earnings surprise of 1 95  over the said time frame  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat estimates by 6 8   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Mylan s stock has lost 17 5  in the past six months compared with the  decline of 24 4  

 
Factors to Consider
Along with third quarter results  Mylan reiterated its outlook for 2018  Mylan expects 2018 total revenues of  11 25  12 25 billion  The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share  EPS  around  4 55  4 90 
Mylan proactively discontinued a number of products  while also transferring some to other sites  These have led to a temporary disruption in supply of certain products and reduction in volumes in North America generic sales  This  in turn  might impact sales 
While Mylan has one of the largest product portfolios among all generic pharmaceutical companies  the company has suffered a few setbacks in recent times  Mylan suffered a major setback as rival Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   won the FDA approval for the first generic version of the former s EpiPen and EpiPen Jr  epinephrine  auto injector for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions  including those that are life threatening  anaphylaxis   in adults and pediatric patients 
The approval of a generic will negatively impact EpiPen sales of Mylan  as the generic will obviously be priced lower  Mylan was earlier under the scanner for high price of the product   We note that the company already has its own authorized generic for the product  Teva has also launched its generic version 
During the earnings call  we expect investors to focus on the performance of EpiPen  newly launched biosimilars and other updates from the company s pipeline 
Mylan received a significant boost when the FDA approved its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s Advair Diskus   Wixela Inhub   following a few setbacks  Notably  this is the first generic of Advair Diskus approved  which  in turn  will give Mylan an edge over its competitors  Mylan has launched the generic 
The biosimilar business continues to gain traction  Mylan and partner Biocon had earlier obtained FDA approval of Fulphila  a biosimilar of Neulasta  The European Commission  EC  granted marketing authorization to Hulio  a biosimilar of Humira  for all indications  Approval of new biosimilars should boost sales 
In November 2019  Mylan and partner Theravance Biopharma  Inc  obtained FDA approval for Yupelri  revefenacin  inhalation solution for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   Yupelri  a long acting muscarinic antagonist  LAMA   is the first and only once daily  nebulized bronchodilator approved for the treatment of COPD in the United States 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model doesn t show that Mylan is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat on earnings  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 37   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  While the rank is favorable  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are few pharma company you may want to consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter

197011,418527,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Q4 Earnings   Revenues Miss Estimates  Stock Down,opinion,"Shares of Mylan N V   NASDAQ MYL   have declined 9 7  in after market trading  after the company reported lower than expected results for the fourth quarter and issued a tepid 2019 guidance 
Mylan s stock has lost 31 8  in the past six months compared with the  decline of 24 3  

 
Adjusted earnings of  1 30 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33 and declined from  1 43 in the year ago quarter 
However  fourth quarter revenues of  3 08 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 12 billion and declined 4 9  from the prior year quarter 
Quarter in Detail
The company posts results in three segments on a geographic basis  namely North America  Europe and Rest of World 
North America segment s net sales came in at  1 10 billion  down 16   This decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes on existing products due to actions associated with the restructuring and remediation activities at the Morgantown plant  the timing of purchases of products by customers and the impact of the implementation of new accounting standards 
The FDA completed an inspection at Mylan s plant in Morgantown  WV  in 2018 and made observations through a Form 483  Thereafter  Mylan submitted a comprehensive response to the FDA  During the second quarter of 2018  Mylan started a restructuring and remediation program to reduce complexity at the Morgantown manufacturing facility  which led to the discontinuation and transfer of a number of products to other manufacturing sites  a reduction in workforce and extensive remediation activities 
These actions have led to a temporary disruption in supply of certain products  In the fourth quarter  the company received a warning letter related to the previously disclosed observations 
Net sales in the Europe segment were  1 09 billion  up  15 8 million  which was primarily driven by new product sales and higher volumes on existing products 
Rest of World segment s net sales of  851 4 million were up 4   driven by new products 
Adjusted gross margin of 54 6  was slightly down from 55 5  in the year ago quarter 
2018 Results
Earnings per share of  4 58 were up from  4 56 in 2017 but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 63  Revenues were  11 43 billion  down 4  from 2017 and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 46 billion 
2019 Guidance
Revenues are projected between  11 5 billion and  12 5 billion  with a midpoint of  12 billion that is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 89 billion 
The company anticipates adjusted EPS around  3 80  4 80  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 99 
Our Take
Mylan s fourth quarter results were disappointing as the company missed on both earnings and sales  While the generic market in large has been experiencing a slowdown  Mylan itself proactively discontinued a number of products along with transferring some to other sites 
These have led to a temporary disruption in supply of certain products and reduced volumes in North America generic sales  including the EpiPen auto injector  We note that rival Teva Pharmaceutical   NYSE TEVA   has already won the FDA approval for the first generic version of Mylan s EpiPen and EpiPen Jr  which  in turn  will impact sales further 
Moreover  slower than expected uptake of generic Copaxone  even after reducing the price by more than 60   adversely impacted sales in North America 
The guidance for 2019 was disappointing as well 
Nevertheless  Mylan received a significant boost when the FDA approved its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   Advair Diskus   Wixela Inhub   following a few setbacks  Notably  this is the first generic of Advair Diskus approved  which  in turn  will give Mylan an edge over its competitors  Mylan has launched the generic and continues to gain traction with its biosimilar portfolio 
Mylan and partner Biocon obtained the FDA approval for Fulphila  a biosimilar of Neulasta  The company earlier received the FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings    OTC RHHBY   Herceptin

197042,418558,MYL,Teva  TEVA  Stock Poised To Record Big Gains In 2019 ,opinion,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA   have picked up pace this year so far after declining sharply in 2017  Though the stock has declined 2 7  this year  it has outperformed its  s decline of 14  
 

 
Last year  Teva s stock declined a massive 54 6   underperforming the industry s decline of 26 3  
Teva is one of the world s largest generic drug makers and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  It appears on track to come up with a good performance in 2019 
You can see  
What s Going in Teva s Favor 
The Israel based generic drug maker has been facing significant challenges  This includes accelerated generic competition for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone  new competition for branded products  pricing erosion in the U S  generics business and a massive debt load of approximately  30 billion  
Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   earlier than expected launch of the first generic version of the 40 mg strength of Copaxone in October last year was a major setback for Teva  In the same month  Mylan also launched the second generic version of the 20 mg formulation of Copaxone  The first generic version of the 20 mg formulation has been marketed by Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   and Sandoz   Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm   since 2015 
With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation  there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone  Moreover  a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation  Glatopa  was launched by Sandoz in February this year  much earlier than its scheduled launch in April  A couple of other companies are also looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40 mg formulation and generic competition is expected to increase in 2019 
However  Teva has undertaken some strategic and restructuring initiatives to revive growth 
The company divested some non core assets last year  mainly in the Women s Health business  to cut its significant debt load  It also has a new organizational structure in place  is closing plants  cutting down its generics portfolio  eliminating low value R D projects  and is reducing global workforce to revive growth  Teva is progressing well on these re structuring activities and expects to save almost  3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives  which should boost the company s profits next year 
Its financial position also seems more stable than before as it is regularly paying down debt  Regular payment of debt is lowering its interest expense  which should again pull up its profits 
On the last earnings conference call held in November  Teva slightly raised the lower end of its full year sales guidance  However  it significantly raised its earnings guidance  following solid third quarter results and accelerated cost savings  The company also upped its free cash flow guidance  A guidance raise always suggests management s confidence in the company s potential to do well 
Most importantly  on the last earnings conference call  Teva management confirmedsigns of stabilization in U S  generic drug pricing  The company also said that the rate of sales erosion in the North American Generic business slowed significantly in the third quarter from second quarter levels due to optimization of its generics product portfolio as well as product launches 
Teva gained FDA approval for Truxima  CT P10   its biosimilar to Roche s Rituxan and launched limited doses of its generic version of Mylan s EpiPen and generic version of Lilly s blockbuster products Cialis in September November 2018  Next year  Teva will launch the generic version of lower dose EpiPen Jr  0 15mg  and bring in additional supply of 0 3 mg EpiPen generics  All these new generic biosimilar launches and slowing sales erosion in the generics segment can improve Teva s topline in the Generics segment in 2019 
Its newest drugs  Austedo and Ajovy  could emerge as significant contributors to the branded drugs portfolio in 2019 and thereafter 
Bottom Line
Overall  though Teva s woes like lower Copaxone sales and pricing erosion in the U S  generics business will continue in 2019  revenues from new branded and generic launches  accelerated cost savings and improving business fundamentals should provide top and bottom line support

197043,418559,MYL,MYL Vs  SUPN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Generic Drugs sector might want to consider either Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  or Supernus Pharmaceuticals  SUPN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Mylan and Supernus Pharmaceuticals are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  5  Strong Sell   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that MYL has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
MYL currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 69  while SUPN has a forward P E of 15 32  We also note that MYL has a PEG ratio of 0 88  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  SUPN currently has a PEG ratio of 0 90 
Another notable valuation metric for MYL is its P B ratio of 1 24  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SUPN has a P B of 4 45 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MYL s Value grade of A and SUPN s Value grade of D 
MYL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that MYL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/myl-vs-supn-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200374413,200374413

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 18 and the year ago loss of  1 27 Total revenues in the quarter under review skyrocketed 200  year over year to  12 8 million  mainly on the back of an

Cumberland is entitled to pay  25 million to Theravance as well as tiered royalties of up to 20  on the product s future net sales in the United States We believe  the sale is a strategic fit for

197053,418569,MYL,Momenta  MNTA  Reports Narrower Than Expected Loss In Q3 ,opinion,"Shares of Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   gained 0 5  after the company reported mixed results for the third quarter  
Momenta s stock has gained 4  in the year so far  against the  decline of 14 3  

 
The company reported loss per share of 45 cents in the quarter  excluding restructuring charges   narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents but wider than the year ago loss of 44 cents 
Revenues in the quarter came in at  14 9 million  significantly down from  24 1 million in the year ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 2  
Quarter in Detail
Momenta s top line comprises product revenues of  13 6 million earned from Sandoz s sales of Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone  20 mg   compared with  10 9 million in the year ago quarter  The increase in product revenues was primarily due to non recurring deduction of a  5 million contractual amount in 2017  which was offset by lower net sales of Glatopa  driven by Mylan N V  s   NASDAQ MYL   entry into the Copaxone market 
Research and development revenues came in at  1 3 million compared with  13 2 million in the year ago quarter  The decrease was primarily due to a  10 million milestone achieved in the 2017 period 
Research and development expenses decreased to  30 7 million from  37 9 million in the year ago quarter due to a decrease in external R D expenses for M923  General and administrative expenses were roughly flat at  20 4 million 
Pipeline Updates
As a result of its strategic review  results announced in October 2018   Momenta plans to advance its two late stage biosimilar assets  M923  which is its wholly owned proposed biosimilar to AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira  and M710  which is its proposed biosimilar to Regeneron s Eylea being developed in collaboration with Mylan  The company is in discussions with its collaboration partner  Mylan  to exit its participation in the development of its five other biosimilar programs  including M834  a proposed biosimilar to Orencia 
Momenta recently announced that it entered into a settlement with AbbVie Inc   to enable the commercialization of M923  Per the terms of the agreement and subject to approval by health regulatory authorities  Momenta may launch M923 in the United States on Nov 20  2023 and in Europe upon approval by the European Medicines Agency 
The company intends to submit a biologics license application for M923 to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a marketing authorization application in the European Union in the first half of 2019 Momenta is now seeking commercialization partners for M923 
In August 2018  Mylan initiated a clinical trial in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare safety  efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with Eylea 
Momenta s novel auto immune portfolio includes M230  a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors  SIF3   M281  an anti FcRn monoclonal antibody  and M254 
In October 2018  Momenta announced additional data from its phase I study of M281 in healthy volunteers 
The company announced that it plans to commence two phase II proof of concept clinical trials  one in generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG  and one in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn  HDFN   in the fourth quarter of 2018 
The company intends to initiate a phase I II proof of concept study in immune thrombocytopenic purpura  ITP  in early 2019  pending regulatory feedback 
Our Take
Momenta s third quarter results were pretty ho hum with loss coming in narrower than expected  while revenues lagging estimates   While the FDA approval of Glatopa 40 mg should relieve Momenta  competition will limit market share gains for the company as Mylan has already won the FDA s approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals    NYSE TEVA   Copaxone 40 mg  The company continues to face fierce competition due to growing pricing pressure from Mylan and Teva 
The completion of the strategic review has narrowed the company s focus on its biosimilar portfolio 
Zacks Rank
Momenta currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

197063,418579,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Q3 Earnings  Is A Disappointment In The Cards ,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   is scheduled to report third quarter 2018 results on Nov  5  after the market closes 
The company s performance has been dismal so far  having missed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters  The company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 6 12  over the said time frame Mylan N V  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   In the last reported quarter  the company missed earnings estimates by 13   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Mylan s stock has lost 19 2  in the year so far  against the  growth of 0 8  

 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Concurrent with second quarter results  Mylan lowered its annual outlook as a result of the change in expected product launches and resizing of product opportunities in the United States  The restructuring in Morgantown also impacted guidance 
Mylan expects 2018 total revenues of  11 25  12 25 billion  down from the previous projection of  11 75  13 25 billion  Mylan anticipates adjusted earnings per share around  4 55  4 90  down from the earlier estimate of  5 20  5 60 
Moreover  Mylan is evaluating strategic alternatives as the generic business in North America continues to experience pricing and competitive pressure 
While Mylan has one of the largest product portfolios among all generic pharmaceutical companies  the company has suffered a few setbacks in recent times  Mylan recently suffered a major setback as rival Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   won the FDA approval for the first generic version of the former s EpiPen and EpiPen Jr  epinephrine  auto injector for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions  including those that are life threatening  anaphylaxis   in adults and pediatric patients 
The approval of a generic would negatively impact EpiPen sales of Mylan as the generic will obviously be priced lower  Mylan was earlier under the scanner for high price of the product  We note that the company already has its own authorized generic for the same 
The company earlier suffered a setback  when the FDA refused to approve its Abbreviated New Drug Application for Wixela  the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug  Advair Diskus  The company recently stated that it has not received any new information request from the FDA for the same 
Nevertheless  the biosimilar business continues to gain traction 
Mylan and partner Biocon obtained FDA approval of Fulphila  a biosimilar of Neulasta  The news comes as a significant boost for Mylan  given the potential market for Fulphilia  The company also received the FDA approval for Ogivri  a biosimilar version of Herceptin  
The European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  issued a positive opinion recommending approval of Fulphila and Ogivri  The European Commission  EC  has granted marketing authorization to Hulio  a biosimilar of Humira for all indications 
During the earnings call  we expect investors to focus on the performance of EpiPen  newly launched biosimilars and other updates from its pipeline 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model doesn t show that Mylan is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat on earnings  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 12   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  While the rank is favorable  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  They are best avoided 
Stock to Consider
Here is a pharma company you may want to consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ PCRX   has an Earnings ESP of  45 9  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to report results on Nov 1  You can see

The greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating revenue  and cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in the pipeline So are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks has released an updated Special Report that explains this breakthrough and names the best 3 stocks to ride it ",2018-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-myl-q3-earnings-is-a-disappointment-in-the-cards-200352647,200352647
197064,418580,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Surpasses Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 25 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 17 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 10 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 84   A quarter ago  it was expected that this generic drugmaker would post earnings of  1 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 07  delivering a surprise of  13 01  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Mylan  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  posted revenues of  2 86 billion for the quarter ended September 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 29   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 99 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Mylan shares have lost about 25 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 9  
What s Next for Mylan 
While Mylan has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Mylan was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 38 on  3 12 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 62 on  11 50 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Generic Drugs is currently in the bottom 28  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2018-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-myl-surpasses-q3-earnings-estimates-200355068,200355068

197075,418591,MYL,Mylan  MYL  To Get CRL Again For Generic Advair From FDA ,opinion,"Shares of Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   are down after the company announced that the FDA will not approve its Abbreviated New Drug Application for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug  Advair Diskus  yet again 
The agency found minor deficiencies in the application  which will be relayed to the company in a Complete Response Letter  CRL  to be issued on June 27  2018 
The news comes as a disappointment for Mylan  Last year  the FDA had issued a CRL for it  as well  A probable approval would have boosted Mylan s generic portfolio immensely  given the potential market for the same 
The CRL also puts a question mark on Mylan s 2018 guidance and the company is expected to update on the same 
Mylan s stock has gained 4 2  in the last six months compared with the  gain of 3 9  

 
After a challenging 2017  things were looking up for Mylan in 2018 with recent approvals  which are expected to help the company combat the persistent decline in EpiPen sales 
Mylan s biosimilar portfolio got a boost with the recent FDA approval of Fulphila  a biosimilar of Neulasta  The company had earlier won the FDA approval of Ogivri  a biosimilar of Herceptin 
Earlier  Mylan received a major boost with the FDA approval for a generic version of Teva s   NYSE TEVA   Copaxone 40mg  Being one of the first filers  it will also enjoy 180 days of exclusivity  The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018 
Hence  the approval of generic Advair would have further propelled the company s broad portfolio of biosimilars and generics 
Meanwhile  Mylan is not the only company whose ANDA has been rejected by the FDA  Earlier in 2018  Swiss pharma giant Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm Sandoz also got a CRL from the FDA for its generic version of Advair  Sandoz is in the process of addressing the issues identified in the CRL and it does not expect to launch the generic before 2019 end  Hikma Pharmaceuticals also received a CRL from the FDA in 2017 for its generic version of Advair 
On the other hand  the delay in approval of generic version of Advair bodes well for Glaxo  Concurrent with the first quarter results  Glaxo stated that it expects Advair sales of around  750 million in 2018  assuming a mid year introduction of a substitutable generic competitor to Advair in the United States

197083,418599,MYL,Mallinckrodt to pay  100 million to settle U S  probe on drug pricing,news,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON  Reuters     Mallinckrodt  Plc  N MNK  has agreed to pay  100 million to settle allegations that a subsidiary broke U S  antitrust law by sharply increasing the price of a multiple sclerosis drug while ensuring that no rival medicine appeared on the market  the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday 
Mallinckrodt s share price dropped sharply to just under  43 from above  49 on a report Wednesday  which proved incorrect  that the FTC would sue Mallinckrodt  It spiked above  50 after news of a settlement and closed at  46 53  down 5 8 percent 
In 2001  Questcor bought the rights to Acthar  a type of hormone based drug used to treat infantile spasms as well as multiple sclerosis  Over time  the company raised the price from  40 per vial to more than  34 000  the FTC said  Questcor was acquired by Mallinckrodt in 2014 
Acthar  which is off patent  represented 34 percent of Mallinckrodt s  3 4 billion in net sales for fiscal 2016  the company said in a government filing 
Per patient  Medicare spent more on Acthar than for any other drug in 2015  putting out  504 million for just 3 104 patients  according to the Medicare Drug Spending Dashboard 
Several U S  drug makers have been criticized for sharp increases in drugs  notably Turing Pharmaceuticals  Daraprim and Mylan s  O MYL  EpiPen  The U S  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported 11 drugs saw price increases of more than 100 percent in 2015 
 This is an egregious case of a monopolist doing a deal to eliminate potential competition and keep its power over pricing  It is abhorrent that lifesaving drugs cost New Yorkers tens of thousands of dollars   said Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in a statement 
Mallinckrodt  an Irish company headquartered in the United Kingdom  said the settlement would not affect its net sales and slammed the FTC s probe 
 We continue to strongly disagree with allegations outlined in the FTC s complaint  believing that key claims are unsupported and even contradicted by scientific data and market facts   a company representative said in a statement

197088,418604,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Q1 Earnings Lag On Weak North America Sales,opinion,"Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   reported disappointing results for the first quarter as earnings and sales both missed estimates Mylan N V  Price and Consensus

   Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents but was up from 93 cents in the year ago quarter 
First quarter revenues of  2 68 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 78 billion and were down 1  from the prior year period 
Mylan s stock has lost 7 3  in the last six months compared with the  decline of 6 0  

 
Quarter in Detail
The company posts results in three segments on a geographic basis namely North America  Europe and Rest of World 
North America segment s third party net sales came in at  985 3 million  down 19  due to a decrease in the sales of branded products  including EpiPen Auto Injector  the impact of the loss of exclusivity of olmesartan and olmesartan HCTZ and the prior year divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets 
Sales were adversely impacted due to the implementation of new accounting standards along with lower volumes  and to a lesser extent  pricing  on other existing products partially offset by new product introductions 
Third party net sales from Europe were  1 04 billion  up 16   This was propelled by new product introductions across the region combined with volume expansion which offset the impact of pricing on existing products   Favorable foreign currency translation positively impacted sales by 14  
Rest of World segment s third party net sales of  626 7 million was up 8   driven by new products and increased volume from the anti retroviral franchise and higher sales in the emerging markets 
Adjusted gross margin of 52 9  was down from 53 5  in the year ago quarter 
During the quarter  Mylan repurchased 9 8 million ordinary shares for  432 0 million completing the previously authorized share repurchase program 
2018 Outlook Reiterated
Mylan expects revenues of  11 75  13 25 billion in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  12 45 billion  Mylan anticipates adjusted EPS of around  5 20  5 60 in 2018 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  5 35 
Our Take
Mylan s first quarter results were dismal as challenges in North America persist   The generic business in the United States continues to experience pricing pressure  Loss of exclusivity on olmesartan products also impacted sales 
Nevertheless  things are likely to look up in the long run  Mylan has already won an FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals    NYSE TEVA   Copaxone 40 mg  Notably  this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved  Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection  40 mg mL containing a Paragraph IV certification  the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity  The company also received an FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings    OTC RHHBY   Herceptin 
Although volatility in the U S  market is expected to persist in 2018  yet these approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help combat the decline in EpiPen sales  The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018  The launch of generic version of Estrace cream is also underway 
Key anticipated approvals also include a biosimilar version of Neulasta with a target action date in June 2018  The company expects to launch the biosimilar in the second half assuming approval  The EMA has also accepted applications for both the biosimilars  Mylan and partner Momenta   NASDAQ MNTA   will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710   a proposed biosimilar of ophthalmology drug Eylea   in the first half of 2018

197092,418608,MYL,Mylan launches EpiPen generic at  300 percent two pack,news," Reuters    Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV  which has come under fire for its drug pricing  said on Friday it would start selling a generic version of its life saving EpiPen allergy treatment for  300 per two pack  a more than 50 percent discount 
The company has been under investigation by the U S  government  and its chief executive was called before Congress to testify on raising the price of a pair of EpiPens to more than  600 from  100 in 2008 
Mylan  which first announced it would launch the generic version of its allergy auto injector EpiPen for  300 in August  said the authorized generic would be available in pharmacies starting next week 
Mylan s move comes a day after 20 U S  states filed a lawsuit over pricing against generic drugmakers  including Mylan  Teva Pharmaceuticals and four other generic drugmakers 
The U S  Department of Justice on Wednesday filed criminal charges against two generic drug industry executives  alleging that they colluded to fix prices and split up market share 
The cases are part of a broader generic drug pricing probe that is under way at the state and federal level  as well as in the U S  Congress  In 2014  media reports of sharply rising drug prices led to Congressional hearings 
Mylan has been criticized for classifying EpiPen as a generic product  which led to its paying significantly smaller rebates to state Medicaid programs for the poor than if the drug were classified as branded 
The company said in October that it would pay  465 million to settle questions on the impact of the classification on U S  government healthcare costs 
Mylan said earlier this month it expected to cut less than 10 percent of its workforce to integrate its acquisitions

197093,418609,MYL,U S  lawmakers press Heritage Pharma on high prices for antibiotic,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two U S  lawmakers are questioning whether Heritage Pharmaceuticals misled them in response to a 2014 congressional inquiry about the rising price a common antibiotic  after 20 U S  states this week accused the company of price fixing 
In a Dec  16 letter to Heritage seen by Reuters  Maryland Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders said they feared the company was  disingenuous at best  in October 2014 when it told them it had not seen any significant price increases for its doxycycline hyclate product 
 We are very concerned that you made these assertions to Congress on behalf of Heritage during the exact time period that its executives were engaged in a price fixing scheme to prevent competition from driving down prices of doxycycline hyclate   they wrote 
In response to Friday s letter  the company said it does not make the same version of doxycycline hyclate that the lawmakers asked about in 2014  Heritage makes a delayed release version  not the immediate release version that was the subject of the 2014 inquiry 
Heritage said it explained this to the lawmakers in its 2014 response 
The letter to Heritage comes after criminal and civil charges were filed by the Justice Department and 20 states in connection with an alleged price fixing scheme involving doxycycline hyclate and glyburide  a diabetes drug 
On Wednesday  the Justice Department criminally charged Heritage s former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Glazer and former Heritage Vice President of Commercial Operations Jason Malek  accusing them of colluding with other generic manufacturers in schemes that entailed allocating market share and conspiring to raise prices 
The next day  20 states filed a parallel civil lawsuit against Heritage  along with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV  Teva Pharmaceuticals  Mayne Pharma Group  Citron Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd   saying they colluded to fix prices 
The lawsuit characterized Heritage as the  ringleader   with Glazer and Malek overseeing and running the scheme 
Mylan and Teva have previously denied the states  civil charges 
Sanders and Cummings launched a congressional inquiry into rising generic drug prices on Oct  2  2014  including the price of doxycycline hyclate 
As part of that  they sent a letter to Glazer while he was still CEO of Heritage to inquire about the prices 
Gary Ruckelshaus  who was then Heritage s outside counsel and now serves as vice president and general counsel  responded later that month and said Heritage  has not seen any significant price increases  for the drug ",2016-12-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-lawmakers-press-heritage-pharma-on-high-prices-for-antibiotic-448439,448439

197116,418632,MYL,Can New Approvals Help Mylan Stock Turn Around In 2018  ,opinion,"Shares of Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   have gained 7 6  in the last three months  as against the  decline of 3 7  

 
Mylan s fourth quarter results were mixed with the bottom line exceeding expectations but the top line lagging the same due to weak EpiPen sales  The generic business in the United States continues to experience pricing pressure 
The year 2017 was challenging for Mylan given the ongoing pricing pressure in the United States and uncertain regulatory environment  Moreover  the company s efforts to get Advair s generic approved faced a jolt when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application  ANDA  for generic Advair Diskus 
However  things are looking up for Mylan in 2018  We note that Mylan got a major boost with the FDA s approval of a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals    NYSE TEVA   Copaxone 40 mg  Notably  this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved  Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection  40 mg mL containing a Paragraph IV certification  the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity  The company also received an FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Roche Holdings    OTC RHHBY   Herceptin 
Although volatility in the US markets is expected to persist in 2018  yet these  approvals should position Mylan better in the year ahead and help it combat the decline in EpiPen sales  The company has more than 30 submissions planned in 2018  The launch of generic version of Estrace cream is also in the offing 
Meanwhile  key anticipated approvals include a biosimilar version of Neulasta with a target action date in June 2018  The company expects to launch the biosimilar in the second half assuming approval  The EMA has also accepted applications for both the biosimilars 
Meanwhile  Mylan and partner Momenta   NASDAQ MNTA   announced that the companies will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710   a proposed biosimilar of Eylea   in the first half of 2018  The trial will be a randomized  double blind  active control  multi center study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety  efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 with the reference drug 
We note that Eylea  a vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  inhibitor  has been approved for the treatment of neovascular  wet  age related macular degeneration  macular edema  following retinal vein occlusion  diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema 
The company is also looking forward for a tentative approval of generic Restatis with a target action date in July 2018

197117,418633,MYL,Should Value Investors Pick Mylan  MYL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Mylan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Mylan s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE is also slightly undervalued than the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio We should also point out that Mylan has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Mylan stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Mylan has a P S ratio of about 1 9  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MYL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Mylan currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Mylan a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 3  which is far better than the industry average of 10 6  Clearly  MYL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Mylan might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives MYL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and three down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 8 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Mylan N V  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMylan is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 27  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-03-15,Zacks Investment

197118,418634,MYL,U S  consumers will want Trump  Congress to take on drug prices,news,By Deena Beasley and Toni Clarke LOS ANGELES WASHINGTON  Reuters    Americans  growing alarm over rising prescription drug costs will pressure a new U S  administration and Congress to take action on pharmaceutical pricing  industry executives and healthcare experts say  Drugmaker stocks  battered in recent months  soared this week after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s victory  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton had vowed to take on pharmaceutical  price gouging   and some pundits predicted the Democrats would gain control of the Senate  giving her a stronger hand  The Republican sweep of Congress eliminated those fears  while boosting chances for other measures  such as corporate tax reforms that would benefit industry  However  the vote did not change a key dynamic  U S  consumers are paying more of the cost of drugs through higher health insurance deductibles and copayments  making them more sensitive to manufacturer price hikes  Most recently  a sixfold increase in the price of Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV s EpiPen stoked outrage for families who rely on the lifesaving allergy shot and prompted investigations by state attorneys general and Congress  If a manufacturer sharply raises the price of a drug   it will be in the headlines  I don t think it matters which party is in office   said Sandra Hunt  principal at PricewaterhouseCooper s health industry practice  Republican lawmakers have taken up drug pricing alongside Democrats  Republicans Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa  chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and Representative Jason Chaffetz  chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  led inquiries into Mylan s EpiPen pricing   A very strong majority of Republican voters want the Congress to address drug prices   said John Rother  president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care  which campaigns for lower prices  An October Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that 74 percent of respondents said making drugs for chronic conditions affordable should be a top health care priority for the federal government  Among Republican respondents  68 percent put drug prices as a top priority  A poll conducted by the Harvard T H  Chan School of Public Health found that 64 percent of voters   including 78 percent of likely Clinton voters and 48 percent of Trump supporters   believe the federal government should be able to limit pharmaceutical drug price hikes  BIGGER PRIORITY THAN OBAMACARE Trump and Republican leaders have vowed to repeal President Barack Obama s healthcare reform law  known as Obamacare  which has extended medical insurance to more than 20 million Americans  Despite complaints about Obamacare insurance premium increases  just 37 percent of Kaiser poll respondents said that overturning it was a high priority  Chaffetz is  evaluating his next steps  on the drug pricing issue when the next Congress convenes  an aide said  A representative for Grassley said he would press forward with a scheduled Nov  30 hearing into Mylan s EpiPen pricing   The U S  has always been a country that supports innovation     and we hope it will remain the same   said Pascal Soriot  chief executive of AstraZeneca Plc  which sells drugs like cholesterol fighter Crestor   But we also believe we will continue to have to deal with price ressures    Clinton s proposals to curb drug prices included capping consumers  monthly out of pocket costs  In the past  Trump has suggested allowing the government s Medicare health program for seniors to negotiate prices and making it easier to import drugs from countries where they sell for less  A Trump administration also could provide extra funding to the U S  Food and Drug Administration to speed approval of generic drugs  which still tend to cost far less than their brand name equivalents  health policy experts said  Capital Alpha Partners analyst Kim Monk  in a research note on Wednesday  said she expects advisors and Congress to steer Trump toward  more Republican oriented ideas   including pricing drugs based on their relative health benefit and requiring more disclosure of pricing details  Consumer advocate Rother cited the FAIR Drug Pricing Act  introduced in September by Senators John McCain  an Arizona Republican  and Tammy Baldwin  Wisconsin Democrat  as a potential vehicle for federal action  The bill would require manufacturers to explain annual price increases of more than 10 percent   It is a bipartisan bill consistent with traditional Republican health policy based on transparency and competition   Rother said  In California  voters on Tuesday rejected a ballot measure that would have require drugmakers to provide state health plans with discounts similar to those given to the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  The VA pays the lowest prices in the country   Drugmakers spent more than  106 million on a campaign to defeat the measure   A similar measure will go before Ohio voters  who backed Trump in the election  next November  The coalition behind California s proposition on Wednesday urged legislators to come up with  a more comprehensive solution to lower sky rocketing drug prices

197128,418644,MYL,Glaxo  GSK  Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates In Q4  ,opinion,GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK   reported core earnings of 72 cents per American depositary share in the fourth quarter of 2017  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents  The bottom line was up 11  at constant exchange rate  CER  compared with the year ago figure Glaxo s shares have lost 9 4  in a year s time against the  s 14 1  increase  Quarterly revenues rose 4  at CER to  10 3 billion   7 6 billion   driven by strong segmental performances in Consumer Healthcare  Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines  The top line also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 9 billion All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at CER Quarterly HighlightsSales were up 4  in the United States and 7  in the International markets  On the flip side  sales in Europe were flat year over year Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products surged 51   driven by HIV drugs  Tivicay and Triumeq  respiratory drugs  the Ellipta products and Nucala  and the meningitis preventive vaccines  Bexsero and Menveo Glaxo reports financial figures under three segments  Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare The Pharmaceuticals division registered 3  revenue growth  driven by HIV drugs  Tivicay and Triumeq and respiratory disease drugs  Relvar Breo and Nucala  This upside was but partly offset by the impact of recent divestments and a sales decrease of older respiratory products including Seretide Advair and Established Pharmaceuticals HIV sales increased 17  on the back of 19  and 28  growth in the United States and International sales  respectively  Europe sales were also up 7  year over year  The encouraging numbers were driven by continued market share growth for both Triumeq  sales up 27   and Tivicay  sales up 41    However  sales of another HIV drug Epzicom Kivexa tumbled 61  due to an increased generic competition  particularly affecting the European market Notably  the company s latest product from the HIV portfolio is Juluca  dolutegravir   rilpivirine   the first two drug regimen  once daily  single pill for HIV  It was approved in the United States in November 2017  The drug generated initial sales of  5 million during the quarter  However  this week  Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   has announced an FDA approval of its triple combination  once daily single tablet regimen  Biktarvy  bictegravir  emtricitabine  tenofovir alafenamide   for HIV 1 infection treatment  This approval might pose competitive threats to Juluca in the coming quarters Respiratory sales were up 2  at CER  In the EU and the International markets  sales increased 4  and 6   respectively  However  in the United States  the metric was flat year over year  The sales improvement was mainly driven by the new respiratory products sales growth  partially offset by the sales decline of older products like Seretide Advair  Flovent and Ventolin Notably  the recently launched respiratory product  Trelegy Ellipta  only once daily single inhaler triple therapy for COPD   has generated initial sales of  2 million in the United States and the EU during the reported quarter The Ellipta products recorded a 53  surge in sales  driven by market share gains with the global roll out continuing  However  this upside was offset by lower sales of Seretide Advair  down 14    Flixotide Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 12  and 9   respectively Immuno inflammation drugs  including Benlysta  rose 15  in the quarter The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals comprises the previous Established Products  Cardiovascular  metabolic and urology  CVMU  and other Pharma products  Established Pharmaceuticals sales declined 5  in the quarter under review Sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment climbed 4   despite a slowdown in market conditions  The power brands  particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories  saw a sturdy performance in the quarter Sales from the Vaccines segment were impressive  having increased 9  year over year  Geographically  the United States  Europe and the international markets increased 16   2  and 9   respectively  While meningitis vaccines   Bexsero   decreased 5  in the United States  the same increased 15  in the Europe market  While Menveo in the United States posted higher sales  the same was offset by a weak performance of the Established Vaccines due to increasing competitive pressures on Infanrix and Pediarix in the United States and Europe It is important to note that in October 2017  the FDA granted an approval to Glaxo s shingles vaccine  Shingrix  Later in the same month  the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of three recommendations for the use of Shingrix  The vaccine is preferred over Merck s   NYSE MRK   Zostavax  Owing to this favorable recommendation  Shingrix generated initial sales of  22 million in the United States during the period under discussion 2017 ResultsFull year sales gained 3  year over year to  39 3 billion   30 2 billion   However  the metric marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  39 5 billion The 2017 earnings of  2 9 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The full year bottom line reflects 4  growth compared with the year ago figure  Moreover  reported earnings matched the previously announced guidance for 2017 2018 OutlookThe company stated that EPS growth for 2018 is uncertain due to the timing of the entry of Advair generics in the market  Hence  it issued two sets of guidance for 2018 The company expects 4 7  EPS growth at CER in 2018  if no Advair generics are launched further this year  However  in the probable event of introducing Advair generics in the U S  market by mid 2018  Glaxo anticipates adjusted EPS to be flat to down 3  year over year at CER Three companies Mylan   NASDAQ MYL    Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Novartis which are trying to bring a generic version of Advair in the market received a complete response letter  CRL  from the FDA  While  Mylan and Hikma received CRL last year  Novartis received the same this week delaying the entry of generics in the U S  market Long term GuidanceThe company projects its EPS to witness a CAGR in the mid to high single digit range through 2020 While the Vaccine segment is estimated to register a mid to high single digit growth through 2020 despite competition for pediatric and flu vaccines  the Consumer Healthcare segment is expected to deliver low

Over the past year  MYL may have been forming a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern with a test of the neckline and falling resistance taking place at  1   If a breakout happens here  it could attract buyers to this hard hit stock 
Another thing that catches our attention is the large  unfilled gap that took place back in 2015 at the  65 zone  Quite often  gaps end up getting filled  If this gap does fill  MYL will make some nice gains from current levels

197141,418657,MYL,Momenta Reports Positive Top Line Data On Antibody M281,opinion,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   reported positive top line data on pipeline candidate  M281 from a phase I single ascending dose  SAD  and multiple ascending dose  MAD  study of normal human volunteers 
The phase I randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study evaluated the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281 
M281 is a fully human anti neonatal Fc receptor  FcRn  aglycosylated immunoglobulin G  IgG1  monoclonal antibody  engineered to reduce circulating pathogenic IgG antibodies  in excess of that achieved by any current treatments  by completely blocking endogenous IgG recycling via FcRn 
The candidate did not exhibit any adverse event  was well tolerated  and decreased circulating IgG levels up to 89  with a mean reduction of 84  over the 98 day MAD study  In addition  the SAD portion of the study enrolled five cohorts with a total of 34 healthy adult volunteers and showed that a single dose of M281 achieved up to an 80  reduction of circulating IgG antibodies 
We remind investors that Momenta plans to present the top line results at a future conference 
Momenta s novel therapeutics portfolio has three pipeline candidates   M281  M254  and M230 
Meanwhile  the company is also trying hard to bring biosimilars to the market  Last week  Momenta and partner Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   announced that the companies will initiate a patient clinical trial of M710   a proposed biosimilar of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ REGN   Eylea   in the first half of 2018  The commercial opportunity is significant  The company has collaborated with Mylan to develop  manufacture and commercialize six of its current biosimilar candidates 
Momenta and Mylan have entered into an agreement to develop  manufacture and commercialize six of Momenta s biosimilar candidates  including M834  a proposed biosimilar of Orencia 
Concurrent with the third quarter earnings  Momenta announced that M834 did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics  safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers 

 
Momenta s stock have increased 8  in the last twelve months as against the  loss  of 0 2  
Momenta has had a rough ride  of late  The company suffered a setback when Mylan won the FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   Copaxone 40 mg  Notably  this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved 
Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection  40 mg mL  containing a Paragraph IV certification  the company and other first filers might be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity  On the other hand  Momenta s ANDA approval is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA  resulting in a delay of approval

197143,418659,MYL,Exclusive  EpiPen price hikes add millions to Pentagon costs,news,By Caroline Humer and Ruthy Munoz NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV s price hikes on EpiPens have added millions to U S  Department of Defense spending since 2008 as the agency covered more prescriptions for the lifesaving allergy shot at near retail prices  government data provided to Reuters shows  Pentagon spending rose to  57 million over the past year from  9 million in 2008   an increase driven both by volume and by price hikes that had a bigger bite on prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies  according to the previously unreported data  The Pentagon gets a government discount on EpiPens dispensed at military treatment facilities and by mail order  But nearly half of its spending was at retail pharmacies where it most recently paid an average of  509 for EpiPen and  528 for EpiPen Jr two packs   three times higher than its discounted rate  the data shows  That may change  Both the Pentagon and Mylan told Reuters that discussions are underway that could extend the military discount to EpiPens filled at retail pharmacies through the use of rebates  Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment on the specific Department of Defense spending  She said in an emailed statement that talks were underway to address  any questions or concerns from the agency   She declined to say if any repayment was on the table  A Reuters analysis of the data estimated a difference of about  54 million between what the agency paid for EpiPens at retail pharmacies from 2009 through 2016 and what it would have paid at military clinics  Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch has drawn public scrutiny for raising the U S  list price on a pack of two injectors nearly six fold to  600 since 2008  Affordability has become a bigger issue with the increased diagnosis and awareness of food allergies  Families who rely on EpiPens to safeguard their children against possibly fatal allergic reactions often purchase several to carry with them  keep at school and with caregivers  In response to the criticism  Mylan is providing more families with coupons to pay for EpiPens and plans to market a half price version  The drugmaker also agreed to pay  465 million to settle questions over whether the Medicaid program for the poor overpaid because EpiPens were classified as a generic treatment  a category that allows manufacturers to give smaller rebates to government agencies  While Medicaid providers don t take issue with the increased use of EpiPens  they have bristled over the price hikes   The rate of increases in their cost is not justifiable   said Dr  J  Mario Molina  chief executive of Molina Healthcare  which runs Medicaid plans in California and 11 other states  THE FULL PICTURE The impact of Mylan s price hikes on government health programs  such as Medicaid  has been obscured by highly complex pharmaceutical pricing and opaque negotiations  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  as well as several large state Medicaid programs  have released partial details on their spending  saying full information on rebates is confidential under U S  law  Without such details  it is impossible to discern what price an agency is paying for EpiPen  At Reuters  request  the Defense Department provided the most comprehensive picture of EpiPen spending by a government agency  including fiscal year expenditures since 2008  average price per pack and the number of prescriptions filled by type of dispensing location for all EpiPens obtained by military service members  their families and retirees  The department s spending on EpiPens has increased fivefold since 2008  far outpacing the 130 percent growth in prescriptions  the data shows  Defense spending on the injectors at retail pharmacies   which accounted for 53 500 of 226 000 EpiPen prescriptions for the last fiscal year that ended Sept  30   has grown more than tenfold  to  28 million from  2 4 million in 2008  While EpiPen spending represents a fraction of a percent of the Defense Department s  49 billion annual healthcare budget  the data illustrates the premium it was paying for EpiPens at retail outlets   Lawmakers would not be terribly happy to hear that DoD is paying more at retail   said Brian Bruen  a drug economics researcher at George Washington University s Milken Institute School of Public Health   DISCOUNT BY DEFINITION The Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs  typically pay among the lowest drug prices in the country because of discounts mandated by law  as well as rebates negotiated with drugmakers  Bruen said  Indeed  the Pentagon has paid  173 for an EpiPen two pack filled through mail order and  169 at military facilities in fiscal year 2016  A key factor for government discounts is whether a drug is patent protected and has market exclusivity  or it is a generic  made cheaper by competition  The EpiPen  which packages a generic allergy antidote in a patented  easy to use injector  is somewhat of a hybrid   For the Defense Department  pharmaceutical companies pay rebates on brand name drugs dispensed by retail pharmacies  reducing the final cost to the agency s discounted rate  EpiPen s classification as a generic drug prevents it from receiving mandated rebates  Mylan provided documentation it said showed the military had accepted the generic classification for EpiPen in 2008  Under Mylan s settlement with the federal government  Medicaid will classify EpiPen as a branded drug  Devlin said  That will qualify Medicaid for a 23 percent rebate  up from the 13 percent it gets on generics  Any price hikes will be capped at the inflation rate  a protection not afforded generic drug purchases   It was always our intention that the reclassification would benefit all government agencies impacted by the classification  including the VA and Tricare  Defense  programs

197146,418662,MYL,West Virginia urges Justice Dept to reject settlement with Mylan,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday blasted Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV s announced  465 million settlement with the U S  Justice Department over the drugmaker s classification of its lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen as a generic  saying the amount was  woefully deficient   The department has not acknowledged such a deal almost a month after Mylan announced it  and department spokeswoman Nicole Navas declined to comment on Wednesday  A spokesperson for Mylan did not respond to requests for comment  In a Nov  2 letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch  Morrisey said there were no reports that such a deal had been finalized  But he urged the department to reject the  465 million figure because it  does not nearly pay for the damage done by Mylan   Mylan has come under fire for hiking the price of EpiPen to more than  600 for a package of two in less than a decade  Mylan s Oct  7 announcement about the settlement came just months after congressional scrutiny into the issue began  For years  the company had classified EpiPen as a generic drug instead of a branded one  resulting in smaller rebates to state and federal Medicaid programs  Morrisey said Mylan should not be allowed to receive a  windfall after flagrantly defrauding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program   The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum 23 1 percent for a branded drug  Morrisey in August started conducting an investigation into the rebates and antitrust concerns as to whether Mylan took steps to block market competition  The probe became public in September after Morrisey filed an action against Mylan for allegedly refusing to comply with a subpoena  Curtis Johnson  a spokesman for his office  confirmed the investigation was still ongoing  The New York Attorney General is also investigating whether Mylan broke antitrust laws in writing contracts to provide EpiPens to school systems  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Acting Administrator Andrew Slavitt revealed in an Oct  5 letter to lawmakers that the centers had on  multiple occasions  provided guidance to the industry and Mylan about the proper classification of drugs  Until Oct  7  the company had not told shareholders about the possible misclassification of the EpiPen or the pending settlement with the Justice Department  That day  Mylan also revealed that the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an investigation and was seeking copies of its communications with the centers and documents related to the Medicaid rebate program  Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley  an Iowa Republican  plans to hold a hearing on Nov  30 to scrutinize the terms of the purported settlement  One topic that could also come up at the hearing is the question of how EpiPen price spikes have affected the U S  military s spending  Last week  Reuters reported that nearly half of the Pentagon s spending on EpiPens was at retail pharmacies  which do not give the same government discounts as medical treatment centers  As a result  Pentagon spending on EpiPens rose to  57 million over the past year  from  9 million in 2008  Grassley  as well as Senate Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal  have responded by sending letters to the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs seeking further details to determine whether they might be owed rebates  
On Tuesday  17 U S  Senate Democrats sent a letter to Mylan asking a variety of questions and demanding copies of all of the guidance that Mylan received from the centers about the classification since 2007  when Mylan acquired the company that owned the EpiPen ",2016-11-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/west-virginia-urges-justice-department-to-reject-settlement-with-mylan-436934,436934

197154,418670,MYL,3 Drug Biotech Stocks In Focus On World AIDS Day,opinion,"Every year  World Aids Day is celebrated on Dec 1 to raise public awareness about Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome  popularly known as AIDS  The day is observed to make people aware about proper cure and prevention of the disease  In this regard  this year  the theme for the day this year is  Right to Health   This day also commemorates those who have died from an AIDS related illness 
World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization  WHO   According to WHO  globally  about 36 7 million people were suffering from HIV AIDS at the end of 2016  Of the total  2 1 million were children less than 15 years old 
AIDS is a pandemic disease caused due to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus  HIV   The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections  eventually leading to AIDS  Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy  ART  that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus 
Currently  companies are investigating new medicines to treat  prevent and ultimately cure HIV  Scientists also are exploring new treatment paradigms like two drug regimens  making therapies drugs drugs with improved long term safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions 
Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV AIDS  this disease still has limited treatment options  In 2016  1 million people died of AIDS related illnesses  totaling to 35 0 million since the start of the epidemic 
Based on these statistics  it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS 
Stocks to Watch For 
On World AIDS Day  here are some of the key pharma companies in the HIV market that investors can rely on 
GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   has a long standing commitment to HIV and AIDS  The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago  which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV  The sales of older HIV products   Epzicom and Selzentry   have been declining  However  the newer HIV drugs  Triumeq and Tivicay   are witnessing a consistent increase in sales and gaining market share 
Meanwhile  a significant portion of its R D expenditures are being used toward developing HIV medicines to treat prevent HIV 
Last week  Glaxo and partner Johnson   Johnson announced the FDA approval for Juluca   a combination of Glaxo s Edurant dolutegravir and J J s Tivicay rilpivirine into a single tablet   for the treatment of HIV  Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs  Juluca is the first two drug regimen to be approved that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three drug regimen 
This week ViiV Healthcare  an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer   NYSE PFE    announced the start of a large late stage African study that will evaluate long acting cabotegravirinjection for the prevention of HIV in sexually active women  If approved  cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months as opposed to presently available oral anti retroviral medication  which needs to be taken every day 
Already  ViiV Healthcare has started conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravirin HIV uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men  under co funding with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  NIAID   Meanwhile  cabotegraviris also being evaluated in three late stage studies as atwo drug regimen withEdurant  with the third study initiation announced earlier this week 
Furthermore  Glaxo is developing two drug regimen ofdolutegravir   lamivudine 
Gilead   NASDAQ GILD   is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio  In fact  Gilead s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya  Truvada  Atripla  Stribild  Descovy  Odefsey and Complera 
The company was the first to introduce a single tablet regimen  STR  for the treatment of HIV   Atripla  Gilead s other STRs for HIV include Complera Eviplera and Stribild  Its TAF based product  Genvoya  happens to be a bestseller surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth quarter 2016 
Currently  Gilead s bictegravir single table regimen  STR  for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States  The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February 2018 
The STR is a fixed dose combination of bictegravir  an INSTI  and emtricitabine tenofovir alafenamide  FTC TAF   a dual NRTI backbone  This combination is also under review in the EU 
Another company working towards developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson   NYSE JNJ    The company along with partner Glaxo recently received FDA approval for first two drug regimen  Juluca  as discussed above  Further  the company along with The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV 1 preventive vaccine 
The study will evaluate whether the vaccine is safe and is able to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women in sub Saharan Africa   HIV has a significant unmet need and women and girls account for about 60  of people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa 
Others
Some other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV    Kaletra and Merck s   NYSE MRK   Isentress 
Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   also recently received a tentative FDA approval for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz  lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
Meanwhile  Merck is developing an investigational non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  doravirine both as a single entity tablet and in combination  fixed dose tablet  with other antiretroviral agents   lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  TDF   The company plans to file regulatory applications for the same before the end of 2017 
Conclusion
AIDS HIV is a life threatening disease which has limited medical cure  However  there are numerous companies that are developing drugs for the treatment and care for people suffering from HIV and for them who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV  thereby making the space competitive

197155,418671,MYL,Mylan Announces IPR Proceedings For Sanofi s Lantus Patents ,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   announced that the U S  Patent and Trademark Appeal Board   PTAB   has instituted inter partes review   IPR   proceedings on all claims against two Orange Book listed patents   U S  Patent Nos  7 476 652 and 7 713 930  respectively 
The two patents are owned by Sanofi   NYSE SNY   for Lantus  insulin glargine injection  100 Units mL 
We remind investors that Mylan s 505 b  2  new drug application   NDA   for Insulin Glargine in vial and pen dosage forms is under active review with the FDA 
In October  Sanofi initiated a patent infringement litigation against Mylan s NDA in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violation of 18 patents in the suit inclusive of these two Lantus patents 
Lantus and Lantus Solostar are both approved for improving glycemic control in adult patients with diabetes mellitus 
Sanofi s diabetes franchise seems highly weighed on with its key product Lantus facing a tremendous competitive pressure at the payor level as well as from other biosimilars in several European markets besides Japan  Moreover  a biosimilar version of Lantus had hit the markets last December 

 
Meanwhile  shares of Mylan have rallied 4 9  so far this year  outperforming the  s 26 7  decline during the period 
Mylan is a leading generic drug company in terms of both total and new prescriptions  The company s pursuit of first to file opportunities should help it maintain a strong position in the global generics market 
Mylan is also exploring the world of biosimilars  a market with potential to grow to  20 billion by 2020  A partnership with Biocon and collaborations with Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   and Mabion have aided the company to develop a portfolio of 16 biosimilar insulin analog generic products 
However  Mylan s performance in 2017 continues to be affected by the ongoing challenges in North America  The third quarter witnessed a fast decline in EpiPen sales  thanks to the launch of an authorized generic as well as the contraction of overall epinephrine auto injector market 
In a major boost  Mylan also received an FDA approval for the generic version of Copaxone 40mg  As one of the first filers  the company will enjoy 180 days of exclusivity  The recent FDA approval for Mylan s biosimilar version of Roche Holdings    OTC RHHBY   Herceptin will also boost the company s biosimilar portfolio

197158,418674,MYL,Parent bloggers question role in Mylan s EpiPen schools push,news,"By Dave McKinney CHICAGO  Reuters    When Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV recruited food allergy bloggers to learn about its campaign to get allergic shock antidotes into schools  many were eager to join the maker of the EpiPens they carry in purses and stash in book bags to protect their children against potentially lethal attacks  The bloggers  more than a dozen mothers of children with serious allergies  embraced the effort Mylan outlined in a series of  summits  it held for them beginning in 2013  They wrote impassioned posts on blogs shared with tens of thousands of followers on social media  Their personal testimony helped persuade a number of state lawmakers to pass bills to get schools to stock epinephrine injectors  such as the EpiPen  according to legislators and others familiar with the lobbying effort  During the same period  the company was marking up its EpiPen to more than  600 per twin pack  six times the 2007 price  creating a burden for many of the bloggers  followers  other parents of children whose lives are threatened by bee stings and peanuts  At least four of the bloggers told Reuters they believe Mylan took advantage of their goodwill  Some have joined public criticism of those price hikes   I personally believe that Mylan held the summits to gain blogger trust and then used those bloggers to spread word about their initiatives  They raised prices while those initiatives gained traction   Ruth LovettSmith  a former food allergy blogger from Massachusetts who attended three summits  said in an email  Mylan spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan declined to comment on the criticism  But in an email  she said the company regretted that it had not anticipated  the potential financial issues for the growing minority of patients  whose EpiPens are not covered by insurance or a patient assistance program  Mylan now offers coupons to more families to cover out of pocket costs and said it would soon release a half price EpiPen  Kashtan also said the blogger summits served a worthy purpose   Mylan aimed to provide access to information  resources and expertise about anaphylaxis and life threatening allergies   said Kashtan  who represented the company at four summits   We are proud to have brought together such a passionate and dedicated group of advocates   Chief executive Heather Bresch was blasted Wednesday at a hearing before U S  lawmakers who  along with prosecutors in several states  are investigating the price hikes  EpiPen sales exceed  1 billion a year and command more than 90 percent of the market  STEAKS AND BLOG POLISHING The effort to get epinephrine injectors into schools is a point of pride for Mylan  which has credited its alliances with advocates for its success   We have collaborated with government officials  leading advocacy organizations  parents  caregivers and healthcare professionals to successfully champion legislation and policies   Mylan said in a 2015 report on its social responsibility efforts  LovettSmith  whose son has nut allergies  went to her first Mylan blogger summit in January 2013 at a boutique midtown Manhattan hotel overlooking the Empire State Building  It was the first of at least four summits  each involving about 15 bloggers  some of whom attended more than one event  They wrote about being treated to three course dinners featuring pan seared yellow fin tuna or marinated grilled hanger steak  At a 2014 summit at the company s Canonsburg  Pa   headquarters  Mylan brought an outside communications consultant to help the women polish their blogs  advocate to policymakers  practice on camera television interviews and speak at public events  participants told Reuters  Homa Woodrum  a lawyer in Las Vegas whose 8 year old daughter relies on EpiPens for nut and oat allergies  attended that summit  But she skipped an invitation to a May 2015 event at California s Disneyland  uncomfortable with the shift in venue to a resort   It starts to seem a little like you re being buttered up   Woodrum said  Bloggers who attended summits testified on behalf of schools  bills in Nevada  Maine and Michigan  according to interviews and legislative records  In all  48 states adopted laws requiring or enabling schools to stock epinephrine injectors  In many cases  Mylan subsequently donated EpiPens to schools  Stanley Short  a Democratic representative who co sponsored the Maine bill  credited a blogger with alerting him to the issue  The woman  who attended the Disneyland summit  brought her son to a legislative hearing  where he demonstrated how he would press an EpiPen into his thigh to stop an allergic reaction  Mylan s lobbyist attended the hearing  but the boy s show and tell  sealed the deal   Short said   With me and most of the legislators  it s that first hand experience of a mother talking about her child and a child talking about what they go through personally that did it   MIXED REACTIONS Bloggers who went to Disneyland told Reuters pricing was not on the drugmaker s agenda  By then  some were aware of the hikes and brought them up  Mylan talked about the role of other parties  including insurers  in determining what consumers pay  they said  Blogger Kelly Rudnicki s food allergy advocacy led to work as a paid Mylan spokeswoman  But  she said in an email  she quit last month because of the pricing controversy  She said she believes Mylan should apologize and cut its prices on EpiPens  and Bresch should step down  Rudnicki  whose 14 year old son has severe food allergies  said the bloggers supported Mylan because they believed it  had our back and manufactured a device that we couldn t live without   Mylan declined to discuss Rudnicki s criticism  The company confirmed she resigned  adding it had thanked her for her work  Some bloggers like Caroline Moassessi  a food allergy activist from Reno  Nev   take a more nuanced view  She attended three summits and testified in Nevada to allow schools and other public venues to stock epinephrine  She also has felt the full effect of price hikes  As a small business owner  she paid  3 000 in 2015 for EpiPens for her son and daughter  Each child carries two pens at all times and keeps two more at school  Moassessi also carries two injectors  While Moassessi would rather pay less  she said she recognizes that Mylan is in business to make a profit

Significantly  the company initiated a phase IIIb study  evaluating revefenacin on patients with low peak inspiratory flow rate in March 2017  Data from the study is expected in early 2018 
Per the company s press release  COPD is the third leading cause for death in the United States  The grim picture suggests that while 12 7 million Americans are diagnosed with the disease  almost an equal number of patients remain undiagnosed  An approval will be a huge boost as patients who prefer nebulized therapy  have no access to a nebulized LAMA  Hence  there is a large commercial countrywide opportunity for revefenacin in the COPD area Theravance Biopharma  Inc  Price

197182,418698,MYL,Momenta s  MNTA  Biosimilar Study Fails  Q3 Loss Narrows ,opinion,"Shares of Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   were down 12 6  after the company reported disappointing results from a phase I study on M834  which it was conducting with partner Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   for the proposed biosimilar of Orencia 
The company also reported a loss of 44 cents per share in the third quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents  The reported loss was  however  wider than the year ago loss of 26 cents Mylan N V  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Revenues in the quarter came in at  24 1 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of  23 2 million  However  revenues were down 17 3  from the year ago quarter  
Momenta s stock has decreased 15 1  year to date compared with the  rally of 4 1  

 
Quarter in Detail
Momenta s top line comprises product revenues of  10 9 million earned from Sandoz s sales of Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone  20 mg   compared with  23 4 million in the year ago quarter  The 53  decrease was primarily due to higher sales deductions  inventory price adjustments owing to Mylan s entry into the Copaxone market along with a deduction of  0 2 million for reimbursing the company s share of Glatopa related legal expenses to Sandoz 
Collaborative research and development revenues came in at  13 2 million  up from  5 8 million in the year ago quarter  The increase was due to a  10 million commercial milestone payment earned in connection with Glatopa 20mg mL  However  the upside in sales was partially offset by less revenues due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement  effective Dec 31  2016 
While  research and development expenses were up to  37 9 million from  31 6 million  general and administrative expenses increased 31  to  20 7 million 
Outlook Updated
Momenta now expects operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and net of collaborative revenues  in the range of  200  210 million  compared with the previous guidance of  210  230 million in 2017  The guidance also includes approximately  50 million of capital expenditure on M923  Operating expenses in third quarter 2017 are projected around  43  53 million 
Momenta expect to generate revenues of  45 million from Mylan as upfront payment on a quarterly basis 
Pipeline Update
Sandoz s abbreviated New Drug Application  ANDA  for the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone  Glatopa 40mg  was under the FDA review  However  Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   in February 2017  which is Sandoz s contracted fill finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa 
Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter  The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer 
Meanwhile  Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates  Currently  Momenta s M923  a biosimilar version of AbbVie  Inc   Humira  is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  Moving ahead  the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies 
However  Momenta announced that M834 did not meet its primary pharmacokinetic end points in a phase I study to compare the pharmacokinetics  safety and immunogenicity of M834 to Orencia in normal healthy volunteers  Hence  Momenta and partner Mylan will evaluate the next course of action 
Furthermore  Momenta s novel autoimmune portfolio includes  M230  a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors  SIF3  and M281  an anti FcRn monoclonal antibody  Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281  The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in January 2017 and completed in August 2017  Top line data is expected in fourth quarter 2017 
Our Take
Momenta s third quarter results were overshadowed by the disappointing results from a phase I study on the proposed biosimilar verison of Orencia  
Momenta has already suffered a blow  We note that Mylan has already won FDA approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   Copaxone 40 mg  Notably  this is the first generic of Copaxone that has been approved 
Since Mylan was one of the first applicants to submit a substantially complete ANDA for glatiramer acetate Injection  40 mg mL  containing a Paragraph IV certification  the company and other first filers may be eligible for 180 days of generic drug exclusivity  On the other hand  Momenta s ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA  resulting in a delay of approval

Momenta currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

197191,418707,MYL,Clinton offers plan to curb  unjustified  price hikes on life saving drugs,news,"By Amanda Becker and Ransdell Pierson WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Hillary Clinton said on Friday that if elected to the White House she would create an oversight panel to protect U S  consumers from large price hikes on long available  lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary  adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices  Clinton  the Democratic presidential candidate  would seek to give the panel an  aggressive new set of enforcement tools   including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an  unjustified  outlier price increase  on a long available or generic drug  her campaign said   Over the past year  we ve seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long standing  life saving treatments with little or no new innovation or R D   Clinton said in a statement  If Clinton defeats Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov  8 election  she would need the support of the U S  Congress to implement key measures of her proposal  which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago  Even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies  it could be difficult to get Republican lawmakers on board  Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said  adding that a  Republican Congress would push back hard on this   Clinton s campaign cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC s raising the price of its AIDS drug Daraprim  pyrimethamine  and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV s repeated steep price increases on EpiPen for severe allergy sufferers as  troubling  examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny  Conover said Clinton s plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall  Drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies  The ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U S  and European drugmakers rose 0 30 percent on Friday  in line with gains for the broad stock market  Shares of Mylan fell 4 6 percent to  40 00 on the Nasdaq  The Nasdaq biotech index slipped 0 40 percent  The decline was slight compared to the more than 4 7 percent drop in the index seen on Sept  21  2015  when Clinton blasted  price gouging  in the specialty drug market on Twitter  responding to reports that Turing had acquired Daraprim  an older antibiotic  and then hiked its price by 5 000 percent   Soon afterward  Clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs  including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs   Her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out of pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions  It aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products  and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising  A  BOLD IDEA  Dr  Peter Bach  the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at New York s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  said Clinton s announcement on Friday was a  flag  for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes   It s a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition   Bach said  saying the campaign was focusing on a  sub category  of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug  Bach said he was contacted by the Clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity  The oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase  the manufacturer s production cost and the treatment s relative value to patients and public health  Clinton s campaign said  Terry Haines  head of political analysis for Evercore ISI  said Clinton s proposed panel had little hope of getting through Congress   But Clinton  if elected  might be able to achieve price reform via changes to Medicare s prescription drug benefit  known as Medicare Part D  if she works with Congress to reform the Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare  Haines said  In that event  Haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come  under sustained headline risk in 2017 as ACA reforms are discussed    In cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition  Clinton s administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the United States  Dr  Aaron Kesselheim  an associate professor at Harvard Medical School  called it a  bold idea  to get the federal government  involved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets   Until recently  there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  Although the wait time has shortened  there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the U S  market  Kesselheim said   Having the government get involved as a long term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market   he said  
Kesselheim has testified before Congress about high cost generic and long available drugs and spoke to Clinton s campaign about his research as it developed its proposals ",2016-09-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/clinton-offers-plan-to-curb-'unjustified'-price-hikes-on-life-saving-drugs-423918,423918

197203,418719,MYL,U S  lawmakers press Mylan on EpiPen price increases,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two senior lawmakers on the U S  Senate s Judiciary Committee on Monday pushed for information regarding sharp price increases for EpiPens  drug filled injectable devices used by people to counter potentially deadly allergic reactions 
Senator Chuck Grassley  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  wrote Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  Chief Executive Heather Bresch on Monday to ask how Mylan determined the price of EpiPens and what changes had been made to the product to account for the higher price 
The top Democrat on the committee s antitrust subcommittee  Senator Amy Klobuchar  urged the Federal Trade Commission on Monday to investigate the prices  citing news reports showing that the price of a pack of two EpiPens had gone from  100 in 2008 to  500 this year  Mylan acquired the product in 2007 
 Although the antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging  regardless of how unseemly it may be  they do prohibit the use of unreasonable restraints of trade to facilitate or protect a price increase   wrote Klobuchar  a Minnesota Democrat who said her daughter relies on an EpiPen 
 The FTC should investigate whether Mylan Pharmaceuticals engaged in activity  such as using incentives or exclusionary contracts with insurers  distributors  or pharmacies  to deny an alternative product access to the market  
An EpiPen injects a pre measured dose of epinephrine  adrenaline  that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction 
The FTC did not say whether an investigation was under way   The commission takes seriously its obligation to take action where pharmaceutical companies have violated the antitrust laws   a spokesman said 
Mylan did not immediately comment on the letters but noted in an email that nearly 80 percent of people with commercial insurance who use a savings card can get the medicine for free 
 With changes in the healthcare insurance landscape  an increasing number of people and families are enrolled in high deductible health plans  and deductible amounts continue to rise  This shift has presented new challenges for consumers  and they are bearing more of the cost   Mylan also said 
The FTC opened a probe into Turing Pharmaceuticals for possible antitrust violations in connection with the company s decision to sharply raise the price of a life saving drug  Turing had raised the price of Daraprim to  750 a tablet from  13 50 ",2016-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-lawmakers-press-mylan-on-epipen-price-increases-421722,421722

In the following table  August September performance by DJIA  S P 500 and NASDAQ has been ranked from strongest to weakest with subsequent fourth performance  In years when August and September combined for a net loss  fourth quarter average performance more than doubled for DJIA and S P 500 while the frequency of fourth quarter gains also improved  Of the 14 down August September periods suffered by S P 500  just one subsequent fourth quarter was also down  2008

197220,418736,MYL,Why Did Mylan  MYL  Stock Surge Today ,opinion,"Shares of much maligned drugmaker Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   climbed on Thursday after the U S  Justice Department announced that it officially reached a settlement with the company regarding its EpiPen lawsuit 
The U S  Justice Department  that Mylan will have to pay  465 million in settlement fees to Medicaid programs in all 50 states to end the nearly year long lawsuit that accused the pharmaceutical company of knowingly misclassifying its EpiPen product as a generic in order to avoid Medicaid rebate payments 
According to the lawsuit  Mylan knowingly bypassed the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  which was put in place to prevent drug makers from price gouging brand name  single source drugs  The law forces pharmaceutical companies that have complete control over a drug to pay much higher rebate prices  Generic drugs that come from more than one manufacturer pay much lower rebate fees 
The lawsuit states that Mylan simply classified its EpiPen product  which injects epinephrine to help treat emergency allergic reactions  as a generic when there weren t FDA approved drugs equivalent to EpiPen 
The real kicker is that the lawsuit contended that Mylan upped the price of its EpiPen product by roughly 400  from 2010 to 2016  charging as much as  600 for the treatment 
Mylan previously confirmed that the company had reached a settlement with the Justice Department nearly 10 months ago  but the U S  Attorney s Office in Massachusetts did not make it official until Thursday 
 Mylan misclassified its brand name drug  EpiPen  to profit at the expense of the Medicaid program   U S  Attorney William D  Weinreb said in a statement   We will continue to root out fraud and abuse to protect the integrity of Medicaid and ensure a level playing field for pharmaceutical companies  
The pharmaceutical company was also forced into a five year corporate integrity agreement that will see Mylan under much heavier scrutiny  However  the EpiPen maker did not confess any wrongdoing as part of the settlement 
 As we said when we announced the settlement last year  bringing closure to this matter is the right course of action for Mylan and our stakeholders to allow us to move forward   Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said in a statement   Over the course of the last year  we have taken significant steps to enhance access to epinephrine auto injectors  including bringing a solution to the fast changing healthcare landscape in the U S  by launching an authorized generic version at less than half the wholesale acquisition cost of the brand and meaningfully expanding our patient access programs  
Members of both parties of Congress have said that the  465 million  and lenient 
Shares of Mylan rose as much as 2  on Thursday morning but the stock still sits only slightly above its 52 week low at  30 95 a share  Mylan is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   but it seems that at least some investors and the company are relieved to have this lawsuit officially behind them

197221,418737,MYL,Mylan Finalizes Settlement Agreement With DOJ For  465M,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   recently announced that its subsidiaries  Mylan Inc  and Mylan Specialty L P   have signed an agreement with the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  and two other relators  The agreement finalizes the Medicaid drug rebate settlement worth  465 million  announced in Oct 2017   
The settlement resolves claims which relates to the classification of EpiPen Auto Injector and EpiPen Jr Auto Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program 
DOJ wanted to ascertain whether EpiPen products were properly classified with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a non innovator drug under the applicable definition in the Medicaid Rebate statute  The drugs were subjected to the formula which is used to calculate rebates to Medicaid for such drugs 
We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since Aug 2016 when the company came under the spotlight for price increase of EpiPen since its acquisition of the drug in 2007  drawing immense criticism from lawmakers  consumers and the common people alike  Further  Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  The misclassification implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one 
EpiPen Auto Injector was classified as a non innovator drug with CMS before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on longstanding written guidance from the federal government 
Nevertheless  the settlement provides for resolution of all potential Medicaid rebate liability claims by the federal government  as well as potential claims by certain hospitals and other covered entities that participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program  Moreover  Mylan will reclassify EpiPen Auto Injector for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and pay the rebate applicable to innovator products  effective Apr 1 

Mylan s stock has fallen 16 7  year to date compared with the  decline of 14 9  
Mylan s second quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America  The cut in annual guidance was also disappointing  Ongoing challenges in the U S  and uncertain regulatory environment in the region has led the company to defer all major launches in the U S  from the 2017 guidance to 2018 including generic version of GlaxoSmithKline Inc    NYSE GSK   asthma drug Advair Diskusand generic Copaxone 
Meanwhile  Mylan s Biologics License Application for proposed biosimilar version of Roche Holdings   OTC RHHBY   Herceptin is currently under review by FDA  The anticipated FDA goal date set under the Biosimilar User Fee Act is Sep3  We expect investor focus on the same

Mylan  a global pharmaceutical company has a well established generics business and is known for specialty pharmaceuticals products 
We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure since August 2016 when the company faced severe criticism from lawmakers  consumers and the common people alike for price increase of EpiPen since its acquisition of the drug in 2007  Further  Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  The misclassification implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one 
The company recently signed an agreement with the U S  Department of Justice and two other relators which finalizes the Medicaid drug rebate settlement worth  465 million  announced in Oct 2016 
Sales from EpiPen continue to decline due to increased competition and the impact of the launch of the authorized generic  Adamis Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ ADMP   recently received FDA nod for Symjepi  a generic version of EpiPen  EpiPen will represent less than 5  of global revenues and less than 10  of sales in North America in 2017 
The company s efforts to get the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug Advair Diskus suffered a blow when the FDA issued a complete response letter to its ANDA for the generic version  Although the company did not mention the contents of the CRL such setbacks are likely to weigh on shares 
Moreover  the FDA recently accepted Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   Sandoz s ANDA for Advair  A potential approval will give Sandoz the edge over Mylan  Moreover  the company believes that approval delays will persist in 2017 thereby impacting business further  The company believes that increased competition resulting from FDA s focus on accelerating the approvals of third  fourth or fifth generics will impact sales 
Meanwhile  Mylan s second quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America  The cut in annual guidance was also disappointing  Mylan now expects revenues of  11 5  12 5 billion in 2017  down from the earlier projection of  12 25  13 75 billion 
The company now projects earnings per share in the range of  4 30  4 70  down from the previous projected range of  5 15  5 55  The guidance was lowered due to expected delays in the timing of certain key new product launches 
2017 will be challenging for the company due to volatility and uncertainty in the world s largest pharmaceutical market   the U S  due to pressure from both accelerated new approvals on the company s existing generic products and continued consolidation of the customer base  Contributions from new product launches in the U S  were one of the lowest in the second quarter  The company also saw increased competition for its existing generic products  as FDA approves more generics through accelerated approvals

197224,418740,MYL,Mylan May Lose  26B Perrigo Takeover Deal  Reports,news,"By   

Generic drug maker Mylan  O MYL  NV may lose its protracted hostile takeover bid for peer Perrigo Company Plc   N PRGO  as only a minority of Perrigo s shareholders reportedly tendered their stock into Mylan s  26 billion takeover proposal by late Thursday night 
Around 40 percent of Perrigo s ordinary shares had been tendered with 10 hours left    significantly short of Mylan s acceptance threshold of 50 percent  reports said  quoting sources close to the matter 
While shares could still be tendered  many large investors would have done so by now if they wanted to accept the offer  the sources added 
If the deal does not secure the support  it would represent a major win for Perrigo chief executive Joseph Papa  who has long maintained that Mylan has resorted to  inappropriate tactics to push its inadequate offer   and on Tuesday urged investors against taking up the offer 
Perrigo  which makes over the counter medicines  reported better than expected third quarter profit last month and announced a  2 billion share buyback and job cuts meant to appease investors ahead of the Mylan vote 
Mylan  which initially made a bid for Perrigo in April  went hostile in September  with both companies trading barbs about the perceived value of the deal and shareholder interests  Mylan contends that the Perrigo board s inaction over the deal was a  reckless gamble  while Perrigo has criticized Mylan s corporate governance  which it said lacks transparency  Mylan has also drawn accusations of insider dealing earlier in the year

197231,418747,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Misses On Q2 Earnings   Sales  Lowers View ,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   reported disappointing second quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales missed estimates  The company also lowered its guidance  Shares are trading down due to dismal results 

Mylan s stock fell 16 7  year to date compared with the  decline of 14 9  
The company reported earnings of  1 10 per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 18 and was down from  1 16 reported in the year ago quarter 
Second quarter revenues of  2 96 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 00 billion  Nevertheless  the top line recorded 15 7  year over year growth on the back of acquisitions Mylan N V  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Quarter in Detail
The company report results in three segments on a geographic basis   North America  Europe and Rest of World 
North America segment third party net sales came in at  1 28 billion  down 9  due to a decline in sales of existing products as a result of lower volume and pricing which more than offset the acquisitions of Meda AB and the non sterile  topicals focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings  LLC  Sales of the EpiPen Auto Injector declined in the current quarter due to increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch  Generics products experienced price erosion in the mid single digits 
Third party net sales from Europe were  954 3 million  up 59  propelled by the acquisition of Meda which was partially offset by lower volume on existing products  Unfavorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 3  within Europe 
Rest of World segment third party net sales of  692 6 million was up 29  fueled by the Meda acquisition  Moreover  net sales from existing products increased due to higher sales from the anti retroviral franchise while sales from new products and higher volumes on existing products more than offset lower pricing  Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 2  
Adjusted gross margin declined to 54  from 56  in the year ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America  including the EpiPen Auto Injector  partially offset by the contributions from the acquired businesses 
2017 Outlook Lowered
Mylan now expects revenues of  11 5  12 5 billion in 2017  down from the earlier projection of  12 25  13 75 billion in 2017  The company now projects earnings in the range of  4 30  4 70  down from the previous projected range of  5 15  5 55  The guidance was lowered as a result of expected delays in the timing of certain key new product launches 
Ongoing challenges in the U S  and uncertain regulatory environment in the region has led the company to defer all major launches in the U S  from the 2017 guidance to 2018 including generic Advair and generic Copaxone  Pricing in generics is expected to decline in mid single digits globally  with high single digit erosion expected in North America 
Our Take
Mylan s second quarter results were dismal as the company missed on both earnings and sales estimates due to challenges in North America  Pricing continues to impact results and the company projects mid single digit price erosion globally  The decrease in guidance was also disappointing  The company recently suffered a few setbacks 
Mylan received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its abbreviated new drug application ANDA for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug Advair Diskus 
On a positive note  the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recently unanimously recommended approval of Mylan s biosimilar version of Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG s   OTC RHHBY   breast cancer drug Herceptin

Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
A better ranked stock in the health care sector is Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   which carriesa Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

197238,418754,MYL,Novartis  NVS  Biosimilar Of MabThera Approved In The EU,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   announced that its generic arm  Sandoz  has received European Commission  EC  approval for Rixathon  a biosimilar version of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   MabThera in Europe 
The biosimilar version has been approved for all the indications of the branded drug  Rixathon is approved for non Hodgkin s lymphoma  follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  as well as immunological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  granulomatosis with polyangiitis  and microscopic polyangiitis 
We note that Sandoz is a global leader in biosimilars  With the approval of Rixathon  Sandoz now has four biosimilar drugs approved in Europe along with a deep pipeline  Sandoz plans to obtain the approval for four more biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics by 2020 
Last month  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  accepted the company s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira  adalimumab  and Remicade  infliximab  for review  The generic unit had generated  10 1 billion sales in 2016 
Last week  the FDA accepted Sandoz s Abbreviated New Drug Application  ANDA  for a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug  Advair Diskus 
We remind investors that Sandoz gaining additional expertise in the development of orally inhaled medicines through its 2010 acquisition of Oriel Therapeutics  Inc  Upon approval  the generic drug will treat asthma in patients aged four years and older  as well as provide maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD  
Earlier in 2017  Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its ANDA for Advair Diskus 
Hence  we expect investors to remain focused on Sandoz s ANDA approval  A potential approval will give Sandoz the edge over Mylan and boost its portfolio 

Novartis has outperformed the Zacks classified industry in the last six months  The stock has rallied 12 6  compared with the  industry s gain of 11 4  
Going forward  we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones will bode well for Novartis  However  the company faces stiff generic competition for key drugs like Gleevec

A look at Sucampo s share price movement reveals that the company has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date  The stock is down 21 1  against the industry s gain of 6 2  

Sucampo is working on expanding Amitiza s label  Sucampo is developing the sprinkle formulation of Amitiza in adults and pediatric patients The company plans to make regulatory filings for both adult and pediatric patients in the U S  in the second half of 2017  This will further boost the revenues of the company once approved

197241,418757,MYL,GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  Beats On Q2 Earnings  Lowers Guidance,opinion,"GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   reported core earnings of 70 cents per American depositary share in the second quarter of 2017  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents by almost 3  
Earnings were however down 2  year over year at constant exchange rates  CER   driven by a negative impact of settlement of intercompany transaction during the quarter 
So far this year  Glaxo s shares have gained 5 6   comparing unfavorably with the  s increase of 10 7  

Quarterly revenues were up 3  at CER to  9 42 billion   7 3 billion  on the back of strong performances by all the business segments  However  revenue marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 52 billion 
All growth rates mentioned below are on a year on year basis and at CER 
Quarterly Highlights
Sales were up 5  in the U S  and 1  in International markets  Also  sales in Europe registered a growth rate of 2  
Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products were up 47  driven by HIV drugs  Tivicay and Triumeq  respiratory drugs  the Ellipta products and Nucala  vaccines to prevent meningitis  and drugs like Bexsero and Menveo 
Glaxo reports results under three segments  Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare The Pharmaceuticals division registered revenue growth of 3  driven by HIV drugs  Tivicay and Triumeq  and respiratory disease drugs  Relvar Breo and Nucala  This was partly offset by the impact of recent divestments on Established Pharmaceuticals 
HIV sales were up 17  on 24  growth in the U S  and 27  in International sales  Europe sales were however flat year over year  The encouraging numbers came on the back of continued market share growth for both Triumeq  sales up 44   and Tivicay  sales up 37    However  sales of another HIV drug Epzicom Kivexa tumbled 63  due to an increased generic competition  particularly affecting the European market 
Respiratory sales increased 4  on the back of 7  growth in both the U S  and 5  in the international markets  In Europe  however  respiratory sales slid 2  as the portfolio continued to transition to newer products including Relvar Breo Ellipta 
Sales of new respiratory products like Relvar Breo Ellipta  Anoro Ellipta  Arnuity Ellipta and Nucala offset the decline in Seretide Advair sales  down 14    Flixotide Flovent and Ventolin sales decreased 1  and 8  respectively 
The Ellipta products recorded a 73  surge in sales  driven by market share gains with the global roll out continuing 
Immuno inflammation drugs  which include Benlysta  rose 9  in the quarter 
The new grouping of Established Pharmaceuticals includes the previous Established Products  Cardiovascular  metabolic and urology  CVMU  and other Pharma products  Established Pharmaceuticals sales were down 7  in the quarter 
However  sales were flat in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions  Sales were hurt by the disposal of the Nigeria beverages business in 2016  challenging conditions in some emerging markets  particularly India  and a weaker allergy performance in the U S  However  the power brands  particularly in Pain relief and Oral health categories saw a strong performance in the quarter 
Sales from the Vaccines segment were up 5   Geographically  the U S  was up 12   Europe was up 10  whereas international markets were down 5   Sales benefited from a continued uptake of meningitis vaccines  Bexsero globally and Menveo in the international markets  The segment also experienced a strong performance of the Established Vaccines  driven by higher demand for Boostrix and Hepatitis vaccines  particularly 
OutlookThe company expects to face a generic competition for Advair in the U S  which will affect the top line  However  there is uncertainty regarding the timing of launch of a generic version of the drug  With no generic version of Advair expected to be launched in 2017  the company expects core 2017 earnings growth of 3 5  at CER  lower than 5 7   projected previously 
Additionally  during the second quarter  the company decided to invest in a Priority Review Voucher to accelerate the FDA s review for its two drug regimen in HIV  This investment decision along with other accelerated launch cost  related with the HIV drugs  led to the lowered profit guidance 
We remind investors that Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   efforts to bring a generic version for Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application  ANDA  for Advair in April  thereby delaying the entry of the generic  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC s generic version of Advair was also denied an approval by the FDA in May 2017  A generic version of Advair is therefore not likely to be approved of this year

197242,418758,MYL,Mylan  Guidance Concerns Grow As Drug Approvals Are Delayed,opinion,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  has drifted down by about 14  since early March as  concerns have grown over that time  Concerns have specifically centered around risk to 2017 and 2018 guidance due to approval delays in the company s new product pipeline  Additionally  the company s core business  generics and Epipens  have had new developments that have raised concerns over their outlooks as well 

2017 and 2018 guidance could move lower
The company has given 2017 guidance of  5 15    5 55  with  850 million revenue from global new product launches  Management noted that the list of drugs that will contribute to the  850 million is long  but did not break out expected contributions by drug  As a result  it s unclear how much revenue management expected from drugs that are currently still pending approval  i e  Copaxone and Advair   If the company is not able to get approval for some of these bigger drugs  the company could potentially miss its  850 million contribution from new products  which could thereby put management s  5 15    5 55 guidance in jeopardy  As a result  investors have grown more concerned that management could potentially lower their 2017 guidance when they report 2Q on August 9th  which could push consensus estimates down further  Consensus estimates for 2017 currently are already below the bottom end of management s guidance at  5 10 
Beyond 2017  the company has also given guidance for 2018 EPS of  6 00  However  with 2017 guidance in danger  one wonders if the company can achieve its 2018 target  Should 2017 EPS move down to   5  the company would need to grow EPS by 20   to achieve its  6 EPS target in 2018  which would likely require an accretive acquisition  At 3 7x net debt EBITDA  this may be difficult to do  Consensus estimates are already  0 30 below the  6 target  but could move lower if the company moves its 2018 guidance lower 

New products  Copaxone  Advair delays
With that in mind  let s zoom into what s happened with Copaxone and Advair   the two drugs that investors believed would make up a large chunk of the new product revenues  but have had issues receiving FDA approval 
Mylan received a non approval for Advair back in late March  Management gave further details on its 1Q conference call  noting that the company disagreed on several points raised by the FDA  and have submitted their response to those points  The FDA has not asked for additional clinical endpoint or device related studies  Instead  the FDA has asked the company to relate its existing study results to newly issued industry draft guidance  In terms of next steps  the company is now waiting to have a face to face meeting with the FDA to address some of the issues  but cannot give further guidance on timing until that meeting happens  As of mid June  the company has still not had that meeting  but management is hopeful that they can give a more detailed update by their 2Q call 
What does this mean for Advair and for the stock  Most investors  and management  had expected the Advair generic to be approved this year and to contribute to revenue  And given that the drug was expected to be the first generic to market for the  4 2 billion Advair branded drug  investors had big expectations for the generic  As we begin to enter the 2H of 2018 and still do not have clarity on the timing of the drug  investors are beginning to lower those expectations  Several analysts have noted that they no longer expect the drug to contribute to revenue in 2017 
What about Copaxone  The drug has a long history of delays  but investors began to see the light at the end of the tunnel when management noted on its 1Q conference call that they had an upcoming action date for both the 20mg and 40mg in June  However  in mid June  management disclosed that the company had received a request for additional information on the 20mg application  Investors are again beginning to lower expectations for the drug given that we re now in August and have not received an update on the drug 
There are a few things to consider as it relates to company s new drug guidance  First  the company has noted that there is a long list of drugs that are expected to contribute to that  850 million guidance  and the company has already received 20 drug approvals year to date  Second  management s guidance of  850 million likely includes a risk adjustment to both the Copaxone and Advair generics  and therefore it is possible that management did not expect a significant contribution from those drugs  As a result  there is a possibility that the delays for the two drugs does not hurt the company s guidance as much as investors believe  However  it s clear that the Advair  or Wixela Inhub  and Copaxone generics are key to the company s plans in the U S   as shown by the company s Investor Day slides below 

Core business  generic pricing environment  Epipen competitor
Investor concerns are also growing for Mylan s generic portfolio  Management has noted that they expect to see mid single digit price erosion among their generics  This runs counter to other generic manufacturers that have experienced pressure in recent quarters and expect double digit price erosion for the year  For example  Novartis s  NYSE NVS  generic division Sandoz reported a global pricing decline of 8  and US generics sales down 15   Much of these dire expectations are driven by consolidating retail wholesale buyer groups and the fact that as much as 1 4 to 1 3 of US generic prescriptions may be up for bidding in the remainder of 2017  Investors fear that Mylan may need to lower guidance further in the midst of a weakening generic pricing environment 
Other threats to the company s products have emerged as well  In mid June  Adamis Pharma  NASDAQ ADMP  announced FDA approval of its Symjepi product  which is expected to be a low cost competitor to the Epipen 
In regards to the generic pricing environment  Mylan would note that the company has advantages in the generic market that others do not   including greater scale and support that provides differentiation and more insulation from the broader pricing issues 
In regards to the Epipen competitor  it s important to note that the Epipen is becoming a smaller portion of its overall revenues and that investors are not as focused on the product as they were in the past  Analysts now only model  5  of MYL sales from the Epipen  and expect that to continue to shrink in the coming years 
However  these issues in totality do raise the risk that the company could see further pressure in other areas of its guidance as well 
Bull case rests on early approval  biosimilar pipeline
While there has been a steady wave of negative news in recent months  expectations may have lowered sufficiently enough to where the risk reward is potentially attractive  As noted above  many analysts are not holding out hope for a 2017 approval for either the Advair or Copaxone generic  There is still a chance that the drugs get approval this year in 2017 though  and either approval would be a surprise and send the stock higher 
Additionally  the company s biosimilar pipeline shows promise  The Trastuzumab biosimilar  in particular  recently received a unanimous recommendation from the FDA s ODAC panel for approval  With a BsUFA goal date on September 3rd  there is a high chance that the drug gets approved  With the branded Trastuzumab generating  7 billion in 2016 US sales  Mylan s biosimilar could generate a sizable amount of revenue when the patent expires in 2019  In total  Mylan has 16 biosimilars that target  88 billion in branded drug sales ",2017-08-03,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-guidance-concerns-grow-as-drug-approvals-are-delayed-200204928,200204928
197243,418759,MYL,Momenta  MNTA  Q2 Loss In Line With Estimates  Sales Beat,opinion,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   reported a loss of 50 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The reported loss was  however  wider than the year ago loss of 31 cents Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Revenues in the quarter improved 10 8  to  23 6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  22 9 million 
Momenta s stock has rallied 6 3  year to date compared with the  rally of 9 9  

 
Quarter in Detail
Momenta s top line comprises product revenues of  19 1 million earned from Sandoz s sales of Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone  20 mg   compared with  20 7 million in the year ago quarter  The decrease was primarily due to lower sales deductions in the second quarter of 2016  as well as legal reimbursement in the second quarter of 2017 
Collaborative research and development revenues came in at  4 4 million  down from  5 8 million in the year ago quarter  The decline in revenues was mainly due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement  effective Dec 31  2016 
While  research and development expenses were up to  39 1 million from  33 2 million  general and administrative expenses increased 52  to  22 6 million 
Outlook Updated
Momenta now expects operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and net of collaborative revenues  in the range of  210  230 million  compared with the previous guidance of  200  240 million in 2017  The guidance also includes approximately  55 million of capital expenditure on M923  Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 are projected around  50  60 million 
Momenta expect to generate revenues of  45 million from Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   as upfront payment on a quarterly basis  In Jul 2017  Momenta earned a  10 million milestone payment from Sandoz as Glatopa 20 mg continues to be the sole FDA approved generic of Copaxone 20 mg 
Pipeline Update
Sandoz s abbreviated New Drug Application  ANDA  for the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone  Glatopa 40mg  was under the FDA review  However  Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   in Feb 2017  which is Sandoz s contracted fill finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa 
Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter  The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer 
Meanwhile  Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates  Currently  Momenta s M923  a biosimilar version of AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   Humira  is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  Moving ahead  the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies in the fourth quarter of 2017  Also  it expects first commercial launch of M923 to be as early as the 2020 timeframe 
The company completed enrolment in the phase I study on M834  a biosimilar version of Orencia  abatacept  in Apr 2017 under its collaboration with Mylan  Top line data from the study are expected in the second half of 2017 
Furthermore  Momenta s novel autoimmune portfolio includes  M230  a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors  SIF3  and M281  an anti FcRn monoclonal antibody  In Jan 2017  the company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with CSL for M230 and potential future Fc multimer programs  The candidate is expected to enter clinic in 2017 
Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281  The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in Jan 2017  expected to be completed in Aug 2017  and data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study are projected in the second half of 2017 
Our Take
Momenta s loss per share came in line with estimates in the second quarter of 2017 while sales beat estimates  The ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA  resulting in a delay of approval  We expect the warning letter will remain a drag on the company s shares till the issue is solved 
Nevertheless  sales of Glatopa 20mg continue to do well  Glatopa 20mg has captured approximately 40  of the market in the U S  In addition  a potential approval of M923 will boost investor confidence 
Zacks Rank
Momenta currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

197244,418760,MYL,Teva Poised To Raise Stake In Mylan  Sources,news,"By   

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  ARCA TEVA  Ltd is looking to buy more shares in Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV  positioning itself for a possible legal challenge to the generics drugmaker that has spurned its takeover bid  people familiar with the matter said 
The strategy is a sign of Teva s commitment to its  40 billion   26 billion  bid for Mylan  as the latter presses on with its own  34 billion hostile bid for over the counter drug company Perrigo Company Plc 
Teva last week disclosed a 1 8 percent stake in Mylan  which blasted the move as breaching U S  antitrust laws because of the stake s size  U S antitrust laws bar companies from acquiring stakes worth more than  76 3 million in rivals without first obtaining regulatory approval  Teva s stake in Mylan far exceeds that threshold 
The dispute boils down to where Mylan  which is incorporated in the Netherlands  has its  principal  offices  Mylan argues these are located within the United States for the purposes of the U S  Federal Trade Commission  thereby affording it antitrust protection  even as it lists its principal executives offices in Britain in filings with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
Despite this issue  Teva may increase its stake in Mylan to around 4 6 percent  the people said  Such a stake would allow Teva to have standing in Dutch court to potentially challenge Mylan  which has so far refused to engage with its Israeli rival  the people added 
Teva may seek to reach this ownership threshold ahead of Mylan s record date  or the date in which a shareholder must officially own shares to be entitled to vote on the tender offer for Perrigo  they said  This would raise pressure on Mylan s management ahead of the vote  the people added 
A tender offer for Mylan is likely to come after Teva raises its stake  the people said 
The sources asked not to be identified because Teva s deliberations are not public  Representatives for Teva and Mylan declined to comment 
Mylan  which makes the EpiPen product for severe allergies  can take advantage of Dutch provisions that would make a hostile takeover difficult because of its incorporation in the Netherlands 
Hedge fund Paulson   Co LP in April raised its stake in Mylan to around 4 6 percent  including derivatives  to put pressure on Mylan management to pursue a tie up with Teva  The hedge fund has been privately encouraging Mylan s board to consider Teva s takeover proposal  people previously told Reuters ",2015-06-03,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/teva-poised-to-raise-stake-in-mylan:-sources-344770,344770

 While we are disappointed that Mylan has formally rejected our proposal  the Teva board and management team are fully committed to completing the combination of Teva and Mylan   Teva CEO Erez Vigodman said in a statement ",2015-04-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mylan-says-teva-offer-too-low-and-stock-'unacceptable'-339105,339105

197257,418773,MYL,Glaxo  GSK  Reports In Line Q1 Earnings  Reiterates View,opinion,"GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   first quarter results came roughly in line with expectations  Glaxo reported first quarter 2017 core earnings of 62 cents per American Depositary Share  ADS   in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings were up 9  year over year at constant exchange rates  CER  
Quarterly revenues were up 5  at CER to  9 2 billion   7 4 billion  on the back of strong performance at all the business segments and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 1 billion 
All growth rates mentioned below are on a year on year basis and at CER 

Glaxo s share price increased 5 2  this year compared to the 5 9  gain witnessed by the Zacks classified  industry 
Quarterly Highlights
Glaxo reports results under three segments  Pharmaceuticals  Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare  Pharmaceuticals were up 4  while Consumer Healthcare up 2   Vaccines segment was up 16  
The Pharmaceuticals division registered revenues growth of 4  driven by strong growth of new products  particularly by Triumeq  Tivicay and Relvar Breo Ellipta which was partly offset by the impact of divestments  Respiratory sales were up 5  driven by the Ellipta portfolio and Nucala while HIV sales grew 35  on the back of a continued increase in market share for Triumeq and Tivicay  Sales of Established Pharmaceuticals declined 6  due to recent divestments 
Vaccines sales increased 16  driven by strong performance from Meningitis vaccines and higher demand for Established Vaccines along with the phasing of shipments in Emerging Markets  The segment also experienced strong performance of the Established Vaccines driven by higher demand in Emerging Markets  including the benefit of the acceleration of a number of shipments  particularly Synflorix 
However  growth slowed in the Consumer Healthcare segment primarily due to the disposal of the Nigeria beverages business  challenging conditions in international markets and a delayed start to the allergy season  On a positive note  strong performances from power brands  particularly in Oral health and the Cold   flu resulted in 2  growth 
Sales of New Pharmaceutical and Vaccine products in the quarter grew 52  and accounted for roughly 27  of Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines turnover in the quarter 
Outlook
Assuming that the generic version of Advair will not be introduced in the markets in 2017  the company expects core earnings per share to grow around 5 7  accounting for a 15 20  decline in Advair sales in the U S  in 2017  Assuming generic competition for Advair in the U S  in mid 2017  the company expects Advair sales of  1 billion in the U S  while core earnings per share are projected to be flat or decline slightly GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Our Take
Glaxo first quarter earnings came roughly in line with expectations  Although sales of new products  Tivicay and Triumeq  Relvar Breo  Anoro  Incruse  and Nucala  and Bexsero and Menveo  will boost the top line  the potential entry for generics for Advair will impact performance 
We remind investors that Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   efforts to bring a generic verison for Advair in the market suffered a blow as the FDA issued a complete response letter to its abbreviated new drug application  ANDA  for Advair  There are other companies too who are developing the generic for Advair  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC has also submitted its ANDA for its generic version of Advair to the FDA  A decision is expected on May 10 
Growth has slowed in a number of emerging markets  particularly India  Moreover  the HIV portfolio has its own set of challenges given the generics for Epzicom Kivexa in most markets across the U S  and Europe  Nevertheless  continued increase in market shares for Triumeq and Tivicay should combat this decline 
The company is currently focusing on near term launches in respiratory  HIV and Vaccines franchises and will throw more light on its business priorities in the second quarter call scheduled in Jul 2017  Hence  we expect investors to keep an eye for data read outs and approval of new drugs vaccines  regulatory decision on shingles vaccine Shingrix expected in fourth quarter 2017  given Glaxo s deep pipeline

197258,418774,MYL,Momenta  MNTA  Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected  Sales Beat,opinion,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   reported loss of 46 cents per share in the first quarter of 2017 which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of  1 09  In fact  the company posted a loss of 35 cents in the year ago quarter as well 
But revenues in the quarter surged 34 1  to  26 6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  22 million 
Shares of Momenta have underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in year to date  The stock rallied 4 6  compared with the industry s gain of 5 4  

Quarter in Detail
Momenta s top line comprises product revenues of  23 4 million earned from Sandoz s sales of Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone  20 mg   compared with  14 8 million in the year ago quarter  The increase was on the back of increased number of Glatopa 20 mg units sold 
Collaborative research and development revenues came in at  3 2 million  down from  5 1 million in the year ago quarter   The decline in revenues was mainly due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement  effective Dec 31  2016 
While  research and development expenses were up 25 5  to  36 1 million  general and administrative expenses increased 47 7  to  23 1 million 
Outlook
Momenta reiterated its guidance for operating expenses for 2017  The company expects operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and net of collaborative revenues  in the range of  200  240 million in 2017  The guidance also includes approximately  55 million of capital expenditure on M923 slated for 2017  Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2017 are projected around  50  60 million 
Collaboration revenues  under its agreement with Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   are anticipated to be  1 8 million per quarter  Moreover  the company anticipates to recognize the  50 million upfront payment from CSL as revenues in the second half of 2017 
Pipeline Update
Sandoz s abbreviated New Drug Application  ANDA  for the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone  Glatopa 40mg  was under the FDA review  However  Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer   NYSE PFE    which is Sandoz s contracted fill finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa 
In fact  the ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer  Pfizer submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letterMeanwhile  Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates  In fact  under its collaboration with Mylan in Apr 2017  the company completed enrolment in the phase I study on M834  a biosimilar version of Orencia  abatacept   Top line data from the study are expected in the second half of 2017 
Again  in Dec 2016  the company inked an early termination of the collaboration agreement with Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG    to develop and commercialize M923  a biosimilar version of Humira  adalimumab   In lieu  the company received a one time asset return payment of  51 2 million from Shire in Jan 2017 
Currently  Momenta s M923 is being evaluated in a phase III study  It announced positive results from a phase III study on M923 in patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis  Moving ahead  the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies by mid 2017  Also  it expects first commercial launch of M923 to be as early as the 2020 timeframe 
Furthermore  Momenta s novel autoimmune portfolio includes two recombinant molecules  M230  a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors  SIF3  and M281  an anti FcRn monoclonal antibody  In Jan 2017  the company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with CSL for M230 and potential future Fc multimer programs  The candidate is expected to enter clinic in 2017 
In fact  this company successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281  The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in Jan 2017 and data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study are projected in the second half of 2017 
M254 is a tetra Fc sialylated immunoglobulin with consistent enhanced anti inflammatory activity  The company continues to progress the M254 program and expects to initiate an investigational new drug  IND  enabling toxicology study in 2017 and is anticipated to enter a clinical study in 2018 
Our Take
The company posted narrower than expected loss and sales beat estimates in the first quarter of 2017  The ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA  resulting in a delay of approval  Notably  the warning letter will remain a drag on the company s shares till the issue is solved 
However  sales of Glatopa 20mg continue to do well  In addition  a potential submission of M923 for approval in mid 2017 will boost investor confidence  Further  Momenta may collaborate with some other company for the future development and commercialization of the drug Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

197268,418784,MYL,Trump Vows To Slash Drug Prices  Sends Biotech Stocks Lower,opinion,"The post election biotech honeymoon is over  Shares of the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  are down more than 3 6  in morning trading Wednesday following a new warning from President elect Donald Trump that he will indeed be targeting high drug prices 
Immediately following the election  IBB soared more than 9  as investors assumed that Trump would be much less likely to crack down on exorbitant drug price hikes than Hillary Clinton  After all  Clinton had put drug prices at the forefront of her campaign  while Trump is typically an outspoken supporter of deregulation 
In an interview with   which recently named him its  Person of the Year   the president elect promised to lower the cost of costly medications and suggested that investors may have misread his intentions 
 I m going to bring down drug price   Trump told Time   I don t like what has happened with drug prices  
Trump s warning was  as usual  concise and vague  but the message clearly resonated with biotech investors  Companies with existing price scandals  such as Mylan   NASDAQ MYL    felt the brunt of the sell off today  while ETFs like IBB and the SPDR S P Biotech  MX XBI  ETF  highlighted the range of the trading 
Interestingly enough  Trump s has previously promised to roll back FDA regulations to make things easier for companies to do business  It looks like Trump s FDA promises could be more focused on food and farming regulations now  as a move to bring drug costs down would imply some sort of intervention in the pharmaceuticals industry

197276,418792,MYL,3 Things To Watch When Mylan Reports Earnings On Wednesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   the global manufacturer and distributor of generic  branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals will release its Q3 2016 earnings report on Wednesday  November 9  after the market close 

1  Earnings and Revenue
Mylan is expected to report earnings of  1 46 on  3 14 billion in revenue  The company s revenues are anticipated to continue to rise  with growth of 16  expected this quarter  Mylan s earnings have also been moving up  although growth in this area has been widely inconsistent over the past year because of rising expenses  varying between more than 20  to the low single digits  This time around  earnings are expected to grow by a meager 2  

2  EpiPen Controversy
Pricing issues have weighed heavily on the pharmaceuticals sector  particularly since the Martin Shkreli Turing Pharmaceuticals scandal in September 2015  when news broke that Shkreli  then Turing s CEO  had hiked the price of a drug used to treat AIDs by over 5400   The latest focus of this growing storm is Mylan  which came under fire in August because of the price of its life saving EpiPen a decades old  auto injector used by millions of people to combat anaphylaxis brought on by such common things as food allergies and insect bites which it had inherited as part of a larger purchase of medicinal lines from Merck KGaA  DE MRK  in 2007 
The Turing scandal goes a long way toward explaining why this whole thing blew up so badly for Mylan this past summer  After MYL acquired the EpiPen  they set out to market the product to parents whose children suffered from a broad variety of allergies and were at risk for anaphylactic shock  Mylan s efforts surpassed their expectations for the EpiPen which isn t even one of their core products  The marketing campaign helped drive the EpiPen price from  100 in 2009  for a two pack of injectors  to over  600 today for the same two pack an increase of more than 500   To reduce the criticism and calm angry consumers  MYL has decided to launch a generic EpiPen of its own  which will be priced at  300 for a two pack  While this may appease angry consumers  it will certainly hurt Mylan s specialty segment profit margins 
As if the summertime controversy wasn t enough  in early October word went out that Mylan had reached a settlement with US authorities over the misclassification of the EpiPen in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  The company was found to have labeled the device as a  non innovator  or generic drug  allowing the company to pay lower rebates to the US government on purchases of the drug  The  465 million settlement  which Mylan has agreed to pay  is expected to show up in the company s report this quarter 
Both issues likely won t fade away any time soon as they go deeper than controversies and settlements  Pharmaceutical companies  Mylan included  have become the eye of a political storm surrounding drug pricing  affordability and pharmaceutical company practices  Hillary Clinton has called on Mylan to reduce the price of its device yet further and has recommended a Federal  response team  monitor drug price hikes going forward  The idea of governmen controls on the price of drugs is a nightmare scenario for big and small pharma as well as investors who follow and buy the sector  Indeed  the current political environment is one of the leading reasons why the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is down over 26  since the beginning of 2016 

3  Generic Drugs
Mylan s core business  generics  involves recreating drugs whose patents have expired  generating competitive offerings and driving prices down  Mylan s generics business is actually performing well  growing at a 10  rate over last year  a noteworthy accomplishment considering that generics represent 85  of Mylan s business  This rate of growth is expected to continue over the next few years  and would be great news for the price of Mylan s stock   if the company were not to become embroiled in another scandal 
Unfortunately  last Thursday  a report was released that a Federal inquiry into drug price fixing has found more meaningful evidence than previously thought that the practice is widespread and ongoing  The report named Mylan and Teva  NYSE TEVA  along with nine other pharmaceutical companies  and led to a sharp  8  drop in the stock s price when the news broke 
Conclusion
Mylan s ongoing and multiple legal issues should be a serious concern for investors  Indeed  the stock is now down to  35  less than half of its high of  76 in April 2015  Still  along with the EpiPen it has a number of successful lines including Simvastatin  a cholesterol reducer  and Omeprazole which is used to treat digestive issues  Nevertheless  the presidential election  coupled with several calls by US senators to intervene in the pharma industry and a price fixing scandal are probably more than many investors are willing to take on at this point 
If one was to ignore all of the above and focus on the numbers  Mylan would be a solid company in which to invest  Revenue has been up every quarter since 2010  the company has a reasonable 22 P E ratio  cash flow of  2 billion TTM from operations  current liabilities of  3 7 billion but on  6 billion in current assets   and that s not counting the fresh  6 billion it just raised from a bond offering 
However  right now Mylan is simply plagued by too many legal issues to be a solid buy  First  watch the elections since the results will undoubtedly affect not just Mylan  but the entire healthcare sector  But do keep an eye on Mylan  With its solid fundamentals it could be a good risk reward play should its share price drop further  We like the company for the longer term and believe there will come a period of reduced uncertainty paired with a good entry point  But that period is not now ",2016-11-08,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-things-to-watch-when-mylan-reports-earnings-on-wednesday-200163125,200163125
197277,418793,MYL,Theravance  TBPH  Posts Narrower than Expected Q3 Loss,opinion,"Theravance Biopharma  Inc    NASDAQ TBPH   reported third quarter 2016 loss of 73 cents per share  much narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 95 cents and the year ago loss of  1 40 Total revenue in the quarter surged 78 3  year over year to  19 1 million on the back of higher collaboration revenues and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  16 4 million 
Quarterly Details
Theravance s sole marketed product  Vibativ  generated U S  revenues of  3 9 million in the third quarter of 2016  up 68 7  from the year ago period  However  the figure tanked 27 2  sequentially due to seasonality and trends in surgical admissions 
Revenues from collaborations soared approximately 81  to  15 2 million  This was due to the recognition of upfront payment of  15 million from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited   OTC TKPYY   under a commercialization agreement for TD 8954 
Research and development expenses were  32 million  up 5 2  from the year ago period mainly due costs associated with the advancement of the company s priority programs 
Selling  general   administrative expenses  on the other hand  declined 11 2  to  20 3 million mainly due to lower costs associated with share based compensation expense and timing of other expenses 
2016 Outlook
Theravance expects operating loss  excluding share based compensation  of approximately  140 million in 2016 
Pipeline Update
Theravance has made significant progress with its pipeline  In Oct 2016  Theravance and Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   announced positive top line data from two replicate three month phase III studies evaluating revefenacin  TD 4208  for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD  
Data showed that the studies met primary efficacy endpoints  demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in trough lung function after 12 weeks of dosing for both the 88 mcg once daily and 175 mcg once daily of revefenacin  Both the doses of the candidate were found to be generally well tolerated in the studies 
In addition to the two efficacy studies  the phase III program includes an ongoing 12 month  open label  active comparator safety study  which is expected to be complete in 2017  Positive data from the safety study would allow Theravance to file a new drug application for revefenacin in the U S  by the end of 2017 
We note that Theravance has partnered with Mylan for the development and commercialization of nebulized revefenacin products for the treatment of COPD and other respiratory diseases 
Theravance is working on expanding Vibativ s label  The company is evaluating Vibativ in a phase III study for the treatment of primary bacteremia with the study expected to be complete in 2018  Moreover  the TOUR registry program is on track and is generating useful data across a range of difficult to treat infections 
With a number of updates expected on the pipeline front over the upcoming quarters  we expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates by the company 
THERAVANCE BIO Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Zacks Rank   a Stock to Consider
Theravance is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  A better ranked stock in the health care sector is Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INFI    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Infinity s loss estimates narrowed from  3 84 to  3 79 for 2016 over the last 60 days  The company has posted a positive surprise in all of the four trailing quarters with an average beat of 67 62

197288,418804,MYL,Mylan  MYL  To Report Q3 Earnings  Stock Likely To Disappoint,opinion,Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 results on Nov 9  after the market closes  The company s performance has been decent so far  having beaten earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  Overall  it has delivered an average positive surprise of 0 86  Last quarter  the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 0 87   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider This QuarterMylan was in the news through the entire third quarter for the massive price hike of its severe allergy treatment  EpiPen  in the recent years  for which it drew flak from lawmakers  consumers and the common people alike  Reeling under pressure  Mylan tried to mitigate the issue by offering a savings card for up to  300  expanding the eligibility of its patient assistance program and announcing the upcoming launch of a generic EpiPen at a discount of over 50  on the branded product s price The company again made it to the headlines when several lawmakers questioned Medicaid rebates for EpiPen  The Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services found that Mylan had misclassified EpiPen as a non innovator multiple source drug or a generic drug in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  This means that the company has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time  This led to millions of dollars in overpayment for the drug by states and the federal government under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Finally  last month  Mylan agreed to pay  465 million to the U S  Department of Justice and other government agencies to settle the issues regarding the classification EpiPen for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  The company expects to take a third quarter 2016 pre tax charge of approximately  465 million to reflect this settlement Concurrent to the announcement of the settlement  Mylan lowered its 2016 earnings outlook  The company now expects earnings in the range of  4 70  4 90 per share  marking a significant reduction from the previous guidance of  4 85  5 15 The company attributes the lowered earnings guidance largely to the changes in EpiPen access programs and the upcoming launch of generic EpiPen  Mylan also stated said that it expects to see a considerable impact of this guidance in the third quarter of 2016 Meanwhile  Mylan s Generics segment has been performing well over the last few quarters and should continue the momentum this quarter as well  Moreover  the company has seen quite a few generic launches over the past few quarters and this one was no exception  Newly launched products should perform well and aid the top line  while acquisitions contribute meaningfully  thereby driving segmental growth In the to be reported quarter  in Aug 2016   Mylan acquired Swedish drug maker Meda in a deal worth  9 9 billion Notably  Mylan s Specialty segment  of which EpiPen is the most significant product  is expected to take a hit On the third quarter call  investor focus will be on the company s performance as well as on the EpiPen pricing controversy given that lawmakers continue to question the company s pricing policy  and political  public and media focus is on the issue Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mylan is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to likely post an earnings beat  That

197289,418805,MYL,Endo International  Surviving Despite Collusion Charges,opinion,"Thursday was not a good day for generic drug companies  On that day   broke the news that the U S  Department of Justice was investigating multiple generic pharmaceutical companies on charges of price collusion  These news are particularly problematic given how pharmaceutical companies have been under severe attack from the public for buying the rights to cheap generic drugs and massively jacking up the price in order to make a profit  Several companies such as Teva Pharma Industries Ltd  NYSE TEVA   Impax Laboratories Inc  NASDAQ IPXL   and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  Pharmaceuticals saw a massive single day drop due to the news 
Investors should be naturally leery of investing in any of these companies  but Endo International PLC  NASDAQ ENDP  is at particular risk  Endo took a massive hit alongside everyone else as it lost 19 5 percent of its value  and the company has issues even before it will have to deal with the inevitable storm of political outrage  fines  and additional regulations better than its competitors 
The company s ongoing discussion to sell Paladin Labs to relieve its massive debt load is concerning  as is its stock performance over the past year and the intense competition it faces  Investors should look to sell their holdings in Endo and avoid the temptation to buy on the dip  The Collusion Charge
The collusion charge is what caused Endo s stock to collapse and is the biggest problem in the short to medium term  As the aforementioned Bloomberg report noted  the Justice Department s investigation targets two dozen companies and drugs and has sent subpoenas to these companies  While some companies like Teva indicated their willingness to cooperate  Endo did not comment 
The fact that  high level executives  could be charged and fined would be enough to give any company jitters under normal circumstances  and these are much worse than normal circumstances  The Democratic Party has made political hay for the past year by targeting pharmaceuticals who they argue unfairly jack up prices which hurt the ordinary consumer 
If Hillary Clinton is elected president as seems likely  she has vowed to regulate real estate  as well as pharmaceutical prices to prevent them from doing the sorts of actions which have attracted media attention  These regulations would likely limit the ability of smaller pharmaceutical firms like Endo to grow  and has investors concerned  Even if Trump prevails  his populist mindset means that he would need little persuading to go after corporations oppressing the white working class that are the core of his support 
Regardless of political victors  Big Pharma will likely have few friends in Washington in the coming months  Endo s Problems
The collusion charge is problematic  but if that was Endo s only problem  I would recommend buying and taking advantage of this price fall  But Endo has more concerns than angry politicians 
The first is Endo s debt load   recently reported that Endo has discussed selling Paladin Labs Inc  to specialty pharmaceutical company Knight Therapeutics Inc  TO GUD   The deal would be explicitly made so that Endo could  pay down some of its  8 billion in debt   even though it would be selling Paladin at a significant loss compared to the price it originally paid 
This debt load happened because Endo went on a major acquisition spree before 2016  acquiring Paladin in addition to issuing  5 billion in debt as part of an  8 billion purchase of   Yet despite these acquisitions  Endo has not been able to increase its revenue enough to make these acquisitions worthwhile  In May  Endo had to slash its year end estimates for revenue and earnings per share by 11 and 23 percent respectively  These changes caused the stock to fall by 40 percent  and Endo s current value is only 25 percent of its peak back at the beginning of this year  Too many problems
There is always a temptation to go against the grain and try to buy low when a stock falls like Endo s has  but investors should be leery of the company and of the pharmaceutical industry in general  While pharmaceuticals will always be in high demand  they are also the target of politicians intent on further regulating the industry  The latest charges of collusion are a perfect opportunity for them  which will hurt the industry s ability to innovate and grow  But even if there were no legal issues  Endo itself has concerns which should unnerve any investor  The company is facing tough competition  has failed to increase revenue enough to compensate for its high debt loads  and has watched its stock fall off a cliff as a result  Investors may be potentially interested if Endo s value falls to  10 to  12  but the safer bet is to just stay away from the company and sell any holdings  Things are almost certainly going to go worse for Endo and pharmaceutics before they get better ",2016-11-05,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/endo-international:-surviving-despite-collusion-charges-200162946,200162946

Mylan struck the deal last Friday after the market closed to pay the U S  Department of Justice  as well as other agencies  over whether or not its EpiPen should be classified as a generic or brand name drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program 
Mylan CEO Heather Bresch commented   This agreement is another important step in Mylan s efforts to move forward and bring resolution to all EpiPen Auto Injector related matters Entering into this settlement is the right course of action at this time for the Company  its stakeholders and the Medicaid program

197301,418817,MYL,Mylan Up On EpiPen Medicaid Settlement  Cuts 2016 Outlook,opinion,"Mylan N V  s   NASDAQ MYL   shares gained 8 2  after the company announced that it has agreed to pay  465 million to resolve the disputes regarding the classification of its severe allergy treatment  EpiPen  The decision came after several lawmakers criticized the classification of the drug as well as the rebate obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program  Mylan has reached a settlement with the U S  Department of Justice and other government agencies in this regard  Overall  the company s shares are up 6 6  since the announcement 
The proposed settlement offers to resolve all potential rebate liability claims by federal and state governments on whether EpiPen should have been classified as an innovator drug or branded drug for the purpose of Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services  CMS   and therefore subject to a higher rebate formula 
The CMS found that Mylan had misclassified EpiPen as a non innovator drug or a generic drug  This implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time  Apparently  instead of the 23 1  rebate for a branded drug  Mylan has been paying the much lower generic rebate of 13  
Mylan said in its press release that the settlement did not imply any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the company or any of its affiliated entities or personnel  EpiPen has been classified with CMS as a non innovator drug since before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on longstanding written guidance from the federal government 
Mylan intends to continue to work with the government to finalize the settlement and will enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services 
Mylan expects to take a third quarter 2016 pre tax charge of approximately  465 million to reflect this settlement 
MYLAN NV Price
    Cuts 2016 Earnings Outlook
Concurrent to the announcement of settlement  Mylan lowered 2016 earnings outlook  The company now expects earnings in the range of  4 70  4 90 per share  This is significantly lower than the previously guided range of  4 85  5 15 per share 
The company attributes the cut in the earnings guidance largely to the previously announced changes in EpiPen access programs and the upcoming launch of generic EpiPen  Mylan said that it expects to see considerable impact of this guidance in the third quarter of 2016 
Meanwhile  Mylan is targeting earnings of at least  6 00 per share in 2018 
The company will report third quarter 2016 results on Nov 9  after the market closes 
We note that Mylan has been under immense pressure ever since the company came under scrutiny of several lawmakers for the massive price hike of EpiPen 
Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector include Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY    Geron Corporation   NASDAQ GERN   and VIVUS Inc    NASDAQ VVUS    While Incyte and Geron sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   VIVUS carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Incyte s earnings estimates for 2016 and 2017 were up a respective 29 5  and 11 5  over the last 60 days  The company has beaten estimates thrice in the last four quarters with an average surprise of 335 16  
Geron has recorded an average positive surprise of 20 78  over the trailing four quarters

197305,418821,MYL,Mylan  MYL  CEO s Testimony Underestimated EpiPen Profits,opinion,"Last week  Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL    testified before lawmakers and elected government officials regarding a recent price increase on its lifesaving product that treats severe allergic reactions   The product is   and since there are no direct competitors in the market  Mylan has had full discretion over how much it charges for the injection pen   A pair of pens went for about  100 in 2008  and since then  the price has ballooned to  600 
What exacerbates the problem is the fact that many pens expire after a year  so people with severe allergy problems are forced to pay for new pens every year  although insurance plans can help in making the drug affordable    With this  it is not too surprising to see why  practices 
Today  it has been revealed that the company s CEO underestimated the amount of profit which the company makes per two pen pack   Mrs  Bresch stated that Mylan makes roughly  100 in profit  but that number applies the 37 5  statutory tax rate  a percentage which Mylan didn t actually pay   Mylan s overall effective tax rate was 4 2  and 7 4  in 2014 and 2015 respectively  
The committee that Heather testified in front of did not believe in Mylan s reported profitability from EpiPens last week  and they were right to have doubts   Without including the statutory tax rate  Mylan s profit on two packs comes out to about  160   This is 60  more profit than the figure that Mylan gave to congress   Mylan is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and its stock fell by about 2  today

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Would a Clinton Presidency Spell Doom for Pharma ETFs 

The pharma sector remains in the limelight thanks to the ongoing drug pricing controversy  Over the past one year  both pharma and biotech stocks have been under immense pressure due to the pricing controversy  While the high price of drugs has always been a matter of concern  political and media focus on this issue has increased significantly since last September following Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s  price gouging  tweet 
	The situation has heated up in recent times given the price hikes taken by Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  for its life saving combination product EpiPen  Clinton announced a health care plan that will address the excessive price hikes of treatments that have been available for years and also reaffirmed her earlier broader plan  announced last September  with the aim to lower drug prices for all Americans   Read   
	With drug costs remaining a concern and lawmakers focusing on the need to control drug prices and make prescription drugs affordable  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market 
	On a positive note  Allergan s CEO Brent Saunders said in a blog post that the company will not engage in price gouging actions or predatory pricing and will limit price increases M As to Continue  
	With Pfizer  NYSE PFE  recently announcing that it will be acquiring oncology focused Medivation for approximately  14 billion  expectations are that M A activities will pick up pace in the latter half of the year  Meanwhile  small bolt on acquisitions  in licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates are expected to continue 
	Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals    most of them find it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash   Read   
	Therapeutic areas attracting a lot of interest include central nervous system disorders  hepatitis C virus  HCV  and immunology inflammation  Another highly lucrative area is immuno oncology  Major players in this field include Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca  Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche 
	Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  UCB  Novartis  Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise New Products Should Gain Traction
	Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  While 45 drugs were approved by the FDA last year  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 16 drugs   Read    
	Biosimilars are also a focus area  Pfizer s acquisition of Hospira gives it a strong position in the biosimilars market  Companies like Novartis are involved in the development of biosimilars as well   in fact  Novartis  Sandoz was the first company to launch a biosimilar in the U S Pharma ETFs in Focus

197312,418828,MYL,Inside The Recent Surge In Biotech ETFs,opinion,"The biotech space gained the much needed strength on September 12 with every ETF being in the green  Positive news ushered into the sector on Monday  giving several stocks and funds a solid lift  Notably  biotech stocks are caught in a web of issues this year including overvaluation concerns and the likely negative impact of the presidential election in the U S  
Investors should note that with the presidential candidate  policymakers  the media and the general public raising questions over high drug pricing lately  biotech stocks and the related ETFs haven fallen out of investor favor  read    
Hillary Clinton   the Democratic presidential candidate   is among those who have been vocal about the steep pricing on life saving drugs for long  read    
However  braving such issues  biotech stocks and ETFs registered solid gains on September 12  Below we highlight the drivers in detail 
Surge in Deals 
The sector has always been at the epicenter of mergers and acquisitions  Horizon Pharma PLC   NASDAQ HZNP    announced that it will acquire Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp   NASDAQ RPTP   for about  800 million  Following the announcement  Horizon Pharma added over 9 4  and Raptor Pharmaceutical surged over 20 5  on September 12

If this was not enough  Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   disclosed that it intends to pursue a host of  rather than a huge one  All these news acted as a cornerstone for the entire biotech space 
Successful Clinical Trial 
Shares of Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd    NASDAQ FOMX   shot up over 15 7  on September 12 after the company announced  that a drug designed to  rosacea had shown strong results in a Phase 2 clinical trial  
Dovish Fed Comments 
Though the broader market went into a tailspin on September 9  dovish comments by Fed Governor  on the policy tightening issue on September 12  triggered a relief rally to start this week  With chances of a September hike slumping to   as per changes in Fed funds futures  high growth  high beta sectors like biotech had reasons to rejoice 
Trump s Chances of Winning Growing 
Lately  chances of Republican candidate Donald Trump s winning the presidential election are rising  The  daily presidential tracking poll results indicated on Monday that Donald Trump  48 7   is leading Hillary Clinton  45 8   by close to 3 percentage points in the seven day polling period ending September 11 
However   Real Clear Politics  poll results showed that Clinton  45 9   beat Trump  42 9   by 3 percentage points on September 12  2016  Whatever the case  Donald Trump s steadfastness in the presidential election race  for biotech stocks  given Clinton s constant move against the price gouging issue in the pharmaceutical space  read

197313,418829,MYL,Forget Novavax  Buy These 4 Biotech Stocks Instead,opinion,"Shares of Novavax  Inc    NASDAQ NVAX   plunged around 82  in pre market trading on Friday after the biopharmaceutical company announced a day before that its key vaccine candidate unexpectedly failed to meet the primary endpoint in a phase III trial 
What Went Wrong at Novavax
Top line data presented from the Resolve trial evaluating its RSV F vaccine for preventing lower respiratory tract disease in 11 856 older adults  60 years of age and older  failed to meet the pre specified primary or the secondary efficacy objectives  The primary objective of the randomized  placebo controlled Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in preventing moderate severe RSV associated lower respiratory tract disease while the secondary objective was to show efficacy in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV  RSV ARD   Though the vaccine was well tolerated in the trial  it failed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy 
Chief Gregory Glenn said that an initial analysis did not show any issues with the  trial execution  data collection  data integrity  or drug product quality  that can be blamed for the unfavorable outcome 
Also top line results presented from another phase II rollover trial of the vaccine candidate showed absence of efficacy of a single immunization  However  the data did suggest improved vaccine efficacy from the second year of dosing 
Novavax is a clinical stage company and has no marketed products at present  There are currently no approved vaccines to fight RSV  Novavax s vaccine  if approved  can bring in huge revenues for the company  Therefore  the failure of this key pipeline candidate in late stage trials is a huge setback for the stock  Novavax has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  NOVAVAX INC Price
 

   The Broader Sector Picture
It has been a pretty rough year for the healthcare sector  A changing competitive scenario and media and political focus on the high prices of drugs have made things difficult for the pharma biotech sector since the past one year 
Democratic presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton has pledged to find ways to institute reforms to curb rising drug prices and thereby lower prescription drug costs for all Americans  The situation worsened when Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   increased the price of its life saving combination product EpiPen  This month  Clinton  in a statement on her website  announced measures to curb  unjustified  price hikes of lifesaving treatments  especially the ones that have been in the market for long 
However  the sector s fundamentals remain strong   strong pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  growing demand for drugs especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth 
Healthcare merger and acquisition activity is also gaining strength  This week  Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   announced that it will be acquiring Monsanto Company   NYSE MON   for  66 billion while Horizon Pharma plc   NASDAQ HZNP   announced its intention of buy Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp    NASDAQ RPTP   
In August  Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   announced that it intends to buy oncology focused Medivation  Inc    NASDAQ MDVN   for approximately  14 billion  This was preceded by the buyout of Anacor in Jun 2016 and Hospira in Sep 2015  In Jun 2016  Shire plc   NYSE S   acquired Baxalta to further strengthen its rare disease portfolio  Aegerion Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ AEGR   and QLT Inc    NASDAQ QLTI   entered into a definitive merger agreement in Jun 2016 to form a new company  Novelion Therapeutics Inc 
Merger and acquisitions are expected to increase in the back half of the year  Meanwhile  small bolt on acquisitions  in licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates are expected to continue

197314,418830,MYL,Mylan CEO s Mother Pushed Schools To Buy EpiPens,opinion,"Gayle Manchin  former First Lady of West Virginia and mother of embattled Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   CEO Heather Bresch  may have used her position as head of the National Association of State Boards of Education to encourage states to require schools to buy EpiPens  according to a new report from  
Manchin took over this role in 2012  the same year her daughter was made CEO of Mylan  and eleven states soon followed her direction by drafting laws that required epinephrine auto injectors in schools  By 2013  most states recommended schools stock this allergy medication after the so called federal  EpiPen Law  helped fund those that did 
The news surrounding Manchin is the latest in a series of controversies surrounding Mylan and its  on EpiPens over the last several years  The company is the center of congressional investigations related to the popular allergy treatment  and it also faces an  in New York related to its EpiPens4Schools program 
According to the USA Today report  Mylan s relationship with the National Association of State Boards of Education appears to have begun in October 2012  when the company sponsored several health presentations at the association s annual conference 
Just two months later  the association announced its  epinephrine policy intiative   which was designed to help state boards of education develop health policies that included access to auto injectors 
While Manchin s organization never specifically mentioned Mylan when it recommended epinephrine auto injectors  it didn t really have to  As critics have pointed out  Mylan is basically the only maker of these allergy treatments in the world 
It s not difficult to see the connection here  and this latest detail will only add more drama to the ongoing Mylan controversy ",2016-09-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-ceo's-mother-pushed-schools-to-buy-epipens-200154594,200154594
197315,418831,MYL,Here s What Pissed Off Congressmen Said To Mylan s CEO ,opinion,"Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   CEO Heather Bresch responded to questions from the House Oversight Committee Wednesday as Congress continues its probe into the company s price hikes on EpiPens  Despite their usual partisan gridlock  members of Congress united to absolutely grill Bresch over the scandal 
Unconvincing Talk
Bresch attempted to explain to the House committee that Mylan made less than  100 on a standard two pack of EpiPens  which retails for nearly  609  but the representatives didn t buy her logic  especially when she refused to admit that her company raised the price of the medication in an attempt to make more money 
Ms  Bresch was also seemingly unprepared for many of the committee s questions  the embattled chief executive didn t come with the information about the company s revenue and patient assistance programs that Congress previously requested 
The Roast of Heather Bresch 
Both Republicans and Democrats took Bresch s appearance in Congress as an opportunity to skewer her and her company for their pricing strategy that saw the cost of EpiPens increase by over 400  in just a few years 
 I am a very conservative and pro business Republican  but I am sickened by what I ve heard   said Rep  John Duncan  a Republican from Tennessee 
Tammy Duckworth  a Democrat from Illinois  questioned Bresch about the company s EpiPen4Schools program  which is currently the subject of an  in New York  Duckworth questioned Mylan s decision to make schools sign non compete agreements  calling the practice  an unfair monopoly  
Duckworth also mentioned that schools were unaware that the president of the National Association of State Boards of Education  which pushed state governments to mandate that schools keep EpiPens in stock  was actually Bresch s own mother  also read    
Democratic Rep  Elijah Cummings of Maryland likened Mylan s conduct to that of Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals 
 After the hearing  you know what he called us  Imbeciles  You know why he said that  Because he knew he would go back and do the same thing  So he took his punches he rope a doped us  Even worse  he took the Fifth   Cumming said in reference to Shkreli s congressional testimony earlier this year 
Another visibly upset lawmaker was Jason Chaffetz  a Republican from Utah  Chaffetz seemed baffled when Bresch attempted to argue that Mylan doesn t actually make that much profit on the drug 
 That doesn t make any sense   Chaffetz said   This is why we don t believe you  
Rep  Eleanor Norton  a Democratic delegate from Washington D C   also called Bresch s personal income into question 
 What have you done to earn this 671  increase    she asked  referencing Bresch s salary increase and stock gains since taking over as Mylan chief 
Bottom Line

Pharma Roundup  Mylan s Antitrust Probe  Allergan Limits Drug Price Hikes

	On Tuesday  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened an investigation into Mylan NV    that focuses on the drugmaker s contracts with local school districts to purchase its EpiPens 

	In a statement  Schneiderman said  No child s life should be put at risk because a parent  school or health care provider cannot afford a simple  life saving device because of a drug maker s anticompetitive practices  

	According to      the probe will be broad  but one of the main focus points is whether or not its EpiPens4School program  which offered a significant discount on the drug  locked schools into anti competitive contracts 

	Last month  the pharma leader drew widespread criticism after it was discovered that the company increased the price of EpiPens over 400  over the last several years  To put that in perspective  the drug cost  57 a shot when Mylan acquired it in 2007  and now  a two pack of EpiPens costs more than  600 

	Shortly afterwards  Mylan  it would take several steps to make the lifesaving allergy treatment more affordable to patients 

Allergan CEO Pledges Limit on Drug Price Increase

	Also on Tuesday  healthcare giant Allergan Inc  s    CEO Brett Saunders has offered a promise to limit price hikes on the drugs it sells  writing in a  that  I understand the public outcry and add my voice to the condemnation of these behaviors  

	Saunders argues that there is a  long standing unwritten social contract  between patients  physicians  policy makers  and the greater public  and  Those who have taken aggressive or predatory price increases have violated this social contract  

	While not explicitly naming names  it s pretty clear he is referring to Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals  Valeant      and Mylan s recent EpiPen controversy 

	Allergan s pricing pledge is significant  as it opposes the common practice taken by fellow biotech and pharmaceutical companies  raising drug prices two to three times every year  This usually means that drug costs can significantly exceed the annual inflation rate 

	 For our industry to remain a vibrant and important part of the healthcare ecosystem  Allergan commits to this social contract and I encourage others to formulate their own self policing actions   Saunders continues

197320,418836,MYL,Will A Clinton Presidency Spell Doom For Pharma ETFs ,opinion,"The pharma sectorremains in the limelight thanks to the ongoing drug pricing controversy  Over the past one year  both pharma and biotech stocks have been under immense pressure due to the pricing controversy  While the high price of drugs has always been a matter of concern  political and media focus on this issue has increased significantly since last September following Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s  price gouging  tweet 

	The situation has heated up in recent times given the price hikes taken by Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  for its life saving combination product EpiPen  Clinton announced a health care plan that will address the excessive price hikes of treatments that have been available for years and also reaffirmed her earlier broader plan  announced last September  with the aim to lower drug prices for all Americans   Read   

	With drug costs remaining a concern and lawmakers focusing on the need to control drug prices and make prescription drugs affordable  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market 

	On a positive note  Allergan s CEO Brent Saunders said in a blog post that the company will not engage in price gouging actions or predatory pricing and will limit price increases 
M As to Continue  

	With Pfizer  NYSE PFE  recently announcing that it will be acquiring oncology focused Medivation for approximately  14 billion  expectations are that M A activities will pick up pace in the latter half of the year  Meanwhile  small bolt on acquisitions  in licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates are expected to continue 

	Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals    most of them find it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash   Read   

	Therapeutic areas attracting a lot of interest include central nervous system disorders  hepatitis C virus  HCV  and immunology inflammation  Another highly lucrative area is immuno oncology  Major players in this field include Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca  Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche 

	Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  UCB  Novartis  Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise 
New Products Should Gain Traction

	Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  While 45 drugs were approved by the FDA last year  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 16 drugs   Read   

	Biosimilars are also a focus area  Pfizer s acquisition of Hospira gives it a strong position in the biosimilars market  Companies like Novartis are involved in the development of biosimilars as well   in fact  Novartis  Sandoz was the first company to launch a biosimilar in the U S

197321,418837,MYL,Mylan Promises  300 Generic EpiPen,opinion,"In a continuation of its response to widespread criticism  pharmaceutical company Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   announced Monday that it will launch a generic version of the EpiPen at a 50  discount to the standard version of its popular allergy medication 
The unexpected move comes just days after Mylan announced that it will take several steps to make EpiPens more affordable after a number of healthcare reform advocates  including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton  directed criticism towards the company last week 
Clinton and others used the EpiPen as an example of the oftentimes absurd pricing strategies that have become commonplace in today s pharmaceutical industry  Over the past several years  Mylan has raised the price of a standard two pack of EpiPens by more than 400   and the life saving medication now has a sticker price of  608 
Mylan said it plans to launch its generic version of the EpiPen within the next several weeks  The non branded version will cost  300 per two pack 
Last Thursday  Mylan announced that it will provide an instant savings card worth  300 to any patient that currently pays full price for the EpiPen out of pocket  This would represent savings of about 50   or about the same as the generic price  for patients without insurance or for those with high deductible plans 
Mylan also announced that it is doubling the eligibility for patient assistance to 400  of the federal poverty level  This means that a family of four making up to  97 200 would be eligible to pay effectively nothing for an EpiPen 
Mylan did not announce what  if any  discounts it will offer for the generic version of the drug  and it s still unclear why patients would choose to use the branded version if the generic version is the exact same medication  as Mylan claims 
In a  announcing the new generic EpiPen  Mylan CEO Heather Bresch detailed the effectiveness of generic alternatives and claimed that the  complexity and opaqueness of today s branded pharmaceutical supply chain  led the company to bypass the brand system and offer an alternative 
 Generic drugs have a long  proven track record of delivering significant savings to both patients and the overall healthcare system   Bresch said    The launch of a generic EpiPen   which follows the steps we took last week on the brand to immediately reduce patients  out of pocket costs  will offer a long term solution to further reduce costs and ease the burden and complexity of the process on the patient  
While Mylan s recent efforts to respond to criticism may reek like a desperate PR move to some investors  they might just be exactly what the company needed to do  and if these new options make EpiPens more accessible to the patients that need them  it could be a win win ",2016-08-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-promises-$300-generic-epipen-200150623,200150623

197323,418839,MYL,It Looks Like A Hike,opinion,"Jackson Hole 2016 has come and gone and Fed members seem determined to raise rates at least once before year end  Based on the comments and conversations  the markets quickly adjusted to factoring in one hike in the September to December time frame 
But without sure signs of accelerating jobs or other economic growth  it is uncertain if there will be further rate hikes after the token one to come this year  So  we will all go back to closely watching the economic and corporate datapoints while keeping the corner of our eye on any Breaking News headlines 
Speaking of Breaking News headlines  The script from the EpiPen Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  saga could rival Michael Clayton  It was unfortunate timing for those investors who were riding the Healthcare subway last week when Hillary s tweet released a box of crickets and worms into the sector  And  just when biotech and drug CEOs were looking forward to a year away from the Congressional hot seat  But the good news is that the new Watergate Hotel is open and it looks great  Just ask for the Mylan group rate 
While the Fed speak last week sparked the U S  dollar and short term interest rates  it is uncertain if equity and risk investors are spooked  While the markets did sell off on Friday  trading remains very thin with the end of summer holidays still impacting  In looking at the numbers from last week  what does seem more certain is that investors continue to shift into more traditionally higher risk investments  Into Cyclicals like Technology and Banks and out of defensive income proxies  Into Junk and Emerging Market fixed income and out of Treasuries  Into EM Equities and out of domestic and developed Equities  The U S  dollar could be a thorn for a shift into these riskier investments  but if the markets become convinced that the Fed is one and done until 2017  then the Dollar could take a back seat as investments move into these newer areas of risk 
So unless the economy or global financial markets completely fall apart  we are getting a Fed Funds rate increase before year end 
 In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation  I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months   Ms  Yellen said in remarks delivered here Friday 
The remarks left the door open for a Fed rate increase at its Sept  20 21 policy meeting  but the chairwoman hedged her comments in ways that give the central bank an out if economic data disappoint in the next few weeks 
Most important  the Fed s decision appears to hinge on whether the Labor Department s Sept  2 jobs report shows steady gains in hiring  Job gains have averaged 190 000 a month over the past three months 
 Our decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the  Fed s  outlook   she said  If the Fed doesn t move in September  it has two more meetings this year  one in November just before U S  elections and another in December  Her comments suggest she expects a move at one of these meetings if the central bank doesn t raise rates in September 
And Fischer doubled down on what Yellen said 
 I think what the Chair said today was consistent with answering yes to both of your questions  but these are not things we know until we see the data  
 I think the evidence is the economy has strengthened  the big numbers are better than they have been for some time  
 In looking back at the timing of the 2015 Fed Funds rate hike  here is a chart of the Two Year Yield 
While it did snap higher on Friday  will it need to have a follow through move like in Nov Dec 2015 before we get the next hike 

The markets pushed September s Fed Funds rate hike probability to 42  on Friday 

Looking at the week s returns shows several interesting moves 
  Natural Gas    Crude Oil   Italy Spain   Europe   EFA   EEM   U S  Dollar  1    Banks   XLF which leads all XL Sectors   Semis   Nasdaq100   Junk Bonds   Risk Free U S  Treasuries   Small Caps   Large Caps   Utes  Staples  REITs lag as high dividend payers see further selling   EpiPen takes down Healthcare and Biotech   XRT  2  on a difficult week for Retailer earnings  save Best Buy   Tiffany s    Oil  Precious Metals and any stock touching either was the worst place to be  blame the Fed   US   

Sectors assets holding their trends the best 

Sectors which continue to give their investors butterflies 

Tough for the equity income proxies to outperform when everyone owns them 
Two of the most crowded sectors right now are consumer staples and utilities  according to analysis by Vadim Zlotnikov  a co head of multi asset solutions and chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein LP  Such stocks have been popular this year because their regular dividend payouts make them attractive as income bearing substitutes for bonds  Utilities are the second best performing sector of the S P 500 so far in 2016  rising 15  
Mr  Zlotnikov s analysis ranks North American traded utilities stocks in the 94th percentile in terms of how  crowded  they are as of mid August compared with the past 18 years  Consumer staples companies are in the 99th percentile  Energy stocks  which are up nearly as much as utilities so far this year in the S P 500  are in the 9th percentile 
Overwhelmingly popular  or  crowded   trades in recent years have tended to provide some outperformance on the way up  but lose all those gains and more in the subsequent drawdowns  according to the analysis 

As U S  Trust shows below  it is the Cyclical groups which have put up some of the best performance since February 

As the Energy sector tries to stabilize this year  here is a good look at its importance to the S P 500 

The recent outperformance in U S  Small Caps is giving the team at Leuthold a valuable Very Long Term Momentum BUY signal 
 LeutholdGroup   SmallCap positive  VLT  Momentum issued a  RUT BUY  While it s a short history  since 1979 only one signal failed 

If you need a new Short strategy  try developing one that shorts those companies cutting dividends and stock repos which are heavily owned by the indexes 
Mr  Damodaran  who likes to be provocative  says with rates this low  traditional valuation metrics are distorted  Instead  the inability of companies to keep paying off their investors will cause the next downturn   This is the weakest link in this market   Mr  Damodaran said in an interview   We know cash flows will go down  What we don t know is what the market is pricing in  
Meanwhile  S P 500 companies have logged four consecutive quarters of shrinking profits and tepid sales  That could force companies to buy less of their own stock and would take away a pillar of support for this market 
With earnings growth expected to be tepid in the coming quarters  maintaining dividends and repurchasing stock will only become more difficult  That trend might have already started  By one estimate  the value of stock buyback announcements in the second quarter slowed to its lowest level in four years 

Economic data worth highlighting last week was New Home Sales which crushed it 
Existing home sales posted a less impressive number but this is likely impacted by the low inventory and rising prices of the existing base 

ISI Group has the inventory chart that you were just thinking about 

Rising restaurant wages  employee healthcare costs   real estate rents making eating at home much cheaper than eating out 

 Remember back when Men had higher salaries than Women

197325,418841,MYL,Mylan Stock  Can It Survive The Epipen Blues ,opinion,"Mylan Inc   NASDAQ MYL 
On August 10th  the CEO of Mylan  Heather Bresch  assured that reliance on the Epipen was starting to ware down  This was the day the CEO was talking about earnings on the conference call  The CEO tried to downplay the whole necessity of the Epipen  Maybe it was to take attention away from it  and rightly so  That is because one week later after many analysts and investors had a chance to analyze the numbers  what they revealed was quite shocking 
What exactly was so shocking to where the Mylan issue has become such a huge dilemma in the news lately  Well how about the fact that from 2008 to now  the Epipen has risen in price by 400   That would make it hard for a standard adult to be able to afford the cost of having to use an Epipen  Even if you factor in the possibility about insurance companies that doesn t help either  That s because most insurers don t even cover the cost of the Epipen anymore  You can see now why this problems has blown up greatly in the media 
It got so bad that one week later  Senator Chuck Grassley who is the Chairman of the U S  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman  asked the CEO of Mylan why is the price hiked by so much  This was a question in which the CEO could not respond to clearly  After all  Mylan acquired the Epipen drug in 2007  The Epipen is responsible for helping people at the time of an allergic reaction  Many think of an allergic reaction as being small  but there are times where an allergic reaction can be severe and life threatening  If that is the case  then the allergic reaction can lead to death 
That s where the problem lies  because this treatment is not a product that is just wanted  It is a necessity for patients to avoid death  Yet Mylan has increased the price by 400  from 2007  The main question is why  It is not a newly developed drug  and the company doesn t need to be reimbursed for development costs  Patients had been forced to drive to Canada to get the Epipen at 1 3 the total U S  cost 
With such a huge backlash from the medical community  the senate and many others Mylan had to quickly get into a reactive position  It has been forced to squelch criticism by doing something drastic  This drastic measure was announced on Monday  where the pharmaceutical drug maker would launch a generic Epipen with a 50  discount  While a nice gesture on Mylan s part  a 50  discount to a drug that has already risen by 400  is nothing  This move is an attempt to squash the harsh criticism  but I don t believe it will work 
That s not all its doing to alleviate pressure on itself  It is also stating that it will offer a  300 instant savings cards to patients that have to pay the full price for the drug out of pocket  As noted before all these gestures are nice  but in the end Mylan is still stopping short of performing one function that would end all the criticism  That function would be to outright cut the price of the drug  The company refuses to take this route when it know full well that it is the right thing to do 
It is not right that Mylan is putting profits in front of patients  lives  Mylan s CEO Bresch continues to blame the broken healthcare system for the reason of the cost being so high  That s far from the truth  because if the company wants to they can cut the price in half or more tomorrow if it wanted to  But analysts wrote that Mylan would receive a big cut per prescription sold  and that would lead to lower revenue  Again  it all comes back to money on why Mylan won t cut the cost of the Epipen  Mylan s stock should continue to feel pressure from this as long as it refrains from cutting the cost of its Epipen treatment ",2016-08-31,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-(myl)-stock:-can-it-survive-the-epipen-blues-200150948,200150948
197326,418842,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Gets Positive Copaxone USPTO Ruling Yet Again,opinion,"In a favorable development for Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL    the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  PTO  once again ruled in favor of the company in its inter partes review  IPR  proceeding  According to the company s recent announcement  the PTO found that the U S  Patent No  8 969 302 that covers Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd  s   NYSE TEVA   multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone  40 mg mL   is unpatentable 
We note that this is the third patent related to Copaxone  40 mg mL  to be found unpatentable in the last week  On Aug 24  the PTO s Patent Trial and Appeal Board  PTAB  found Teva s first two patents   U S  Patent Nos  8 232 250 and 8 399 413   unpatentable in Mylan s IPR challenge of these patents 
Mylan had also filed a petition against a fourth Copaxone  40 mg mL  patent  U S  Patent No  9 155 776  However  on Aug 15  the PTAB found the company s petition against this patent ineligible for post grant review due to procedural reasons  Given the favorable rulings in the IPR against the  302   250 and  413 patents  the company will continue to challenge the  776 patent In fact  Mylan believes that it is one of the first companies to have filed a substantially complete abbreviated new drug application  which contains a paragraph IV certification for the 40 mg mL thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone  This makes the company eligible for 180 days of marketing exclusivity in the U S   subject to FDA approval As per IMS Health data  Copaxone  40 mg mL  generated annual sales of approximately  3 3 billion in the U S  as of Jun 30  2016  The latest favorable ruling also raises optimism  If everything goes well  the FDA approval of a generic version of Copaxone  40 mg mL  will be a huge positive for Mylan and boost the performance of the company s generics business MYLAN NV Price
    However  Mylan has been making it to the headlines for all wrong reasons in recent times  Of late  the company faced extensive criticism from all over  including U S  senators and Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  for over pricing its epinephrine auto injector  EpiPen 
Reeling under pressure from the issue  earlier this week  the company announced that it will launch the first generic to EpiPen at a list price of  300 per generic EpiPen two pack carton  This represents a discount of more than 50  to the list price  of the branded medicine  Mylan expects to launch the generic version in several weeks  pending completion of labeling revisions 
The company also announced that both the augmented patient assistance program and the  300 savings card that were announced late last week will remain in place for the branded product Mylan is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  A couple of better ranked stocks in the health care sector are ANI Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ANIP   and Geron Corporation   NASDAQ GERN    Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

197327,418843,MYL,Healthcare Back In The Spotlight ,opinion,"Although all sectors of the market are sensitive to government policy  healthcare is particularly so  One of the bellwether healthcare indices that we watch is the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  As the election season was getting underway in earnest earlier this year  it was an open question in our mind whether political noise about drug pricing would continue to put pressure on biotech  Since the candidates had both expressed concerns about drug pricing  perhaps they would focus on areas of greater disagreement and the industry would get less negative publicity  With several of our favorite biotech names approaching attractive price levels and with healthy growth still visible for them  we watched the political environment carefully  While the S P 500 rallied from stumbles earlier in the year  biotech continued to perform anemically 

It is safe to say that the verdict is in  the political pressure is not coming off healthcare  In recent weeks  we ve had a new dose of public outrage about drug pricing  this time focusing on the EpiPen injector manufactured by Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   NASDAQ  MYL   General uncertainty has risen as Aetna  NYSE AET   NYSE  AET  has announced its withdrawal from 11 of the 15 Affordable Care Act  ACA  markets where it had operated    with some analysts calling this withdrawal a  death knell  for the ACA in its current form  As we know  markets do not like uncertainty  With events underway that could require a significant reshaping of the U S  healthcare system yet again  no matter which candidate wins  this is probably a cautionary signal for investors no matter how attractive valuations may begin to look 
Still  we advise readers to work on their shortlist of attractive companies    based on events and fundamentals  We believe that although the long term landscape will include greater pressure on pricing  the regulatory environment will not quickly become one in which the U S  stops being the engine of global pharma and biotech discovery  Fear of price controls is here  actual price controls are far off  As the market begins to discount this reality  perhaps after the dust has settled from the election  many pharma and biotech stocks with good pipelines and strong management teams may present excellent buying opportunities 
We would like to draw readers  attention to one area specifically  biosimilars  We ve covered these drugs in the past    generic versions of the complex new biologic drugs that have provided so many of the last decade s transformative new therapies    Biologics  are large molecules  in contrast to small molecule chemical drugs  and can be extremely challenging to discover and manufacture   The regulatory landscape for these drugs is still being determined  Currently  biologics enjoy a 12 year period of exclusivity for their inventors  one key plank of Hillary Clinton s healthcare platform is the reduction of this period to seven years  which would open opportunities for companies that have the technical know how to produce biosimilars  A Clinton victory is therefore likely to be seen as a bane for many big biotechs  whose future revenues largely depend on the success of the new biologics in their pipelines  On the other hand  it could be a boon for such companies as Coherus Biosciences  NASDAQ  CHRS   Momenta Therapeutics  NASDAQ  MNTA   and AbbVie  NYSE  ABBV    CHRS and MNTA are a small biotechs specializing in biosimilars  ABBV is a large company with extensive experience in producing biologics which has invested heavily in developing biosimilars to challenge its rivals  
Investment implications   Healthcare isn t catching a break  Campaign rhetoric and negative newsflow continue to put pressure on the sector  as the prospect of further shake ups looms and presidential candidates rattle their sabers about drug pricing  Some healthcare stocks  particularly biotechs  have begun to approach attractive valuations  but we believe it s not time to pull the trigger yet  Investors should work on their buy list for the time when the market shrugs off its political anxieties and recognizes that price control fears have been premature  We think investors should look particularly at the biosimilar space as the regulatory environment around it takes shape  as well as focusing on proven biotech innovators with good pipelines and seasoned management ",2016-09-02,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/healthcare-back-in-the-spotlight-200151468,200151468
197340,418856,MYL,Biotech ETFs In Focus After Mylan s EpiPen Controversy,opinion,"It seems  from what Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   did on August 25  that finally the move against the  price gouging  by pharmaceutical companies won the battle to some extent  This is because Mylan NV indicated that it will reduce the cost of its EpiPen emergency allergy medication by about  amid heightened political pressure that was building up on the drug s steep price 
In particular  the drug company said that it would offer a  300  savings card  discount to patients purchasing a two pack of EpiPens  which actually have a retail price of around  
Why Mylan Offers Discounts 
The move came after the company faced intense scrutiny over the pricing of its popular allergy medication  The Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton especially  for the  exorbitant  price hike on EpiPen 
As per    a shot of epinephrine can literally be the difference between life and death  and  over the last several years  Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400   They re now charging up to  600 for a two EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12 18 months  This both increases out of pocket costs for families and first responders  and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers  read    
Clinton has been vocal against drug price gouging since last September  Her tweet at that time had come on the heels  price hike  in about two months  of a drug called Daraprim  used to treat malaria and toxoplasmosis  This gigantic leap in pricing action was taken by a privately held biotech company Turing Pharmaceuticals  read    
Apart from Clinton   were investigating EpiPen s price rises and demanded explanation from the drug maker for this hike  Various   experts and patients were also into the move against the  out of control  price increases of EpiPens 
How Important EpiPen is for Mylan  
Mylan bought the auto injectors in 2007  when the life saving drug generated  200 million in revenues annually  From there  EpiPen s revenues reached over  1 billion in annual sales and make up  40  of Mylan total sales  While sales volume does matter  price hikes played an important role in this staggering revenue 
How Mylan Move is Being Viewed Now  
Even after a 50  discount  the step is viewed as  a  more than a real remedy  by some  Though Clinton sees Mylan s effort positively  she also believes that  discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient   This is particularly true since Mylan has not altered the list price  This seems just a small act to stop the storm raging on Mylan  Notably  this discount will not hold good for people without  or for those with government insurance programs 
How Did Biotech ETFs React  
Mylan shares lost about 12 4  in the last tumultuous five days  as of August 25  2016   when protests against EpiPen s price hikes were intense  On Thursday  MYL shares were down about 0 7  
Most of the biotech ETFs were in the red on Thursday  Biotech ETFs that have sizable weight in Mylan were hammered  VanEck Vectors Generic Drugs ETF  puts 7 04  weight in Mylan and lost about 3 2  on August 25  read    
iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology    which has 3 84  exposure to Mylan  shed about 1 2  on the day  Another biotech ETF SPDR S P Biotech ETF  was down about 1 1  
The price gouging issue has been throttling the biotech space for long  We believe that this blazing issue will be a talking point over the coming days especially given the looming election and will continue to put biotech ETFs in focus  read

197341,418857,MYL,Here s How Drug Companies Justify Massive Price Hikes,opinion,"Prescription drug pricing remains firmly in the national spotlight this week after Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and other healthcare reform advocates called out Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV   for increasing the price of its popular EpiPen allergy medication by more than 400  over the past several years 
After a U S  Senator whose daughter relies on EpiPens called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate Mylan  Clinton took to social media to unveil her new plan to combat drug price hikes and demand that Mylan reduce the cost of EpiPens immediately 
In response  Mylan and CEO Heather Bresch unveiled a new plan Thursday that would help make EpiPens more affordable for some customers  The drugmaker will offer a savings card to patients who pay for the treatment out of pocket  and it will double the size of its patient assistance program  also read    
Not Good Enough 
Despite this announcement  Bresch and the company received widespread criticism for what many consider to be a rather weak justification for the price hike in the first place  In an interview with   Bresch said  No one s more frustrated than me  and placed the blame on a healthcare system that lacks transparency 
 This system needs to be fixed  No one knows what anything costs   Bresch said 
Bresch argues that the  608 price tag for a two pack of EpiPens  which has been cited by critics throughout the week  is a list price that results from the number of hands that the drug must touch before reaching the patient  and the company never intended for patients to be paying that list price 
According to Bresch  Mylan only nets  274 in sales for a pack of EpiPens  or  137 per pen  She would also note that Mylan s costs include  manufacturing the product  distributing the product  enhancing the product  investing  
Mylan s new discount program wasn t enough to convince Hillary Clinton  as campaign spokesperson Tyrone Gayle said that  Discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient  because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums  
Many were quick to agree with this criticism  citing the inefficiency of discount programs and questioning the legitimacy of Bresch s explanation for the price hike  Nevertheless  as we look further at the growing trend of massive price increases in the prescription drug market  we find that Bresch s answers becoming standard among industry executives 
Who s to Blame  
As Bresch pointed out  pharmaceutical companies are faced with extremely high costs associated with the production and distribution of drugs  The research and development process for new medications is costly and can take several years  Drugmakers also assume a certain level of risk while working on new treatments that could fail tests and never see the light of day 
This was the primary justification used by pharma bad boy Martin Shkreli after he received significant backlash from his own price hike scandal  Last year  Turing Pharmaceuticals and then CEO Shkreli grabbed headlines after the company bought 62 year old toxoplasmosis drug known as Daraprim and immediately increased its price from  13 50 to  750 per pill 
When asked why such an extreme price increase was necessary  Shkeli claimed that the drug was not profitable at that price and pointed to the benefits patients could receive from a better funded company 
 This is a disease where there hasn t been one pharmaceutical company focused on it for 70 years  We re now a company that is dedicated to the treatment and cure of toxoplasmosis  And with these new profits we can spend all of that upside on these patients who sorely need a new drug  in my opinion   he told  
In a way  Shkreli has a point here  and it definitely extends to other older drugs  Price increases in older drugs can go towards funding the development of a newer  more effective version of the treatment  or they can come as a result of the supply chain drying up over time 
Other than the common research and development argument  drugmakers tend to take the other route that Mylan and Bresch also used  many executives will argue that list prices are less relevant because companies offer extensive discounts to insurers  hospitals  and under covered patients 
As the Clinton campaign pointed out  these discounts are oftentimes paid for by other people in the chain and can result in higher premiums for everyone 
Bottom Line
With the number of U S  politicians targeting drug companies  it s pretty obvious that this issue has taken a political turn  and that does makes sense  At the end of the day  this is an inherently political issue and it challenges everyone s fundamental beliefs about regulation and the free market 
What is clear to see  however  is that prescription drugs tend to cost more in the U S  than in other developed nations  The reason for this depends on who you ask  but pharmaceutical executives have certainly fine tuned their justifications for price hikes over recent years

The number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits last week fell by 1 000 to 261 000 and remained near post recession lows  Claims fell below the key 300 000 threshold in early 2015 and have remained there for 77 straight weeks  the longest streak since 1970 
Orders for durable or long lasting goods made in the U S  surged 4 4  in July to mark the biggest gain since last fall  Higher demand for passenger jets led the way as expected  The Pentagon also put in a bunch of new orders  Stripping out the volatile transportation sector  orders rose a smaller 1 5   Still  that matches the biggest increase of the year 
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said Thursday she thought it was time to raise interest rates  George  who is a voting member of the Fed s policy committee this year  said she didn t know if anything would cause her to change her mind at the Fed s meeting next month  But she indicated that decision making remains data dependent  George has a hawkish track record  Still  she joins Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan  FOMC Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley on the list of Fed officials calling for rate hikes 
Fed chair Janet Yellen delivers a speech at Jackson Hole tomorrow  she is expected to address possible rate hikes  Fed Funds futures are currently predicting only a 53  chance of a rate hike in calendar year 2016  which  of course is only a bit higher than coin flip  So  given the current overbought condition and the complacency seen in many indicators  the bears tell us that stocks are now  set up  for disappointment if Ms  Yellen s speech takes on a more hawkish tone than expected tomorrow 
Central bankers sit down with their critics  In what is a first for the high profile policy conference at Jackson Hole  Wyoming  eight central bankers  including William Dudley  president of the New York Fed  will meet with 120 activists from the Fed Up Campaign  which wants to see change at the Federal Reserve 
Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  is responding to backlash over price increases for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment by promising to reduce the costs that some patients pay  though the drug maker stopped short of saying it would roll back prices or limit future increases  EpiPen is a lifesaving treatment for millions whose allergies can send them into severe shock  including many schoolchildren who are advised to keep an injector handy at all times  The price has increased 548  since 2007  After widespread criticism recently  Mylan will  double eligibility  for its EpiPen patient assistance program to 400  of the poverty level  saying that a family of four making  97 200 would now pay nothing out of pocket for a prescription 
What the discount does change is how much people with commercial insurance and a high deductible pay  If you were at on the hook for about  600 before  that will now be cut to about  300  For people without insurance  however  the card won t apply  they d fall under a separate patient assistance program  It also won t apply to people under government insurance programs such as Medicare or Medicaid 
Mylan CEO Heather Bresch  who happens to be the daughter of US Senator Joe Manchin  was making the rounds of TV business interviews today  trying to explain that there was nothing she could do about the price increases  she claimed the health care system is broken  she claimed she can t lower the price because there are many layers  or middlemen  each taking a cut along the supply chain  even if Mylan cut the price  it wouldn t result in lower prices for consumers  Well  she s partially correct   the health care system is broken  The rest is pure hogwash 
The cost of a two pack of EpiPens   shots of epinephrine that relieve symptoms from severe allergies that restrict breathing and can cause death   has risen from  103 50 in 2009 to  608 61 today  despite no changes in the chemical formula  Two vials of the proper dosage of epinephrine and manual syringes would cost only  20  some put the cost of the dosage in each EpiPen at as little as  1 
In 2012  the company behind the EpiPen settled a lawsuit by agreeing to allow a generic competitor into the market in 2015  potentially cutting into a big part of its business  Mylan had already been steadily increasing the price of EpiPen  an injector containing a drug that can save people from life threatening allergy attacks  After the settlement  it started to raise the price even faster  The increasing price hikes reek of a greedy last grab for profits and an attempt to subvert the court s ruling 
Bresch can lower the price  just as easily as she raised the price  or for that matter  even easier than the corporate  inversion  merger with Abbott Labs that moved Mylan s headquarters to the Netherlands last year  so the company could dodge US taxes 
Brazil s Senate has started the impeachment trial of suspended President Dilma Rousseff for violating budget laws  with the chances strong that she will be removed from office  Brazilian markets have rallied lately over the prospect of the Vice President Michel Temer permanently taking over from the Rouseff  although Temer was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits  a case that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years

197343,418859,MYL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Mylan  Teva Pharmaceutical  Lannett Company  BioSpecifics Technologies And USANA Health Sciences,opinion,"For Immediate Release 

Chicago  IL   August 29  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  N V      Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd       Lannett Company  Inc      BioSpecifics Technologies Corp     and USANA Health Sciences Inc      

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Forget Mylan  Buy These 3 Drug Stocks Instead

The healthcare sector has once again grabbed the spotlight due to exorbitant drug pricing  Generic drug maker  Mylan N V  s     shares crashed almost 12  after the company drew flak for over pricing epinephrine auto injector  EpiPen  which is approved for the treatment of severe allergic reactions 

Earlier this week  a couple of U S  senators raised questions about the company s massive price hike of EpiPen  While one of the senators asked for details of the massive price hike of the product in the recent years among other issues  another urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate into the company for a likely antitrust violation regarding the issue 

Mylan had acquired EpiPen from Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA in 2007  following which the product s cost has skyrocketed over 400   As per news reports  Mylan has hiked the price of a pack of two EpiPens from  100 in 2008 to the present level of  500  with some customers reportedly paying  600 or more 

Making matter worse  Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton even posted a tweet  saying  EpiPens can be the difference between life and death  There s no justification for these price hikes   Reeling under pressure from the issue  the company yesterday announced plans to improve access to EpiPen by expanding the existing programs for patients who are bearing the high expenses  Under this plan  Mylan will double the eligibility for its patient assistance program  which will slash out of pocket costs for uninsured and under insured patients and families 

Similar Controversies Faced by Peers

But Mylan is not the first company to come under scanner for overpricing drugs  While exorbitant drug prices and the lack of affordability of prescription drugs have always been there  price hiking suddenly came to the forefront late last year  Privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of Daraprim from  13 50 to  750 per pill in a single shot  thereby attracting public attention as well as criticism  The company had acquired the U S  rights to Daraprim from Impax Laboratories Inc  in Aug 2015 

The price increase didn t go down well with Hillary Clinton then either  whose  price gouging  tweet led to a major sell off in the healthcare sector  cutting short the phenomenal run of health care stocks  particularly in the biotech sector 

What s to Happen Next

It has been widely believed that lack of competition allowed Mylan to raise the price of EpiPen  Auvi Q has been off the markets since last October  while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd     failed to even receive an approval for its generic version of EpiPen earlier this year  On the bright side for Teva  the controversies surrounding Mylan could now push regulatory agencies to expedite the approval of generic versions of the drug 

Medical Sector Price Index



Against this backdrop  Mylan currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Here  we have picked three stocks using our   Not only do these stocks have a solid VGM score   V  for Value   G  for Growth and  M  for Momentum  of  B   but they also have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  

The VGM score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles  helping to identify those with the most attractive value  best growth  and most promising momentum  across the board  

Philadelphia  PA based Lannett Company  Inc     develops  manufactures  packages  markets  and distributes solid oral and extended release  tablets and capsules   topical  nasal  and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs  which target a wide range of therapeutic areas 

The company is also pursuing partnerships  research contracts and internal expansion for the development and production of other dosage forms including ophthalmic  nasal  patch  foam  buccal  sublingual  soft gel  injectable and oral dosages  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has seen its current year earnings per share  EPS  estimate move 11 64  higher over the past 60 days 

Wilbur Street Lynbrook  NY based BioSpecifics Technologies Corp      is a biopharmaceutical company that develops injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum for multiple indications  Injectable collagenase is marketed as Xiaflex in the U S  for the treatment of Dupuytren s contracture and Peyronie s disease by its partner  Endo International  This Zacks Rank  2 stock s current year EPS estimate has moved up by 9 29  over the past 60 days 

Headquartered in Salt Lake City  UT  USANA Health Sciences Inc      is focused on the development and manufacture of high quality  science based nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has seen its current year EPS estimate move up by 4 92  higher over the past 60 days 

Bottom Line

Regardless of macroeconomic events  drug pricing will remain in focus among policymakers  the media and the public  But instead of focusing on finding someone to take all the blame  emphasis should be on striking a balance between innovation and affordability  With all eyes on the healthcare sector  companies will now become increasingly cautious about drug price hikes  While Mylan attempts to recover from the recent setback  investors could consider these top ranked drug stocks  which also have a superb Style Score

197352,418868,MYL,Did Hillary Clinton s Tweet Cause The Sell Off In Mylan  MYL  Stock ,opinion,"Shares of pharmaceutical giant Mylan Inc    NASDAQ MYL   fell over 5 5  in afternoon trading Wednesday as the company faces increased scrutiny over the pricing of its popular EpiPen allergy medication  Interestingly enough  the sell off in Mylan stock seems to be caused by a tweet sent out by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 
At about 2 p m  EST  Clinton tweeted the following EpiPens can be the difference between life and death  There s no justification for these price hikes    H  Hillary Clinton   HillaryClinton  With her account s signature   H  marking to signify the message was coming from Clinton herself  the tweet linked to an expansive Facebook  NASDAQ FB  post wherein the former First Lady attacked Mylan and its recent price hikes on the EpiPen 
 Over the last several years  Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400   They re now charging up to  600 for a two EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12 18 months  This both increases out of pocket costs for families and first responders  and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers   Clinton wrote 
The current frontrunner in what is becoming an increasingly polarizing presidential race would go on to describe Mylan s behavior as  outrageous  and introduced her plan to address  exorbitant  drug price hikes  Clinton said her plan would require drug companies to explain significant price hikes and prove that additional costs are linked to better patient benefits and value  With that  she called on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens 
Although today s announcement was the first detailed plan to combat the issue  prescription drug reform has been on Clinton s platform for quite a while  In fact  this isn t even the first time one of her tweets caused a sell off 
Back in September of 2015  Clinton tweeted about price gouging in the specialty drug market  which sent biotech ETFS such as  and   LON FBT   tumbling  also read

197353,418869,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Listens To Critics  Will Make EpiPen More Affordable,opinion,"In response to widespread criticism  pharmaceutical company Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   announced Thursday that it will take several steps to make its popular EpiPen allergy treatment more affordable for some patients 
Mylan found itself in the crosshairs of many healthcare reform advocates this week  including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton  who used the EpiPen as an example of the aggressive pricing strategies that have become commonplace in today s pharmaceutical industry 
As Clinton pointed out  Wednesday  Mylan has increased the price of EpiPens more than 400  over the past several years  A standard two pack of the allergy medication now costs nearly  600 
In a   the drugmaker said it will provide an instant savings card worth  300 to any patient that currently pays full price for the drug out of pocket  This would represent savings of about 50  for patients without insurance or for those with high deductible plans 
Mylan also announced that it is doubling the eligibility for patient assistance to 400  of the federal poverty level  This means that a family of four making up to  97 200 would be eligible to pay effectively nothing for an EpiPen 
 We responded this morning  first and foremost  ensuring that everybody that needs an EpiPen has an EpiPen   Mylan CEO Heather Bresch told    As a mother I can assure you that the last thing we could ever want is no one to have their EpiPen due to price  
The company also announced that it will continue to offer its EpiPen4Schools program  which provides free epinephrine injectors to schools across the country  and it is opening a pathway for customers to purchase EpiPens directly from Mylan in the hopes of reducing costs 
The impact of today s decision on Mylan s earnings and revenue is still unknown  but the company definitely won an important public relations battle  As drug manufacturers continue to see increased scrutiny  patients could be the big winners if price cuts become a trend ",2016-08-25,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-(myl)-listens-to-critics,-will-make-epipen-more-affordable-200150095",200150095
197354,418870,MYL,Market Update   25 08 2016,opinion,"Currencies
EUR USD   even though the data out of the US wasn t good  the USD strengthened and we saw the pair extend the drop until late afternoon  when it started to correct slightly upwards  We have more data out of Eurozone and the US today  but as mentioned already a few times  tomorrow will be the main event  even though there won t be important data out of Eurozone tomorrow 
USD JPY   is still trading in an ever tighter range as we can expect a breakout of the pattern tomorrow  due to the important day Friday promises to be  We will start today with some US data  and then overnight we will have Japanese inflation data  to be followed tomorrow by the US GDP and afterwards the speech by FED Chair Yellen  
GBP USD    while the USD strengthened yesterday across the board  the major exception was against the GBP  It was trading lower in the morning  but as has been the case in recent days  in the course of the morning there is a turnaround and we see the pair move higher again  This morning we once more see a drop  so it will be interesting to see if we see the same thing happening again 
USD ZAR   moved sharply up as the inflation data out of South Africa was weaker than expected  as well as a strengthening of the USD  However  the main reason we moved up was the fact that is was reported that the South African Finance Minister could be rearrested again 
Indices
S P 500   saw the largest loss since the beginning of the month  as the USD strengthened  and also oil dropped further  In case Yellen s comments tomorrow will be interpreted as hawkish  we can expect the S P to drop further as that would bring a rate hike closer  At the moment the nearest support can be found around the 2167 level 

Commodities
Gold   moved sharply down yesterday and broke below the support whish was in place in recent weeks around the 1332 level and reached the lowest level since the last FOMC statement  Tomorrow we are expected to see a lot more volatility with the GDP data out of the US and the much anticipated speech by Yellen at the Jackson Hole Symposium  The big question is if she reiterates what several senior FED members have said in recent days  or if she strikes a different tone 
Oil   dropped after the inventories confirmed the API data that there was an increase in the inventories  albeit not as large as the API figure  Nonetheless  production dropped slightly compared to the previous week  which saw a large increase in production  Gasoline inventories also increased  while a decrease was expected  All of this contributed to a decline of the oil price  and in addition the USD also strengthened a bit 
Regarding the OPEC meeting next month  one other issue we have to take into consideration  besides the ones mentioned earlier this week  is that it was mainly Saudi Arabia which was against cutting production or freezing production in order to gain market share  With Saudi production at record levels  it remains to be seen how much more it can produce  so from that perspective a freeze makes sense  but that could move oil higher  which in turn would bring back US producers  When that happens  it is likely that this would hurt not only the oil price again  but also the Saudi market share  From that point of view  the best course of action from the Saudi perspective would be to not agree to an official production freeze  but rather a de facto production freeze

Teva   dropped sharply after Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  successfully fought Teva s patents on one of its flagship drugs   Copaxone  The fight is about the new dose for the drug  and so far Teva has lost 2 of the 4 rulings  although it has already said it would fight these ",2016-08-25,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-update-–-25-08-2016-200149925,200149925
197355,418871,MYL,US Markets  Jackson Hole Begins Today,opinion,"The Jackson Hole Symposium begins today with market participants curious to see if any indication on a September or even December hike in rates is on the cards  Will the momentum remain with the Bulls 
The Bears were happy to see the NASDAQ  S P 500 and DJ 30 all close down yesterday  when intraday trading on the NASDAQ had it on route to a consecutive nine day gain  The reason for this was a very powerful Tweet by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton saying that there was no justification for the high prices being charged for EpiPens by health care company Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  
This has us questioning if it really was the Tweet that did this or simply a lack of news in the market 
With some chief economists calling the Fed Symposium in Jackson Hole the most important event taking place all summer  the world s economists and investors will be watching this small ski resort in Wyoming with bated breath 
With the most powerful central banker in the world  Fed Chair Janet Yellen going to speak on Friday  the markets are unnervingly quiet  Is this the quiet before the storm 
Some analysts are expecting her to air on the hawkish side in her speech relating to Septembers meeting  We can see why this may be the case  but we aren t agreeing with them entirely 
If her past speeches are anything to go by  Chair Yellen never wants to take anything off the table  She may suggest that the employment and inflation targets have been hit  which could be seen as a signal to hike interest rates  but she has done this in the past without taking any action
Yellen knows that higher interest rates could seriously jeopardize what little growth the US economy actually has  And moving too early could be detrimental to the economy ",2016-08-25,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-markets:-jackson-hole-begins-today-200149949,200149949
197364,418880,MYL,Is A Surprise In Store For Inovio  INO  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INO   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 8  before the opening bell  In the trailing four quarters  Inovio s performance has been mixed with the company recording an average positive surprise of 180 15   While the company surpassed estimates on two occasions  it missed expectations in the other two 
In the last reported quarter  Inovio had posted a positive surprise of 52 17   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Inovio  a development stage biopharmaceutical company  is focused on the development of active DNA immunotherapies and vaccine treatments targeting various cancer forms and infectious diseases  VGX 3100 is the most advanced candidate in the company s pipeline  Following the successful end of phase II meetings both with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency  the company plans to commence a pivotal phase III study on the candidate for the treatment of HPV 16 18 related high grade cervical dysplasia  CIN 2 3  this year 
Apart from VGX 3100  Inovio has several other candidates in its pipeline in early  to mid stage development  Inovio along with its partner GeneOne Life Science gained approval for the initiation of a phase I study evaluating the Zika vaccine  GLS 5700  in Jun 2016  The first patient was dosed in the study late last month 
Meanwhile  in late Apr 2016  the company acquired all of Bioject Medical Technologies Inc  s assets  including the needle free jet injection technology  devices  and intellectual property for  5 5 million in cash and stock in a bid to further boost its needle free electroporation technology 
Inovio has collaborations with several companies and institutes for the development of its pipeline candidates  And with no approved product in its portfolio  Inovio depends largely on collaborations  grants and other payments for revenues as well as for the development of its pipeline candidates  Therefore  the top line at the company varies on a quarterly basis depending on the timing of such events 
Investor focus should remain on pipeline updates as a lot of pipeline related events are lined up along with the company s plans related to the development of its Ebola and Zika vaccines 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Inovio is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below

Zacks Rank  Inovio currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Inovio s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction uncertain

Catalyst has maintained an impressive track record so far  The company reported narrower than expected losses in two of the last four quarters  with a positive average surprise of 7 1   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Given that Catalyst does not have any revenue generating products in its portfolio yet  investor focus will remain on pipeline and regulatory updates  At present  Catalyst has three candidates under development   Firdapse  CPP 115 and CPP 109 
In Jun 2016  Catalyst reached an agreement with the FDA for a confirmatory phase III study protocol on lead candidate Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome  LEMS   The company was handed a  refusal to file  letter from the FDA in Feb 2016 in connection with its New Drug Application  NDA  for the product 
The agency had determined that the company s NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review  As part of the clinical protocol for the confirmatory study  the company plans to initiate a small  single center study on Firdapse in the second half of 2016 
Catalyst is also evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of certain types of congenital myasthenic syndromes  CMS  and a specific form of myasthenia gravis  The company has initiated an investigator sponsored phase II III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis  MuSK MG  in Feb 2016 and top line results from this study are expected in 2017 
Apart from Firdapse  the company is looking to develop CPP 115 for the treatment of epilepsy  initially infantile spasms   and other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette s disorder  Catalyst is also working on a generic version of Sabril  vigabatrin   which is marketed by Lundbeck  for the treatment of infantile spasms and complex partial seizures 
Consequently  its R D spending is expected to go up in 2016 due to clinical development efforts on Firdapse in the pediatric CMS population and MuSK MG

   What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Catalyst is likely to beat expectations this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand a loss of 8 cents

4 Buy Rated Stocks with High Earnings Yield

	Earnings yield is a useful ratio for investors who have exposure to both stocks and bonds  This ratio gains an upper hand on the more commonly used P E ratio as it facilitates comparison of stocks with fixed income securities  Interestingly  it is simply the inverse of the P E ratio 

	Earnings yield is calculated as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  If other factors are constant while comparing stocks  the one with a higher earnings yield has the potential to provide comparatively greater returns 

	Earnings yield can also be used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10 year Treasury yield  For instance  when the yield of the market index is more than the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be considered as undervalued than bonds  In this situation  investing in the stock market would be a better option for a value investor 

	However  bearing in mind the risk free nature of T bills  it would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the stock market 

The Winning Strategy

	We have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion  but it alone cannot be used for selecting stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen 

Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500  This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS Estimate with the 12 month Actual EPS 

Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000    High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 00 

Buy Rated Stocks    Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in any type of market environment 

	Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through the screen 

Korea Electric Power Corp       is an integrated electric utility engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution of electricity and development of electric power resources in South Korea  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 25  for the next 3 5 years 

Third Point Reinsurance Ltd       is a property and casualty reinsurance company based in Bermuda  The company carries a Zacks Rank  1  Its expected EPS growth rate for 3 5 years is 15

197390,418906,MYL,Mylan Beats On Q1 Earnings  Revenues Lag  2016 View Intact,opinion,"Mylan N V  s   NASDAQ MYL   first quarter 2016 earnings  excluding special items  of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Also  reported earnings escalated 9  from the year ago quarter  driven by higher revenues Revenues grew 17  to  2 19 billion  but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 26 billion  The top line recorded year over year growth on the back of solid revenue growth at the Generics segment 
Quarter in Details
Generics third party net sales  derived from sales in North America  Europe and Rest of World  soared 17  to  1 93 billion  Segmental third party net sales climbed 8  to  919 7 million in North America  While new product launches aided revenues  factors offsetting this increase were lower sales on existing products 
Third party net sales from the European market increased 45  to  587 7 million  The increase was mainly due to incremental net sales derived from established products as well as new products  However  higher volumes on existing products  primarily in France  were offset by lower pricing throughout Europe due to government imposed pricing reductions and competitive market conditions 
Third party net sales from Rest of World increased 10  to  420 8 million  Segmental performance was driven mainly by incremental net sales from established products and from certain female healthcare businesses acquired from Famy Care Limited  and to a lesser extent from new product launches across the region  Higher volumes in Japan and Australia also contributed to the increase  This was partially offset by lower pricing throughout the region and a decrease in third party net sales volumes from the anti retroviral franchise 
Beginning from the first quarter of 2016  the company reclassified sales from its Brazilian operation from the Rest of World region to the North America region  The amount reclassified for the three months ended Mar 31  2015  was about  10 2 million 
Third party net sales at the Specialty segment increased 17  to  247 9 million  Specialty segment sales benefited from higher volumes of EpiPen Auto Injector and higher sales of Perforomist Inhalation Solution 
Adjusted gross margin during the first quarter of 2016 expanded to 54  from 53  in the year ago quarter on the back of contribution from established products as well as new product launches  partially offset by decreased margins on existing products in North America 
2016 Outlook Maintained
Mylan reiterated its outlook for 2016  The company continues to expect earnings in the range of  4 85 to  5 15 per share  the midpoint of which represents a year over year increase of 16   while total revenues are expected in the range of  10 5 billion to  11 5 billion  the midpoint of which again represents a year over year increase of 16    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is  4 90 per share on revenues of  10 6 billion 
Meanwhile  Mylan is set to acquire Meda  a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company  in a deal worth  9 9 billion  The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016 
Our Take
Mylan s first quarter results were mixed with the company beating on the bottom line while missing top line estimates  Nevertheless  we are encouraged by double digit growth both at the Generics and Specialty segments  We are also positive on the Meda deal  We expect investor focus to remain on updates from the transaction  going forward 
Mylan is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector include Aegerion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AEGR    Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   and ANI Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ANIP    All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-beats-on-q1-earnings,-revenues-lag,-2016-view-intact-200127669",200127669
197391,418907,MYL,Key Healthcare Earnings For May 3  CVS  MYL  PFE,opinion,"As   more and more companies are starting to post their earnings results  On Tuesday  three big names in the healthcare industry reported their quarterly earnings before the bell  Let s take a look 
CVS Health Corp    NYSE CVS  
The pharmacy company  adjusted first quarter earnings per share of  1 18  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents and increasing 3 5  year over year  Net revenues were up 18 9  year over year to  43 2 billion  surpassing our consensus estimate of  42 9 billion  Thanks to balanced growth  CVS reiterated its full year 2016 guidance

197392,418908,MYL,Mylan  MYL  Beats On Q1 Earnings  Misses On Revenues,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   is one of the largest generics and specialty pharmaceutical companies in the globe  The company s product portfolio encompasses various therapeutic areas including cardiovascular  central nervous system  anti infective  gastrointestinal  endocrine and metabolic  and respiratory drugs 
Mylan continued to launch generic drugs in the first quarter of 2016  Meanwhile  the company is set to acquire Meda  a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company  in a deal worth  9 9 billion  The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016  Investor focus will be on updates from the Meda deal 
Mylan s performance has been decent with the company beating earnings estimates on two occasions  while posting in line results in one  Overall  the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 1 46  
Currently  Mylan has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but that could definitely change following the company s earnings report which was just released  We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just revealed announcement below

197393,418909,MYL,Momenta  MNTA  Reports Narrower than Expected Q1 Loss,opinion,"Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   reported a loss of 35 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016  narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents and the year ago loss of 40 cents 

Revenues surged 131 8  to  19 9 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  27 million 
The Quarter in Detail
Total revenue comprised product revenues of  14 8 million  and research and development revenues of  5 1 million  The company earned product revenues solely from Sandoz s sales of Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg   Since its launch in Jun 2015  Momenta has recognized  58 2 million in product revenues from Sandoz s sales of the drug 
We note that Sandoz s Abbreviated New Drug Application  ANDA  for the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone is currently under FDA review  The companies expect a tentative approval later in 2016 
The company did not earn any revenue from enoxaparin as no contractual profit was earned on Sandoz s net sales of the drug in the quarter due to a change in collaboration economics from a royalty payment to a 50  profit share  reduced unit sales due to a lower market share  and continued competitive pricing 
Research and development expenses were  28 7 million  up 26 4   reflecting higher expenses related to biosimilar and novel autoimmune drug programs  personnel related expenses  and expenses related to the necuparanib study 
General and administrative expenses were  15 6 million  up 98 3  due to higher personnel related expenses 
2016 Outlook
Momenta expects operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and net of collaborative revenues  in the range of  40 million to  45 million for each of the remaining quarters of 2016  lower than the earlier estimate of  45  55 million 
Pipeline Update
Momenta  in collaboration with Baxalta Inc    NYSE BXLT    initiated a pivotal study on a biosimilar version of Humira  M923  for chronic plaque psoriasis  Enrolment in the study was completed in Apr 2016  with data expected in the second half of 2016 or early 2017  The first regulatory submission is expected in 2017 and the first commercial launch in 2018 
Moreover  Momenta inked an exclusive global collaboration agreement with Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   in Jan 2016 to develop  manufacture and commercialize six of its current biosimilar candidates  including M834  a biosimilar version of Orencia  The companies received regulatory clearance in Feb 2016 and expect to initiate a clinical trial on M834 in the second half of 2016  Under the agreement  Momenta received an upfront payment of  45 0 million from Mylan in the reported quarter and expects to receive another  60 million in contingent payments later this year 
Meanwhile  enrollment is ongoing in the phase II trial on necuparanib  in combination with Abraxane plus Gemzar versus Abraxane plus Gemzar alone  in pancreatic cancer following the institution of a protocol amendment in Dec 2015  with data expected in the second half of 2017  Data from the phase I study on the candidate are expected to be published or presented at a medical conference in June 
On the other hand  the company s three novel autoimmune candidates are still in preclinical development  with one of them  M281  expected to enter the clinical stage in 2016  The company has received regulatory clearance to initiate a phase I dosing study on M281 in the forthcoming weeks 
Our Take
Momenta reported mixed results for the first quarter of 2016  with the company posting a narrower than expected loss but revenues missing expectations  On the earnings call  management stated that Glatopa has now captured nearly 35  of the once daily Copaxone 20 mg market  up from 30  at 2015 end 
We note that Glatopa sales have rebounded since the third quarter of 2015 as inventories were worked through  However  Teva has already switched approximately 75  of once daily Copaxone 20 mg patients to thrice weekly Copaxone 40 mg  Nevertheless  we are encouraged by the company s progress with biosimilars in its pipeline 
Momenta currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   is a better ranked stock in the healthcare sector  with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2016-05-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/momenta-(mnta)-reports-narrower-than-expected-q1-loss-200128025,200128025
197403,418919,MYL,Deal Making Mood Helped Equities Move Higher,opinion,"In an interesting development  I read this week that the Controller for the City of New York is upset at the fees their pension fund is paying because of a lack of performance  As someone who experienced the nonsense of this entity  my only thought is they made their bed  now they have to sleep in it  For a little more context  the fund is a monster  some  150 billion  and many large investors get contracts from it to manage different aspects of the porfolio  equities  bonds  real estate  private equity  hedge funds  infrastructure  etc  I was invited and did the obligatory work of submitting my information  Not a response or an email acknowledging my existence  thanks so much  The reality is for any fund less than a billion bucks  you are not on their radar  Still  performance is what matters in the investment world and their fund has not outperformed the indexes  which bothers the head honchos  I am sure it upsets the pension holders as well  Hard to think the fellows at Goldman  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   and Blackstone give a rip  though 


Finally  in the market this week  the deal making mood helped equities move higher  With Shell  LONDON RDSa  s agreed upon acquisition of BG Group  LONDON BG   Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  buying Perrigo  and GE announcing they would sell their financing operations to fund a large  50 billion buyback  spirits have turned optimistic  I would imagine that may change at some point  much like the tides of fortune in the great city of New York

197405,418921,MYL,Bonus Trade Idea  Perrigo Jumps Higher,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Perrigo  N PRGO  stock jumped higher in April when it was announced that Mylan  O MYL  was bidding for the company  This was not a friendly bid  and it has played out in a sue and countersue way ever since 
The chart shows the stock price popping on the initial news and then a Adam and Eve consolidation that failed to launch it higher  Instead  the stock fell back with the Healthcare sell off in late September  ending below the pre bid price  It has been basing there in a ascending triangle for 2 weeks  tightening against 162 as former support becomes resistance 
A break of the resistance to the upside would target a move to 174  A break to the downside  though  would look for a Measured Move lower to 130  The momentum indicators are more positive than negative  supporting the upside  The RSI is rising out of an oversold condition  while the MACD has crossed up 
There is a harmonic pattern in the price action as well  It is a bullish Bat harmonic  also known as a Cypher  This completed at the Potential Reversal Zone at 155 and triggered with the reversal candle the next day  This pattern calls for a retracement of 38 2  of the pattern or a move higher to 173 28 
There is resistance above 162 at 168 60 and 172 75 before 176 20 and 180  Support below stands at 152 and 147 50  Short interest is low at 1 7   and the company is expected to report earnings next November 3rd 
The options chains show an upward bias for this week s October Expiration  There is large open interest at 170 on the Call side and 165 and 170 on the Put side  Moving to the November Expiration  there is larger open interest on the Call side as well and above at the 190 and 200 Strikes  The 160 Strike is largest open interest on the Put side 
Perrigo
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 162 with a stop at 158 50  A simple stock purchase 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the October 160 170 Call Spread  offered at  3 40 late Friday   A defined risk way to participate 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the October 160 170 Call Spread and sell the October 155 Put   2 50   Capping return and adding leverage to the trade with a risk of owning the stock under 155 Friday 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the November 160 175 Call Spread   8 00  and sell the November 150 Put   3 40   Giving the upside more time in the levered trade with further downward protection 
Trade Idea 5  Sell the stock short on a move under 155 with a stop at 160  A straight downside trade 
Trade Idea 6  Buy the November 155 Put   8 20    Using defined risk to follow the stock lower 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into October Options Expiration week  sees the equity markets looking stronger  but they have not sent the all clear signal yet 
Elsewhere  look for gold to continue its short term uptrend  while crude oil does the same but might encounter resistance  The US dollar index has a short term bias lower for the week in the broad consolidation  while US Treasuries are biased lower short term as well  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue in consolidation  while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside 
Volatility looks to return to more normal levels  relieving the downward bias on the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts all show strength continuing into next week  but with the SPY the strongest followed by the QQQ and then the IWM on the longer term look  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

197419,418935,MYL,Pharma Buyout Continues  Will Mylan Inc Be Next  ,opinion,"The Pharma buyout bonanza continued Monday with the Covidien deal Sunday night  and it has many wondering which stock might be the next target  Some have speculated that Mylan Inc  NASDAQ MYL   could be it  That would be a coup for technical traders as the chart suggests it may be ready to run higher  Take a look 

Since the beginning of March Mylan has been pulling back from the all time high at 57 50  But the longer term support resistance zone between 45 50 and 46 50 has given it support  halting the fall 3 times  Each bounce ended at a lower high  creating a descending triangle pattern as price tightened around the S R zone  That was until Friday last week  On Friday it broke above that descending resistance and continued higher Monday  The target on the break of the triangle is to 61 50  I purposely drew this conservatively  Some would have been interested in a break over the faint blue line a more aggressive take on the triangle  For those that are still skeptical a jump over resistance at 52 will seal the deal with a higher high
