3406,224921,CARB,3 Growth Focused Cloud Stocks For Tech Investors To Buy For 2020,opinion,"The Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq all hit new intraday highs Thursday on the back of U S  China trade war positivity  This week  House Democrats also announced their support for the USMCA trade deal to replace NAFTA  Meanwhile  corporate earnings growth is set to return next year  which could help send stocks even higher in 2020 as U S  unemployment rests at 50 year lows 
With this in mind  now appears to be a good time for investors to search for stocks for 2020  One industry that seems sure to expand for years to come is technology  And within the broader tech space  cloud computing remains a growth heavy sector 
Most investors already know about the big players such as Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and its AWS  along with Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    IBM   NYSE IBM    Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    and other tech giants  Meanwhile  cloud based business services and software firms have expanded and it s not just Salesforce   NYSE CRM   that has grown rapidly amid the larger technological transitions for businesses and other enterprises   
With this in mind  we found three cloud focused software stocks using our that investors might want to consider buying for 2020 
Veeva Systems Inc    NYSE VEEV  
Veeva Systems offers cloud based solutions for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries  Veeva s software as a service model helps deliver industry specific tools for customer relationship management  content management  and many other enterprise applications  And Veeva topped our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings and revenue estimates in late November 
Peeking ahead  our current Zacks estimates call for the firm s full year fiscal 2020 sales to surge 26 5  to  1 09 billion  The company s fiscal 2021 revenue is then projected to jump another 27 3  higher to reach  1 39 billion  Both of these figures would top 2019 and 2018 s roughly 25  top line expansion 
At the bottom end of the income statement  the cloud company s adjusted FY20 earnings are expected to surge 33  to  2 17 per share  In a sign of continued expansion  Veeva s full year fiscal 2021 EPS figure is projected to climb another 17  higher to  2 53 a share 
VEEV shares have skyrocketed 155  over the last two years to crush its Internet Software Market s 15  average climb  Veeva is also up 60  in 2019 but it has moved mostly sideways during the last three months  This might actually set up a better buying opportunity for investors high on Veeva as it rests roughly 20  off its highs at the moment  VEEV holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but has seen its longer term earnings estimate revisions climb completely upward following its Q3 release 
Anaplan  Inc    NYSE PLAN  
Anaplan develops cloud platforms for business applications for everything from finance to supply chains  The goal is to help customers  of which it has more than 1 300 customers worldwide  improve their planning and decision making in real time  Anaplan topped our Q3 fiscal 2020 earnings and revenue estimates in November  with sales up 44  and subscription revenue up 47   The San Francisco  California based firm was also recently named to Deloitte s 2019 Technology Fast 500 list 
PLAN shares have climbed over 100  since the firm went public in October of 2018 and are up 90  in 2019  This crushed its Internet Software Market s average  which climbed only 16  this year  Like VEEV  Anaplan stock has slowed down  up 3 5  in the last three months to lag the S P 500 s 6  move  PLAN stock opened trading Friday at  50 29 per share  which is 17  off its highs and could give the stock more space to expand heading into 2020 and beyond 
Anaplan is still firmly in its growth phase and it is projected to report a full year fiscal 2020 loss of   0 48 per share  But this would come in far better than last year s   0 73 loss  with this positivity expected to continue next year  On top of that  PLAN has seen its longer term consensus earnings estimates surge recently to help it earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Anaplan s fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to jump over 44  to  346 8 million  with 2021 expected to come in 33  higher at  461 1 million        
Zuora  Inc    NYSE ZUO  
Zuora provides cloud based software on a subscription basis that aims to help firms transition to their own subscription focused models  The company hopes to capitalize on the rise of everything from Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   to Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE    Zuora s tagline is  The World Subscribed  and it sees the global economy transitioning more and more toward a subscription model  The firm has worked with everyone from cybersecurity firm Carbonite   NASDAQ CARB   to Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   
Mountain View  California headquartered ZUO  which was founded in 2007 and went public in the spring of 2018  works with over 900 companies and its revenue surged 40  last year  The stock hasn t impressed investors since its early surge  But Zuora has crushed our quarterly earnings estimates by an average of 25  over the trailing four periods  This includes a 33  Q3 earnings beat on December 5  when it also raised its current full year  2020  sales guidance 
Our current Zacks estimates call for ZUO s fiscal 2020 revenues to surge over 18  to  277 7 million  with 2021 projected to jump 20  higher to reach  332 million  Meanwhile  it is expected to post a much smaller loss this year    0 33 vs    0 55   with its 2021 loss projected to shrink to   0 19  Zuora is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that sports an  A  for Momentum in our Style Scores system 
ZUO is trading under  15 per share  which marks a 40  discount compared to its 52 week highs  Plus  the beaten down stock is trading at 4 9X forward 12 month sales estimates  which marks a discount against its industry s 5 7X average  Therefore  Zuora might be a  cheap  tech stock to take a chance on for 2020

3417,224932,CARB,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Catabasis  Ligand  Key  Carbonite And Second Sight,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 19  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Catabasis Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ CATB    Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ LGND    Key Energy Services Inc    NYSE KEG    Carbonite Inc    NASDAQ CARB   and Second Sight Medical Products Inc    NASDAQ EYES   Rising P E an Overlooked Criterion  5 Top StocksTrying hands at bargain stocks that have a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a common practice  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore the stock has room to run But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why this often overlooked approach may go a long way to reap some solid returns for you Why Rising P E is a Valuable ToolInvestors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some solid positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on strong fundamentals Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump more than 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable

3418,224933,CARB,Carbonite  ComScore  Micron Technology  Guess And Williams Sonoma Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   March 21  2019    Carbonite   NASDAQ CARB   as the Bull of the Day  comScore   NASDAQ SCOR   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Micron Technology   NASDAQ MU    Guess   NYSE GES   and Williams Sonoma   NYSE WSM   
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 
 
Carbonite is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and it has a Growth Style Score of A  so you know that it is on my radar screen   I am like aggressive growth stocks and this one fits the bill   Let s see why in this Bull of the Day article 
Description
Carbonite Inc  is a computer service company which provides online backup solutions for consumers and small and medium sized businesses to retrieve files if lost on the internet  The Company s backup solutions work automatically and continuously uploading encrypted copies of its customer s files to the servers known as Carbonite Personal Cloud  Carbonite Inc  is headquartered in Boston  Massachusetts 
Recent Earnings
CARB beat expectations back on Feb 7  when the company reported EPS of  0 45 which was  0 03 ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Revenues were just a little shy of expectations at  77M but that was still good for nearly 25  annual growth 
Guidance was soft  with next quarter looking at  77M    78M when the consensus was calling for  80 4M   That is the sort of thing you don t want to see 
The end result was the stock was crushed following the report  down as much as 19  that day and  more than 16  for the week of the earnings report 
Buy That Dip
So here is the rub  the stock gets beat up and the estimates for this quarter fall by four cents and by a penny for next quarter   That is basically all the damage as the 2019 number fell by 5 cents 
The 2020 number  however  is up from  1 90  60 days ago to  1 99   So in the short term we have some falling estimates but the long term has them rising 
That sets up for a perfect dip for investors to be confident to buy 
 
comScore is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and checks in with an F for the Value Style Score and a D for the Growth Style Score   The company posted a beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate on  February 28  but it is now the Bear of the Day   Let s take a look at why that is the case 
Description
comScore  Inc  is a global leader in measuring the digital world  This capability is based on a massive  global cross section of more than two million consumers who have given comScore permission to confidentially capture their browsing and transaction behavior  including online and offline purchasing  comScore panelists also participate in survey research that captures and integrates their attitudes and intentions 
Through its proprietary technology  comScore measures what matters across a broad spectrum of behavior and attitudes  comScore analysts apply this deep knowledge of customers and competitors to help clients design powerful marketing strategies and tactics that deliver superior ROI  comScore services are used by global leaders such as AOL  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Yahoo   NASDAQ AABA   Verizon  NYSE VZ   Best Buy  The Newspaper Association of America  Tribune Interactive  ESPN  Fox Sports  Nestle  MBNA  Starcom USA  Universal McCann  the United States Postal Service  Merck and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  
Recent Earnings
Although the chart show that SCOR beat earnings  I see other data that suggest that SCOR missed in a big way   I see a loss of  0 46 compared to an expected loss of  0 21 on the bottom line 
Revenue of  109M was good for 6  growth and topped the  104 8M estimate 
Prior to this report  Zacks shows that SCOR missed the prior three quarter with an average negative earnings surprise of 52  
Estimates
The estimate data on the detailed estimate page is not fully functioning at the moment  but I do see that there were negative revisions over the last 30 and 60 days 
If you look at the agreement section  you can see there were negative earnings estimate revisions for this quarter  next quarter and for the full year 
Valuation
Without a positive earnings number  there is no PE  but I do see a 2 3x book multiple which is where value players should be happy   They tend to like a book multiple below 3x   A price to sales multiple of 3x is fairly rich considering the low growth profile 
Margins are negative  but they are moving in the right direction   That said  SCOR will likely not post positive earnings this year or next

Micron  MU  Posts 1st Miss in Years  Plus GES  WSM
Boise  ID based semiconductor producer Micron Technology posted fiscal Q2 2019 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday  And  for the first time since we re calibrated earnings surprises going back to Q2 2015  accounting for stock based compensation   Micron missed estimates on the bottom line  earnings of  1 71 per share was shy of the Zacks consensus by 2 cents  while revenues in the quarter of  5 84 billion was beneath the  5 92 billion analysts were looking for 
There was some concern that Average Sale Prices  ASPs  would be weaker in the quarter  especially with economic weakness being experienced in Asia over the time period 
Shares have not been negatively impacted in late trading following the earnings release  up roughly 0 30   but considering MU stock has traded up about 30  from the beginning of the year and didn t get hammered on the miss  I m sure they ll take it  Micron had been a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  rated company with a Style Score  Value   Growth   Momentum  of A 
Guess  shares are getting hammered in off hours trading following its Q4 earnings release where the company also missed on top and bottom lines  earnings of 70 cents per share missed the Zacks consensus of 76 cents  while quarterly revenues brought in  837 million  under the  840 million and changed we were predicting  Shares are down 7  at this hour  to the lower part of the company s medium term range 
Williams Sonoma also posted Q4 earnings results Wednesday afternoon  taking out both estimates on both top and bottom lines   2 10 per share  adjusted  topped the  1 97 we had been expecting  on  1 84 billion that beat the  1 80 billion consensus  The company also announced a quarterly dividend hike of 11 6   to 48 cents per share  and a  500 million share buyback program 
Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential
The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases

3419,224934,CARB,Get Over Bargain Hunting  Tap 5 Stocks With Rising P E,opinion,"Bargain hunting or looking for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is among the widely used investing strategies  Investors believe that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But there is more to this whole P E story as not only low P E  stocks with a rising P E can also fetch solid returns 
Rising P E  An Useful Tool
Generally  the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings  As forecasts for expected earnings move higher  demand for the stock should drive its price  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out for every dollar of earnings  Thus  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company s inherent strength 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 20 
Here are five of the 20 stocks

3425,224940,CARB,Should Value Investors Consider Carbonite  CARB  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Carbonite  Inc    NASDAQ CARB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Carbonite has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 54  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 43  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Carbonite s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past three years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Computer   Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 91  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Carbonite has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 09  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Carbonite stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Carbonite has a P S ratio of about 1 52  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 25 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  CARB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Carbonite currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Carbonite a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Carbonite is just 0 40  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 89  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio comes in at 6 36  which is lower than the industry average of 15 38  Clearly  CARB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Carbonite might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B  This gives CARB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the current year estimate has seen three upward revision compared to one downward in the same time period  This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 2  in the past two months  while current year estimate has increased by 2 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Carbonite  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Carbonite is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 14  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Computer   Services industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure

3426,224941,CARB,How Carbonite  CARB  Stock Stands Out In A Strong Industry ,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Carbonite  Inc    NASDAQ CARB    This is because this security in the Computer   Services space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Computer   Services space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 28 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Carbonite is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term Carbonite  Inc  Price and Consensus   In fact  over the past three months  current year estimates have risen from  1 87 per share to  1 96 per share  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is also a favorable signal You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Carbonite  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-carbonite-carb-stock-stands-out-in-a-strong-industry-200472387,200472387
3432,224947,CARB,Rising P E An Overlooked Criterion  5 Top Stocks,opinion,"Trying hands at bargain stocks that have a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a common practice  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore the stock has room to run 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why this often overlooked approach may go a long way to reap some solid returns for you 
Why Rising P E is a Valuable Tool
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some solid positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump more than 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to the previous year
 These two criteria point to a positive or flat earnings growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 This criterion indicates that a 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just nine

3437,224952,CARB,5 Toxic Stocks To Abandon Or Sell Short For Gains,opinion,Investors who can precisely differentiate between overpriced stocks and fairly priced stocks emerge winners  However  in this complicated market place  these two types of stocks are intertwined in such a way that it is very tough to identify them  Investors who can pick the toxic stocks appropriately and abandon them at the right time are likely to benefit Generally  the overblown toxic stocks are susceptible to outside shocks and are loaded with high levels of debts  Also  the price of the toxic stocks is unrealistically high  The irrationally inflated price of the toxic stocks is only short lived in nature as their intrinsic value falls short of the current hyped price The overhyped price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock  Owning such stocks for a long period of time is detrimental and may lead to huge erosion of wealth On the other side  investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  figuring out toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to protect your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average  High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the

3441,224956,CARB,Get Nice Earnings Surprises With These 5 Top Stocks,opinion,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season  every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
Meanwhile  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market projection  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks That Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that raise the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat  per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity  we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to seven 
Here are five out of the seven stocks 
PlayAGS Inc    NYSE AGS    This is a designer and supplier of electronic gaming machines and other products and services for the gaming industry  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks sector  top 38    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

3444,224959,CARB,Play Potential Earnings Beat With These 5 Top Stocks,opinion,"There is no mystery to investors  hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential ahead of an earnings season  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Locate Potential Outperformers

There is no mystery to investors  hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential ahead of an earnings season  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Locate Potential Outperformers  
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release

Nasdaq   NASDAQ CARB       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Toxic Stocks to Discard or Sell Short for ProfitInvestors who can accurately distinguish between overpriced and rightly priced stocks emerge as winners at the end  However  in this tricky market place  these two types of stocks are inter mixed in such a way that it is very tough to differentiate them  Investors who can appropriately spot toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are likely to gain Generally  the overhyped toxic stocks are exposed to external shocks and are burdened with high amount of debts  Also  the price of the toxic stocks is unreasonably high  The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as their intrinsic value is lower than the current bloated price The overblown price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some deep rooted drawbacks in the stock  Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time may result into huge erosion of wealth On the other hand  investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  pointing out toxic stocks and removing them at the right time is the key to safeguard your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average  High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50  A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and

3449,224964,CARB,4 Stocks To Watch  CARB  ESPR  CATM  PZZA ,opinion,"Carbonite Inc  NASDAQ CARB  exploded out of the coil that has been forming for five weeks  jumping 1 35  or 6 8   to 21 15  on 882 381 shares traded  and closed at the upper end of the range on Wednesday  That s the biggest volume in about a month  It looks to me like it s headed higher  My targets are 24  28  and eventually 30 plus 
Esperion Th  NASDAQ ESPR  has made an incredible move since we gave you the swing on it  going straight up five waves  It s at resistance  it filled a gap  and I think it s going to get a pullback shortly  It ran up to my target at 35 on Wednesday  gaining 2 69  or 8 6   to 34 02  on 1 5 million shares traded  I wouldn t be too aggressive here  but it does have momentum still 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Cardtronics Inc  NASDAQ CATM  continues to form a distinct looking bear flag after a precipitous drop  and a counter rally  which is a very narrow sign  On Wednesday  it was down 17 cents to 44 56  on 374 329 shares traded  and looks like it s headed to 41  and change  and then it may drop into the high 30 s 
Papa John s International Inc  NASDAQ PZZA  has had four negative days in a row  and on Wednesday  it had another down day  so that makes five days in a row  It was down 18 cents to 76 26  on 236 029 shares traded  I m still looking for a test of the 73 area  and if it gets through that  then look for a precipitous drop to the low to mid 60 s

3450,224965,CARB,Carbonite Founders Have Moved On  Investors Should Too,opinion,"Carbonite Inc   NASDAQ CARB  was once at the forefront of a new industry  but commoditization of its core product and lack of innovation has resulted in management s attempt to re invent the company through acquisitions  Profit growth expectations embedded in the stock price are likely unfeasible in light of current financial performance and formidable competitive challenges 
We think execution risk is high and the probability of upside to already high expectations is low  The firm lacks a clear competitive advantage amidst a sea of well established rivals  Carbonite is this week s Danger Zone pick 
Carbonite Background
Carbonite offers cloud based data storage and back up solutions to businesses and consumers  CARB was among the first to offer cloud back up services to the masses and went public in 2011 at  10 share  Since the IPO  the proliferation of cloud storage options and lack of timely innovation has resulted in the loss of first mover advantage and a deteriorating competitive position 
CARB s legacy consumer data back up business is in decline  The company is now repositioning itself through acquisitions to target the business continuity and disaster recovery markets  The two original founders remain on the Board of Directors  but their focus appears to be on outside endeavors  The duo has raised capital for a cloud data storage start up  called Wasabi  to compete directly against Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS  
Slowing Growth Gives Way To M A
CARB has grown revenue 24  compounded annually since 2012  Over 60  of this growth  in dollar terms  has come since the end of 2015 by way of two acquisitions  which totaled  80 million in deal value  Revenue growth had slowed to 11  in 2015 before jumping to 52  in 2016 and 29  over the trailing twelve months  TTM  
Most recently  revenue growth slowed to 10  in 2Q17 vs  2Q16  This increase was mainly driven by the recent Double Take Software acquisition  Without this acquisition s  5  6 million quarterly revenue contribution  per company guidance   it appears CARB generated little to no organic revenue growth over the TTM 
Figure 1  CARB s Revenue Growth   NOPAT Margins
 
 Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Profits Remains Illusive
CARB has not achieved consistent profitability since going public  The company posted a break even 0  NOPAT margin in 2014  Profitability then swung between  7  and  2  NOPAT margins over the next two years  CARB s current NOPAT margin has dipped to  2   TTM  due to expense growth  2Q17 total expenses increased 23  vs  2Q16 while 2Q17 revenue increased only 10  vs  2Q16 
In addition  free cash flow  FCF  swung to   76 million TTM from  10 million in 2016 due to the decline in NOPAT and capital investment in acquisitions 
Per Figure 2 below  management s focus on non GAAP metrics creates an illusion of profitability  Specifically  management s definition of  non GAAP net income per share  allows for the exclusion of  purchase accounting adjustments  stock based compensation  litigation expenses  acquisition expenses  intangible amortization  non cash convertible debt interest expense  and the tax effect of non GAAP adjustments at a 13  effective rate 
Removing so many expenses relevant to the operations of the business  especially with the new acquisition driven strategy  is suspect 
Figure 2  Non GAAP EPS vs  Economic EPS

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Poor Return On Invested Capital
CARB s return on invested capital  ROIC  has averaged  5  over the past two years  The current ROIC of  9   TTM  is in the bottom quintile of our coverage universe and well below the median 5  ROIC generated by 230 companies in the software and services sector 
The main impediment to higher ROIC is NOPAT margin as the balance sheet is relatively efficient  CARB s capital turnover ratio  revenue divided by invested capital  is 2 6 compared to an average of 1 3 for the software and services sector  For the company to earn an adequate ROIC above the cost of capital  it would need to earn a 3  NOPAT margin on TTM revenue without growing invested capital 
This hurdle appears manageable given the software sector s median 5  NOPAT margin  However  a low single digit profit margin provides little room to maneuver  while invested capital seems more likely to balloon than remain flat given the investment in new business lines and acquisition driven strategy 
Executive Comp Aligned with Misleading Metrics
We know from numerous case studies that changes in ROIC are directly correlated to changes in market value  Accordingly  we favor compensation plans that use ROIC to measure performance to ensure executives  interests are aligned with shareholders  interests  Revenue and non GAAP performance targets can be an incentive to sacrifice profitability for volume  or worse  engage in acquisitions that destroy shareholder value 
CARB management focusses exclusively on non GAAP in their presentation of company performance and to determine executive compensation  CARB s compensation structure consists of base salary   20    incentive cash bonus   30   and equity incentives   50   
Incentive cash bonuses are based on non GAAP metrics such new bookings  50    renewal bookings  25   and adjusted free cash flow  25    Equity incentives are intended to align executive s interest with shareholders  but the shares vest based solely on stock price performance 
While the stock has done fine during the tech stock bull market  the company has generated   38 million of economic profits over the past five years  Until CARB aligns its compensation plans with financial goals that actually constitute profits  we are not optimistic that shareholder value destruction will come to an end on its own 
Competitive Landscape is Daunting
There are at least 50 competitors within the consumer data back up and protection market  These companies fall into two main categories  a  the cloud services of industry giants such as Amazon  AWS   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   iCloud   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   GoogleDrive  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   OneDrive   and b  significantly smaller independent companies seeking to differentiate themselves through product customization and customer service  The largest and most visible of these independent competitors include  Backblaze  Box  CrashPlan  DropBox  iDrive  Mozy and SOS  Each of these competitors offers products comparable to CARB in terms of capability and pricing 
Competition for consumer business among smaller firms  where discounted promotions are the norm  is fierce  CARB currently offers computer back up plans from  59 99 year  BackBlaze offers computer back up plans for  5 month  iDrive currently offers the first year of computer back up plans for 90  off  or  6 95  iDrive has won PC Magazine editor s choice award in the category for three consecutive years  iDrive currently receives a 4 5 out of 5  Excellent  rating compared to 3 5  Good  for Carbonite 
The industry giants  integrated cloud services have commoditized the consumer market to the point where firms such as CARB have been forced to adapt by developing enterprise service platforms  We believe CARB has been slow to adapt to this new competitive reality  Competitors such as Box  Inc   BOX  are far ahead CARB in the enterprise market despite the two firms being founded in the same year  BOX has business relationships with 64  of Fortune 500 companies and a co selling agreement with Microsoft  Competing directly against Amazon is already a lost cause in light of AWS s rapid growth to  12 billion in revenue 
Disaster recovery and business continuity seem to be maturing into distinct markets  but they remain difficult to quantify and separate from the  50 billion expected to be spent by 2018 in the overall Cloud Professional Services market  According to one study  the disaster recovery as service market  DRaaS  is estimated to grow to  12 billion in 2020 from  1 4 billion in 2015  While there is demand to fuel growth in this market  there is no shortage of well established competitors  such as  International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM   Vmware  NYSE VMW   Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   FTI Consulting  NYSE FCN  and Sungard Systems  private  
CARB lacks a clear competitive advantage at either the consumer or enterprise end of the cloud services market  The company has all but ceded the consumer data back up segment   50  of revenue  to competitors  This consumer surrender is evident in guidance for  10  0  growth in consumer segment revenue and recent acquisitions which are entirely enterprise focused  This re positioning effort is likely to require investment that will prevent near term improvement in lagging profitability metrics 
Per Figure 3 below  CARB s NOPAT margin and ROIC rank near the bottom of a peer group that comes mostly from CARB s annual Proxy statement  These thin margins give CARB little margin of safety against adverse business conditions or capacity to invest for future growth with diluting investors with outside capital 
Figure 3  Competitive Advantage Not Apparent for CARB

Considering The Bull Case
The bull case depends on CARB successfully repositioning from providing consumer cloud backup to providing disaster recovery and business continuity solutions to small medium sized businesses 
To establish an enterprise services presence  CARB purchased EVault assets from Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  and Double Take Software from Vision Solutions  private   EVault assets were purchased from STX for just  14 million  Double Take s  65 purchase price was 73  less than the  242 million Vision Solutions paid in 2010  Developing these relatively small investments in discarded assets into an edge over well established competitors strikes us as a longshot  The current stock price implies it s a high likelihood 
Bulls assume that synergies from recent acquisitions will cause revenue to accelerate while expense growth moderates  It is far from certain that recent acquisitions will bring the advertised revenue synergies  We also believe the competitive landscape will prove too challenging for CARB to back off expenses  CARB is more likely to be forced to spend aggressively in the near term to integrate acquisitions and pursue revenue opportunities  Under this scenario  reaching the profitability levels implied by current market expectations seems very unlikely 
Potential Catalysts
As noted above  we believe the near term investment required for CARB to reposition from consumer to enterprise is likely to prolong the current period of losses  As such  we believe that earnings expectations for next year  currently  1 00 share  are far too high and likely to be revised lower as actual earnings are reported 
Market participants have shown themselves to be more than willing to fund operational losses that drive high revenue growth rates  however  Revenue growth  however  is where we believe CARB will truly disappoint investors 
As noted previously  we argue that CARB s organic revenue growth in 2Q17 vs  2Q16 fell to near 0  excluding the revenue contribution of Double Take Software  If the consumer segment was operating within negative 10  to 0  growth guidance and the enterprise segment was growing in line with  bookings  growth of 20  30   then CARB s organic revenue growth  excluding Double Take  should have been 5  15  in 2Q17  not 0  
Given the intense competition on the consumer side and the company s too little too late entry into enterprise services  we believe that revenue growth is a high risk of disappointing over the coming year 
High Expectations Embedded In Stock Price
CARB shares have risen 16  YTD and 46  over the past year to outperform the S P 500   9  YTD   13  1Y   This appreciation occurred  despite the steep YTD decline in NOPAT  due to speculation that the company can successfully re invent itself  Market expectations for 2017 profits  i e   consensus EPS   have increased 33  over the past year to  0 75 per share  However  this estimate reflects company defined  non GAAP EPS  which excludes a host of real costs  For comparison   non GAAP EPS  has totaled  0 50 over the trailing twelve months compared to economic EPS of   0 26 
To justify its current price of  19 share  CARB must grow NOPAT by 11  compounded annually for the next 19 years  This scenario assumes CARB grows revenue to  910 million  from  220 million TTM  or 8  compounded annually  This scenario also assumes the NOPAT margin improves to the sector median of 5    2  TTM   Achieving this scenario seems highly unlikely given that the consumer half of the revenue base is in decline while the enterprise half has yet to display evidence of sustainable growth at levels consistent with investor expectations 
Even if we assume CARB can grow NOPAT 18  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is still worth only  13 50 today   a 29  downside risk  This scenario assumes CARB grows revenue to  533 million  or 10  compounded annually  This scenario also assumes an improvement in NOPAT margin to 5  
Each of these scenarios assumes CARB is able to grow revenue  NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets  This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create optimistic scenarios that demonstrate just how high expectations embedded in the current valuation really are  For reference  invested capital increased from  39 million in 2012 to  86 million TTM  or 19  compounded annually 
Assessing Acquisition Risk
The largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call  stupid money risk   which means a strategic buyer acquires CARB at a higher price despite the stock already being overvalued  In our view  CARB is not currently an attractive acquisition target due to its questionable competitive position and lack of consistent free cash flow 
We begin assessing acquisition value by adjusting for liabilities that would make an acquisition more expensive than accounting numbers suggest  For CARB  these liabilities equal 7  of market cap 

 24 million in off balance sheet operating leases
 15 million in outstanding stock options 

After adjusting for hidden liabilities  and baking in meaningful revenue growth and margin synergies  CARB is worth less than its current share price even in the most optimistic scenario  As shown below  an acquisition of CARB above the current price is possible only if the acquirer is willing to destroy shareholder value 
Figure 5 assumes an acquirer s ROIC hurdle in an acquisition of CARB is equal to the software sector s 6  weighted average cost of capital  WACC   Even if an acquirer can grow CARB s revenue 20  compounded annually and operate at a 5  NOPAT margin over the next five years  the stock is currently overvalued by 18   Any deal that only achieves a 6  ROIC would likely be value neutral and not accretive given the software sector s average WACC of 6

Figure 5 assumes an acquirer s ROIC hurdle in an acquisition of CARB is 8   or the software sector s WAAC plus a 2  economic profit margin  An acquisition of CARB at these prices could be accretive to a firm with a 6  WACC  assuming the revenue and margin synergies come to pass  Even in the best case scenario  an acquirer would destroy  240 million in shareholder value purchasing CARB at its current valuation  The most an acquirer should pay for CARB is  11 share  41  downside

CARB does not pay a cash dividend  The company does have a repurchase authorization in place through May 2018 with  5 2 million of the original  30 million authorization remaining  No shares were repurchased in 2Q17 following the repurchase of 767 000 shares for  15 million in 1Q17  At the current price of  19 share  the remaining authorization amounts to 1  of outstanding shares and a 1  potential shareholder yield 
While heavy 1Q17 repurchase activity appeared to lift the stock  going forward CARB offers little of the downside protection that a solid shareholder yield can provide  Given the level of risk we see in the valuation and forward expectations  this protection could be sorely missed 
Insider Trading And Short Interest
Insiders own 16  of outstanding shares  Insider activity has been universally on the sell side over the past year  The last significant insider buying occurred in early 2016 when the stock was trading at  6  7 share  Short interest is currently 2 9 million shares  equating to 13  of the float and 7 days to cover  The number of shares sold short has increased significantly from 1 2 million shares at year end and 320 000 shares a year ago

3451,224966,CARB,5 Toxic Stocks To Abandon Or Sell Short For Profit,opinion,Investing success hinges upon precise identification of overpriced stocks and fairly priced stocks  But the overhyped toxic stocks and the rightly priced stocks are intermixed in the market place in such a way it becomes very tough to differentiate between them  Investors who can correctly spot toxic stocks and abandon them at the right time are likely to gain Generally  toxic stocks are vulnerable to external shocks and are loaded with high amount of debts  Also  price of the toxic stocks is irrationally high  The unjustifiably high price of the toxic stocks is only temporary as their intrinsic value is lower than the current bloated price The inflated price of toxic stocks can be either due to an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks in the stock  Owning such stocks for an inordinate period of time may lead to huge loss of wealth On the other hand  investors may gain from the precise identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  spotting toxic stocks and abandoning them at the right time is the key to safeguard your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the

3534,225049,CARB,Endure Market Volatility With These 5 Low Beta Stocks,opinion,The notion that risky securities bring on attractive returns holds true in bull markets  In a bear market  investors will witness exactly the opposite as their portfolio returns are less than the market  In this article  we develop an idea that investors can use to reap solid returns from less risky stocks if they take into account some other investing parameters Understanding of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta in the range of 0 to 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in the volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to

3535,225050,CARB,3 Stocks To Watch After Donald Trump s Debate Performance,opinion,"Last night  the first of the three presidential debates witnessed a high octane face off between Democrat ex Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Donald Trump  As the discussions traded barbs and skeptical anecdotes  it displayed two starkly different personalities and their visions for the nation    The debate also served as a precursor to the likely changes in the framework of the government policies and offered a broader hint to the impending changes in the financial markets as a whole and the stock market in particular  Investors across the globe have already started to weigh the pros and cons from the one on one political rendezvous to fathom its effect on various industries  Let us also take a closer look at the broad takeaways from the debate to identify potential game winning stocks  should Trump emerge as the victorious candidate in the Presidential election Focus on DefenseIn order to combat the barbaric terrorist acts and radical extremist groups like the Islamic State  Trump has urged to increase the defense expenditure for a bigger Army and Marine Corps  improved missile defense systems and more ships and fighter jets  At the same time  he has pledged to end the across the board budget cuts known as sequester to increase funding for future defense needs Trump is widely viewed as not being risk averse and is likely to advocate an aggressive foreign policy that showcases military strength  Such an oblique reference was also made in the debate when Clinton highlighted the episode wherein Trump wanted the U S  forces to fire on Iranian boats that had taunted them In such a scenario  high tech defense and aerospace equipment manufacturers like AAR Corp    NYSE AIR   are likely to benefit in the long run  Wood Dale  IL based AAR Corp  provides various products and services to the aviation and defense industries worldwide  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has a  of B  You can see  AAR CORP Price

   Cyber Security ThreatsDespite several disagreements  both Trump and Clinton were unanimous in their concerns for cyber security threats faced by the country  The U S  federal government is arguably the largest producer  collector  consumer and disseminator of data in the world  This makes government contractors ideal targets for cyber attacks as they are entrusted with sensitive information related to national security secrets  military and critical infrastructure  and personal information of all U S  citizens and residents The incessant cyber attacks and related security risks offer a great investment proposition for the global cyber security market  In addition  a broad proliferation of smartphones and other hand held devices make cyber security threats a potent weapon for businesses  While cyber security spending by federal agencies will mostly revolve around the development of cyber weapons  cyber defense products and services  corporate firms will primarily seek to develop technologically robust products and services for the IT domain and equipment  This would include continuous upgrade of technology and skills to counter technological obsolescence  Consequently  cyber security stocks like Carbonite  Inc    NASDAQ CARB   gain immense prominence  Headquartered in Boston  MA  Carbonite is a leading provider of hybrid backup and recovery solutions for businesses  This Zacks Rank  1 stock offers a comprehensive suite of affordable services for data protection  recovery and anywhere  anytime access  Carbonite has long term earnings growth expectation of 30  CARBONITE INC Price

   Stress on Fossil FuelsDuring the debate  Trump made an oblique reference to the now bankrupt solar company Solyndra and termed the federal investment in it as a failure  Earlier in his campaign  Trump had promised to repeal a host of energy and environmental regulations  save the coal industry and lift restrictions on energy sales  Specifically  he vouched to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency rules that limit carbon emissions from power plants  known as the Clean Power Plan  the EPA s Waters of the U S  rule  which brings more water bodies under federal protection  and an Interior Department moratorium on new coal leasing on federal lands Although such promises are challenging to fulfill  they have given a fresh lease of life to the beleaguered coal industry stocks like Hallador Energy Company   NASDAQ HNRG    Based in Denver  CL  Hallador is engaged in the mining  production  and sale of steam coal for the electric power generation industry in the U S  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has a VGM score of B HALLADOR ENERGY Price

   Moving ForwardScott Fidel  an analyst of Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   perfectly summed up   Investors often tend to fear the unknown more than anything else  In the 2016 elections  Donald Trump represents the specter of the unknown to a larger degree than any leading presidential candidate in our lifetime   Nevertheless  various presidential campaigns and debates have offered a broad overview of the policy framework of Trump and its likely effect on various industries  Until a clearer picture emerges in the future  investors could be well off if they invest in these stocks that are backed by a solid Zacks Rank and healthy fundamentals Confidential  Zacks  Best Investment Ideas  Would you like to see a hand picked  all star  selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks  trading and investing services  Steve Reitmeister knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-after-donald-trump's-debate-performance-200155854,200155854

3583,225098,CARB,5 Toxic Stocks To Discard Or Sell Short For Profit,opinion,Investors who can accurately distinguish between overpriced and rightly priced stocks emerge as winners at the end  However  in this tricky market place  these two types of stocks are inter mixed in such a way that it is very tough to differentiate them  Investors who can appropriately spot toxic stocks and discard them at the right time are likely to gain Generally  the overhyped toxic stocks are exposed to external shocks and are burdened with high amount of debts  Also  the price of the toxic stocks is unreasonably high  The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only transitory in nature as their intrinsic value is lower than the current bloated price The overblown price of toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some deep rooted drawbacks in the stock  Owning such stocks for a long stretch of time may result into huge erosion of wealth On the other hand  investors may gain from the accurate identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  pointing out toxic stocks and removing them at the right time is the key to safeguard your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average  High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50  A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5  Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold   We have not considered Buy rated
