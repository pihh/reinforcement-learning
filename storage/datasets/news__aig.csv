The global death toll from the new coronavirus is now at 813  higher than that of SARS 
There will also be important testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  who appears Tuesday and Wednesday before congressional panels on the economy and monetary policy

There are also U S  retail sales figures for January  which investors will be eyeing for further signs on the strength of the American consumer 
In earnings  there are 68 S P 500 companies reporting results in the week ahead  as the earnings season on Wall Street starts to wind down 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Coronavirus Headlines
China reported an additional 89 deaths on Sunday  bringing the total number of people killed by the fast spreading coronavirus to 811 in the mainland  The global death toll for the new coronavirus currently stands at 813  including one death in the Philippines and another in Hong Kong 
That number exceeds the global number of deaths from SARS  which killed at least 774 people and infected 8 096 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003  according to data from the World Health Organization 
The National Health Commission said on its website that 2 656 new cases were confirmed as of end Saturday  This brings the total number to 37 198 in mainland China 
Hubei province  the epicenter of the outbreak  accounts for most of the deaths and cases around the world 
The cumulative number of deaths in the province reached 780 after an additional 81 deaths were recorded as of end Saturday  The Hubei Provincial Health Committee said there was an additional 2 147 new cases  bringing the total of confirmed cases to 27 100 
The Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday after the coronavirus outbreak forced an extended holiday  although numerous stores and factories will remain shut and many white collar employees will continue working from home 
The toll on China s already slowing economy has been heavy  with Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4  from 5 6  previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible 
2  Fed Chair Powell Testifies
 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC 
Powell is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 00AM ET  1500GMT  Tuesday  On Wednesday  he will appear in front the Senate Banking Committee  also at 10AM ET 
Text of the testimony will be released 90 minutes before he starts speaking 
The Fed chair is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold given the labor market continues to tighten and private consumption growth remains solid 
3  U S  Inflation 
The Commerce Department will publish January inflation figures at 8 30AM ET  1330GMT  Thursday 
Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0 2  last month  according to estimates  matching the increase seen for December  On a yearly base  CPI is projected to climb 2 5   up from 2 3  a month earlier 
Excluding the cost of food and fuel  core inflation prices are forecast to have gained 0 2  last month and 2 2  over the prior year 
Rising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently expected  Weakening inflation will likely add to expectations that the U S  central bank will need to slow its pace of rate hikes 
4  U S  Retail Sales
 
The Commerce Department will release data on retail sales for January at 8 30AM ET  1330GMT  Friday 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 3  last month  after rising at the same pace in December  Excluding the automobile sector  sales are also expected to increase 0 3  
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth  while weaker sales signal a declining economy  Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70  of U S  economic growth

Results from Restaurant Brands International  Allergan  NYSE AGN   and Loews  NYSE L  will capture the market s attention on Monday

172851,394367,AIG,AIA Can Withstand Hong Kong Visitor Hit,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Turbulent times should mean good business for insurers as people try to protect themselves against the hazards of an uncertain world  Hong Kong s summer of unrest has proved anything but happy for shares of AIA Group Ltd   the city s biggest seller of policies  The company may prove more resilient than investors are giving it credit for 
AIA has slumped more than 16  from its July 19 peak  among the worst performers on Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index in that period  The insurer has the third highest weighting in the benchmark after  HSBC Holdings  Plc  LON HSBA  and Tencent Holdings Ltd   which have both lost less than 9  over the same time frame  AIA s steepening decline is unusual for a stock that has mostly seen steady gains since it was spun out of American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   after the financial crisis in 2010 
Blame the Hong Kong protests  Anti government demonstrations have led to a precipitous fall in mainland Chinese visitors to the semi autonomous city  These tourists are an important source of business for Hong Kong insurers  whose dollar based products offer a hedge against the falling yuan and a route outside China s restrictive capital controls  Chinese tour groups to Hong Kong for the Golden Week holiday starting Oct  1 are set to  plunge 86  from a year earlier  Jinshan Hong and Qian Ye of Bloomberg News reported last week  citing the city s Travel Industry Council 
Policies sold to mainland visitors accounted for 26  of total new premiums received from individuals in the first six months of 2019  according to Hong Kong s Insurance Authority  While AIA sells insurance across Asia  Hong Kong contributed 40  of its new business value in the first half  Michael Chang of CGS CIMB Securities Ltd  reckons  Of this  mainland Chinese visitors accounted for 20   Chang estimates 
The physical presence of customers in Hong Kong is important because  unlike most financial assets  the city s regulators require insurance to be sold face to face  at least to new clients  AIA   Prudential   LON PRU  Plc and China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co   a state controlled company based in Shanghai  are among the most reliant on mainland visitors  according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Lam 
There s more to AIA s China exposure than sales made in Hong Kong  though  The company s new business value in China surged 26  in the first half to account for 29  of AIA s total  Demand for insurance is surging in the mainland as incomes rise while health and retirement systems remain under developed 
Until recently  AIA had failed to make much headway in a market that s dominated by state behemoths such as China Life Insurance Co   despite being the only foreign insurer allowed to operate without a partner  thanks to roots that stretch back to 1919  when AIG was founded in Shanghai   That may be starting to change as the government  under pressure from slowing economic growth  opens its financial markets further to overseas companies 
This year  the government loosened regulations that restricted AIA to five geographical regions  Beijing  Shanghai  Shenzhen and the provinces of Jiangsu and Guangdong  The insurer has now moved into new provinces and started selling policies in Tianjin municipality and in the city of Shijiazhuang in Hebei province   German insurer Allianz SE  has been given the green light to set up the first wholly foreign owned insurance holding company in the country  
In any event  the collapse in Chinese visitors to Hong Kong is likely to ease even if the protests continue  Investment linked insurance products denominated in the Hong Kong dollar   which is pegged to the greenback   offer a perennial hard currency allure for mainland individuals with few opportunities to diversify at home  Insurers in the city also sell policies denominated in the U S  dollar itself  AIA s new business value in Hong Kong jumped 19  in the first half 
The slide in AIA stock has taken its price to embedded value to 1 9 times  from a peak of 2 4 times at the end of June  That s still a premium to rivals such as Ping An Insurance  Group  Co   at 1 3 times  and China Life at 0 5 times  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Prudential  weighed down by its exposure to the slower growing U K  market  trades at 0 7 times embedded value  Still  19 of 22 analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate AIA stock a buy  with only one sell recommendation 
This slump looks to have limits ",2019-09-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/aia-can-withstand-hong-kong-visitor-hit-1988707,1988707
172852,394368,AIG,Brexit may spur more deals in legacy general insurance policies,news,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON  Reuters    Britain s impending departure from the European Union is creating expansion opportunities for specialist general insurers who buy up and manage policies closed to new customers 
Whether Britain leaves the European Union without a deal or under a so called hard Brexit  British insurers selling policies into the EU will need a local subsidiary  and vice versa 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that Britain and the EU had agreed a new Brexit deal  but he still faces resistance from other parties in parliament 
If a Brexit deal is finally agreed it will give insurers more time to set up EU subsidiaries  but domestic focused and smaller firms are reluctant to do this because of the cost 
Another option for those insurers is to end their overseas operations and sell books of legacy business to a specialist insurer 
European insurer Darag   which specializes in buying closed books   has set up in Britain this year  and expects Brexit related deals  The firm  which now has seven UK employees  has already had enquiries  its chief executive Tom Booth told Reuters 
Chris Fagan  CEO of insurer Catalina  another closed book specialist  also told Reuters that Brexit could have a positive impact for his firm 
 Brexit is causing EU insurers to look at their structures and this brings non core lines into focus  leading to opportunities for the acquirers   said Andrew Ward  a director for insurance deals at PwC 
Fortitude Re  a vehicle set up by U S  insurance group AIG  N AIG  with investment from private equity firm Carlyle to house AIG s closed books  is also planning to buy or reinsure other closed books and expand into Europe  four sources told Reuters  AIG declined to comment 
There are nearly  800 billion in closed books of non life insurance globally  including  300 billion in Europe  according to PwC  Around  9 billion changed hands across 34 publicly announced deals globally in 2018  the consultants said in its first annual deals report 
Closed book specialists take over old policies or reinsure them  reducing risk for the insurers 
The specialists say they can use economies of scale to manage them more efficiently  Some also invest more of the policies in alternative asset classes to increase returns 
 There is a reasonable margin to be made in this area of insurance   Stephen Roberts  chairman of the Insurance   Reinsurance Legacy Association  said 
Outside the life insurance sector  insurers are usually keenest to offload books of business where claims may still be have to be paid years after an event 
The sector started off with asbestos related business  but books of business sold these days include motor  medical malpractice and also employers  liability  taken out by companies to cover compensation for work related accidents or illness 
Zurich Insurance  S ZURN   for example  transferred UK employers  liability policies totaling  2 billion to specialist insurer Catalina in Dec 2018 
Lloyd s of London s decision last year to tell its members to ditch the worst performing 10  of their business has led to a number of closed book deals  including in poorly performing insurance classes such as marine 
They include specialist insurer Riverstone s takeover of policies from Lloyd s syndicate Advent Underwriting in January 2019

172853,394369,AIG,Hong Kong firms  lacking riot insurance  pick up pieces from protest damage,news,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim
HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong s businesses will likely foot the bill for vandalism inflicted over the past four months during the territory s most violent protests in living memory as few of them bought insurance coverage for riot damage  industry insiders said 
Businesses big and small have suffered smashed windows  graffiti and even fire for their perceived support of mainland China by activists concerned that the central government in Beijing is exerting increased control over the special administrative region at the cost of democratic freedoms 
Displaying a banner in support of the police   who protesters have complained of being heavy handed   was enough to see a small video game shop in western New Territories vandalized four times this month 
 I don t know whether I ll get insurance compensation   said shop owner K K  Man   There s a chance that I won t get compensation because the damage is due to social unrest    I don t think riot damage is covered  
While businesses flood insurers with claims for such damage  few are likely to be fully compensated as Hong Kong insurance usually protects against events such as fire and natural disasters  such as typhoons 
Coverage for civil unrest  particularly for small and mid sized firms  is uncommon  industry insiders said 
Hong Kong is a lucrative market for global insurers including American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   AXA SA  PA AXAF  and Zurich Insurance Group AG  with the value of premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product at 18 16   second only to Taiwan in the Asia Pacific region 
Total insurance premium volume in the territory last year rose 8 3  to  66 billion  the quickest growth rate in the advanced Asia Pacific region that includes Australia  Japan and Singapore  a Swiss Re study showed 
Near term  Hong Kong insurers expect a surge in demand for coverage that includes riot damage  though profit is likely to suffer from payouts for event cancellations  a drop in demand for travel insurance and  more generally  economic downturn 
 Overall financial damage from these events will be quite significant and neither insurers nor most of the businesses would have prepared for something like this   said an insurance sector lawyer with a global law firm 
 So you will see a sharp rise in litigation around what s covered and what s not  as well as pressure on earnings of insurance companies because of a surge in claim settlements and a drop in premium income   the lawyer said 
The financial impact of the protests could not be determined with unrest ongoing  but two insurance executives said liabilities for insurers could run into millions of dollars 
The executives and the lawyer declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter

Anti government demonstrations have taken place on almost every weekend since June 9  On Sunday  riot police and protesters exchanged tear gas and petrol bombs as an illegal march descended into chaos  with hundreds of shops trashed and Chinese banks and metro stations targeted 
Retailer Best Mart 360 Holdings Ltd on Wednesday said as of Oct  13  59 of its stores had suffered damage during protests 
 The Group is discussing and handling with its insurance company   it said   In the event that the insurance company refuses to compensate or inadequately compensates its claims  the Group may be required to bear the corresponding economic losses  
Best Mart did not identify its insurer or elaborate on why compensation might be refused  An external spokeswoman for the retailer declined to comment beyond the statement 
Damage to subway stations of operator MTR Corp Ltd may not be fully covered by its insurance  and its inability to recover such costs is likely to weaken its credit profile  credit rating firm Moody s Investors Service said last week 
MTR declined to comment

China ahead of any public offering and plans to bolster its non life business in Asia  its chief executive said  as a potential shake up looms in the region s insurance sector  FWD  controlled by Richard Li  the entrepreneur and son of Hong Kong s richest man Li Ka shing  made headlines earlier this month with the  3 billion purchase of Siam Commercial Bank s life insurance unit in Thailand  just days after agreeing to buy the Hong Kong operations of U S  insurer MetLife Inc  NYSE MET    a deal worth about  300 million  according to a person familiar with the matter  Having spent more than  6 billion on half a dozen deals in the last six years  FWD has built up a presence in Hong Kong and Macau  Singapore  Japan  Thailand  Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  and Vietnam  FWD has applied for a license to operate a majority owned joint venture in China  the world s No 2 insurance market  which  according to a Swiss Re Institute report  is forecast to account for 20  of global premium by 2029  up from 11  in 2018   It would be good to have China  but having a growth story in ASEAN  Association of Southeast Asian Nations   having a stable profitability in Japan  having a strong base in Hong Kong will be pretty compelling   said CEO Huynh Thanh Phong  while discussing the potential for an initial public offering  IPO   Huynh refused to be drawn on the timing of any IPO  saying it was for the board and shareholders to decide  But separately two people with knowledge of the plans said FWD was aiming for the second half of next year   depending on progress in China  ASIAN BATTLEGROUND Billionaire Li laid the foundation of FWD in 2012 with the acquisition of ING s Hong Kong  Macau and Thailand units for  2 1 billion and has continued this bolt on approach since   If you look at a typical life insurance setup  you can either grow organically in five to seven years or you do bolt on acquisitions to shorten that time frame   Huynh  who joined FWD in 2014 a year after its formal launch  told Reuters    Insurance  M A in Asia is very limited  and  we have to be very opportunistic   he said  identifying India  where the company is looking for a potential partner  and Australia as other markets FWD is interested in  The Asian market  worth  1 7 trillion in premiums  is expected to account for 42  of global premiums by 2029 from about a third currently  the Swiss Re Institute report showed   Not many leading Asian insurance firms need to plug product or geographical gap via acquisitions  so it s a good time to be a buyer if you have the capital and the reason to do deals   said a M A banker  who advised FWD on one of its deals  Asia is also bracing for the spin off of the international businesses of the UK s  Prudential   LON PRU   led by its Asian business boasting 15 million life insurance customers and  117 billion in assets  according to its 2018 annual report  The spin off will give Prudential Asia unit access to more capital which could be used for acquisitions  investment bankers have said  FWD FINANCES Compared with regional giants such as AIA and Prudential  FWD is still small  its five million customers give it  30 billion in assets  according to the company  compared with  230 billion for AIA  Besides Li  other minority shareholders in FWD include Swiss Re  which came on board with a 12 3  stake in 2013  Singapore wealth fund GIC  and Chinese private equity firm Hopu Investments  FWD has so far used a mix of equity and debt to finance its acquisitions  said the two sources cited earlier  Huynh said the company s shareholders were  very supportive  about its expansion and the company was  very financially disciplined   but declined to give specific details about its leverage   Speculation about its IPO plans or other funding options have grown as FWD has expanded  Earlier this month  ratings agency Moody s cut it outlook to negative from stable after the acquisition of the MetLife Hong Kong business  Fitch also put the company on  rating watch evolving  citing uncertainty about the impact of the acquisition on the company s capital  debt service capabilities  and financial flexibility  FWD Life HK  which accounts for nearly half of the group assets and is the ninth largest life insurer by premium in Hong Kong  has doubled its revenue since its launch and was at  2 billion in 2017  according to a July 10 Moody s report  Hong Kong  Thailand and Japan are its top three markets in terms of customers  In Japan  where it launched in 2017 with the purchase of the life insurance business of American International Group  NYSE AIG   new business premiums rose 39  to  378 million last year  The same measure in Thailand dropped 10  to  198 million  according to company documents seen by Reuters   NON LIFE PUSH FWD s next round of acquisitions is expected to be focused on non life insurance business  which covers automobile  real estate and travel insurance  said Huynh  FWD is  actively looking  for non life insurance businesses in Southeast Asia to compliment existing operations in Hong Kong and Singapore  Huynh said  adding life insurance would remain a dominant part of its business

 The trade war is now intensifying and it s possible that a currency war will start as well   said Chris Zaccarelli  Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance   Neither is good for the global economy and both will hurt equity markets  
President Trump said the yuan slide is  called  currency manipulation   and indicated he d like the Federal Reserve to act to counter the Chinese action  Swaps show bets the U S  central bank will ease by 100 basis points by December 2020  a quarter point more than what was priced in after last week s cut 
The trade war has been a consistent catalyst for market volatility and hopes of a resolution are now being sent even further out in the horizon  according to Mike Loewengart  vice president of investment strategy at E Trade Financial Corp  While that could continue to challenge portfolios  investors should not make the mistake of trying to time the markets amid the sell off  he said 
 This too shall eventually pass  and bouts of volatility in recent months have shown this can happen quickly   said Loewengart

172912,394428,AIG,Alibaba plans bumper  20 billion HK listing to boost investment war chest  sources,news,"By Kane Wu  Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu HONG KONG  Reuters     Alibaba   NYSE BABA  is considering raising as much as  20 billion through a listing in Hong Kong  people familiar with the matter told Reuters  lining up a second blockbuster deal following its 2014 record  25 billion float in New York  The deal  the biggest follow on share sale in seven years globally  would give Alibaba a war chest to keep investing in technology   a priority for China as growth flags and as the world s second largest economy is locked in a mounting trade spat with the United States  The e commerce giant is working with financial advisers on the offering and is aiming to file an application confidentially in Hong Kong as early as the second half of 2019  three people said on condition of anonymity as the plans are not public yet  While advisers and others close to the deal downplayed any trade war reasoning for the move  analysts said the context and geography could not be ignored   For Chinese companies listed in the United States  one has to prepare a contingency plan   said Hao Hong  head of research at broker BOCOM International    Given most of the Alibaba investors are in Asia  it makes sense to come closer to your home base and give investors an option to trade in the same time zone    Last week  Chinese chipmaker SMIC said it was delisting its New York shares in favor of focusing on its Hong Kong listing   Sources with knowledge of Alibaba s plans cautioned that many details were not yet clear  including the final planned size  One person with direct knowledge said it was more likely to be between  10 billion and  15 billion   At  20 billion  Alibaba s deal would be the sixth biggest follow on share sale ever  Refinitiv data shows   It would rank behind NTT s 1987  36 8 billion sale  crisis era offerings of  24 4 billion and  22 5 billion from the Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS  and Lloyds Banking Group  LON LLOY   and the  20 7 billion raised by U S  insurer AIG  NYSE AIG  in 2012  A spokesman for Alibaba declined to comment  SoftBank Group  Alibaba s largest investor  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The Japanese tech investor has a 28 8  stake  worth  115 7 billion  in Alibaba after it sold a small part of its original holding via derivatives to fund its acquisition of chip designer ARM in a transaction that completes next month  SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son is a close friend of Alibaba founder Jack Ma  Bloomberg was the first to report the plan for a Hong Kong listing   ADDED LIQUIDITY  Since its U S  listing  Alibaba has nearly doubled in size to become the largest listed Chinese company with a market value of more than  400 billion   A Hong Kong listing would give mainland investors their first direct access to one of China s biggest success stories  via the stock connect trading link between Hong Kong  Shanghai and Shenzhen   It would also give the company an extra pocket of liquidity and potentially a better valuation if the household name became a favorite among retail investors in Hong Kong   A Hong Kong based analyst said while Alibaba is not in need of cash  the listing could help it improve its access to loans from Asian banks   It means closer access to Chinese investors  and maybe Chinese investors are more bullish than the global investors in Alibaba   the analyst added   Rival Tencent  which is listed in Hong Kong  is trading at 26 times its expected earnings compared with Alibaba s 22 times in New York  according to Refinitiv data  A Hong Kong listing for Alibaba would come as its 54 year old founder prepares to step down as chairman in September  handing over the mantle to CEO Daniel Zhang  The company is also expanding into new sectors including cloud computing division and Hema  its chain of brick and mortar supermarkets as growth in its core e commerce business slows  The listing would provide Alibaba with additional capital to fund its new and expensive initiatives  said James Hull  founder of Hullx capital and co host of the China Tech investor podcast   Alibaba has strong and growing free cash flow  but they re also pursuing cash hungry new initiatives   he added   HOMECOMING An Alibaba float would be seen in Hong Kong as a victory  after the city lost the tech giant s initial public offering to New York because its then rules precluded it accepting Alibaba s governance structure  where a self selecting group of senior managers control the majority of board appointments  Any big listing would also be a bonus to the city s traders    With such a big market cap  it will enhance the daily trading volume  and  attract more funds into the market   that s exciting many investors   said Steven Leung  a director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong  Trading in Alibaba shares averaged  2 2 billion a day in the first quarter of this year  according to Refinitiv data  compared with the total average daily turnover on the Hong Kong exchange of  12 9 billion in the same period   Hong Kong amended its rules last year to make it easier for  innovative companies  already listed in New York or London to sell shares in Hong Kong  as part of a broader shake up of the city s listing regime  The new rules allow companies based in greater China to list in the city even if their current weighted voting rights structures contravene Hong Kong s rules for primary listings   Such companies can also apply confidentially for a listing  as Alibaba is expected to do

172920,394436,AIG,Exclusive  OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma exploring bankruptcy   sources,news,"By Mike Spector  Jessica DiNapoli and Nate Raymond  Reuters    OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is exploring filing for bankruptcy to address potentially significant liabilities from roughly 2 000 lawsuits alleging the drugmaker contributed to the deadly opioid crisis sweeping the United States  people familiar with the matter said on Monday   The potential move shows how Purdue and its wealthy owners  the Sackler family  are under pressure to respond to mounting litigation accusing the company of misleading doctors and patients about risks associated with prolonged use of its prescription opioids  Purdue denies the allegations  arguing that the U S  Food and Drug Administration approved labels for its opioids carried warnings about the risk of abuse and misuse associated with the pain treatments  Filing for Chapter 11 protection would halt the lawsuits and allow Purdue to negotiate legal claims with plaintiffs under the supervision of a U S  bankruptcy judge  the sources said   Shares of Endo International Plc and Insys Therapeutics Inc  two companies that like Purdue have been named in lawsuits related to the U S  opioid epidemic  closed down 17 percent and more than 2 percent  respectively  on Monday   More than 1 600 lawsuits accusing Purdue and other opioid manufacturers of using deceptive practices to push addictive drugs that led to fatal overdoses are consolidated in an Ohio federal court  Purdue has held discussions to resolve the litigation with plaintiffs  lawyers  who have often compared the cases to widespread lawsuits against the tobacco industry that resulted in a  246 billion settlement in 1998   We will oppose any attempt to avoid our claims  and will continue to vigorously and aggressively pursue our claims against Purdue and the Sackler family   Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said  Connecticut has a case against Purdue and the Sacklers  BANKRUPTCY FILING NOT CERTAIN  A Purdue bankruptcy filing is not certain  the sources said  The Stamford  Connecticut based company has not made any final decisions and could instead continue fighting the lawsuits  they said    As a privately held company  it has been Purdue Pharma s longstanding policy not to comment on our financial or legal strategy   Purdue said in a statement    We are  however  committed to ensuring that our business remains strong and sustainable  We have ample liquidity and remain committed to meeting our obligations to the patients who benefit from our medicines  our suppliers and other business partners   Purdue faces a May trial in a case brought by Oklahoma s attorney general that  like others  accuses the company of contributing to a wave of fatal overdoses by flooding the market with highly addictive opioids while falsely claiming the drugs were safe   Last year  U S  President Donald Trump also said he would like to sue drug companies over the nation s opioid crisis  Opioids  including prescription painkillers  heroin and fentanyl  were involved in 47 600 overdose deaths in 2017  a sixfold increase from 1999  according to the latest data from the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Purdue hired law firm Davis Polk   Wardwell LLP for restructuring advice  Reuters reported in August  fueling concerns among litigants  including Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter  that the company might seek bankruptcy protection before the trial   Companies facing widespread lawsuits sometimes seek bankruptcy protection to address liabilities in one court even when their financial condition is not dire  California utility PG E Corp filed for bankruptcy earlier this year after deadly wildfires raised the prospect of large legal bills even though its stock remained worth billions of dollars   DECEPTIVE MARKETING Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in June became the first attorney general to sue not just Purdue but Sackler family members  Records in her case  which Purdue has asked a judge to dismiss  accused Sackler family members of directing deceptive marketing of opioids for years while enriching themselves to the tune of  4 2 billion   Some other states have since also sued the Sacklers  The Sacklers are currently discussing creating a nonprofit backed by family financial contributions to combat addiction and drug abuse  a person familiar with their deliberations said   The drugmaker downplayed the possibility of a bankruptcy filing in a Feb  22 court filing in the Oklahoma case   Purdue is still here   ready  willing and eager to prove in this Court that the State s claims are baseless   the company said in court papers   Sales of OxyContin and other opioids have fallen amid public concern about their addictive nature  and as restrictions on opioid prescribing have been enacted  OxyContin generated  1 74 billion in sales in 2017  down from  2 6 billion five years earlier  according to the most recent data compiled by Symphony Health Solutions  Purdue Chief Executive Officer Craig Landau has cut hundreds of jobs  stopped marketing opioids to physicians and moved the company toward developing medications for sleep disorders and cancer since taking the helm in 2017   In July  Purdue appointed a new board chairman  Steve Miller  a restructuring veteran who previously held leadership positions at troubled companies including auto parts giant Delphi and the once teetering insurer American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   Mortimer D A  Sackler no longer sits on Purdue s board  according to a filing the company made with the Connecticut secretary of state late Monday  The Oklahoma case and other lawsuits seek damages from Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid crisis  In addition to lawsuits consolidated in an Ohio federal court  more than 300 cases are pending in state courts  and dozens of state attorneys general have sued manufacturers  including Purdue   Settlement discussions have not yet resulted in a deal

172926,394442,AIG,Lloyd s of London plots new course as storm clouds gather,news,"By Carolyn Cohn and Jonathan Saul LONDON  Reuters    Lloyd s of London  the world s oldest insurer of seafaring vessels  is facing its own perfect storm  Old fashioned business practices  exposure to natural disasters  competition from rival centers and Brexit are all threatening Lloyd s reputation as the place to insure anything from ships to sculptures to soccer stars  legs  Stung by combined losses of 3 billion pounds   3 9 billion  over the last two years  John Neal  the new chief executive of an insurance market founded in a London coffee house in 1688  is under growing pressure to drag Lloyd s into the 21st century  Following a six month review  Neal will unveil a new strategy next week expected to include a push to automate arcane processes  a shift away from risky catastrophe insurance  a hard look at the middlemen who drive up the cost of doing business at Lloyd s and ways to attract new sources of capital  It is also looking to improve inclusion at a time when the culture at Lloyd s is in the spotlight following a report by Bloomberg News about sexual harassment and day time drinking  But in a market where shipwrecks are still recorded by some insurers with a quill and paperwork is lugged around Lloyd s futuristic 14 storey building in slipcases  some brokers and underwriters are resisting innovation   Lloyd s has to change  it s like an old man dancing   a bit awkward and embarrassing   said one insurance company chief executive  who declined to be named   We do not have a great track record in modernization   All of Lloyd s brokers are meant to shift to an electronic platform by June  but many are complaining about the cost and increased transparency   which risks hurting their fees  Underwriters are meant to move 50 percent of their business to the platform by the middle of the year but several are behind  and much of their business has been deemed outside the scope of the automation drive   Recent performance has not been acceptable and the work we began last year has placed the market on a much firmer footing   Neal  who joined as CEO in October  told Reuters   The focus now turns to the changes we must make to ensure Lloyd s succeeds in the future   by supercharging innovation  simplifying the process for capital to access Lloyd s  automating claims processes  lowering costs by making an electronic exchange  and creating a culture of inclusivity    DEFINITELY A THREAT  Lloyd s is not an insurance company in itself but a group of 99 syndicates  or members  who price and underwrite policies and spread the risk among themselves  More than 150 brokers act as middlemen with clients  along with another group of intermediaries known as managing general agents  Once mostly wealthy individuals  members now include small underwriters and listed firms such as Beazley and Hiscox  as well as global insurers specializing in business lines such as shipping  aviation and property  The problem for Lloyd s is that while it still has global cachet and a strong A credit rating  investors from hedge funds to private equity firms looking for higher yields are piling into rival centers such as Bermuda  New York and Singapore  While Lloyd s reputation for specialization and innovation has pushed it to the forefront of new areas such as insurance against hacking  cheaper centers are muscling in on its turf  Bermuda  for example  has developed a specialism in catastrophe bonds and other insurance linked securities   It definitely is a threat and it will happen in a number of areas   said industry veteran Andrew Bathurst  director of PWS Gulf  an insurance broker in London and Dubai   Lloyd s is aware that overseas underwriters are looking at those classes of business and weighing up whether to underwrite them     If we should see some more losses  particularly on the older accounts  then Lloyd s will come under pressure and then there will be more incentive to look outside   said Bathurst  who has been a Lloyd s underwriter and CEO of a Lloyd s broker  SLOW TECH Automating claims processes to cut costs in a market where most business is still done face to face is one of the areas highlighted in a Lloyd s leaflet hinting at its new strategy  Lloyd s has an expense ratio   costs divided by net premiums   of 40 percent  according to ratings agency AM Best  Sources say this is some 10 points higher than commercial insurers like Germany s Allianz  DE ALVG  or AIG  NYSE AIG  in the United States   The market needs to modernize  It does not make sense to have business placed by paper when we have the technology   said Ian Fantozzi  chief operating officer at Beazley  which manages seven Lloyd s syndicates  Hiscox has also embraced technological change but Lloyd s has struggled to persuade some underwriters and brokers to adopt an electronic processing platform launched in July 2016  While some say the system is easy to use  others complain it is unwieldy and creates  rather than reduces  workload  Former Lloyd s CEO Inga Beale made it compulsory last year for syndicates to shift their business to the platform because underwriters had moved only 10 percent voluntarily  Underwriters who miss the targets face charges while brokers could be deregistered   a rare event in the market  For smaller brokers and underwriters  however  the upfront costs of adapting to the system are high  Persuading them to change is like  herding cats   according to one market source  One senior broker said the system was not ideal because different syndicates work and use it in different ways  The system is suited to simple  commoditized policies  rather than the complex business with lots of conditions and clauses for which Lloyd s is known  the insurance CEO said  Smaller brokers are also wary of the increased transparency provided by the system  which would expose their charging structures and could put pressure on their fees  said one City of London source familiar with Lloyd s  Charles Manchester  chairman of the Managing General Agents  Association  also said there was no great demand from brokers  POWER SHIFT  Despite the inertia  Lloyd s will be reluctant to push too hard by imposing sanctions for non compliance at such a sensitive time for the industry  which is grappling with lower premiums globally  City of London sources said   There is a growing worry that this could compel many brokers to leave   said a second City source familiar with Lloyd s   In the past  British banks would insist on using Lloyd s of London to write insurance  That balance of power is shifting and other centers could emerge  such as New York   The risk to Lloyd s and other insurance companies in London was highlighted in a 2017 report by Boston Consulting Group and industry association London Market Group  It said the market faced competition from emerging markets and Bermuda  Singapore and

172930,394446,AIG,American International Group  AIG  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when American International Group  NYSE AIG  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  263 5  
Revenues are expected to be  12 32 billion  down 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 91  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American International Group 
For American International Group  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that American International Group will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that American International Group would post earnings of  0 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 56  delivering a surprise of  43 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
American International Group appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-international-group-aig-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200505396,200505396

Key Central Bank Actions
The RBA kept rates at 0 75  Here is how the bank described the Australian economy  emphasis added  
The outlook for the Australian economy is little changed from three months ago  The central scenario is for the Australian economy to grow by around 2  per cent this year and then for growth gradually to pick up to around 3 per cent in 2021  The low level of interest rates  recent tax cuts  ongoing spending on infrastructure  the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector should all support growth  The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption  with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending  Other sources of uncertainty include the effects of the drought and the evolution of the housing construction cycle 
Later in the week  the bank released its Statement of Monetary Policy  which contained the following observations about the domestic economy 
Unemployment has been steady at 5 4  since April The employment population ratio has been rising recently due to decent growth in the jobs marketHousing remains weakBusiness investment has been soft for the last four quartersWhile down from abnormally high levels a few years ago  mining activity is up modestlyHousehold consumption is weaker due to weaker wage growthThe Bank of England maintained    Here is how the bank described the current situation  emphasis added  
Looking through Brexit related volatility  underlying UK GDP growth has slowed materially this year and a small margin of excess supply has opened up  That slowdown reflects weaker global growth  driven by trade protectionism  and the domestic impact of Brexit related uncertainties 
The accompanying monetary policy report demonstrated the breadth of UK weakness  with soft readings for household consumption  business investment  and exports  The combined impact of this weakness is variable rates of slow growth readings this year along with weaker growth over the last four years 




The left chart shows the fluctuating nature of UK growth over the last year  In the first quarter  Brexit s initial date of March 31 pulled orders forward  This is partially responsible for the decline in growth in 2Q19  as is the shutdown of auto production facilities in the UK  Growth rebounded modestly in 3Q19  but not by much  The right chart shows that  once temporary factors are stripped from GDP data  overall growth is not only weak but declining since the Brexit vote in 2016 
Key US Data

US Markets
Let s start with the performance tables 




Let s begin at the bottom  Treasuries sold off this week  with the long end dropping 4  and the belly of the curve falling 1 68   Small caps were up  although their gains were less than 1   The large caps wound up gaining a bit more than 1  




The sector performance table is very bullish  Defensive sectors were off this week  real estate was down 3 37  and utilities dropped 3 62   Combined with the weak Treasury market performance  this indicates that the bulls are in control  The sectors that did rise are aggressive sectors  financials  energy  basic materials  and industrials  This solidifies the argument that bulls are running the market 
Let s take a look at the charts for the major indexes  starting with the SPYs 




There were two trends this week  a modest but controlled selloff between Monday and Wednesday followed by a modest move higher at the open on Thursday  Prices ended the week on a rally  which means bulls weren t concerned about negative news occurring over the weekend 




Instead of rallying with the SPYs  the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  moved sideways  trading between 158 and 160 




And the iShares 7 10 Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ IEF  sold off  The ETF gapped lower on Tuesday and Thursday  While prices tried to rally twice  the rallies failed 
The 30 day charts for the indexes show a strong rally 




The SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  is in the middle of a strong  30 day rally  as is    




    the IWM  The best part about both these rallies is that prices are engaged in a give and take between advances and selloffs 




Meanwhile  the IEF has sold off over the last 30 days  Prices moved lower for the first 2 3 of the month  They staged a modest rally at the end of October but have since continued to move lower 
Finally  several industries have very bullish charts  which supports the move higher and probably bodes well for the next week 




The tech sector started to rise at the end of October and is now in an upward sloping channel  Prices are near a 30 day high 




Industrials have been rallying a bit longer  as have    




    financials 
And defensive sectors are noticeably lower 




The Vanguard REIT  NYSE VNQ  dropped below support in the lower 90s and is now trading near a 30 day low 




Utilities have been trending lower since mid October and are also near 30 day lows 
Overall  the pieces are lining up for the bulls  Indexes have broken through resistance  Treasuries are selling off  and bullish industries are moving higher  For the second week in a row  we re ending on a high note

172974,394490,AIG,Growing Disconnect Between The Markets And Economy,opinion,"A couple of years ago  I wrote an article discussing the disconnect between the markets and the economy  At that time  the Fed was early into their rate hiking campaign  Talks of tax cuts from a newly elected President filled headlines  corporate earnings were growing  and there was a slew of fiscal stimulus from the Government to deal with the effects of 3 major hurricanes and 2 devastating wildfires  Now  the Fed is cutting rates  so it is time to revisit that analysis 
Previously  the consensus for the rise in capital markets was the tax cuts  and low levels of interest rates made stocks the only investment worth having  
Today  rates have risen  economic growth both domestically and globally has weakened  and corporate profitability has come under pressure  However  since the Fed is cutting rates  hinting at expanding their balance sheet  and a  trade deal  is at hand  stocks are the only investment worth having 
In other words  regardless of the economic or fundamental backdrop   stocks are the only investment worth having   
I am not so sure that is the case 
Let s begin by putting the markets into perspective 

Yes  the markets are flirting with  all time highs   While this certainly sounds impressive  for many investors  they have just started making money on their investments from the turn of the century  As we noted in  The Moment You Know You Know  You Know   what is often forgotten is the massive amount of  time  lost in growing capital to meet retirement goals 





This is crucially important to understand as was something I addressed in Stocks   The Great Wealth Equalizer  

 By the time that most individuals achieve a point in life where incomes and savings rates are great enough to invest excess cash flows  they generally do not have 30 years left to reach their goal  This is why losing 5 7 years of time getting back to  even  is not a viable investment strategy 

The chart below is the inflation return of  1000 invested in 1995 with  100 added monthly  The blue line represents the impact of the investment using simple dollar cost averaging  The red line represents a  lump sum  approach  The lump sum approach utilizes a simple weekly moving average crossover as a signal to either dollar cost average into a portfolio OR moves to cash  The impact of NOT DESTROYING investment capital by buying into a declining market is significant  







 Importantly  I am not advocating  market timing  by any means  What I am suggesting is that if you are going to invest into the financial markets  arguably the single most complicated game on the planet  then you need to have some measure to protect your investment capital from significant losses 

While the detrimental effect of a bear market can be eventually recovered  the time lost during that process can not  This is a point consistently missed by the ever bullish media parade chastising individuals for not having their money invested in the financial markets  
However  let s set aside that point for the moment  and discuss the validity of the argument of the rise of asset prices is simply a reflection of economic strength 
Assuming that individuals are  investing  in companies  versus speculating on price movement  then the investment process is a  bet  on future profitability of the company  Since  companies derive their revenue from consumption of their goods  products  and services  it is only logical that stock price appreciation  over the long term  has roughly equated to economic growth  However  during shorter time frames  asset prices are affected by investor psychology which leads to  boom and bust  cycles  This is the situation currently  which can be seen by the large disconnect between current economic growth and asset prices 
Since January 1st of 2009  through the end of the second quarter of 2019  the stock market has risen by an astounding 164 90   inflation adjusted   However  if we measure from the March 9  2009 lows  the percentage gain explodes to more than 200   With such a significant gain in the financial markets  we should see a commensurate indication of economic growth 




The reality is that after 3 massive Federal Reserve driven  Quantitative Easing  programs  a maturity extension program  bailouts of TARP  TGLP  TGLF  etc   HAMP  HARP  direct bailouts of Bear Stearns  AIG  NYSE AIG   GM  bank supports  etc   all of which total more than  33 Trillion  the economy grew by just  3 87 Trillion  or a whopping 24 11  since the beginning of 2009  The ROI equates to  8 53 of interventions for every  1 of economic growth 
Not a very good bargain 
We can look at this another way 
The stock market has returned almost 103 6  since the 2007 peak  which is more than 4 times the growth in GDP and nearly 3 times the increase in corporate revenue   I have used SALES growth in the chart below as it is what happens at the top line of income statements and is not AS subject to manipulation   
The all time highs in the stock market have been driven by the  4 trillion increase in the Fed s balance sheet  hundreds of billions in stock buybacks  and valuation  PE  expansion  With Price To Sales ratios and median stock valuations near the highest in history  one should question the ability to continue borrowing from the future 




Speaking of rather extreme deviations  another concern for the detachment of the markets from more basic economic realities  the deviation of reported earnings from corporate profits after tax  is at historical extremes 





These sharp deviations tend to occur in late market cycles when  excess  from speculation has reached extremes  Recessions tend to follow as a  reversion to the mean  occurs 




While  earnings have surged since the end of the last recession  which has been touted as a definitive reason for higher stock prices  it is not all as it would seem 
Earnings per share are indeed an important driver of markets over time  However  the increase in profitability has not come strong increases in revenue at the top of the income statement  The chart below shows the deviation between the widely touted OPERATING EARNINGS  earnings before all the  bad  stuff  versus REPORTED EARNINGS which is what all historical valuations are based  I have also included revenue growth  as well 




This is not a new anomaly  but one which has been a consistent  meme  since the end of the financial crisis  As the chart below shows  while earnings per share have risen by over 360  since the beginning of 2009  revenue growth has barely eclipsed 50  





While suppressed wage growth  layoffs  cost cutting  productivity increases  accounting gimmickry  and stock buybacks have been the primary factors in surging profitability  these actions have little effect on revenue growth  The problem for investors is all of the gimmicks to win the  beat the estimate game  are finite in nature  Eventually  real rates of revenue growth will matter  However  since suppressed wages and interest rates have cannibalized consumer incomes   there is nowhere left to generate further sales gains from in excess of population growth 
Left Behind
While Wall Street has significantly benefited from the Fed s interventions  Main Street has not  Over the past few years  as asset prices surged higher  there has been very little translation into actual economic prosperity for a large majority of Americans  This is reflective of weak wage  economic  and inflationary growth which has led to a surge in consumer debt to record levels 




Of course  weak economic growth has led to employment growth that is primarily a function of population growth  As I addressed just recently 

 Employment should increase to accommodate for the increased demand from more participants in the economy  Either that or companies resort to automation  off shoring  etc  to increase rates of production without increases in labor costs  The chart below shows the total increase in employment versus the growth of the working age population  






While reported unemployment is hitting historically low levels  there is a swelling mass of uncounted individuals that have either given up looking for work or are working multiple part time jobs  This can be seen below which shows those  not in labor force   as a percent of the working age population  skyrocketing 




If employment was indeed as strong as reported by government agencies  then social benefits would not be comprising a record high of 22  of real disposable incomes  




Without government largesse  many individuals would literally be living on the street  The chart above shows all the government  welfare  programs and current levels to date  While unemployment insurance has hit record lows following the financial crisis  social security  Medicaid  Veterans  benefits and other social benefits have continued to rise and have surged sharply over the last few months 
With 1 5 of incomes dependent on government transfers  it is not surprising that the economy continues to struggle as recycled tax dollars used for consumption purposes have virtually no impact on the overall economy 
Conclusion
While financial markets have surged to  all time highs   the majority of Americans who have little  or no  vested interest in the financial markets have a markedly different view  While the Fed keeps promising with each passing year the economy will come roaring back to life  the reality has been that all the stimulus and financial support hasn t been able to put the broken financial transmission system back together again 
Amazingly  more than two years following the initial writing of this article  the gap between the markets and the economy has grown even wider  Eventually  the current disconnect between the economy and the markets will merge 
I bet such a convergence will likely not be a pleasant one ",2019-09-24,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/growing-disconnect-between-the-markets-and-economy-200467295,200467295

When looking at the last two reports  this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 34 94   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  American International Group came out with earnings of  1 43 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 17 per share  representing a surprise of 22 22   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 07 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 58 per share  delivering a surprise of 47 66  
Price and EPS Surprise

For American International Group  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
American International Group has an Earnings ESP of  4 04  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-american-international-group-aig-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200471542,200471542

172977,394493,AIG,American International Group  AIG  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"American International Group  NYSE AIG  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for American International Group basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for American International Group imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for American International Group
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this insurer is expected to earn  5 13 per share  which is a change of 338 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for American International Group  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of American International Group to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-international-group-aig-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200471799,200471799
172985,394501,AIG,Banks urge U S  regulators to reconsider  Volcker Rule  tweaks,news,"By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    Banks on Thursday pushed back on how regulators are attempting to simplify rules prohibiting banks from trading on their own account  a development that is likely to delay efforts to wrap up the overhaul in the coming months  On May 30  U S  regulators unveiled a plan to modify the so called Volcker Rule introduced following the 2007 2009 financial crisis  aiming to make compliance easier for many firms and relieving small banks altogether  Wall Street has long complained about the complexity and subjectivity of the rule  which bans banks that accept U S  taxpayer insured deposits   such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS   JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  and  Morgan Stanley   N MS    from engaging in short term speculative trading  The Volcker Rule was introduced by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act after many firms  including insurance giant AIG  N AIG  had to be bailed out when their bets in the derivatives market went bad  The public comment period ended on Wednesday with several prominent industry groups  including the Financial Services Forum and the Bank Policy Institute  urging the five agencies involved to seriously reconsider or scrap major portions of the proposal  In particular  they said the agencies should toss out a proposed new test for assessing whether trades are speculative that would focus on the accounting treatment of the instruments traded   The five agencies are the Federal Reserve  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  the Securities and Exchange Commission  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission   Reuters reported in June that banks had identified the  accounting prong  as a major problem that could actually make life far harder by capturing even more trades than the current rule  The Financial Services Forum  which represents the heads of the nation s largest banks  said on Thursday that the test was  overbroad and inconsistent  and should be scrapped  The Federal Reserve declined to comment  but officials at the central bank have said in the past that they are very open to industry feedback on how to improve the proposal  Regulators had hoped to advance the rule changes by year end  but one regulatory source involved in the discussions said industry pushback would complicate the process and potentially extend that timeline  Several industry groups also pushed regulators to better streamline their supervisory work  The five regulators share responsibility for enforcing the Volcker Rule  but banks have long complained that being overseen by so many agencies can be onerous and create conflicting demands  However  industry groups were generally supportive of a proposal to tailor the rule by reducing its requirements for banks with less than  10 billion in trading assets  Consumer groups are also pushing regulators to rethink  arguing the proposal would weaken the rule and in turn put the financial system at risk   It creates numerous loopholes  intentionally blinds regulators  eliminates reporting requirements  and leaves the banks to self regulate   said Dennis Kelleher  president and chief executive of Better Markets  a group that lobbies for tighter regulation

172986,394502,AIG,AIG sees third quarter catastrophe losses of  1 5 billion  1 7 billion,news," Reuters    Insurer American International Group Inc  N AIG  said on Thursday it expects third quarter pre tax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  of between  1 5 billion and  1 7 billion   These losses are largely associated with multiple events in Japan  including Typhoons Jebi and Trami  as well as Hurricane Florence and revisions to our loss estimates on the California mudslides   AIG said in a statement

172987,394503,AIG,Insurer AIG s quarterly loss narrows on reinsurance benefit,news,"By Diptendu Lahiri and Suzanne Barlyn
 Reuters    American International Group Inc  N AIG  reported a smaller quarterly loss on Wednesday as reinsurance pacts helped offset steep catastrophe losses in Japan and North America 
The insurer posted a net loss of  1 26 billion  or  1 41 per share  for the third quarter ended Sept  30  compared with a loss of  1 74 billion  or  1 91 per share  a year earlier 
AIG recorded net pretax catastrophe losses of  1 6 billion in the quarter  mainly related to typhoons in Japan and Hurricane Florence  that were largely in line with the insurer s preview of those losses in mid October 
The figures  far worse than analysts were expecting  helped spur a 13 percent drop in AIG shares during recent weeks  The shares were down 1 1 percent in after hours trade on Wednesday 
AIG s revised estimates for California mudslides also contributed to its losses 
AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault  who took charge in May 2017  has vowed to turn the company around and post an underwriting profit as soon as year end 
But some analysts are not convinced his plan is working   The third quarter results do not suggest progress in and of themselves   Sandler O Neill analyst Paul Newsome said in an interview 
AIG has not made much progress in improving underwriting profit in its commercial property and casualty insurance business  even without the catastrophe losses  Newsome said  But there are some signs that AIG s loss ratio is improving  he said 
AIG estimated it has exhausted about  700 million of the  750 million available through its North American catastrophe reinsurance program following the mudslides  Hurricane Florence and loss estimate from Hurricane Michael  which crashed into Florida earlier this month 
The adjusted pretax loss from the general insurance business narrowed 72 percent to  825 million  while the underwriting loss narrowed to  1 73 billion from  3 8 billion a year ago 
Adjusted pretax income from the life and retirement business fell 38 percent to  713 million  driven by changes to some actuarial assumptions following an annual review 
The company s combined ratio fell to 124 4 percent from 157 1 percent  A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims 
Loss ratio fell to 88 6 percent from 124 1 percent in the year ago quarter  when it recorded pretax catastrophe losses of  3 billion related to hurricanes Harvey  Irma and Maria 
On an adjusted basis  it lost 34 cents per share  Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 12 cents  according to I B E S data from Refinitiv  It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable ",2018-10-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/insurer-aigs-quarterly-loss-narrows-on-reinsurance-benefit-1669098,1669098

Even a decade later  many people still cling to false ideas about the underlying causes  there wasn t just one  folks   of the crisis  What follows are my 10 favorite flawed memes  misunderstandings and just outright falsehoods about the financial crisis and its aftermath 
No  1  Lehman s collapse caused the crisis   If only we had saved Lehman Brothers  we could have avoided the crisis   goes a popular lament  This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the scale of the dislocations  To accept this premise   former Lehman employees are some of the loudest apostles of this theory   then one has to pretend an entire universe of other issues didn t exist 
Lehman  like Bear Stearns before it  suffered from many of the same issues that afflicted most of the U S  s other big banks and brokers  too much junk paper  too much leverage  too little capital and deficient risk controls  Lehman was simply among the most overleveraged and undercapitalized of the lot 
No  2  If not for X  we would have been OK  Take your pick of things to insert here  but it s important to understand that this was not a single event  but rather the result of many factors that came together over time  These include  the Federal Reserve s ultralow interest rates  a fundamentally weak recovery from the dot com collapse  the housing boom and bust  huge amounts of financial leverage  securitization of mortgages  the embrace of derivatives and reckless deregulation of the financial industry that enabled much of the above  and more  I depicted these elements via this graphic in  Bailout Nation  
No  3  Repeal of Glass Steagall  The argument is that in the decades after Glass Steagall was enacted during the Great Depression  Wall Street crises were confined to Wall Street and didn t spill onto Main Street  See as examples the 1987 stock market crash or the Mexican peso crisis of 1994  But the causative issue we run into to is the but for test  Would we have had a crisis if Glass Steagall were still in place  I don t see how we can make that claim  Perhaps had Glass Steagall not been repealed  the crisis might have been smaller  but it is very hard to say it wouldn t have occurred anyway 
No  4  Bailouts were the only option  There were many other options  but they would have been very painful and required considerable foresight  I believed then  and still believe  that the best course of action would have been prepackaged bankruptcies for all the insolvent institutions instead of bailouts  I would have had the federal government provide debtor in possession financing  allowed qualified private institutional investors to bid on the assets thereby letting markets set the valuations  with the government picking up the rest  It would have been more difficult in the short term  but the economy would have rebounded much sooner 
No  5  Taxpayers were repaid in full and even made a profit  There are two major issues with this claim  The first is that the Troubled Asset Relief Program and most other loans and bailouts were all  or almost all  repaid  But to make that happen  the federal government in a move questioned by tax experts allowed failed American International Group  NYSE AIG  to carry forward the net operating losses for use to offset future earnings  this was a stealth bailout worth tens of billions of dollars that didn t appear to  cost  anything  Meanwhile the Federal Reserve kept rates at zero for almost a decade  This resulted in a huge transfer from savers to bailed out lenders 
The federal government also took a huge amount of risk during a period when financial markets tripled  And that is before we account for all of the collateral losses and moral hazards we created 
No  6  No one went to jail because stupidity isn t a crime  This one is laugher  from the behavior of the executives at Lehman Brothers to all of the foreclosure fraud that took place  Jesse Eisinger  author of  The Chickenshit Club  Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives   explained how the white collar defense bar successfully lobbied and undercut the Department of Justice during the years before the crisis  You can t convict a criminal if you don t have the personnel  intellectual firepower or stomach to prosecute in the first place 
No  7  Borrowers were as blameworthy as lenders  First  we know that for huge swaths of the banking industry  the basis for lending changed in the run up to the crisis  For most of financial history  credit was granted based on the borrower s ability to repay  In the years before the crisis  the incentive to lend shifted  It was based not on the likelihood of repayment but on whether a loan could be sold to someone else  often a securities firm  which would repackage the loan with other loans to create a mortgage backed security  Selling 30 year mortgages with a 90 day warranty changes the calculus for who qualifies  just find a warm body that will make the first three payments  after that it s someone else s problem  
Second  we know that if you offer people free money  they will take it  This is among the reasons we have banking regulations in the first place  We expect the banking professionals to understand risk better than the unwashed masses 
No  8  Poor people caused the crisis  This is another intellectually dishonest claim  If any U S  legislation such as the Community Reinvestment Act was the actual cause of the crisis  then the boom and bust wouldn t have been global  Second  if poor people and these policies were the cause  then the crisis would have been centered in South Philadelphia  Harlem  New York  Oakland  California  and Atlanta instead of the burgeoning suburbs of Las Vegas  Southern California  Florida and Arizona  The folks making this argument seem to have questionable motivations 
No  9  The Fed made a mistake by stepping in when Congress refused  Congress is the governmental entity that should have done more in response to the crisis  But it didn t  and all of those members who opposed efforts to repair the economy and financial system should have been thrown out of office  The Fed gave cover to Congress  creating congressional moral hazard and allowing it to shirk its responsibilities  We don t know how the world would have looked if that hadn t happened  but I imagine it would be significantly different than it does today   and not necessarily better 
No  10  Lehman could have been saved  This is perhaps the most delusional of all the claims  Lehman was insolvent  We know this from an accounting sleight of hand it performed called Repo 105  in which it which  sold   50 billion in holdings to an entity it owned  booked a profit just before quarterly earnings  then repurchased the holdings  The sleuthing done by hedge fund manager David Einhorn reached the same conclusion about Lehman s solvency long before the collapse  the Fed itself also made clear that it couldn t take on Lehman s losses 
When people stubbornly refuse to acknowledge facts  when they insist on staying married to their own faulty belief system  it becomes very challenging to respond with sound policies  As a society  the sooner we reckon with reality  the sooner we can begin to avoid disasters like the financial crisis ",2018-09-14,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/10-things-people-still-get-wrong-about-the-financial-crisis-1610421,1610421

173017,394533,AIG,American International Group  AIG  Dips More Than Broader Markets  What You Should Know,opinion,"In the latest trading session  American International Group  NYSE AIG  closed at  56 48  marking a  1 38  move from the previous day  This move lagged the S P 500 s daily loss of 0 16   At the same time  the Dow added 0 11   and the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 44  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the insurer had gained 7 95  over the past month  This has outpaced the Finance sector s gain of 3 52  and the S P 500 s gain of 4  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from AIG as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be August 7  2019  In that report  analysts expect AIG to post earnings of  1 17 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 11 43  
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  4 99 per share and revenue of  49 25 billion  These totals would mark changes of  326 5  and  3 64   respectively  from last year 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for AIG should also be noted by investors  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 63  higher  AIG is holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now 
Valuation is also important  so investors should note that AIG has a Forward P E ratio of 11 48 right now  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 11 43  so we one might conclude that AIG is trading at a premium comparatively 
It is also worth noting that AIG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 04  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  The Insurance   Multi line industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 21 as of yesterday s close 
The Insurance   Multi line industry is part of the Finance sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 99  putting it in the top 39  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

173023,394539,AIG,Opening Bell  Stocks  Yields  Yuan Slump In Unison As Trade War Opens New Fronts,opinion,"U S  futures  European shares slide deep into red territory on escalating trade risk
Chinese yuan hits ten year low as trade war threatens to turn into currency war
Yen surges  gold seals highest price since 2013 on flight to safety
U S  yields erase Trump Trade gains on heightened risk off 

Key Events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 plunged with global stocks this morning on a spike in trade risk  U S  Treasurys  the yen and gold reached long term highs on investors  flight to safe havens  while oil dropped on fears the U S  China dispute will further strain global demand 
Contracts on the Dow and the SPX extended a selloff to the fifth day  while those on the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 entered their sixth falling session 





While all four contracts slipped below their 50 and the 100 DMA  small cap futures also crossed beneath the 200 DMA  where they were trading at the low of the session  Overall  they extended the penetration following July s double top 
Europe s STOXX 600 opened lower and sharply extended Friday s decline with mining and tech stocks  amid the highest volumes since June 21  The trade is at the bottom of the session  within one percentage point from the lowest price since February  The May 31 low is supported by the 200 DMA just over half a percentage point lower than the current price 
In the earlier Asian session  stocks tumbled to a six month low  posting the steepest daily plunge in 10 months  Investors  exodus from equities pushed the yuan to a ten year low against the dollar as Chinese policymakers refused to defend the key 7 000 level which has historically marked the line in the sand for intervention likely weaponizing the renminbi in retaliation to U S  President Donald Trump s 10  tariff blow on all remaining untaxed Chinese imports  worth  300 billion  
Moreover  the Chinese government reportedly urged its state owned enterprises to halt imports of U S  agricultural products  in response to the U S  administration s latest tariff salvo 
China s Shanghai Composite   1 62   still managed to fare better than other regional markets  as the weakest currency in a decade in turn provided stocks with some cushioning 
Hong Kong s Hang Seng gave up 2 85  as protracted civil unrest compounded heightened market uncertainty   Australia s S P ASX 200 suffered a 1 9  loss after traders were reminded the country  which is China s biggest two way trading partner and is already suffering from an economic contraction  stands to be hit harshly by further trade headwinds 
Global Financial Affairs






U S  shares suffered their worst weekly loss of the year on Friday  Meanwhile  the yield on 10 year Treasurys hit the lowest level since October 2016  wiping out all gains from the Trump Trade that followed that year s presidential elections  We have been discussing for some time about the dichotomy of equities  record highs versus multi low bond yields  arguing that sooner or later one asset will drag the other into the opposite direction as of now  it seems that bonds are winning the battle 





The USD JPY pair dropped to the lowest level since March  as the 50 DMA found resistance by the 200 DMA  a bearish sign 





Gold jumped to the highest price since May 2013  extending an upside breakout of a massive bottom dating back to 2014 
The U S  China trade war also overshadowed escalating Mideast tensions for the oil market  which slid lower despite the fact that Iran seized another foreign tanker in the Persian Gulf

Price to Book Value Stocks to Buy in July
In value investing  it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong  There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks 
Among them  price to book ratio  P B ratio  is an easy to use tool for identifying low priced stocks  which have high growth prospects 
The P B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock  It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter s book value per share 
P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equity 
What is Book Value 
There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities 
It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value 
Understanding P B Ratio
By comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  
A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive 
For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock

173041,394557,AIG,AIG Stock Up 36  So Far This Year  Will The Rally Continue ,opinion,"American International Group  Inc    NYSE AIG   seems to have garnered investors  attention with its improving profitability led by numerous turnaround actions over the past two years 
Prior to the first quarter  which beat estimates  AIG had disappointed investors by missing estimates in six straight quarters  arousing skepticism over its ability to turn around the underperforming business 
This also led to a 34  decline in the company s share price in 2018 and 8 8  fall in 2017  However  in 2019  the stock has gained 37  year to date  compared with its  s rise of 15  

 
Since the beginning of 2018  the company has been undertaking significant foundational work in General Insurance around organizational structure  talent recruitment and improving underwriting capabilities  while at the same time rapidly evolving reinsurance program and exercising expense discipline  These initiatives seem to be paying off now 
The company has achieved quite a bit in its largest segment  General Insurance  contributing nearly 67  of total revenues in 2018   by posting an underwriting profit and a favorable combined ratio  This underwriting profit represents a significant milestone for AIG  and reflects the tremendous work undertaken by management recently to improve underwriting fundamentals 
The company s approach to reinsurance  which has dramatically reduced risk and volatility  onboard acquisitions and continuous expense discipline across General Insurance  is expected to drive the segment s results  Management remains confident that the segment will continue to improve its financial performance and deliver underwriting profit for the full year 2019 
Along with growing its top line  the company has tightened its grip on expenses which has aided its margins  The company has also witnessed a decline in expense ratio  despite making investments in talent  business process and infrastructure to support its long term profitable growth objectives 
AIG s continuous focus on strengthening its underwriting fundamentals  the changing mix of  business and the acquisitions of Validus and Glatfelter will improve its operating profitability 
AIG carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Other stocks worth considering are James River Group Holdings  Ltd    NASDAQ JRVR    Kemper Corp     NYSE KMPR    and Radian Group  Inc    NYSE RDN    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  James River beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 4 7   Kemper Corp  and Radian beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 14 13  and 10 28   respectively  You can see

Please see discussion in central bank actions for the conclusion about Australia s economy 
Central Bank Actions
The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered rates 25 basis points  Here are key points from their policy announcement  emphasis added 

The outlook for the global economy remains reasonable  However  the uncertainty generated by the trade and technology disputes is affecting investment and means that the risks to the global economy are tilted to the downside     

Consumption growth has been subdued  weighed down by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices     

The central scenario for the Australian economy remains reasonable  with growth around trend expected  The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption  although a pick up in growth in household disposable income is expected to support spending 

The Australian economy is softer  GDP grew 1 8  in the latest report but the overall trend is lower since 2Q18  The unemployment rate has ticked higher since 4Q18 and is 5 2   industrial production was up 1 2   quarterly calculation  in the 1Q19 but its pace of increase has consistently declined since 2Q18  Retail sales are also softer    they have been declining since October 2018 and grew 2 7  in the latest report  Australian growth has been dependant on two key events
Chinese growth  Australia supplies raw materials to China s growth engine  which is largely capital spending  Australian investment in basic materials spiked after the GFC and has since some done 
Australia real estate    which grew due to international investment  Asian wealth sought out other areas of investment  and rising domestic prosperity 
Rising trade tensions and the natural transition to a more developed economy growth model are slowing the first area of growth  which is seeping into the second 
US Data of Note
The Institute of Supply Management released manufacturing and  service sector reports this week  The manufacturing number decreased by  4 to 51 7  New orders were right at 50    the number that separates expansion and contraction  Production  however  increased 2 8 points to 54 1 while 12 of 18 industries expanded  The anecdotal comments were littered with negative comments about tariffs  emphasis added  
 China tariffs and pending Mexico tariffs are wreaking havoc with supply chains and costs  The situation is crazy  driving a huge amount of work  and  costs  as well as potential supply disruptions    Computer   Electronic Products 
 Tariffs are causing an increase in cost of goods  meaning U S  consumers are paying more for products    Chemical Products 
 Tariffs continue to be a challenge  We are concerned about the implementation of Mexican tariffs and the cost pressures it will have on our Latin American business    Petroleum   Coal Products 
 Tariffs continue to adversely impact decisions and forecasting  Our increasing fear is that current trends will weaken the global economy  influencing our ability to grow in 2020 and beyond    Fabricated Metal Products 
The Service sector report was stronger  While it decreased by 1 8 points  the composite reading was a healthier 55 1  16 18 industries increased  While production and new orders were lower  down 3 and 2 8  respectively   both are at healthy readings of 58 2 and 55 8  respectively  Once again  tariffs were mentioned in the anecdotal comments 
 New residential sales are off the typical pace by 10 to 15 percent year over year  Tariffs are working their way through the system  raising costs on finished materials 
 Waiting to see what new tariffs on Mexican steel will do to the market    Professional  Scientific   Technical Services 
 The suppliers we do business with are  claiming tariffs  to justify price increases  While some of these issues could be credible  it s our opinion that this issue provides cover to increase margins  as few will detail the line item impact    Management of Companies   Support Services 
 Closely watching the Trump tariffs on China  which could significantly impact medical supplies    Health Care   Social Assistance 
The above data shows that the manufacturing service sector split continues  Manufacturing is struggling due to increased international trade tensions while the service sector is growing at consistent rates 
The Census reported that construction spending is weaker  emphasis added  
Construction spending during May 2019 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  1 293 9 billion  0 8 percent   1 2 percent   below the revised April estimate of  1 304 0 billion  The May figure is 2 3 percent   1 5 percent  below the May 2018 estimate of  1 324 3 billion  During the first five months of this year  construction spending amounted to  498 8 billion  0 3 percent   1 3 percent   below the  500 3billion for the same period in 2018 
Here are two charts of the data 

The above chart shows absolute numbers  Red tracks non residential spending  61  of construction spending  which continues to increase  blue tracks residential spending  39  of construction spending  which has been decreasing since the beginning of 2018  GDP data from the BEA also show this trend  

The above chart converts the absolute data into a Y Y format  non residential  in red  is now growing while residential  in blue  is decreasing 
Finally  on Friday  the BLS released the latest employment report 
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 224 000 in June  and the unemployment rate was little changed at 3 7 percent  the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today  Notable job gains occurred in professional and business services  in health care  and in transportation and warehousing     
In June  average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 6 cents to  27 90  following a 9 cent gain in May  Over the past 12 months  average hourly earnings have increased by 3 1 percent 
Here s a chart of the relevant data 

Data from the St  Louis Federal Reserve  author s calculations
To remove monthly noise  I ve included 3  6  and 12 month moving averages  which are currently at 171 000  172 000  and 192 000  The 3 month average is moving higher while the latter two are moving lower  But all three are still at good levels 
An important note  the strong employment report probably put the Fed on the sidelines for now 
US Conclusion  overall  the data is good  Manufacturing data is softer due to increased international trade tensions  But    the sector is still expanding  The service sector is in much better shape  And  since it is a much larger percentage of the economy  the possibility of a recession is a bit lower  Finally  companies are hiring at a strong clip 
US Market Overview
Here s the performance table for the week 

The equity indexes were up  with the QQQ leading the way  The OEF followed  with the SPY and DIA next  Then we have the mid  small  and micro caps  all of which gained but to a smaller degree than the large caps  The treasury market sold off fractionally 
The 30 day charts show the overall trend of the large and smaller cap indexes  Let s start with the OEF 

Starting on June 13  the OEF started to move higher and has been in an uptrend since  The index has gained about five points during that time 

The SPY has the exact same pattern  as does    

    the QQQ 
Then we have the smaller cap indexes  with a very different chart 

Micro caps started to rally on June 6  But they sold off starting on June 21 and rebounded at the end of June  For July  the index has more or less moved sideways  which is the exact same pattern    

    as the small caps    

    and mid caps

173054,394570,AIG,Swiss Re Jumps as SoftBank Is Said to Eye  9 6 Billion Stake,news," Bloomberg     Swiss Re AG jumped after people familiar with the matter said Japan s SoftBank Group Corp  is edging closer to buying a quarter of the company  valuing the reinsurer at as much as 37 billion francs   39 billion  
Billionaire Masayoshi Son could buttress the finances of his diverse SoftBank empire with steady cashflows from reinsurance through the acquisition  The Tokyo based group has raised  93 billion out of a planned  100 billion for the world s biggest private equity pool  while taking stakes in businesses including ride hailing  chipmaking and office sharing 
SoftBank is holding talks to buy the stake at about 100 Swiss francs to 105 Swiss francs a share  the people said  declining to be identified as the deliberations are confidential  At 105 francs  the deal would represent a 16 percent premium over Swiss Re shares  close on Feb  7    before the company confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that it was in talks    and value the holding at about  9 6 billion 
Swiss Re gained as much as 3 2 percent in Zurich trading and was up 2 9 percent at 97 88 francs as of 9 08 a m  The stock has climbed 10 percent in the last 12 months 
The terms of the potential deal are still fluid and may change  and the companies may fail to reach an agreement  the people said  SoftBank declined to comment  A Swiss Re representative wasn t immediately available to comment 
 Swiss Re may offer interesting opportunities for business transformation  especially in its ailing Corporate Solutions business    Barclays   LON BARC  analyst Ivan Bokhmat wrote in a note to clients   The end target is still not clear for Softbank    a minority investment will not allow it to control investment policy or growth priorities for Swiss Re  
Insurance Deals
The insurance industry is experiencing a flurry of dealmaking as companies come on the market after a rash of natural disasters depressed valuations and an influx of competitors made it harder to raise rates  France s Axa SA this month agreed to buy XL Group Ltd  for  15 3 billion in cash to capture a bigger slice of the U S  property and casualty market  while American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   in January decided to buy the Bermuda based reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd  for  5 56 billion in cash 
Swiss Re s chief executive officer last month said the company would welcome a long term investor  In a business where results can change radically from one year to the next   it s not a bad thing to have an anchor shareholder   Christian Mumenthaler said at a conference in Zurich 
The reinsurer last month said it plans to raise its dividend and return an additional  1 billion to shareholders

173067,394583,AIG,Anbang Out With a Whimper Is No AIG Moment for China  Gadfly,news," Bloomberg Gadfly     Beijing s interventions in the economy don t always merit applause  but the government s unprecedented seizure of Anbang Insurance Group Co  deserves a round 
Anbang was a toxic threat to China s financial system after a debt fueled global acquisition spree    including trophy assets such as New York s Waldorf Astoria hotel    that was funded by the sale of high yield insurance policies  Those risky products propelled the company from obscurity into the ranks of the country s biggest insurers in the space of a few years 
The government will take temporary control of Anbang for a year starting Friday and prosecute its founder Wu Xiaohui for  economic crimes   the China Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a statement  Wu  who was the company s chairman  was detained in June 
As I have written previously  the insurer was always going to crash and burn if left untouched  
The heart of the Anbang dilemma is a duration mismatch  The company funded itself with the sale of short term policies  some of which promised 8 percent returns in six months  The proceeds were often invested in long term  hard to sell assets such as overseas real estate 
In its size and entanglement with China s financial system  Anbang is comparable to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc  or American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   in the U S  before the global financial crisis  The company s total assets were equivalent to a staggering 3 4 percent of China s GDP  UBS Group AG analyst Jason Bedford estimated in a report in August 
By the end of last year s first quarter  Anbang was the country s second largest insurer after state owned China Life Insurance Co  Its voracious dealmaking included an aborted  15 billion bid for  Starwood Hotels    Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  It  was also once in talks to invest in 666 Fifth Ave  in New York  the marquee holding of Kushner Cos   the family company of President Donald Trump s son in law Jared Kushner 
In May  though  an early sign of its downfall came when Anbang was restricted from selling the policies that had powered its growth  A month later  Wu  who was married to the granddaughter of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping  was detained 
By taking control of Anbang  authorities reinforce the message that President Xi Jinping is determined to tamp down financial risk  They also buy themselves time to scale down and recapitalize this bloated monster 
Strip away the uncontrolled trophy collecting and there appears to be a viable business underneath  Just 11 percent of the asset base of Anbang s core entities was invested in illiquid holdings such as the Waldorf Astoria  according to UBS s Bedford  
Markets reacted calmly to the announcement  underpinning the sense that regulators have acted in time to head off potentially bigger problems down the road  The Shanghai Composite Index was marginally higher at the midday break on Friday  shares of China Minsheng Banking Corp   in which Anbang is the largest shareholder  rose in Hong Kong 
While debt fueled conglomerates have been in Beijing s cross hairs  don t expect the Anbang takeover to set a precedent  For one thing  HNA Group Co  and Dalian Wanda Group Co  have slimmed down considerably since the government began signaling its concerns  For another  neither is nearly as entwined in the financial system as Anbang  which has policies held by millions of small investors 
This won t be an AIG moment for China  Rather  it s more likely to mark the demise of a single businessman who overreached  When he was raking in billions of yuan in premiums by selling policies like Longevity Sure Win No 1  Wu probably never imagined that the longevity he most needed to ensure was his own ",2018-02-23,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/anbang-out-with-a-whimper-is-no-aig-moment-for-china-gadfly-1299543,1299543

173086,394602,AIG,AIG launches new cyber threat analysis to gauge companies  risks,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn  Reuters    American International Group Inc  N AIG  has ramped up its analysis for insuring against cyber attacks  using a system that scores a company s risk of having a breach along with safeguards it has in place  the insurer said on Tuesday  AIG s underwriters have been using the computerized analysis since November  which combines information from a new insurance application designed for the process and data about current cyber threats to generate scores on various related factors  said Tracie Grella  AIG s global head of Cyber Risk Insurance  in an interview   The analysis scores companies on the degree to which a cyber attack may affect their businesses and the potential costs of various cyber incidents  among other issues  according to a sample report seen by Reuters  Cyber coverage is a mounting concern worldwide as hackers increasingly target companies  technology systems  Insurers are also struggling to estimate their potential exposure as cyber risks and interest in coverage increase  In October  AIG said it would review all coverage types to better gauge its exposure to cyber risk  Other policies  such as for property and commercial vehicles  are often silent on whether cyber events are covered  leaving insurers without a clear picture of their total financial exposure  AIG on Tuesday also announced a partnership with cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike Inc and Darktrace to launch CyberMatics  a service that verifies information AIG receives from customers  cyber security tools   The service uses artificial intelligence  or the ability of machines to carry out tasks normally associated with human intelligence  to look inside an insured company s network for strengths and vulnerabilities  said Darktrace Chief Executive Nicole Eagan in an interview    They may be good at identifying spear phishing attacks but not internal threats   said Eagan  referring to email attacks against organizations and individuals in which perpetrators try to gain access to sensitive information  Companies need not use the service  but those who do may be able to negotiate more favorable policy terms  Grella said  AIG s new analysis does not change cyber insurance rates  but could affect how it calculates a company s premium because of added insights it has into risks and mitigation efforts  Grella said  AIG s analysis also generates cyber risk reports for customers that include the same information its underwriters use  Companies can also compare their scores with those for their industries

173087,394603,AIG,Is AIG Focused Dividend Strategy A  FDSAX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Any investors hoping to find a Large Cap Blend fund might consider looking past AIG  NYSE AIG  Focused Dividend Strategy A  FDSAX   FDSAX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5  Strong Sell   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
FDSAX is classified in the Large Cap Blend segment by Zacks  which is an area full of potential  Targeting companies with market caps of more than  10 billion  Large Cap Blend mutual funds offer a stable investment choice  these funds are perfect for investors with a   buy and hold   mindset  Since blended funds mix large  more established firms into their portfolios  investors are exposed to both value and growth opportunities 
History of Fund Manager
FDSAX finds itself in the AIG family  based out of Kansas City  MO  Since AIG Focused Dividend Strategy A made its debut in June of 1998  FDSAX has garnered more than  3 57 billion in assets  A team of investment professionals is the fund s current manager 
Performance
Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance  This fund in particular has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 8 34   and it sits in the middle third among its category peers  Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3 year annualized total return of 9 31   which places it in the bottom third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Over the past three years  FDSAX s standard deviation comes in at 11 35   compared to the category average of 9 45   The fund s standard deviation over the past 5 years is 11 31  compared to the category average of 9 83   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
One cannot ignore the volatility of this segment  however  as it is always important for investors to remember the downside to any potential investment  FDSAX lost 53 01  in the most recent bear market and underperformed comparable funds by 3 64   These results could imply that the fund is a worse choice than its peers during a sliding market environment 
Even still  the fund has a 5 year beta of 0 89  so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large  Another factor to consider is alpha  as it reflects a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark in this case  the S P 500  Over the past 5 years  the fund has a negative alpha of  1 82  This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Expenses
For investors  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is key  since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  Competition is heating up in this space  and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  all things being equal  In terms of fees  FDSAX is a load fund  It has an expense ratio of 1 04  compared to the category average of 0 96   So  FDSAX is actually more expensive than its peers from a cost perspective 
Investors need to be aware that with this product  the minimum initial investment is  500  each subsequent investment needs to be at least  100 
Bottom Line
Overall  AIG Focused Dividend Strategy A   FDSAX   has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank  similar performance  average downside risk  and higher fees compared to its peers

173112,394628,AIG,All You Need To Know About American International Group  AIG  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"American International Group  NYSE AIG  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for American International Group is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for American International Group imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for American International Group
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this insurer is expected to earn  4 67 per share  which is a change of 299 2  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for American International Group  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of American International Group to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-american-international-group-aig-rating-upgrade-to-buy-200419526,200419526
173113,394629,AIG,AIG Started The Year Strong  But Congestion Is Ahead ,opinion,"After a poor 2018 which saw the price of AIG  NYSE AIG  stock fall by almost 34  during the year  2019 is proving to be brighter  as the stock continues to rise in a bullish trend and recapturing most of these losses  Last week s price action was dramatic with the stock rising strongly from  46 to currently trade at  51 64 and in sharp contrast to the prime indices which have seen significant falls triggered by concerns over the ongoing tariff debate  The question now is whether this strong performance is likely to continue in the short to medium term and there are two technical factors which suggest this is unlikely 
First  we have a volatility trigger which denotes a move outside the average true range with ultra high volume associated with the price action  This signals market maker participation and  as a result  the prospect of a reversal or congestion to follow  This is generally what follows as the market makers trap investors into weak positions in the ensuing congestion  Second  the stock is now testing a strong level of price resistance in the  52 area and denoted with the blue dashed line  The thickness of the line is calculated by the Quantum accumulation and distribution indicator for NinjaTrader automatically  and builds each time a level is tested and rejected  with the line then thickening as a result  This level is currently being tested  with a further region at  55 also on the horizon  So two reasons we can expect to see this stock congest over the next few weeks  and for any continuation  there are some sizeable barriers ahead  with the two levels outlined above  volume resistance is also high between the two  and finally the VPOC itself at  60

173129,394645,AIG,Fed s Yellen says AIG s threat to stability is reduced after downsizing,news,By Michelle Price WASHINGTON  Reuters    American International Group Inc  N AIG  poses less of a threat to financial stability because it shrank its assets by more than  500 billion  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Monday in explaining why she voted in favor of releasing the company from stricter oversight  Her comments and others published by regulators on Monday shed light on a process financial firms say is too opaque and unaccountable  indicating big banks and insurers will have to downsize dramatically if they are to shake off the  systemically risky  label  The comments also expose ongoing divisions among financial regulators over how to determine if a company is systemically risky a decade since the 2007 2009 global financial crisis began  The U S  Financial Stability Oversight Council  FSOC  said on Friday that AIG   which received a  182 billion U S  government bailout during the crisis   is no longer critical to the health of the U S  financial system   Since the financial crisis  AIG has largely sold off or wound down its capital markets businesses  and has become a smaller firm that poses less of a threat to financial stability   Yellen said in the statement   The possibility of de designation provides an incentive for designated firms to significantly reduce their systemic footprint   she added  The FSOC  which comprises the heads of financial regulators across the federal government  requires a two thirds majority to agree to remove a company s designation as a  systemically important financial institution   or SIFI   By law  any bank with over  50 billion in assets is automatically considered a SIFI  while the FSOC can apply the label to nonbanks on a case by case basis  The panel only once before has removed a SIFI designation  with GE Capital in 2016  With four appointees of former President Barack Obama still holding FSOC seats  Yellen s vote proved decisive on Friday  The remaining three Obama appointees voted against while five Trump appointees voted in favor along with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  who chairs the council   Jay Clayton  chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission  recused himself   The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Martin Gruenberg  who voted against  argued that AIG had actually increased its life insurance and annuity business exposure in recent years  according to comments released by the Treasury on Monday  The director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency  Mel Watt  also voted against and even challenged the legality of whether six votes was sufficient under FSOC rules   In my view  the Council s decision represents a simple majority decision  not the two thirds required by statute  ,2017-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fed-chair-yellen-says-aig-poses-less-of-systemic-threat-after-downsizing-535761,535761

173131,394647,AIG,Yellen Is Said to Find Unlikely Advocate at White House  Trump,news," Bloomberg     Janet Yellen s only advocate in the White House may be the one person who matters most  President Donald Trump 
The incumbent Federal Reserve chair was impressive in an Oval Office interview with Trump on Thursday  several people familiar with the matter said  She made clear to the president that she wants to keep her job  set no preconditions for appointment to a second term  and offered suggestions for the vice chairman position that were welcomed by the Trump team 
Yellen  the first woman to lead the U S  central bank  also made the case that the economy is doing well  and that Fed policies have been supportive of growth  Trump  who d be bucking conservatives in his own party if he opts to reappoint Yellen  has said he ll decide by Nov  3 who to nominate as Fed chair when her term ends in February 
The president  in a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans on Tuesday  asked for a show of hands in support of Taylor  Powell and Yellen  He didn t announce a winner and most of the senators didn t raise their hands  But of those who did   I think Taylor won   said Senator Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina 
Confidence in the central bank is critical for continued economic growth and job creation  something Trump frequently claims as an accomplishment  The president also often touts the stock market s boom since his election  a run that could be threatened should financial markets perceive him to be seeking a change in direction at the Fed 
White House Wants a Fed Chief Willing to Revisit Financial Rules
Under Yellen  unemployment was at 4 2 percent in September  a 16 year low  and the economy is in its ninth year of expansion  Inflation and interest rates are low and she is gradually backing off crisis era policies and unwinding the Fed s  4 5 trillion balance sheet 
Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment on Yellen s renomination prospects 
Within the White House Trump s interview of Yellen was regarded as serious  not just a courtesy  two of the people said  The president genuinely considers her a finalist for the job  the people said  despite misgivings among many of his closest advisers 
 I really like her a lot   he said Friday in an interview with Fox Business Network broadcast Sunday 
Other contenders for the job  Trump said in the interview  are Stanford University economist John Taylor and Fed governor Jerome Powell  or some combination of the two    the Fed Board vice chairman position is also open 
Taylor  who invented a widely used equation for setting interest rates that bears his name  has criticized the Fed s recent practices and is a favorite of House Republicans  They have passed legislation that would require the Fed to abide by a rule  opening a path to government audit of monetary policy  The House bill did not become law 
Political Backlash
The Fed s expansive policies during the global financial crisis  when it rescued Bear Stearns Cos  and American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG    became a political lightning rod for both parties and Republicans are still calling for a more restrained central bank 
All three of Yellen s predecessors were renominated by a president from the party opposite of the one who initially appointed them  Trump also faces a diversity issue in his choice  Breaking the glass ceiling at the 100 year old central bank by appointing Yellen was a significant step for women in finance and economics 
If she doesn t get the job that is  a devastating message for women in economics which is already struggling with gender imbalance   said Julia Coronado  president of Macropolicy Perspectives and a former Fed staff member 
However  Yellen lacks support from key Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee that would vote on her nomination  and among White House staff and Trump allies who want to see change atop the central bank 
New Leadership
 What I d like to see at the Federal Reserve is new leadership down there   Senator Richard Shelby  the number two Republican on the Banking Committee  said Monday at the Capitol   I think we can do better  
Shelby said Powell is  very good  and spoke favorably of Taylor s credentials as a monetary policy expert 
But Trump s Fox Business Network interview demonstrated that he grasps the gravity of his choice    disruptive outsiders may not be good for a central bank that can t be successful without the confidence of investors and the public 
 It s a hard decision   Trump said   If the right person is in there  a lot of good things can happen  
Nevertheless  many Republicans retain distrust of her association with the Fed s extraordinary policies during the financial crisis  and she carries a political stain as an Obama appointee 
 I have disagreed very strongly with the policies  like quantitative easing and the liberal policies that we ve seen   Mike Crapo  the Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Banking Committee  told Bloomberg News Oct  19 
 I would like to see the Fed change direction   he said   Get back to more normal  traditional monetary policy  ",2017-10-25,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/yellen-is-said-to-find-unlikely-advocate-at-white-house-trump-547145,547145

173160,394676,AIG,Global insurance capital rule snared in transatlantic divide,news,"By Huw Jones
LONDON  Reuters    The first global standard for investors to compare how much capital insurers from different countries hold to keep policies safe is caught in a transatlantic tussle  casting doubt on whether it is practical  industry and regulatory officials say 
Global banks have used common  Basel  capital rules for decades  and the  180 billion bailout for insurer AIG  N AIG  during the 2007 09 financial crisis prompted regulators to embark on a similar standard for insurers in 2013 for the world s top 50 insurers 
But four years into the work there is no completed International Capital Standard  ICS  nor a firm date for its introduction  making it harder for investors and policyholders to compare insurers from different parts of the world 
 The sense is there has been a collective pause around the ICS following elections in the United States and the European Union  as well as Brexit   said Mike Consedine  chief executive of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  NAIC   which groups U S  state level regulators 
Slow progress has triggered speculation within the industry that regulators may tell insurers the process is now on hold when they meet in Kuala Lumpur in November 
Hugh Savill  director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers  a trade body  said the ICS lacked sufficient political support for now to drive it through to completion 
 There is a serious stalemate  and I see us no nearer agreement than two years ago   Savill said 
Others were openly critical 
 It s a mess  The U S  won t play and the ICS is going nowhere   said the chief executive of a European insurer 
 I don t think you will get a material change in global capital because nobody can afford it  
Few believe  however  that a new capital rule would lead to big hikes in requirements 
The ICS is being written by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors  IAIS  whose chair  Victoria Saporta  a Bank of England executive director  said a significant step forward was taken in July when the first version of the ICS was published for field testing 
 There is no question that arriving at an ICS that achieves greater convergence than that of the different group capital standards adopted in different jurisdictions and regions is a challenging task   Saporta told Reuters 
 But it is also a necessary one if policyholders of international groups are to be better protected  whilst also enjoying the more inclusive offering that can result from the greater capital efficiencies of international diversification  
CARRY ON TALKING
The IAIS has yet to come up with a single approach to calculating the amount of capital the world s top 50 or so insurers will have to hold 
It is testing two  approaches  for valuing liabilities such as future payouts on policies 
The first approach is based on U S  accounting rules  while the second is based on market prices  similar to EU capital rules known as Solvency II 
But without as yet unclarified adjustments  the two approaches would come up with different capital requirements and leave investors scratching their heads 
 Is there a bridge between U S  accounting and Europe s Solvency II  There is none that is economically sound   said Tobias Buecheler  head of regulatory strategy at German insurer Allianz  DE ALVG  
 It s unclear how those approaches can be combined  aligned  You have a divide between the United States and Europe  
Insurance industry officials say the IAIS should instead focus on managing risks from the sector s activities  seen as more fruitful regulatory territory 
Insurers point out that AIG was the only insurer bailed out in the financial crisis  and this was because it had moved into non core  riskier hedge fund activities 
Cristina Mihai  head of international affairs at Insurance Europe  a trade body  said it would be hard to have an ICS based on just one approach 
Finding a common approach is becoming more difficult 
NAIC announced a few weeks ago it was teaming up with the Federal Reserve to write a new U S  capital rule  and Consedine made clear that any global rule would have to fit in with what this double act comes up with  not the other way round 
 We have stressed the need previously for the ICS to be principles based and to give countries a certain level of jurisdictional flexibility  That s going to be critical for the United States   Consedine said 
Complications loom in Europe  too 
European insurers will begin using a new accounting rule in 2021 known as IFRS 17  representing a major overhaul of how income is calculated  The EU s Solvency II rules will be reviewed  meaning there could be changes with knock on effects for the ICS 
 There are more goalposts and they are all moving  that is the problem   Allianz s Buecheler said 
Consedine said NAIC remains committed to the goals of the ICS  but it must result in something that is  workable for the United States and for regulators  ",2017-09-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-insurance-capital-rule-snared-in-transatlantic-divide-527266,527266

173164,394680,AIG,Is AIG Doomed To Have A Terrible 2019 Too ,opinion,"The stock of American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   seems to be in rough waters as the company is faced with a challenging insurance market  which has dragged down revenues in its property and casualty  P C  business  The P C business is under the umbrella of the General Insurance segment  which contributes nearly 59  of the company s total revenues  this year Other macro factors such as low interest rates  currency exchange rates  credit and equity market conditions  and catastrophic claims events also acted as dampeners Notably  AIG has lost nearly  20 5 billion in market value in a year s time  Year to date  the stock has lost 37  compared with the  s decline of 18 9   In 2017  the stock lost 9  The company missed estimates for the past five quarters in a row  due to weak performance in its General Insurance segment  unfavorable reserve release  low investment income and loss from catastrophes Problems Plaguing AIGIssues at AIG are not new  It all started at the height of the subprime crisis  when the company was bailed out  for  185 billion  by the government in order to save it from huge exposure to the subprime securities  Though the company repaid the bailout money by 2012  its operational problems continued AIG has incurred sizable investment and underwriting losses over the last decade  It has also seen significant changes in its operating  capital structure and senior management  causing the company to remain under significant stress during all these years The company has faced hurdles with respect to reserving  pricing  and handling its longer tail commercial lines business  and the effectiveness of the group s enterprise risk management function AIG became a victim of its own mammoth size with numerous unrelated business under its hood that created very little or no synergy  A number of low return generating businesses along with a weak industry dragged down the company s results AIG s top line has suffered over the years from declining premium due to disciplined underwriting  competitive market conditions and reduction in business due to numerous divestitures taken  This is evident from declining revenues since 2010  except in 2012  that continued till the first nine months of 2018  The company is unlikely to see any respite in the coming quarters as very a competitive property and casualty market and soft insurance pricing will keep the top line under pressure Another driver of its revenues  net investment income has also declined this year  Despite rising interest rates  the company s net investment income dipped 9  in the nine months of 2018  due to less robust performance in alternative investments An already suffocating top line performance coupled with AIG s exposure to catastrophe losses make matters worse  The company incurred catastrophe loss of  4 17 billion in 2017  up 213  year over year  Though catastrophe loss of  2 15 billion was down 37  in the first nine months of 2018  the company further expects to incur  750 million to  800 million of cat losses in the fourth quarter  These losses have historically imparted volatility to the company s earnings and will be a headwind going forward Remedial Steps TakenAfter years of asset dispositions  in order to restore profitability and consolidate business  management is now targeting new and profitable areas of expansion  In this vein  this year  it made the twin acquisitions of Glatfelter Insurance Group and Validus Holdings Glatfelter  the program manager and a specialty insurance broker  will expand AIG s General Insurance business  by bringing along high quality program underwriting capabilities  Validus has added diversified franchises to AIG including Validus Re  a reinsurance platform  AlphaCat  an insurance linked securities asset manager  Talbot  a Lloyd s syndicate  Western World  a specialist in U S  small commercial excess and surplus underwriting  and Crop Risk Services  which provides access to the North American crop insurance market  This acquisition has added complementary businesses to AIG while providing an experienced team General Insurance continues to execute on its other strategic priorities such as improving core performance by refining the portfolio  adding highly respected industry executives to its leadership team  strengthening the underwriting organization by recruiting seasoned underwriters and continuing to build out end to end business units in North America and International  To this end  it expanded its European Casualty excess of loss program to cover the entire international business and entered into a new U S  terrorism facility that reduced net exposures for its in force commercial property policies Can the Stock Stage a Comeback in 2019 Though the company has undertaken massive turnaround initiatives and has changed its leadership in hopes that the new management will bring stability  investors will remain skeptical until these actions get reflected in its financials  Till then  the stock is expected to remain under pressure Also  AIG has a Zacks Rank  5

173166,394682,AIG,The Automotive Industry And Precious Metals,opinion,"The new Alchemist is out  What can we learn from the latest publication of the LBMA  We invite you to read today s article and find out 
Oesterreichische Nationalbank  OenB  And Gold
In the previous edition of the Gold News Monitor  we analyzed one article from the newest Alchemist about gold s outlook for 2019  Today  we would like to return to the publication and examine the remaining ones  which are no less interesting 
The previous edition of LBMA s Alchemist focused on the link between Banque de France and gold  The most recent issue  no  92  describes the gold strategy of the Austrian central bank  We can learn  for example  that since 2007  OeNB s gold holdings have held constant at 280 tons  currently representing about 48 percent of the bank s foreign exchange reserves 
Interestingly  in line with recent international trends in the management of gold reserves  the OenB changed its gold storage policy  shifting it toward domestic storage  By the end of 2014  OeNB held around 80 percent of its gold reserves in the United Kingdom  around 17 percent in Austria and about 3 percent in Switzerland  According to the new gold storage policy adopted five years ago  by 2020 at the latest  half of OeNB s total gold reserves  280 tons   are to be stored in Austria  30 percent of them are to remain in the UK while 20 percent are to be kept in Switzerland 
The shift reflects the central bank s response to a significant increase in public interest in OeNB s management of its gold reserves  The rise in awareness about the importance of gold reserves and in central banks  transparency should be welcomed by all gold lovers 
Inside Perspective On The Global Financial Crisis
Another interesting article is  Inside Perspective on the 2008 Financial Crisis and the Lessons Learned  by Mike Silva  who served as Tim Geithner s  and later William Dudley s  chief of staff at the New York Fed during the Great Recession  The author clearly explains why the Fed rescued Bear Steans and AIG  NYSE AIG   but not Lehman Brothers  The issue was simple  the latter did not have adequate collateral for the Fed to lend against  as  according to the Federal Reserve Act  the US central bank could lend to a non bank if it determined that it was  secured to its satisfaction  
Silva believes that the next financial crisis is likely to happen sooner rather than later  because of the large number of possible crisis triggers that are currently being squeezed   think about Brexit  nearly inverted yield curve or record leveraged lending   This is good news for gold  However  the author adds that because of the improved capital  liquidity and risk management   the next financial crisis is unlikely to result in a banking crisis   This is not so good news for gold  as the yellow metal shines the most during recessions which are accompanied by a banking crisis 
Changes In The Automotive Sector And Its Impact On PGM Usage
The third article we would like to analyze is  Future Propulsion System Mix and Its Impact on Automotive PGM Usage  by Rahul Mital  the Global Technical Specialist for Diesel Aftertreatment at General Motors  NYSE GM   The author examines the impact of the automotive propulsion system mix on precious metals usage in the coming years  According to him  86 percent of passenger cars are still expected to have an IC engine and  hence  a catalytic converter by 2030  This implies no drop in demand for converters and the usage of precious metals  for the next 10 years  as the lower percentage share will be counteracted by higher car sales  In fact  we could see a marginal increase from now till 2030  as lower emission levels would mean that the converters will need more precious metals to achieve those more stringent emission levels  Indeed  Amanda Josey  in a complementing article  World Emissions Standards  Opportunities   Risks for PGMs in Automotive Catalysis   projects a 3 percent increase in demand for platinum group metals until 2027 driven by regulation 
Centenary Of London Gold Price
Last but not least  the newest Alchemist notes that this year marks the centenary of the first gold London gold fix or what is now known as the LBMA Gold Price  The first fixing took place on September 12  1919 and the price of gold was settled at  4 18 s 9d by the five founding members  NM Rothschild   Sons  chair   Mocatta   Goldsmid  Pixley   Abell  Samuel Montagu   Co  and Sharps Wilkins  Over the years  the London Fix has evolved and modernized  One of the most significant changes occurred in 1968  when the price changed from sterling to dollars and took place twice a day  Today  it still remains the international benchmark price for the gold market used as reference price by miners  refiners  central banks  investors  traders and fabricators around the globe  Indeed  as we pointed out many times  the international price of gold is set in the London gold market and in Comex  not in India or China  despite their large retail markets 
Disclaimer  Please note that the aim of the above analysis is to discuss the likely long term impact of the featured phenomenon on the price of gold and this analysis does not indicate  nor does it aim to do so  whether gold is likely to move higher or lower in the short  or medium term  In order to determine the latter  many additional factors need to be considered  i e  sentiment  chart patterns  cycles  indicators  ratios  self similar patterns and more  and we are taking them into account  and discussing the short  and medium term outlook  in our trading alerts

173192,394708,AIG,I m Still Shorting AIG,opinion,"One of my many short positions is one that I have based my investment on not just a chart but on vitriolic hatred  The company is American International Group  NYSE AIG   The company cranks out all kinds of deceptive and misleading ads about all the fine work they re doing  but let s remember what happened in 2008 and with one particular criminal  Joe Cassano  shall we 
Cassano is alleged to have been responsible for losses of  500bn   360bn  dealing in worthless  toxic  debts  The team that he headed took huge bets on complex financial instruments called  credit default swaps  used to insure US mortgages and other debts  When the US housing market fell out  the team realised that they had to come up with half a trillion dollars and all they had was a couple of million  The company received a  132 billion taxpayer bailout 
When he was sacked in March 2008 Cassano received  280 million in cash and an additional  34 million in bonuses  He continued to receive  1 million a month until the end of September 2008  even after AIG had received  85 billion in government support  When asked in October why the company still retained Cassano at his  1 million a month rate CEO Martin Sullivan told Congress AIG wanted to  retain the 20 year knowledge that Mr  Cassano had  
Apparently Mr  Cassano has dedicated himself to  philanthropy  since those days  which I suppose means giving 0 05  of his wealth to charity each year so he can attend festive social gatherings  In any event  here s the chart  and my fervent wish is for a repeat of 2008  except this time  for the company to go bankrupt As God Intended back in 2008 ",2018-11-09,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/im-still-shorting-aig-200357703,200357703
173193,394709,AIG,Forget AIG  Buy These Insurance Stocks Instead,opinion,The stock of American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   has fallen out of favor with investors  having missed estimates in five quarters on the trot due to weak performance by its General Insurance segment  unfavorable reserve release  low investment income and loss from catastrophe Year to date  shares of the company have lost 27   which is more than the   s decline of 16  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 15 3  downward over the last 30 days  reflecting analysts  pessimism  Given the headwinds facing the company  we believe that its stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters Why is the Stock Down Revenues  which have been declining every year since 2013  continued the downward journey in the first nine months of 2018  The bottom line for the first nine months also remained under pressure  Lackluster results were an outcome of lower premium in the company s Life and Retirement business and high catastrophe losses  Also  performance of its General Insurance business has not been too impressive  though premium written has grown 2 2  in the first nine months of 2018  The segment generated underwriting loss of  2 1 billion  down 42  year over year  The company s nature of operations exposes it to weather related losses  America International Group incurred catastrophe loss of  4 17 billion in 2017  up 213  year over year  Its catastrophe loss of  2 15 billion was down 37  in the first nine months of 2018  which weighed on its underwriting profitability The company s return on equity of 3 44  is low compared with its industry average of 8 1   This reflects the company s relative inefficiency in using shareholders  funds Will the Stock Show Up Although results show that a number of growth initiatives  reinsurance deal with Validus  cost control efforts  acquisition of Glatfelter  hiring industry leaders in key positions  among others  taken in this segment by management are slowly taking off  we would wait and see the positive effect of the same in the underwriting results  Until the company is able to report positive earnings  the stock will remain under pressure AIG further expects to incur  300 million to  500 million of losses from Hurricane Michael in the fourth quarter  which might dent its underwriting results by increasing its claims costs A Glance at the IndustryThe Insurance industry is on a solid footing now with huge surplus capital  rising premium rates in many business lines  increasing interest rates and a solid economy The industry is witnessing an increase in premium in Commercial insurance  which accounts for about half of U S  property casualty insurance industry premium  The rate increase seen now is a result of players  response to catastrophe loss sustained in 2017  which led them to hike premium to recover losses across the affected insurance lines  This is a welcome development after the industry saw soft market conditions in three years prior to 2017   Personal lines premium is also rising after remaining low from past many years  Interest rate

173248,394764,AIG,A M  Best affirms AIG ratings after review  insurer s stock rises,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn
 Reuters    A M  Best Co affirmed its financial strength rating on American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG  on Tuesday  lifting some uncertainty over the New York based insurer s ability to meet its long term debt obligations  which had unsettled some investors 
AIG s stock ticked up after A M  Best issued its rating  ending the day up 1 3 percent 
The largest U S  underwriter of commercial property and casualty insurance has been through a turbulent few months 
In January  it announced a deal to pay  10 2 billion to Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc to take on many of its long term commercial insurance policies  as the losses it expects to pay out on them continues to grow 
In February  AIG made a  5 6 billion addition to its reserves to cover future commercial insurance claims on policies it had already written  which led the company to report an unexpectedly large fourth quarter loss  jolting investors and AIG s board 
In March  Chief Executive Peter Hancock  who had been under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn since 2015  announced his resignation  even though he was only part way through his plan to turn around the insurer s fortunes  Earlier this month AIG named Brian Duperreault as its new CEO 
A M  Best launched its review after AIG announced the Berkshire deal  and it has cast a shadow of the insurer for the past four months 
 We view this announcement as a positive step in AIG s plans to improve its franchise   wrote  Barclays   LON BARC  analyst Jay Gelb in a research note on Tuesday 
A M  Best s outlook for the ratings assigned to AIG is now  stable   the specialist insurance rating firm said on Tuesday  It also affirmed ratings for AIG s subsidiaries 
AIG s ability to meet its long term financial obligations is  good   on A M  Best s scale  which ranges from  exceptional  to  poor  
AIG s appointment of the Bermuda born Duperreault  who spent many years at the insurer earlier in his career  was a factor in the rating decision  said A M  Best analyst Darian Ryan 
Duperreault was a prot g  of long time AIG leader Maurice  Hank  Greenberg and he went on to found and run Bermuda based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd   L4N1IH41F 
 From this review  it has been possible to make a satisfactory assessment that AIG s consolidated risk adjusted capitalization remains supportive of the ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries   Ryan wrote ",2017-05-23,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/a.m.-best-affirms-aig-ratings-after-review,-insurer's-stock-rises-487785",487785

173268,394784,AIG,Forget AIG  Buy These 3 Value Added Insurance Stocks Instead,opinion,"Multi line insurer American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   has lately been witnessing downward revisions  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings per share being revised a whopping 44 6  downward to  2 76 over the last 60 days  Also for 2018  the consensus mark has moved 7 4  south to  4 98 over the same time frame 
The stock carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and has an unimpressive  of D  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential  Hence  the stock under discussion does not look promising at present 
Further  shares of AIG have underperformed the  so far this year  The stock has lost 9 3  versus the industry s 8 7  gain 

What s Bothering AIG 
The company s Commercial insurance segment has been underperforming for several quarters  In 2016  the segment reported a pre tax operating loss of  2 74 billion while the same registered  1 3 billion in the first nine months of 2017  The segment is reeling under a rise in core losses and adverse development to account for current loss trends 
Given that the company has exited some of the casualty lines business  we expect the top line to remain under pressure  The company also had a two year plan  formed in January 2016  to improve the segment s profitability but with significant loss incurred of late  it is unlikely to achieve the goal 
Also unfavorable reserve development from past several years continues to impede underwriting results at AIG  The sluggishness further adds to the uncertainty and questions the company s underwriting discipline and claims paying ability  Also  the company s nature of operations exposes it to weather related losses  Catastrophes have historically imparted volatility to the company s earnings and will be a headwind going forward 
The company s newly appointed CEO has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy in a bid to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability  Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets  boosting the company s personal and life lines segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases 
Though on one hand  the company s forthcoming buyouts will expand its business but those might not be accretive to earnings immediately  On the other  the bottom line will be bereft of the support provided by effective buybacks till now  This might likely decrease earnings in the coming quarters 
Further  AIG s trailing 12 month return on equity  ROE  undermines its growth potential  The company s 6 1  ROE compares unfavorably with the ROE of 7 7  for the industry  reflecting that it is inefficient in using shareholder funds 
Picking Favorable Insurance Stocks
While AIG doesn t appear to be an attractive pick right now  there are a few other insurance stocks that have a better Zacks Rank and a potent Value Score to emerge as best bets  Also  these companies have outperformed the industry s rally so far this year 
With the help of the   we have zeroed in on some solid insurance stocks with a Value Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  You can see  
Kingstone Companies  Inc   NASDAQ KINS   carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a Value Score of B  The company s current quarter earnings are expected to grow 11 5  year over year  Further  shares of the company have jumped 39 3  year to date 
Radian Group Inc    NYSE RDN   is a Zacks  2 Ranked player and has a Value Score of B  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings being pegged at 8 5  year over year growth  Further  shares of the company have rallied 16 2  year to date 
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd    NYSE TPRE   has a Zacks Rank of 2 and a Value Score of B  The company s current quarter earnings are anticipated to skyrocket 265 2  year over year  Further  shares of the company have surged 45  year to date

173305,394821,AIG,The Great Disconnect  Markets vs  Economy,opinion,"The general consensus is the rise in capital markets  despite global weakness  geopolitical risks and sluggish employment and wage growth  is clearly a sign of economic strength as witnessed by rising corporate profitability 

Therefore  stocks are the only investment worth having 

My arguments are much more pragmatic 

First  it is worth noting that while the markets have risen to  all time highs   there was a massive amount of  time  lost in growing capital to meet retirement goals 



This is crucially important to understand as was something I addressed in  Stocks   The Great Wealth Equalizer  


 By the time that most individuals achieve a point in life where incomes and savings rates are great enough to invest excess cash flows  they generally do not have 30 years left to reach their goal  This is why losing 5 7 years of time getting back to  even  is not a viable investment strategy 
The chart below is the inflation return of  1000 invested in 1995 with  100 added monthly  The blue line represents the impact of the investment using simple dollar cost averaging  The red line represents a  lump sum  approach  The lump sum approach utilizes a simple weekly moving average crossover as a signal to either dollar cost average into a portfolio OR moves to cash  The impact of NOT DESTROYING investment capital by buying into a declining market is significant  





 Importantly  I am not advocating  market timing  by any means  What I am suggesting is that if you are going to invest into the financial markets  arguably the single most complicated game on the planet  then you need to have some measure to protect your investment capital from significant losses 
While the detrimental effect of a bear market can be eventually be recovered  the time lost during that process can not  This is a point that is consistently missed by the ever bullish media parade chastising individuals for not having their money invested in the financial markets  


However  setting aside that point for the moment  how valid is the argument the rise of asset prices is related to economic strength  Since companies ultimately derive their revenue from consumers buying their goods  products  and services  it is logical that throughout history stock price appreciation  over the long term  has roughly equated to economic growth  However  unlike economic growth  asset prices are psychologically driven which leads to  boom and busts  over time  Looking at the current economic backdrop as compared to asset prices we find a very large disconnect 

Since Jan 1st of 2009  through the end of June  the stock market has risen by an astounding 130 51   However  if we measure from the March 9  2009 lows  the percentage gain explodes to more than 200   With such a large gain in the financial markets we should see a commensurate indication of economic growth   right 



The reality is that after 3 massive Federal Reserve driven  Quantitative Easing  programs  a maturity extension program  bailouts of TARP  TGLP  TGLF  etc   HAMP  HARP  direct bailouts of Bear Stearns  AIG  GM  bank supports  etc   all of which total more than  33 Trillion  the economy grew by just  2 64 Trillion  or a whopping 16 7  since the beginning of 2009  The ROI equates to  12 50 of interventions for every  1 of economic growth 

Not a very good bargain 

Furthermore  the Fed s monetary programs have inflated the excess reserves of the major banks by roughly 332  during the same period of time  The increases in excess reserves  which the banks can borrow for effectively zero  have been funneled directly into risky assets in order to create returns 

With the Fed threatening to withdraw the reinvestment from their massive balance sheet  one has to ask just how much risk to asset prices there currently is 

Unfortunately  while Wall Street has benefited greatly from the Fed s interventions  Main Street has not  Over the past few years  as asset prices surged higher  there has been very little translation into actual economic prosperity for a large majority of Americans  This is reflective of weak wage  economic and inflationary growth which has led to a surge in consumer debt to record levels 



Of course  weak economic growth has led to employment growth that is primarily a function of population growth  As I addressed  


 The first is that the number of  real  employees  while growing  is in lower income producing and temporary jobs  and the rate of job growth is substantially lower than the growth of the population  




While reported unemployment is hitting historically low levels  there is a swelling mass of uncounted individuals that have either given up looking for work or are working multiple part time jobs  This can be clearly seen in the chart below which is the working age population of those between the ages of 16 and 54 as a percentage of that same age group   This analysis strips out the argument of retiring baby boomers  who ironically  aren t retiring  not because they don t want to 



These higher levels of under and unemployment have kept pressures on wages even as work hours have lengthened  The declines in real income are evident as the burgeoning  real  labor pool  and demand for higher wage work  is actually suppressing wages as companies opt for increasing productivity  continued outsourcing  and streamlining employment to protect corporate profit margins  However  as the cost of living is affected by the rising food  energy and health care prices without a compensatory increase in incomes   more families are forced to turn to assistance in order to survive 



Without government largesse  many individuals would literally be living on the street  The chart above shows all the government  welfare  programs and current levels to date  The black line represents the sum of the underlying sub components  While unemployment insurance has tapered off after its sharp rise post the financial crisis  social security  Medicaid  Veterans  benefits and other social benefits have continued to rise 

Importantly  for the average person  these social benefits are critical to their survival as they make up more than 22  of real disposable personal incomes  With 1 5 of incomes dependent on government transfers  it is not surprising that the economy continues to struggle as recycled tax dollars used for consumption purposes have virtually no impact on the overall economy 

It is extremely hard to create stronger  organic  economic growth when the dependency on recycled tax dollars to meet living requirements remains so high 

But  Earnings Have Beaten Estimates 

Corporate profits have surged since the end of the last recession which has been touted as a definitive reason for higher stock prices  While I cannot argue the logic behind this case  as earnings per share are an important driver of markets over time  it is important to understand that the increase in profitability has not come strong increases in revenue at the top of the income statement 

The chart below shows the deviation between the widely touted OPERATING EARNINGS  earnings before all the  bad  stuff  versus REPORTED EARNINGS which is what all historical valuations are based on  I have also included revenue growth as well 

This is a not a new anomaly  but has been a consistent  meme  since the end of the financial crisis  As the chart below shows while earnings per share have risen by over 260  since the beginning of 2009   revenue growth has barely eclipsed 30  



As expected  since the economy is 70  driven by personal consumption  GDP growth and revenues have grown at roughly equivalent rates 

While suppressed wage growth  layoffs  cost cutting  productivity increases  accounting gimmickry and stock buybacks have been the primary factors in surging profitability  these actions have little effect on revenue growth  The bigger problem for investors is all of the gimmicks to win the  are finite in nature  Eventually  real rates of revenue growth will matter  However  since consumer incomes have been cannibalized by suppressed wages and interest rates   there is nowhere left to generate further sales gains from in excess of population growth 

So  while the markets have surged to  all time highs   for the majority of Americans who have little  or no  vested interest in the financial markets their view is markedly different  While the Fed keeps promising with each passing year the economy will come roaring back to life  the reality has been that all the stimulus and financial support can t put the broken financial transmission system back together again 

Eventually  the current disconnect between the economy and the markets will merge 

My bet is that such a convergence is not likely to be a pleasant one ",2017-08-17,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-great-disconnect-markets-vs-economy-200207792,200207792
173306,394822,AIG, AIG Stock Down 7  This Year  Will It Continue To Suffer ,opinion,The stock of American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   seems to be in rough waters  The company is struggling with property and casualty market challenges that are dragging down revenues of one of its most important segment   Commercial Insurance Other macro factors such as low interest rates  currency exchange rates  credit and equity market conditions  catastrophic claims events are also acting as dampeners Whats dragging down the stockAIG s top line has suffered over the years from declining premium due to disciplined underwriting  competitive market conditions and reduction in business due to numerous divestitures taken This is evident from shrinking revenues since 2010  except in 2012  that continued till the first half of 2017  The company is unlikely to see any respite in the coming quarters as a highly competitive property and casualty market  and continued business dispositions will keep the top line under pressure AIG is aggressively looking to mend its commercial lines business but has also confessed to a tough market environment  which may require axing of some lines that fail to meet profitability targets  This will lead to forgone business which will further compress top line growth The company became a victim of its own mammoth size with numerous unrelated business under its umbrella that created very little or no synergy  Many of its low return generating business lines along with an ailing industry dragged down results to such an extent that it led activist investor Carl Icahn to call for rapid reforms at the company Icahn demanded the sale of non core parts of the company and reduction of its size to a manageable level  Management therefore took a number of steps aimed at rightsizing operations by cutting workforce  divesting units  reducing expense  making leadership changes  and returning funds to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments Though these measures helped in cutting costs and returning capital to share holders  the company was unable to address revenue growth challenges in Commercial Insurance Share Price Performance Year to date  shares of AIG have lost 7 1   significantly underperforming the  s gain of 10 7   Even the recent second quarter results which came in better than expected  beating the estimates by 27 5   offered no help to the stock  which has lost 7 9  since the earnings release compared with the decline of 5 5  endured by the industry The company s shares must have taken a beating due to the discontinuance of guidance and management targets  The absence of forward guidance or targets has cast doubts over the company s future profitability  Management  however  disclosed a shift in its capital utilization strategy  It will now utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets  personal and life lines  and domestic middle market as opposed to significant capital used for share repurchases till now Though the acquisitions to be made by the company will expand its business  these may not be accretive to earnings immediately  On the other hand  the bottom line will be bereft of support provided by significant buybacks till now  This will likely drain earnings in the coming quarters Though the company has undertaken massive turnaround initiatives and has changed its leadership in the hope that the new management will bring stability  investors will remain skeptical for some time before these actions are reflected in its financials  Till then  the stock is expected to remain under pressure AIG carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked players in the space are Atlas Financial Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ AFH    Markel

 Reuters    Samuel Merksamer  who represents billionaire Carl Icahn on several corporate boards  has exited the activist investor s firm and a source familiar with his plans said that he is exploring launching his own hedge fund 
At the same time Vincent Intrieri  another long time Icahn executive who also sits on boards on behalf of the activist investor  retired from the firm  the source said 
Merksamer had since 2008 been a managing director at Icahn Capital  a unit of Icahn Enterprises LP  and served on the boards of more than a dozen companies on his behalf  according to biographies on corporate websites 
He will continue to serve as Icahn s representative on several corporate boards  maintaining his ties to his long time employer whom he left on good terms  the source said 
Merksamer currently sits on the boards of American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG    Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG   Navistar International Corp  Ferrous Resources Ltd  Hertz Global Holdings Inc and Cheniere Energy Inc

Similarly Intrieri is expected to continue serving as a director  the source said  He currently sits on boards at Transocean  Hertz Global Holdings  Ferrous Resources  Navistar and previously served as a director at Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE CHK  
 After almost nine years  it is time to move on from Icahn Capital and do something else   Merksamer had written colleagues in a December 2016 email  He did not give a reason for his departure or say what he would be doing next 
The source who is familiar with Merksamer s plans said he is considering opening his own investment fund  something several of Icahn s former employees have done with financial help from their former boss 
Icahn  who stopped managing money for outside investors in 2011  did not immediately respond to requests for comment

173350,394866,AIG,Insurance gaps leave shipping exposed to growing cyber threats,news,"By Jonathan Saul and Carolyn Cohn LONDON  Reuters    Shipping companies grappling with the threat of cyber attacks on vessels are finding insurance policies often fall short  officials involved in both industries say  a risk that could feed through into global prices  Digitalization means electricity networks  emergency services  industry and agriculture are all vulnerable to hacking by criminal gangs for extortion or  for political reasons  by militant groups or foreign states  But ships are also exposed to interference through electronic navigation devices such as the Global Positioning System  GPS  and lack the backup systems airliners have to prevent crashes  With 90 percent of world trade transported by vessels  the stakes are high  Gaps in insurance for ship owners and the disruptions that could cause have the potential to drive up both industrial and consumer prices   In a particularly secretive industry  information about the nature of attacks is scarce  which insurance and shipping officials say is an obstacle to mitigating the risk  There is also a gap in provision  because most existing cyber or hull insurance policies will not cover the risk of a navigation system being jammed or physical damage to the ship caused by a hacking attack   Shipping is very vulnerable not just to jamming of their systems but now to spoofing as well   said professor David Last  strategic advisor to the government affiliated General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland  referring to devices that can transmit false GPS signals  The most high profile reported cyber attacks involving shipping so far had wider targets  Last year  South Korea said hundreds of fishing vessels had returned early to port after its GPS signals were jammed by North Korea  which denied responsibility  and an earlier hack by drug traffickers diverted containers in Belgium s Antwerp port  Other cases have had a lower profile  U S  Coast Guard officials have said GPS interference disrupted operations at an undisclosed U S  port for several hours in 2014 and reported a similar attack at a non U S  port  also unnamed  in 2015  In the latter attack  the Coast Guard said affected ships were able to navigate using radar  compasses and landmarks and urged operators to make sure such skills were not lost  It also called for more information sharing on cyber threats  RANSOMWARE North  a British based international marine mutual liability insurer  said last month there were likely to be gaps in cover as there was little data and risks were not well understood  Jamie Monck Mason  executive director for cyber and TMT at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson  said attacks on ships were not covered by the insurance shipowners have traditionally held   Marine hull and cargo policies typically contain a cyber attack exclusion   he said  while adding that large policyholders could negotiate to have the exclusion removed  However  an earlier report by North said attempts to cause shipping accidents were rare at the moment   The risks of this are currently thought to be low for most companies   it said  A veil was lifted on the scale of the wider problem when CSO Alliance  a trade association for maritime security professionals  said a quarter of the ship owners represented at a confidential workshop it had run admitted cyber incidents in the past year  Ship operator Consolidated Marine Management said in a presentation last month that  ransomware  attacks  where hackers scramble a ship s computer system and seek a ransom to unscramble it  were one of the main challenges   SILENT  POLICY Regulators are also concerned that a  silent  property policy   which neither mentions nor excludes cyber attacks   is not adequate  a problem too for other industries that face cyber attacks on their property such as power plants  Britain s insurance regulator said in November such policies could leave insurers open to large losses from cyber breaches and that policy holders  may find it challenging to understand whether they are covered   The world s number one container shipping line Maersk acknowledged the cyber risk to its fleet and said it was working to mitigate it   We currently see a trend towards the gap in insurance cover being closed   it said  Products are emerging from specialist insurer Sciemus Cyber Ltd as well as large insurers such as American International Group Inc NYSE AIG   while reinsurer Munich Re is also developing cover   It s about figuring out how to connect the gap between a property loss and a cyber loss   said Dieter Berg  head of business development  marine at Munich Re and president of the International Union of Marine Insurers   This is the process of discussion with the client   where is your exposure   AIG launched a standalone cyber policy last year  CyberEdge Plus  which protects the policyholder from property damage among other issues  It did not immediately respond to a request for pricing comment and has previously declined to discuss pricing  Sciemus was not immediately available to comment on the cost of its policies  It has said it charges energy utilities about  100 000 for  10 million in data breach insurance and as much as seven times that to cover attacks causing physical damage  Following an attack on a Ukrainian power plant in 2015  large utility companies have warned of their exposure to cyber risks in annual reports to regulators and that their insurance coverage might not cover all expenses related to an attack  
Those kind of warnings are largely absent from company reports in the shipping world  which is just waking up to the risks and has tight margins to take into account due to a near decade long industry slump  Graeme Charnock  chief financial officer with Peel Ports  which operates Liverpool port among other terminals in the UK and Ireland  said it was going through a risk assessment and would share it with its insurers in due course   To the extent cover is available  it will ultimately come down to how much it costs as measured against the perceived threats  ",2017-01-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/insurance-gaps-leave-shipping-exposed-to-growing-cyber-threats-452731,452731

Meanwhile  in the U K   market participants will be looking ahead to reports on consumer prices  employment and retail sales for further indications on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy 
Elsewhere  Germany is to publish preliminary data on fourth quarter economic growth on Tuesday for further hints on the strength of the euro zone s economy 
Preliminary data on Japanese fourth quarter growth will also be in focus  amid concerns over recent yen strength and its implication on economic growth prospects 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Fed Chair Yellen Testifies
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is set to deliver her semi annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC 
Yellen is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 00AM ET  15 00GMT  Tuesday  On Wednesday  she will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10AM ET 
Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when it might raise interest rates 
The Fed left borrowing costs unchanged earlier this month and gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate hike 
Fed fund futures are pricing in a less than 15  chance of a rate hike in March  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  However  odds of a June increase was seen at more than 65  
The U S  central bank has previously projected three rate increases this year  However  traders remained unconvinced  with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year 
2  U S  January Inflation   Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will publish January inflation figures at 8 30AM ET  13 30GMT  Wednesday  Market analysts expect consumer prices to ease up 0 3   while core inflation is forecast to increase 0 2  
On a yearly base  core CPI is projected to climb 2 1   Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories  The central bank usually tries to aim for 2  core inflation or less 
Rising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates 
At the same time Wednesday  the Commerce Department will publish data on January retail sales  The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 1  last month  after gaining 0 6  in December  Core sales are forecast to inch up 0 4   after rising 0 2  a month earlier 
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth  while weaker sales signal a declining economy  Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70  of U S  economic growth 
Besides the inflation and retail sales reports  this week s calendar also features U S  data on producer prices  industrial production  building permits  housing starts  initial jobless claims  as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions 
Headlines from Washington will most likely continue to dictate market sentiment in the week ahead  as traders focus on President Donald Trump for further details on his promises of tax reform  infrastructure spending and deregulation as well as trade policies 
Earnings from the likes of PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  and AIG  NYSE AIG  are also on the radar this week 
3  U K  CPI  Employment   Retail Sales for January
The U K  Office for National Statistics will release data on consumer price inflation for January at 09 30GMT  4 30AM ET  on Tuesday  Analysts expect consumer prices to rise 1 9   after increasing 1 6  a month earlier 
At 09 30GMT  4 30AM ET  Wednesday  the ONS will publish the monthly jobs report  The claimant count change is expected to rise by 1 000 in January  with the jobless rate holding steady at 4 8   Wage growth including bonuses is forecast to rise 2 8  
On Friday  the ONS will produce a report on January retail sales at 09 30GMT  4 30AM ET   with analysts expecting an increase of 1 0   following a drop of 1 9  in the preceding month 
The Bank of England raised its forecasts for growth and inflation earlier this month  but appeared in no rush to raise interest rates 
4  German  Euro Zone Q4 GDP
Germany will publish a preliminary report on fourth quarter economic growth at 07 00GMT  2 00AM ET  on Tuesday  The euro zone s largest economy is forecast to expand 0 5  in the October December period  compared to growth of 0 2  in the preceding quarter 
The euro zone will release revised fourth quarter growth data shortly afterwards at 10 00GMT  05 00AM ET   An initial estimate published late last month showed that the region s economy grew 0 5  in the three months ended December 31  accelerating from growth of 0 4  in the third quarter

173365,394881,AIG,AIG Restructuring Continues With Japan Life Business Sale ,opinion,Continuing its efforts to recalibrate its business to focus on core operations  American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   has entered into a strategic agreement with FWD Group  the insurance arm of Pacific Century Group  Per the agreement  American International will sell its Japan life insurance business AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company  Ltd   AFLI  to FWD Group The timing and the financial terms of the deal has been kept under wraps For AIG  Japan remains a major market and the company has been operating in this region for nearly 70 years now  Though this deal will lead the company to relinquish its life business  it is committed to continue with its extensive non life insurance business in the region The non life business provides commercial insurance and services  personal insurance coverage lines  accident   health  auto  homeowners  and travel insurance through the company s units   Fuji Fire   Marine  Ltd   AIU Insurance Company  Ltd   and American Home Assurance Company  Ltd AIGhas been busy shedding assets and selling non core business in an effort to simplify its business by releasing tied up funds and focusing on core operations that have the potential to generate higher return on equity To this effect  AIGhas entered into a number of strategic deals recently  Last month  the company entered into strategic agreements with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited to offload its commercial and consumer insurance operations in Argentina  Chile  Colombia  Uruguay  Venezuela and Turkey  It will also sell to Fairfax renewal rights for the portfolio of local business written by its Central and Eastern European  CEE  operations in Bulgaria  Czech Republic  Hungary  Poland  Romania  and Slovakia  Fairfax will also take over AIG s CEE operating assets and employees   In September  sources reported that Ascot Underwriting Holdings Ltd   the Lloyd s of London insurer tied to American International Group Inc  will be bought by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  The deal  valued at  1 1 billion  would fetch American International  240 million for its 20  share in business and ownership of a related unit in the deal   AIG has undertaken other several divestures in a bid to make the company leaner  AIG was a victim of the financial crisis in 2008 and was rescued by the government  It has generated more than  90 billion in funds by selling assets and businesses since then  AIG s restructuring initiatives gathered steam in recent months after its CEO  Peter Hancock was attacked by billionaire investor Carl Icahn last year November through a letter in which he created pressure on the former to slim down the massive company by dividing it into three parts   property and casualty  life and mortgage insurance  According to Icahn  these three businesses were so diverse that they together provided little or no synergistic effect  Also  the company s mammoth size acted as a hindrance in its own path to progress as evident by its underperformance from the past several years   Though AIG has taken numerous divestures since 2008  it could not generate the anticipated returns  The company has therefore taken a series of steps since Nov 2015  after Peter Hancock was threatened to be replaced from his job  In the beginning of 2016  the company announced that it will return  25 billion to its shareholders over two years  In view of this  in August  the company announced that it will sell its mortgage insurance unit United Guaranty Corporation to Arch Capital Group Ltd   NASDAQ ACGL   or  3 4 billion  Also  in August  AIG completed the sale of its Taiwan unit  In May  the company completed the sale of Advisor Group to investment funds affiliated with Lightyear Capital LLC   Other steps taken recently to drive up returns from AIG include the announcement made in August of a new share buyback plan to repurchase of additional shares with an aggregate purchase price of up to  3 0 billion  Prior to this  in Feb 2016  it authorized an additional  5 billion in share repurchases  The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 14  this year   Moreover  the company formed a new Executive Leadership Team structure comprising 10 heads   all veterans in their respective fields   to work toward attaining the strategic priorities of the company  Several jobs were slashed  including those at senior positions in the company in order save cost   Despite these numerous measures taken by AIG  it still has far to go to improve its profitability  We  however  believe the company is on the right track and is progressing well AMER INTL GRP Price   Currently  AIG carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better placed stocks from the same sector are James River Group Holdings  Ltd    NASDAQ JRVR   and Radian Group Inc    NYSE RDN   both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   James River Group posted a positive surprise in three

173369,394885,AIG,AIG Touches 52 Week High On Successful Strategic Planning ,opinion,On Dec 7  2016  shares of the multi line insurance giant  American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   reached to an all time high of  64 99  Despite disappointing results in three out of the last four quarters  the stock seems to have gained investors  attention with the rapid recalibration of its business and other growth initiatives At the very onset of the year  the company updated its business restructuring strategy which targeted geographical regions and segments with critical mass and expertise  while improving multinational capabilities So far this year  the company has been continuously taking steps in this direction  Shares have  however  returned 4 8   underperforming the Zacks categorized Insurance Multi Line industry s return of 11 3  over the same time frame   The underperformance shows that investors are closely watching the several turnround actions taken taken by the company and their outcome  We expect the stock to gain going forward as and when the growth initiatives start bearing fruit  resulting in clear visibility for the company s profitability Since the second quarter of this year  the company has announced or completed five strategic and complex transactions  These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG s earnings and reshaping it  The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of this strategy In August  the company announced that it will sell its mortgage insurance unit United Guaranty Corporation to Arch Capital Group Ltd    NASDAQ ACGL    Also  in the same month  AIG completed the sale of its Taiwan unit  In May  the company completed the sale of Advisor Group to investment funds affiliated with Lightyear Capital LLC   The company s cost reduction initiatives are also worth noting  Through the first nine months of the year  AIG remained ahead of its 6  planned reduction with a 10  decline in gross operating expense  The company expects expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of its plan as a result of actions taken across its operations Apart from fixing parts of its business and reducing costs  the company has taken steps to free up capital  In this regard  it completed a Life Reinsurance transaction in the third quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately  1 billion of excess statutory capital from its U S  life companies to AIG While this was the company s first completed Life Reinsurance transaction that is expected to free up  4 billion to  5 billion of capital by the end of 2017  it remains focused on and confident about executing additional Life Reinsurance transactions  The company has also halved its hedge fund allocation  which is expected to free up  2 billion to meet  its capital return target by the end of 2017 The company is also executing well on its capital return target  In August  the company announced a new share buyback plan to repurchase additional shares with an aggregate purchase price of up to  3 0 billion  In Feb 2016  it had authorized an additional  5 billion in share repurchases  The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 14  this year AIG carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell    Better ranked stocks from the same sector include James River Group Holdings  Ltd    NASDAQ JRVR   and FBL Financial Group Inc    NYSE FFG    both carrying a Zacks Rank   2  Buy   You can see  James River Group posted a positive surprise in three of the past four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 60  FBL Financial Group posted a positive surprise in two of the past four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 26  Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website  how would you like to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time Our experts cover all kinds of trades  from value to momentum       from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  You can even look inside exclusive portfolios that are normally closed to new investors  Starting today  for the next month  you can have unrestricted access ,2016-12-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aig-touches-52-week-high-on-successful-strategic-planning-200168998,200168998
173371,394887,AIG,FTSE Upbeat As Energy Stocks Lead Gains,opinion,"It appears that both OPEC and non OPEC producers are well decided to sustain the recovery in oil prices  Last week  Brent s failure to break above  55 barrel and the WTI s downside correction towards  50 barrel apparently displeased Saudi Arabia and brought the world s leading oil producer to unexpectedly signal a larger output cut than previously agreed on at the November 30th meeting in Vienna  In addition  Russia reiterated its plans to pump lower quantities in 2017 
Oil prices hit a seventeen month high in Asia  Both Brent and WTI gapped higher at the open and rallied past 4  into the European open  Decisive comments from the supply side could encourage a further rise of the price of a barrel of WTI to  55  before  58 15  major 38 2  retracement on Jun 14 to Jan 16 drop   The barrel of a Brent could challenge  60 barrel for the first time since mid 2015 
The impending Aramco IPO could be a reasonable explanation for Saudi s eagerness in securing a mid term recovery in oil prices  The value of Aramco will of course increase if Saudi Arabia manages to generate a sustainable momentum to help oil prices higher 
Nevertheless  as the price of a barrel rises  an increasing number of oil producers are expected to reach the breakeven point and return to the market  At around  70 barrel  we expect many producers that have been left off sight to restart producing  Therefore  the depth in the supply side could rapidly jeopardize the recovery in the mid term

Turkish lira slides
The Turkish lira remains on slippery ground following the weekend s terrorist attacks at the central district of Besiktas in Istanbul  Combined with high political and geopolitical risks  questionable central bank independency and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s aggressive push for lower interest rates  rising social unrest and overheating discussions regarding the looming constitutional referendum that would give President Erdogan the supreme power  tensions on the lira and lira denominated assets are certainly not ready to ease 
In addition  higher oil and commodity prices are expected to reinforce the selling pressure on the lira 
Although the substantial fall in the lira could encourage technical traders to build fresh long positions in the short term  we reiterate our mid term bearish bias in the lira against the leading G10 and EM currencies and warn that even short term  long exposure to the Turkish lira is very risky

The AUD USD treaded water  The rise in iron ore prices and improved risk appetite bolstered buyers  while the rising US yields kept carry traders on the sidelines  The U S  10 Year yield curve surged to 2 49  ",2016-12-12,Ipek Ozkardeskaya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ftse-upbeat-as-energy-stocks-lead-gains-200169418,200169418

173383,394899,AIG,American International s Strategic Divestures To Fuel Growth,opinion,"On Sep 26  2016  we have issued an updated research report on American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   
The New York based company is primarily engaged in the provision of insurance  financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in over 130 countries  Its buoyant inorganic growth story involves numerous mergers  acquisitions and strategic alliances 
In order to drive the bottom line growth  the company has taken up several cost control initiatives  This gradual yet effective reduction in expenses has boosted the company s operating efficiency  The company has reduced operating expenses by 11  during the first six months of 2016 
Further  the company s financial strength supports it to deploy capital effectively  The insurer remains focused on enhancement of shareholders  value  To this end  it has returned  7 2 billion of capital to its investors in the first half of 2016  The company also expressed its intention to reduce hedge fund allocation roughly by 50  in order to achieve its capital return target by the end of 2017 
Divestures are another preferred strategy of the company to focus on businesses generating higher return on equity  The company axes its unprofitable and underperforming operations to save capital for the continuous restructuring efforts it takes up  The company has successfully completed more than 50 asset sales and divestures since 2008 and generated proceeds of  90 billion from the same  Frequent operational and structural reorganization has helped the company to streamline its productivity 
However  the persistently soft interest rate has spelt doom for several insurance sector bigwigs like CNO Financial Group Inc   NYSE CNO    James River Group Holdings Ltd   NASDAQ JRVR    ageas SA NV   OTC AGESY   to name a few  This weak interest rates have drastically lowered net investment income of these companies and American International is no exception to the trend 
Moreover the company s global market share has been largely hampered by its enormous divesture initiatives  The loss from discontinued operations as well as catastrophe losses have adversely impacted the company s bottom line  Apart from these  unfavorable reserve development in last four consecutive years have weakened the company s capital base  Negatives like these have led to a rating downgrade from A M Best

173384,394900,AIG,2008 Redux  The Next Financial Crisis Could Come From Europe,opinion,"A financial system stability assessment report  from the International Monetary Fund  IMF   on one bank in Europe identified Deutsche Bank   as the TOP bank that poses the greatest systemic risk to the global financial system  Systemic risk was identified as a major contributing factor in the  financial crisis  of 2008  This is essentially the risk of contagion by the failure of one firm leading to failures throughout its  industry 
In February I talked about Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB  as the next major bank to fail  Since then price has plunged 31  and its likely headed much lower still 

IMF  The Top Bank That Poses Global Financial Risk Is DEUTSCHE BANK

Deutsche Bank s  75 Trillion In Derivatives Is 20 Times Greater Than German GDP

Deutsche Bank was historically one of the most respected banks in the world  Today  it is increasingly the subject of reports that it is on the verge of collapse which was primarily due to a massive exposure to derivatives estimated at  50 to  70 trillion  The bank has struggled continuously since the 2008 financial crisis  and its stock price  as of late July 2016  stood at a new seven year low of just  14 57 per share which is less than 10  of its peak price  in 2007  before the  financial crisis  

The bank s CDS spread shot up to recent highs  a CDS is a measure of risk   higher is bad  while its share price has hit 33 year lows  DB has been struggling in Europe s negative interest rate environment  Negative interest rates have been crushing European and Japanese banks 
Deutsche Bank s CEO John Cryan told analysts that to compensate  banks will increase fees and take other measures which will be passed on to customers 
 
The bank was hit with a  2 5 billion fine in October 2015 for its involvement in the LIBOR scandal regarding interest rate rigging  In January 2016  it announced a record loss of more than  6 billion for 2015 which is a stunning reversal from a 2014 profit of  1 6 billion 
In past articles  I issued a warning that Deutsche Bank was massively leveraged and that its problems were most probably insurmountable  In June 2016  the Fed announced that Deutsche Bank had failed its stress test for the second year in a row  The bank was also hit by the Brexit decision seeing as it derived nearly 20  of its revenues from the United Kingdom 
Does Deutsche Bank Have Similarities to Lehman 
The biggest problem that Deutsche Bank faces is excessive leverage on its balance sheet  It faces insurmountable challenges from poor performing core businesses and a lack of capital  I believe that the company ultimately must raise more equity capital to solve its leverage problems 
Deutsche Bank s valuation highlights the market s pessimism  As of June 15th  2016  the bank traded at 27  of tangible book value  which means that the company is worth less than its liquidation value 
In 2008  failures at Lehman Brothers and American International Group Inc   NYSE AIG  led to a run on banks and imperiled the financial system  Similarly  a failure at Deutsche Bank will have catastrophic consequences for the banking system during 2016 
The U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  has ordered Deutsche Bank AG  DE DBKGn   DB  to pay  14 billion in order to settle claims of miss selling mortgage backed securities  Deutsche Bank said it would fight a  14 billion demand by the U S  Department of Justice to settle claims that it miss sold mortgage backed securities which raises questions about the future of Germany s largest lender 
The bank s market value is about  18 billion  A pending fine of  14 billion is not a good sign  The bank  which is already battling multiple legal cases  has only around  6 billion in its litigation reserves  Therefore  paying a  14 billion fine would seriously impact the capital structure of the bank  It is important to note that Deutsche Bank has already been struggling in terms of profitability 
The Destruction Of An Illusion
Last Monday  September 26th  2016  their stock crashed yet again  down another 6   Its bonds have slumped  while the cost of credit default  swaps  are essentially a way of hedging against a collapse  It all has a very 2008 deja vu feeling to it 

Markets should be bracing themselves for the worst outcome  The European  debt crisis  will create long term systemic risks for ALL banks  Shares in all European banks continue to lag while at the same time U S  indexes are making all time highs 
Deutsche Bank has struggled in Europe s negative interest rate environment and very recently the German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out a government rescue of the bank  Deutsche Bank has the second largest  derivative  book in the world  well behind JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  which is in and of itself indeed a serious concern 
If the viability of Deutsche Bank is put in jeopardy  many other Euro banks will go under as well  which would induce  global turmoil  reminiscent of 2008  The IMF has highlighted Deutsche Bank as the most important net contributor to  systemic risk   Once confidence is lost  a bank is in big trouble  If Deutsche Bank does go under  it will most likely take Merkel with it and quite possibly the euro as well ",2016-10-05,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-next-financial-crisis-will-come-from-europe!-200157090,200157090

173391,394907,AIG,Exxon probe faces uphill climb amid ambiguous accounting rules,news,"By Dena Aubin and Karen Freifeld NEW YORK  Reuters    New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman faces an uphill climb in building a case against  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM  for not writing down assets amid the oil price slump because of the broad leeway that energy companies have enjoyed reporting under U S  rules  accounting experts said  Schneiderman is investigating Exxon s accounting practices and why the oil giant has not taken writedowns even while oil prices have fallen  a person familiar with the matter told Reuters  The price drop of more than 60 percent since 2014 has forced many integrated oil producers around the world to write down the value of their wells  leases and equipment  and Exxon is the only major producer to hold off so far  Oil in many wells can no longer be profitably recovered  and failing to write them down could give a misleading picture of a company s financial health  But accounting experts said it was far from clear that Exxon s lack of writedowns signaled any wrongdoing  Accounting rules give companies a choice of methods for valuing and impairing their assets  and writedowns can vary sharply based on the method used and other factors  they said    This is an extremely subjective area   said Tom Selling  author of The Accounting Onion blog   Everyone will have a different pattern of writedowns depending on how old their fields are and how much they cost to develop   Doug Cohen  spokesman for the AG s office  declined comment  An Exxon spokesman on Friday told Reuters its accounting follows rules of the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board  which sets reporting standards for U S  public companies   The largest U S  oil companies have historically not taken large charges to write down the value of their assets when commodity prices tumble  said Brian Youngberg  oil company analyst at Edward Jones in St  Louis  Companies are reluctant to take writedowns because they reduce income and assets on the balance sheet  and once assets are written down  they cannot be written up  said Larry Crumbley  accounting professor emeritus at Louisiana State University  Accounting rules do not require companies to take impairments for a temporary drop in oil prices  but the rules do not define the timeframe of a temporary slump  said Terry Crain  accounting professor emeritus at the University of Oklahoma   Is it a month or two  or several years   Crain said   It falls in a gray area    Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   which took  2 8 billion of impairments and other charges in the second quarter  may not look at the current slump as temporary  Crain said  But Robert McTamaney  a lawyer with Carter  Ledyard   Milburn  said if companies believe prices will soon rise again  taking an impairment is the wrong move  He also noted that Exxon  as one of the nation s oldest oil producers  may be already carrying many of its rigs and other equipment at much lower prices  making writedowns unnecessary   From glancing at it  I think Exxon has substantial arguments that their accounting is correct   he said  New York attorneys generals have a powerful tool for fighting accounting misconduct with the Martin Act  the state s securities fraud statute  The act allows for both civil and criminal charges  and the attorney general does not have to prove an intent to deceive  Exxon is not the first company whose accounting has come under the scrutiny of the New York attorney general s office  Former American International Group  NYSE AIG  chief executive officer Maurice  Hank  Greenberg went on trial in New York state court Sept  13  in a case stemming from a probe of AIG s accounting practices  McTamaney  who has been critical of the use of the Martin Act by New York attorneys general over the last decade or so  said he wondered why Schneiderman is bringing a case that  if it belongs anywhere  should be with the SEC   
The SEC in 2013 questioned why Exxon had not taken an impairment charge despite stating it was making  no money  on U S  natural gas due to falling prices  according to a letter published on the commission s website  The SEC declined comment on Friday on whether it is still looking into Exxon s accounting ",2016-09-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exxon-probe-faces-uphill-climb-amid-ambiguous-accounting-rules-426792,426792

173404,394920,AIG,Insuring Against A Fall In AIG,opinion,"American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG   had a steady run higher off of a bottom in February  Rising in a channel  it moved higher for 3 months until reaching a peak at 58 50 at the end of May 
The price fell from there making a lower low following the Brexit reaction  It moved back higher to short term resistance then  and gapped higher following their earnings report August 3rd  A few days later in made a new high over the important 58 50 level and has been consolidating there ever since 
8 days ago the Bollinger Bands  started to squeeze in and it started moving lower in the range ending Friday at the bottom  The RSI has pulled back to the mid line  remaining in the bullish zone but trending lower 
The MACD is falling but positive  Wednesday last week the stock printed a Golden Cross  with the 50 day SMA crossing up through the 200 day SMA  That is a bullish signal 
There is resistance at 60 to the upside and then 63 50 before very thin prior price history  Support below 58 58 stands at 56 80 and then there is a gap to fill to 54 50  Short interest is low at 1 3   The company is due to report earnings next November 2nd and the stock goes ex dividend September 13th 
The September options chain shows large open interest on the call side at the 55 strike and on the put side at the 50 strike  These suggest a downward bias this week 
October options are also biased lower  but not as much so  with the largest put open interest at 52 50 and largest open interest on the call side at 57 50  Finally the November options  the first beyond the earnings report  shifts the price range to 57 5 to 60 based on open interest 
AIGTrade 1  If you are long the stock you might consider adding a collar for protection  Given the gap in the chart an October 14 Expiry 58 5 54 5 Put Spread would protect for a gap fill  This was offered at  1 13 late Friday  By selling the November 60 Calls  which were bid at  1 27 Friday  you can cover the entire cost of the protection 
Trade 2  If you want to own this stock on a gap fill then you might consider a 1 2 Put Spread  The October 57 5 55 1 2 Put Spread  buying a 57 5 Put and selling 2 of the 55 Puts  was offered at 18 cents late Friday  This would give participation in the downside under 57 5 until a maximum profit at 55  Under 55 you would be put the stock but with a basis of 52 50 
Trade 3  You can participate in the downside by selling the stock short on a move under 85 50  Add an October 60 Call  offered at 72 cents late Friday  as guaranteed protection against a move or gap higher

173433,394949,AIG,AIG must face Pimco lawsuit over financial crisis losses,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    American International Group Inc  N AIG  failed to persuade a California judge to dismiss a lawsuit by Pacific Investment Management Co that accuses AIG of lying about its subprime mortgage exposure prior to the 2008 financial crisis 
Judge Thierry Patrick Colaw of Orange County Superior Court  in a decision dated Tuesday  rejected AIG s argument that Pimco  a unit of German insurer Allianz SE  DE ALVG   waited too long to sue over the alleged deception 
But the judge said AIG can appeal immediately  noting that federal courts in comparable cases have reached differing conclusions over the proper time limit 
Pimco is seeking to recoup losses allegedly suffered by more than 60 funds  including its flagship Pimco Total Return   over securities purchased between 2006 and 2008 
Newport Beach  California based Pimco sued AIG last year after opting out of a  970 5 million class action settlement between the insurer and other investors 
AIG had been accused of misleading investors about its exposure to subprime mortgages and credit default swaps  culminating in  182 3 billion of federal bailouts 
Some plaintiffs opt out of class action settlements when they hope to recover more by suing on their own  Pimco has about  1 5 trillion of assets under management 
AIG spokesman Jon Diat in a statement said the New York based company disagreed with Colaw s decision and will argue on appeal that  the more recent and better reasoned decisions of the federal courts of appeal should be followed  
Pimco declined to comment on Colaw s decision 
AIG had brought related litigation in U S  District Court in Manhattan seeking to thwart Pimco s federal securities law claim  A judge there ruled on April 18 that letting the California court handle the case was better than  piecemeal  litigation

Schneiderman was forced to withdraw claims for as much as  6 billion in damages after the shareholder settlement because the state cannot seek restitution on behalf of victims who settled a class action lawsuit  even if they are not made whole   Schneiderman decided to continue to trial  seeking the bans and bonuses  Greenberg s cash bonuses in question were  24 5 million  while Smith s were  3 million  according to Matt Mittenthal  a spokesman for Schneiderman  With interest at the statutory 9 percent rate  the state is seeking more than  55 million at this point  The U S  government in a separate case last August appealed a judge s ruling that sided with Greenberg on a legal claim over AIG s bailout and found that the Federal Reserve exceeded its authority in the insurer s bailout ",2016-06-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/former-aig-chief-hank-greenberg-must-face-fraud-trial-406105,406105

capitalization As per the  report  total earnings for these companies are down  3 3  from the same period last year on  0 9  lower revenues  with 72 9  beating EPS estimates and 53 6  coming ahead of top line expectations About 80  of the companies in the Finance sector have already reported their results  Total earnings are down 4 2  while revenues have increased 1 1   The beat ratio is 66 7  for earnings and 52 8  for revenues The insurance industry is part of the broader Finance sector Here  we will focus on how the second quarter has turned up for insurers so far Earnings for insurers this quarter are featuring the impact of a rise in incurred claims and adjustment expenses  especially claims from catastrophes  as well as little growth in the U S  economy and continuing low interest rates The players will also see an earnings drain from a series of catastrophes that hit the quarter  The industry is expected to witness a higher loss ratio from 25 weather events that are estimated to cause a loss of around  15 billion to over   20 billion  These events include a wildfire in Canada  flooding in Europe  earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador and hailstorms in Texas According to Aon Benfield s report  for the first half of 2016  preliminary global economic losses reached  98 billion and global insured losses were  30 billion   the highest levels since 2011   The U S  accounted for 47  of global insurance losses incurred by public and private insurance entities in the period under review However  in spite of all the catastrophe and niggling low rates  the industry is expected to post another profitable quarter aided by capital gains and reserve releases We also expect to see favorable reserve development related to the past years led by relatively low catastrophe losses and prudent reserving practices The sector is flushed with excess capital  due to benign catastrophe activity in recent years  The players are therefore putting to work the un deployed capital by buying back shares  hiking dividends  and indulging in mergers and acquisitions  These efforts should be accretive to earnings With little sign that inflation is picking up and Brexit induced uncertainties remaining  the Fed is keen on keeping interest rates near its current lows for the foreseeable future  This will lead to depressed investment yields  consequently hurting investment income  which is one of the revenue drivers of the sector  Companies in the insurance sector will experience lower net investment income led by negative performances of alternative investments in hedge funds  This decline in investment income will be to some extent offset by an increase in invested assets A strong dollar will affect earnings of players with international exposure Let see what

173453,394969,AIG,U S  ability to police  shadow banking  under threat  senator,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Recent moves in the U S  Congress and courts could defang the country s overarching financial regulatory council when it comes to policing  shadow banking   the most powerful Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee said on Monday 
Senator Sherrod Brown  who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick  wrote to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew about possible threats to the council s regulatory reach in the area 
Lew is the chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council  which is made up of the chiefs of the country s financial regulatory agencies and was formed through the Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law in 2010 to head off a repeat of 2008 s massive financial meltdown 
 Shadow banking  usually refers to nonbanking firms carrying out services similar to those typically offered by banks  Brown wrote that  a major cause of the global financial crisis of 2008 was the failure  or near failure  of nonbank financial institutions  
 Many nonbanks took unacceptable risks prior to 2008 that resulted in catastrophic losses during the crisis  including creating dangerous exposures for the regulated banking system   Brown wrote  citing bad swaps made by insurer American International Group  N AIG  that led to a  182 billion federal bailout 
Legislation has come up in the last year in both chambers of Congress that would limit the council s reach 
Meanwhile  a recent legal decision striking down the council s designation of MetLife Inc  N MET  as a systemically important institution   essentially saying the insurer is  too big to fail    could threaten the council s regulatory powers  The federal government is appealing the decision 
Brown wrote that the council has been  analytical and thorough  in both examining and analyzing financial activities and firms  but he is concerned about  our ability to address these risks in the future  leaving our economy vulnerable to another financial crisis  
He asked Lew a series of questions covering the council s processes in identifying and monitoring  potential threats arising from the migration of financial activities to less regulated entities   legislation that could impair the council s response to threats  and additional powers the council may need 
He also asked if there were additional tools FSOC may need as it analyzes the use of leverage by hedge funds ",2016-05-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-ability-to-police-'shadow-banking'-under-threat:-senator-403904,403904
173456,394972,AIG,U S  Banks Clear Stress Test  Financial ETFs In Focus,opinion,"The results of the much awaited Federal Reserve s stress test of the big banks  financial health indicate a brighter picture despite regulatory stringency  The test   first undertaken in 2009 after the fall of big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers and American International Group  NYSE AIG   Inc    is a tool used by the financial regulators to measure whether the Wall Street banks are sound enough to endure extreme economic upheaval in the future 
Inside Stress Test Results
In the latest review  each of the 33 U S  banks cleared the Fed test  indicating that the vast majority of the country s largest financial institutions have the minimum capital levels required to combat severe chaos in the economy and market  As per   the banks had to show larger losses  however   including  113 billion in trading losses for the eight biggest firms  
Going by an article in   33 banks would incur  385 billion in loan losses over nine quarters even in an extreme case  per the Fed  Overall   a key ratio measuring high quality capital against risk weighted assets  known as the Tier 1 common equity ratio   would be 8 4   which is way higher than the 4 5  minimum requirement set by regulators  according to the source 
Wall Street Reaction 
Backed by elevated capital  an improving credit quality and reducing bad debt  banks have lived up to the expectations of the Fed as well as analysts  In fact  it grappled with the test bar that the Fed is raising every year 
 In January  the Fed added negative interest rates   something most developed economies are practicing now to fight recessionary threats   to its test criteria  So  the Fed had to ensure how well the banks would perform if the U S  economy confronts such a situation  Most analysts appeared satisfied with banks  present capital and liquidity 
Market Performance
As per sources  Citigroup   NYSE C   s Tier 1 common equity ratio expanded to 9 2  from 6 8  and its Tier 1 leverage ratio improved to 6 9  from 4 6   JPMorgan Chase   Co s   NYSE JPM   Tier 1 common equity ratio shot up to 8 3  from 6 3   Citigroup s stock jumped about 4 2  on such stellar results and added about 1  after hours on June 23  2016  JPMorgan s shares rose over 2 1  on June 23  2016 while it lost about 0 4  after hours 
Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   shares gained about 2  while it shed about 0 02  after hours  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   was yet another big beneficiary  having added over 3 4  in the key trading sessions  Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   advanced over 3   but has lost about 0 1  after hours

173465,394981,AIG,Are You Prepared For The New Rules Of The Economy ,opinion,"Are you prepared for the new rules of the economy  Can your portfolio overcome a major jolt to the world s financial system 
As we wrap up our special series on financial predictions for 2016  it s time to put our theories to practice 
It s time to prepare for what lies ahead 
Last week  I wrote you and  the typically ho hum realm of interest rates would be the biggest financial story of 2016  I m sure scores of unenthused readers immediately moved on to their next email 
Too bad for them  I m certain they are going to regret not paying attention to what s happening 
I m more convinced than ever that we ve found ourselves in a bit of a trap 
And now  it s clear that others have noticed the jarring pain around our collective leg 
I spent time last week reading through the text of a speech James Bullard  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  recently gave at the Cato Institute 
If you know Bullard s policy  you know he s a hawk with sharp talons  He s been behind Yellen  pushing her for  for many months 
But it may have been too little  too late  Even he ponders if we might be stuck 
In a speech simply titled  Permazero   Bullard admits we may have just seen the system change forever 
 Should we find ourselves in a persistent state of low nominal  interest rates and low inflation   he said   some of our fundamental assumptions about how U S  monetary policy works may have to be altered  
 During the past six years I have warned along with many others that the committee s  zero interest rate policy  has put the U S  economy at considerable risk of future inflation   Bullard said   After seven years  one might want to consider other models  
It s possible  he continued  that an equilibrium has been set that will be tough to break 
That s not good 
Bullard is stating the case for the idea of a new normal  Like us  he ponders whether the Fed s interest rates are no longer a reaction to inflation but are  in reality  the driving force 
In other words  is the current lack of inflation due to the Fed s zero interest rate policy    or is the policy due to the lack of inflation 
Historically  the Fed follows the economy  like a cart behind a horse  The Fed pulls the reins or cracks the whip to keep the beast under control  But lately it s clear Yellen has her clenched hand on the bridle and her heels dug into the dirt  pulling the stubborn economy where she wants it to go 
The latter scenario hints at a controversial theory known as Neo Fisherian economics   a revival of Irving Fisher s century old theories on interest rates 
In the Neo Fisherian view  interest rates dictate the inflation rate 

Looking at real life results across the globe s major economies  it s not difficult to see the merit of the idea  Since the fall of Lehman and American International Group Inc  N AIG  in 2008  something has changed    falling central bank benchmark rates have pulled inflation lower 

Traditional theories contend the low rates should have sent inflation climbing quickly  Clearly  that didn t happen 
Put bluntly    if the pattern holds  textbook printers are going to be busy  The Econ 101 syllabus will change 
The problem this theory presents is that it takes great power away from Yellen and her monetary maestros  It stands to take away their most powerful weapon    rate increases  If a hike in benchmark rates actually pulls inflation higher  it does the exact opposite of what current theory dictates 
In other words  it switches the reins with the whip 
That s scary 
It s an idea Bullard hints at in a couple of wordy  yet powerful sentences 
     the limits on operating monetary policy through ordinary short term nominal interest rate adjustment in this situation would surely continue to fire a search for alternative ways to conduct monetary stabilization policy   he says   The favored approach during the past five years within the G 7 economies has been quantitative easing  and there would surely be pressure to use this or related tools  
In other words  if the neo Fisherian theory holds up  the Fed would no longer rely on interest rates to control the economy  Instead  it would lean on the printing press    a practice that rarely ends with smiling citizens 
Don t get me wrong    it s not all that bad for the average investor  If it mirrors the last seven years  it s great news 
As long as you realize what s happening and adjust accordingly  you ll do well  But be unaware of the change   and rely on traditional economic ideas   and you ll soon wonder why your money isn t growing quite like you d hoped 
In a  permazero  economy  traditional investing techniques will fail 
You ll need to use a much more sophisticated bond strategy  you ll need safe dividend stocks and you ll need to own shares of companies that have business models that are immune to persistent low rates  Big banks and insurers that rely on interest rate spreads won t do well if the idea of interest rates dies 
It s a fascinating development  The weapons the Fed once used to control the economy have lost their edge 
New tactics are needed  New rules are in place  Make sure your portfolio is up to date ",2016-01-04,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-prepared-for-the-new-rules-of-the-economy-378540,378540

Throughout the early 1990 s  Orange County s fund was handsomely beating every benchmark  So much so that municipalities throughout the county were beating down Citron s door in order to invest in his magic  some cities  such as Irvine  even borrowed through bond offerings just to make available cash to put in  S P  as the bankruptcy transcript tells  even conditioned its highest investment rating on Irvine s bonds such that they were placed in Citron s  care  
The manner of the outperformance was as it usually is in modern wholesale finance  available and easy leverage of all kinds and all forms  In this specific instance  Citron was building the fund s bond portfolio not for general coupon returns but so that they were available for reverse repos  When the interest rate environment was in his favor  the Orange County fund was leveraged less than 2 to 1  when it started turning against  that was when the leverage piled up as almost a gambler s view of doubling down to  make it back  
As it turned out  even though Citron s broker Merrill Lynch had warned him about both the increasing volatility risk of an increasingly homogenous portfolio and that interest rates might rise  Citron continued on his course regardless of the advice  and Merrill kept selling securities to him and funding those positions   Later grand jury proceedings even found evidence that Mr  Citron  a  mailorder astrologer and a psychic for interest rate predictions   He was  starting in 1994  quite wrong with those predictions 
Still  the fact that rates had gone up even sharply did not alone produce catastrophe  there were no losses to book based on credit defaults or skipped coupons in any of the underlying  The  inverse floaters  at the center of the controversy were simply designed as a mechanism for FNMA to reduce or hedge its own funding costs in the event of conditions just the kind produced by the Fed s rate hikes in 1994 
The inverse floating rate notes integral to Citron s strategy for leveraged outperformance were agency coupon bonds that reset them regularly by LIBOR  In December 1993  the fund held approximately  100 million inverse FNMA floaters maturing in 1998  offered in reverse repo to Credit Suisse  VX CSGN  First Boston as collateral on  100 million funding  I haven t seen anywhere descriptions of any haircuts  so it may just be or have been assumed 1 to 1   That was not the full extent of the leverage  as the bonds were repledged to total something like 3 to 1 leverage in other funded positions  All told  there were about  800 million in FNMA floaters that spearheaded the fall from grace 
The coupon of the floaters varied inversely to the volatility of LIBOR  The coupon rate is set as the initial payment rate minus some LIBOR spread  meaning that any increase in LIBOR reduces the coupon payments  For FNMA  it is funding protection  for Orange County and Citron  the bonds paid typically a much higher initial rate and in some cases might increase  up to a preset ceiling   The lowest possible rate was  conversely  0  
Because of this structure  the convexity of the bond is enormous  particularly when compared to the change in value of any fixed rate investment  In January 1993  the coupon on the FNMA 1998 s was 8 25   but by 1994 the coupon rate was cut all the way to 2 3  and perhaps  via volatility calculations  on its way to zero  That didn t mean that the bonds would default as they were agency paper  only that the current value of them would fall precipitously with the reset coupons being so far below the  market  interest rate 
If there had been no leverage involved  Citron s run as something of a  guru  would have ended but at least not in a prison sentence  it would have continued in underperformance but absent loss as at maturity  in every underlying bond  principal would have been returned in full  As it was  given the repos  the current values of the securities pledged as collateral matters more than whether those prices actually mean credit losses or not  The more  sensitive  to changes in prices the larger the adjustments that will be made as volatility rises  For Orange County  the floaters that were pledged in reverse repos meant collateral calls and then eventually collateral seizure when prior demands for additional collateral were not met  Bankruptcy was the only means to stop the seizures  it was alleged   and even then banks viewed it within their rights to liquidate what they could at current  depressed  prices 
Thus the huge losses for Orange County were really produced because the fund could no longer fund itself  once liquidated  the assets were about  1 64 billion less than total liabilities including the nearly 3 to leverage employed near the end  For the overall fund of  20 some billion  even then  1 64 billion isn t huge except that the underlying  equity  was just  8 billion 
It is not just a tale of woe and a lesson about the nature of leverage  it speaks to the nature of the whole idea of wholesale finance  Banking is no longer about lending and boring loans  it is about leveraged spreads and leveraged capital and leveraged capacity  When leverage is plentiful and in all types  there is great profit on all sides  from those doing the  investing  to those providing the funding and the advice  That is what built the eurodollar system before August 2007  the idea of plentiful leverage not just in repos and funding  but also in capital ratios and regulatory leverage provided by accounting rules  gain on sale for one  and math as money  The major conduit through which it all flowed was proprietary trading  where banks would mingle all sides of the leverage equations   as  investors  holding securities  in warehousing  and then testing the line of what might count as  hedging  those positions  which so often drew into outright speculation  
With all these avenues for profit available  it was simply accepted  and modeled in ridiculously low volatility  that it would continue forever and ever  And if recession were to result and interrupt the leverage festival  it was assumed the  Greenspan put  would work enough to keep it mild and temporary as was the case in 2001  stocks may have suffered  but even the credit cycle did not interrupt the mortgage boom and eurodollar  hot money  pushing into every EM with access to the global financial network   It was the fatal flaw in the whole thing  assuming little or no volatility 

Without free flowing leverage on all sides  money dealing profits simply dried up  Banks have tried to make the most of it  and intermittent circumstances  but for the most part the world as it existed before 2008 just cannot be rebuilt  Again  it wasn t losses so much as math  recalculated  post crisis  volatility and  capital  efficiency that systemically sapped leverage capacity especially as reinforced by the events of 2011   It was  like Citron s game  all an illusion based upon  perfect  circumstances that will never be repeated  It might have been possible had a real recovery started after the Great Recession was over  given enough time of a full and robust fundamental rebound  but as   that  too  was an illusion predicated on the lie of orthodox economics and the Phillips Curve view of economic potential 
Without leverage there is no money dealing  and without money dealing there will only be increasing volatility  leading to less leverage and so on   Some banks  such as United Bankshares Inc  O UBSI  and Wells Fargo  N WFC   worked that out early on  others  like Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  AG NA O N   N DB   Credit Suisse Group AG  N CS  and Goldman Sachs  N GS   saw the potential rebirth of pre crisis wholesale in Bernanke s Yellen s fairy tale ending for QE and ZIRP  Like Citron s psychically derived interest rate forecasts  it was just  and all the more so as leverage conditions have only worsened and worsened 
The difference now is  obviously  that EM debt and US corporate junk  including leveraged loans  are the center of the current and gathering liquidity storm  We might likely never know exactly what those banks have been doing  but through examples like American International Group Inc  N AIG  and Orange County Bancor  OTC OCBI  we can see the destructive capacity and potential of volatility no matter if ever the credit cycle truly blasts apart this time   it is never losses that do it  it is illiquidity and lack of margin of safety  In the case of these particular banks though  there is a ready feedback that plays directly into quickening the process   they are both leveraged in their holdings and activities but also suppliers into those  dollar  conduits  It s as if Orange County were not just reverse repo counterparty borrowing cash for its own portfolios but also then providing a good part of that cash or financial resources to the next guy  That is really what scared the Fed and the Treasury in 2008   which  of course  has only gotten worse over the intervening years 
I think that explains somewhat the trajectory of the eurodollar decay past the panic  that initially leverage restraint  including and especially collateral shortage  as compared to pre crisis meant the downward baseline to begin with  Since 2013  increased volatility has only quickened that pace in the same manner as we have seen in all sorts of prior episodes  Again  some firms instead doubled down and are being undressed especially recently  which will only make it all the more difficult further on 
Restoring the eurodollar system as it was just wasn t possible  That is why the collapse in oil and commodities is especially relevant as a signal about leverage and hidden liquidity capacity that otherwise goes unnoticed  The  thing  that made the eurodollar appear to work and work so well  at least as it was rapidly expanding to ridiculous proportions  in both quantitative and qualitative terms  were these artificial channels of leverage flow and capacity  the same kinds of ideas and  products  that made Robert Citron a hero are no different than what eurodollar banks had been up to all throughout their structures before the final reckoning in 2008  That might be the most important point about unwieldy and unconstrained leverage  that there is always an endpoint and then the cleanup 
Unfortunately  we remain stuck in the cleanup phase so long as economists and their ability to direct policy continue to suggest the Great Recession was anything other than systemic revelation along these lines  a permanent rift between what was and what can be  It is and was never about oil  only now that oil projects volatility into the dying days of eurodollar leverage ",2016-02-11,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/it-was-never-about-oil-part-2;-it-was-always-leverage-and-volatility-384151,384151

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the last week of April the Equity indexes are showing signs of rotation out of the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  and SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  and into the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in a  30 range while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index continues to test the bottom of a wide consolidation range while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside with risk of the Emerging Market longer term uptrend re exerting itself  Volatility looks to remain subdued and with a bias lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite the moves last week 
Their charts are mixed with the IWM just strong all around and the SPY strong on the weekly timeframe but with cracks on the daily  The QQQ is the weakest on the daily and shows consolidation on the weekly  Perhaps next week rotates back into the QQQ  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

173480,394996,AIG,It s Time For A Rate Hike,opinion,"The global economy has gone through a rocky road in the recent month  and actually  still continues to go through  with the People s Bank of China  PBOC  allowing its currency to go through a one day depreciation of two percent  the poor second quarter Gross Domestic Product  GDP  growth recorded by Japan  the barely breathing and debt shattered Greek economy  the fluctuations and heightened volatility in the stock markets worldwide led by those in the Asian region  the weakening commodity prices and the United States Federal Reserve s rate hike outlook  Not surprising  these are just some of our growing economic concerns 
Consequently  on Thursday  Fed policymakers are set to conduct a two day monetary policy meeting  which investors and analysts alike have long been waiting for  given the bothersome condition of the world s financial sectors  The final decision regarding the central bank s September rate hike prospects will primarily be tackled  For weeks  the Fed and its officials have expressed uncertainty of a rate hike and its timely implementation  stating that the decision will be highly  data dependent   Finally and hopefully  our questions will be given the paramount answers 
We cannot blame the Fed officials for their persistent confusion  The decision is not necessarily binary  It does not only involve a simple question of whether to do or not do  Typically  before every policy meeting  the central bank s economists cite to the officials a handful of choices that include middle ground options that vary between Fed  hawks  who disregard low interest rate policies and Fed  doves  who back easy money 
The Fed has not increased interest rates in almost a decade and some concerned experts still think that it is not yet time for the central bank to carry out a  much needed  rate hike  They believe that the economy is way too hurt to afford an increase in the interest rates of the world s top central bank  As Harvard professor and former Obama administration economic adviser Larry Summers says  a rate hike is  tipping some parts of the financial system into crisis   Summers emphasizes    as a strong basis    the incident in 1994 when the Fed suddenly imposed a 0 25 percent increase in interest rates  which was later followed by what Fortune Magazine called  Bond Market Massacre   On that note  the bond market today has expressed its distress over the possible increase in rates  Doubleline Capital Founder and Bond King Jeffrey Gundlach noted the many reasons the Fed should not pursue an interest rate hike    the weakening of the world s second largest economy  the decline in commodity prices and the sparse inflation rate to name a few    saying   Dammit Janet  referring to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen   do not raise rates  
The previous monetary policies had us acquainted with slow rises in interest rates  Most of us believe that high interest rates will hurt the economy as it will limit government borrowings  How did this happen  How did gradual interest rate increments become so unbearable for the economy  Since when did a rate hike of a quarter of a percent become too much to deal with 
Greenspan And Bernanke
Alan Greenspan  the 13th and newly confirmed Fed Chairman during the 1987 stock market crash  commonly termed as  Black Monday    lowered interest rates to one percent shortly after the tremendous drop in worldwide shares and the tech bubble  Being the monetarist that he is  Greenspan had a diverse view on the economy  His monetary policy decisions were    accordingly    largely patterned after the Taylor Principle  a monetary policy rule imposing how much the central bank must change the nominal interest rate in response to inflation  output and other economic indicators  His monetary policy approach is commonly known as the  Greenspan put  
After the mild recession  the Fed tightened monetary policy with an increment of a quarter of a percent at a time to avoid agitating the financial institutions 
It turns out that Greenspan and his successor Ben Bernanke did not also see the subprime housing debt mayhem coming their way  Predatory lenders imposed excessive interest rates  leading a number of people into undesired foreclosures  We all thought that real estate was a very disparate asset to ever encounter a market bubble and we were proven wrong  Tightening monetary policy and lending might not have fully controlled the bubble from occurring but they could have kept it from worsening 
We have had reasonable warnings since 2005 but the central bank and the Treasury were still bushwhacked by the crash of leading American companies Lehman Brothers Holdings  Inc   Bear Stearns Companies  Inc  and American International Group  Inc   NYSE AIG  in 2008  Along with the collapse in the mortgage markets  these three companies shed billions of dollars  greatly contributing to the Global Financial Crisis  Exactly seven years ago  financial services firm Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history  With the liquidity problems encountered by the Lehman Brothers  the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its biggest one day loss since the September  2001 attacks  tumbling 4 40 percent  Meanwhile  global investment bank and securities trading and brokerage firm Bear Stearns was eventually sold to multinational banking and financial services holding company JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  while multinational insurance company AIG sought financial assistance through government bailouts  Needless to say  this paved way for the darkest days in the ever progressive Wall Street  As a result  Bernanke introduced three rounds of quantitative easing  adding about  3 50 trillion in purchases to the central bank s balance sheet  Due to the market collapse  the emergency zero percent overnight lending rate was unexpectedly deemed necessary  The next thing we know  seven years later  we still regard its necessity 
The Market Bubbles
Robert Shiller  the economist who forsaw the coming of the tech and real estate bubbles in the recent decade  said earlier this year that the Land of Liberty is potentially headed for a bond market bubble  At the same time  high end housing and art markets seem to be reaching the same zone  However  a serious correction in the US equity market is most likely to happen and prevent the economy from hitting the bubbly territory 
The bubbles are triggered by the hundred billion dollar debt in the energy sector  particularly in the fracking business  Oil prices may have a doubled value today but most borrowing companies were not cash flow positive  The oil industry have promptly recouped following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis but the current trend of production oversupply makes the situation more comparable to the 1980s  a turmoil that saw a long term correction since companies kept on producing more crude as a result of desperate measures 
Concerns Over The US Economy
With a number of positive indicators since the year began  it is evident that US equity markets have significantly been overvalued  However  the surfacing of various concerns for the American economy is quite inevitable 
At the expense of long term capital investment  American companies have disclosed that dividends and share buybacks for 2015 amount to more than  1 trillion    pretty far greater than their estimated profits combined  American corporations nowadays care more about share prices than long term growth prospects 
Another worry is the growing number of private market investments  Private firms find it relatively easy to raise capital  triggering market bubbles  As American businessman Mark Cuban puts it   The bubble of today comes from private investors who are investing in apps and small tech companies    Cuban sold his online television website Broadcast com at the peak of the internet era in 1999 to Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO   Inc  for  5 70 billion  a deal that the multinational technology company eventually regretted sealing 
For example  California based international transportation network company Uber Technologies  Inc   an emerging industry whose shares are not yet profitable    and nonetheless growing  got two new rounds of such funding  In just a year  the valuation of the company easily jumped from  20 billion to  50 billion 
Ironing It Away With Normalization
The proper    and probably only    way to respond to these growing concerns is a rate hike  The central bank has to take the hint  If the Fed is to normalize interest rates  the time is now  There is no reason to prolong the agony since whatever the circumstances are  it will transpire anyway  Stocks are still up by 200 percent from the preceding bottom  It is then safe to say that the economy is strong enough to withstand such correction  In the grand scheme of things  a mild recession is already something that our financial systems can deal with  It is nothing compared to the economy boost that comes together with it 
For so many years  now  fixed income investors have drowned themselves in irresponsible lending that yields too little returns  As a result  instead of generating more money  we only accumulate unceasing losses  We cannot deal with further debt problems by subsidizing more    let us take that from the financial dilemmas experienced in prominent economies like Europe  Japan and China 
The equity markets have been lacking a sense of responsibility because investors have complacently relied on bailout funds  Markdowns may seem painful but they can help correct the irresponsibility that has been lingering for quite long  We need to get back on track 
The Taylor Rule suggests that an increase in inflation rate is equivalent to an increase in nominal interest rate  If only we truly followed the Taylor Rule  the central bank would have lifted overnight rates back up to the range of 2 50 percent  Annually  we could have had spawned  1 trillion and had allowed the US GDP to gain 6 percent 
Our worries over the worsening trade problems are honestly illogical because a 2 percent differential is not that relevant to currency variations  Without changing the overnight lending rates  exchanges between the dollar and the euro have varied 10 to 20 percent annually anyway  Also  the average American would not likely be hurt as credit card interest rates are still at a 13 percent average and mortgage rates would barely rise 
After all that has been said and done in the past decade  you may ask now   What does this tell us   Well  this is a call for us to put an end to Greenspan put and Bernanke s quantitative easing  We need to go back to the basics in order to pop and combat the forthcoming market bubbles  The present Fed and its policymakers need to take its undertakings more seriously with its own strategic measures  Undeniably and evidently  a rate hike has a really great impact on the markets  However  it is always better to take a minor setback for a major comeback  The odds are  in any way  in the favor of progress  The Fed must implement a 0 25 percent rate hike this month  followed by 0 50 percent increase shortly after  Of course  we cannot opt for abrupt increments as this will shake the economic stability  especially now that we are barely sustaining it  With the troubled global economy we have today  we can only go for gradual changes that will take eventual effects  After all  the only enemy of success is stagnation 
Despite the looming of varying opinions  I believe that the Fed s rate hike will greatly help regain confidence in the whole economy  I don t know about those who are against it  but I think that we are more than ready for the central bank s move to normalize interest rates and loosen our grips  we just find it difficult to see as the pressing economic problems keep on overshadowing  It has long been due and the time is now ",2015-09-16,MXTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/it’s-time-for-a-rate-hike-265275,265275

173485,395001,AIG,What s Next For AIG Shareholders ,opinion,"American International Group Inc   NYSE N AIG  stock got additional attention after activist and billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  disclosed his stake in the company  More than that  he sought the company to be split into three publicly traded companies  The insurance firm s CEO  Peter Hancock  has rejected the proposal  saying that it would not be any helpful either to the company or its shareholders  However  Icahn is committed to pushing his proposal with his fellow shareholders  As the billionaire investor sees Hancock as the unwilling person to push through his proposals  Icahn is also ready to seek his removal from the CEO position  The management is also holding meetings with two small groups of the biggest investors  The stock is trading near the yearly high price  and investors are worried as to what awaits next for them 
Clarity On Strategy Needed
Hancock might have reasons to defend AIG to remain as a single entity  Therefore  he needs to clear the air surrounding its tactics  as well as  goals while meeting the small group of big investors  Clarity must come on what it terms as  One AIG  and the reason to invest in growth since they have not met their own targets set in respect of margin  There was little proof of the margin expansion in the last one year period  As a shareholder owned company  it needs to clarify whether they still have the target of 10  return on equity  The company s most recent quarter results failed to meet the Street analysts  expectations  thus disappointing investors and giving an edge to activist investors 
As a result  some of the frustrated shareholders seek some radical solutions when American International Group meets the big shareholders  Therefore  any discussions with them should revolve around the tactics to be pursued in the future for better understanding  For years  the company has outlined its priorities  i e  modernizing  streamlining and adding fresh talent to fuel operating margins in P C  There was already an impression that the insurer has never been point blank in explaining its tactics with its shareholders  be it big or small  The only favorable factor was that it was leveraging its capital to boost its book value through the share repurchase program  Therefore  the onus is on the insurer to convince the big shareholders about its tactics to get a wider support to stand with it at the height of Icahn s exerting pressure 
Management Should Address Series Of Disappointments
Of late  AIG has been disappointing shareholders with its recently re set targets  The insurance firm should come out to discuss openly and address the issues of series of disappointments  That can be done only if the management demonstrated its willingness to explain the way they understand and executed their plans  Also  the management should come out with ideas to get back to their operating momentum in line with the stated objectives  The company has revealed about the fresh disclosures in respect of normalized ROE  and it is now easier to control the volatility besides isolating its progress on a quarterly basis 
There is an element of doubt whether American International Group is taking a long time than expected in meeting the set targets  Alternatively  there has also been a feeling whether the company was just doing the right way to achieve its set goals as it failed to provide any evidence of progress in its turnaround efforts of P C businesses  Therefore  the company is compelled to explain where it failed and how it is going to address the issues with the investors  There were some series of underwriting misses in its recent quarter  Though it might have been a minor one  it was a fact that it was troubling  There was a sense of belief that the complexity  as well as  the distraction of reorganization apart from the focus on growth over profitability have led to losing its focus on its set goals  The insurer needs to be honest if they were serious in getting the support of the big investors  That could also ensure to keep the activists  investors at bay 
Place Shareholders Value On Top Of The Agenda
American International Group cannot take the activist investors light and should demonstrate its willingness to listen to shareholders in all its earnest to place the value on top of the agenda  The insurance firm s balance sheet and health of its business have undergone significant changes since the financial crisis or after getting the bailout package in 2009  That was made possible after years of increasing pricing  as well as  adding to its reserves 
The insurer needs to clarify clearly on the need to stay as a conglomerate and the synergies that it would likely to get  In the face of mounting pressure from Icahn  AIG should also spell out the reasons to pursue integration than divestiture given the execution risk in their fix it plans  The company s operating businesses are already struggling to deliver a 7  return on equity due to its cost  capital  and tax structure  It is not an easy task but a tough proposition to convince the need to stay as  On AIG  
Still A Long Term Bet
Though there are some issues that needed the attention of the insurer  its stock is continued to be a compelling long term bet  according to Berstein senior analyst  Josh Stirling  With the activist involvement  he said that he would back the truck  Though American International Group might have missed its targets  it was fueling margins with a safety following its transformation  As a result  it is trading at a considerable discount to its rivals  multiples  Therefore  the stock would outperform given the value and the activist investors involvement as a catalyst  There are also potentials to unlock some of its values 
Conclusion
The insurance firm needs to address some of the concerns that investors have  However  that is not altering its valuation or the sentiments or the multiples  which is lower than its rivals  That provides an opportunity to probe further into American International Group shares  Activist investor entry is an additional catalyst  Therefore  there is still growth available in the stock ",2015-11-25,InvestCorrectly,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what’s-next-for-american-international-group-inc-(aig)-shareholders-272559,272559

173517,395033,AIG,Market losses  low yields sideswipe U S  corporate pensions,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss and Richard Leong NEW YORK  Reuters    Low interest rates and a U S  stock market that is still down 2 percent for the year have taken their toll on corporate America s pension plans   Pension liabilities grew 1 percent in the third quarter  as returns fell 2 5 percent  according to global consulting firm Milliman  The increase in the pension shortfall has been largely driven by investment losses in August and September  low discount rates used to value pension liabilities  and recent studies showing that people are expected to live longer over the next 20 years   While the government has granted relief into 2021 for companies to improve their pension funding  corporate executives with severely underfunded pensions have some urgency to take action  or pay stiffer premiums to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure their programs   As a result  companies with some of the larger unfunded liabilities have started to load up on riskier assets such as stocks and junk bonds to make up for lost ground in hopes they do not have to contribute more cash  pension managers and consultants say  Private pensions added nearly  50 billion in so called  other  assets  which pension consultants say could include hedge funds and private equity  The investment in other assets is nearly double the  26 billion invested in the second half of 2014 and far more than the  14 2 billion invested in all of 2010  according to Federal Reserve data  Market losses and low interest rates have also slowed the  2 4 trillion sector s move into the safety of long term bonds  Fed data showed  as many had planned to do when they reached a high funding status  Insurer American International Group Inc  N AIG   for example  aims to grow its holdings of alternative investments that include hedge funds and real estimate by nearly 80 percent this year  while trimming its bond exposure  according to regulatory filings    Things are moving in the wrong direction   said Andrew Wozniak  head of BNY Mellon Fiduciary Solutions in New York    They are trying to find the right balance between contributing to improve the funding status and taking more risk within the pension plan to have a higher return to close that funding gap    Thirty seven of the top 100 U S  corporate pensions by assets tracked by Milliman had funding ratios below 80 percent at the end of 2014  more than double that level in 2013   The overall funding ratio for these U S  companies fell to 81 7 percent in September this year  down from 85 5 percent at the end of June  Milliman data showed   The funding ratio measures a pension s solvency  and 80 percent for many plans closed to new entrants has generally been considered a threshold in which they should be thinking about moving into fixed income to preserve gains  Falling below that level could delay a pension s move to the stability of fixed income assets that would help cushion portfolios from market volatility  TURNING TO RISKY ASSETS  Among the underfunded corporate pension plans in Milliman s top 100 at the end of 2014 were Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  with a 42 8 percent funding level and American Airlines Group Inc at 62 4 percent   AIG  which had a funded ratio of 70 percent at the end of last year  has targeted an increase in other investments to 31 percent this year from 17 percent in 2014  according to the company s 2014 annual report  while lowering its bond allocation to 27 percent from 28 percent in 2014   American Airlines and AIG declined to comment   In addition to heavily loading up on riskier investments  Delta is also pumping  1 billion a year into its pension through 2020   Delta  whose funding level is the lowest among the Top 100 companies in the Milliman index  should reach an 80 percent funded ratio in the next five years  according to financial documents provided by the company   Only 12 percent of the airline s pension is invested in fixed income with 21 percent in equities and the rest in other investments   The airline has been severely underfunded over the last three years  with funding ratios of 46 9 percent in 2013 and 38 1 percent in 2012   Frank van Etten  head of client solutions at UBS Global Asset Management  which oversees  695 billion in assets  said some pensions needed to take on more risk due to higher return targets    We do expect more shifts in allocations given the decreased levels of funding ratios   Chicago based Van Etten added  Adding to their burden  the Society of Actuaries last year estimated retirees are living longer than just a decade ago  a factor the Internal Revenue Service is expected to adopt in 2017 when calculating pensions  future payouts   DERISKING DELAY   The shift into bonds by corporate pensions was part of a derisking process that began in the last three years as their obligations declined and funding levels improved   The objective is to move 50 percent to 80 percent of pension assets into long term bonds  usually corporate investment grade debt   But that goal may have to wait now  pension consultants say    What we have seen is a delay in moving into long duration bonds while they re waiting for the long end of the  yield  curve to go higher and market conditions to improve   said Philadelphia based Charles Tan  head of North American fixed income at Aberdeen Investments  managing more than  480 billion in assets   Fed data showed that private pensions  bond purchases tumbled to  7 4 billion in the second quarter  from  56 5 billion in the first quarter   One reason for the drastic decline in bond purchases  analysts say  is the expectation of an interest rate increase by the Fed  which diminishes the value of the bonds   From 2012 to 2014  private pensions have amassed more than  250 billion in fixed income debt   At the end of last year  fixed income allocation grew to 42 7 percent from 39 5 percent at the end of 2013  Milliman data show   Despite expectations for a Fed rate hike  longer term bond yields have declined  a factor in computing discount rates used to estimate pension liabilities  Lower discount rates  which are based on the yield of high quality corporate bonds  increase a pension plan s projected liabilities   Pension discount rates fell to 4 19 percent in September  from 4 23 percent in August and down more than 2 percentage points since the global financial crisis in 2008

173518,395034,AIG,AIG  Under Pressure  Plans To Downsize,news,"By   

Insurance giant American International Group Inc   N AIG  said Monday that it plans to cut as many as 400 senior level jobs in restructuring initiatives  less than a week after activist investor Carl Icahn wrote a public letter to CEO Peter Hancock urging the company to split up 
The insurer said it plans to spend about  500 million in severance and termination fees  and said that the job cuts will continue into 2016  Terming the cutbacks  urgent   yet disciplined   the company said it expected to save  400 million to  500 million annually after completing the restructuring exercise 
Shareholder pressure on AIG has mounted since Icahn published a letter last Wednesday advising Hancock to spin off AIG s life insurance and mortgage units into public companies  The move would help AIG rid itself of a regulatory burden and return more cash to shareholders  Icahn wrote  in the letter 
 We believe there is no more need for procrastination  the time to act is now   Icahn wrote  adding that many large shareholders  are frustrated with the lack of clear progress and are supportive of an AIG break up  
Icahn s move  termed one of the biggest campaigns by an activist investor this year  also blamed a lack of cost controls at the company that was one of the  too big to fail  entities to be bailed out at the height of the global financial crisis 
Dismissing the company s recent attempts to rid itself of loss making ventures  Icahn said the company had shown no urgency in closing the gap with its peers and instead chose a  wait and see   for years strategy  to avoid taking tough measures 
On Monday  the company also reported adjusted third quarter earnings of 52 cents a share   well below Wall Street s expectations of  1 03 per share  according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters  The company s shares slipped 2 7 percent to  62 01 in extended trading in New York

173530,395046,AIG,On Berkshire Hathaway And Asbestos,opinion,"Recently  a friend of mine from Canada came to stay with me   We talked about a wide number of things  but when we talked about investing  I described insurance investing to him  giving my usual explanation on reserving 
Classical life insurance reserves are a science   Death happens with regularity  it is only a question of when   Short tail P C  health  etc  are almost a science   the claims come quickly  and the reserves get adjusted rapidly   Long tail Casualty and Liability is a dark art at best   Mortgage  financial  and title insurance reserving is not even an art  there is no good theory behind them  as is true of life insurance products with secondary guarantees  particularly those dealing with variable products 
As an example of long tail P C  I told my friend about Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  and asbestos   I mentioned to him how BRK has become the reinsurer of choice for insurers with uncertain asbestos liabilities   Buffett has reinsured White Mountains  NYSE WTM   American International Group  NYSE AIG   CNA  NYSE CNA   Equitas  and many others  the most recent being   which happened after the talk with my friend 
This is retroactive reinsurance  where an insurer purchases insurance from a reinsurer to cover business previously written   This is an uncommon form of insurance  and most commonly used when the amount of claims is very uncertain 
Quoting from the Bloomberg article 

Liberty Mutual Group Inc  issued  750 million of bonds to help finance a payment to a unit of  s  for covering the insurance company s liabilities tied to asbestos 
The 4 85 percent  30 year notes were sold to yield 160 basis points more than similar maturity Treasuries  according to data compiled by Bloomberg   increased Liberty Mutual s rating one level to BBB from BBB  after Berkshire s National Indemnity Co  agreed last week to provide as much as  6 5 billion of coverage for the insurance company s liabilities for asbestos  environmental and workers  compensation policies 
 This agreement covers Liberty Mutual s potentially volatile U S  A E liabilities and largely mitigates potential risks from future adverse reserve developments   Tracy Dolin  an S P analyst  said in a statement 
Berkshire  which has grown over the last five decades by investing insurance premiums in stocks and takeovers  has assumed billions of dollars in asbestos risk from insurers including American International Group Inc  and CNA Financial Corp 
Liberty Mutual paid Omaha  Nebraska based National Indemnity about  3 billion for the coverage  according to a July 17 company statement 

This is similar to the other deals  where the premium paid is roughly half the amount of what BRK could have ot pay out at maximum   Note that BRK has capped its exposure to the claims    If asbestos claims against Liberty Mutual exceed  6 5 Billion  Liberty Mutual will have to pay the excess 
I don t think there is another American insurance company with more asbestos exposure than BRK   That s not necessarily a bad thing  though   Let me quote from BRK s recent 10 K 

We are exposed to environmental  asbestos and other latent injury claims arising from insurance and reinsurance contracts  Liability estimates for environmental and asbestos exposures include case basis reserves and also reflect reserves for legal and other loss adjustment expenses and IBNR  DM  Incurred But Not Reported  reserves  IBNR reserves are based upon our historic general liability exposure base and policy language  previous environmental loss experience and the assessment of current trends of environmental law  environmental cleanup costs  asbestos liability law and judgmental settlements of asbestos liabilities 
The liabilities for environmental  asbestos and other latent injury claims and claims expenses net of reinsurance recoverables were approximately  13 7 billion at December 31  2013 and  14 0 billion at December 31  2012  These liabilities included approximately  11 9 billion at December 31  2013 and  12 4 billion at December 31  2012 of liabilities assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts  Liabilities arising from retroactive contracts with exposure to claims of this nature are generally subject to aggregate policy limits  Thus  our exposure to environmental and other latent injury claims under these contracts is  likewise  limited  We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims  Changing government regulations  newly identified toxins  newly reported claims  new theories of liability  new contract interpretations and other factors could result in significant increases in these liabilities  Such development could be material to our results of operations  We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible 

Long tail P C reserves are roughly 20  of the total gross P C reserves of BRK  and this deal with Liberty Mutual increases it   Again  that s not a bad thing  necessarily   Given the premium paid  even if BRK pays out the maximum on average 10 years from now  the deal is a winner if BRK earns more than 8  per year   If 15 years 5 3    If 20 years  4    Given the long period before the ultimate payment of claims  BRK can make money in most scenarios 
That said  if anything bad ever did happen to BRK  such that its solvency was impaired  there would be a lot of insurance companies hurting as a result   BRK is critical to the payment of asbestos claims   There is not a better company to entrust with this task

173532,395048,AIG,AIG  Why You Will Step Back And Say Wow,opinion,"Sometimes a stock can be so deeply discounted for so long that you almost forget where it has been  American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG  is one of those stocks  Just this weekend the chart of the stock price looked like it might be ready for a break higher  This lead to a series of short term trading ideas for my subscribers should it trigger  Below is the chart I used  Notice that on a Measured Move basis a break out of the current consolidation higher would target 61 or almost 10  higher  Not a bad return against little risk 

But I said this is one that has been depressed for so long it is being viewed on the wrong scale  Step back to the monthly chart below and suddenly your eyes pop open and you audibly saw wow  The whole of the price action from late 2008 until now has been nothing but a basing period  A 6 year base  And the momentum indicator is just starting to get bullish  Those Measured Move arrow from the daily chart above suddenly have very little meaning  In fact this chart shows that is the move higher continues over 63 then there is no real resistance higher until that last big red candle in September 2008 

And virtually no price history above it  Even a mere 23 6  retracement of down leg  hardly a bullish bounce  could go as high as 345  and the typical expectation of 38 2  would mean 557  Makes  6 over the next few weeks look like picking up nickels in front of a steam roller

173534,395050,AIG,The Role Of Volatility In Asset Allocation And Risk Management,opinion,"I just returned home from the 20th Annual Global Indexing   ETFs Conference in Scottsdale  Arizona  Popular topics included moving beyond cap weighted index funds  the growing search for yield and the increasing role of volatility in the management of risk 
The conference organizers had asked me to participate on the volatility panel and the moderator kicked off our panel s discussion by asking   What do we really mean by volatility   The easy answer might include addressing the craziness  or lack thereof  in fluctuating asset prices  A more sophisticated response might differentiate between historical price movement and the risk of loss  For example  if Exxon Mobil drops from a  102 per share down to  74 per share because there are extreme price shifts in an underlying commodity in its business pipeline  i e   oil   has the dividend aristocrat that pays 3  become more risky  Exxon Mobil s  NYSE XOM  stock price  like oil itself  may become more volatile for a brief period  yet scooping up shares of XOM at  74 might actually be less of a risk than when it had traded north of a  100 per share 
Intrigue in oil price volatility notwithstanding  I felt the attendees would be better served to hear my perspective on what transpires in the real world  that is   do not care to make the distinction between good volatility and bad volatility    they just want me to respond to  black swans    left tails   or stock market Armageddon in a way that preserves the bulk of their portfolio dollars  After all  for regular folks  volatility and risk are one in the same 
Should we blame them  In 2000 and again in 2007  scores of endlessly bullish gurus misled their followers by touting volatility as opportunity  Take author James Glassman who wrote the bestselling Dow 36 000 at the height of 2000 euphoria  Few books have ever been less prophetic and more harmful  The same Mr  Glassman boasted about American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG  in June of 2008 because the stock was down 30  and had a P E of 6  Had you bought AIG on his guidance  you would have lost all of your investment in the company  And these are the people who love to tell you about  good volatility  
In contrast  most people would rather see their portfolios fluctuate less  Need proof  Today  nearly  15 billion with a  B  rest within the coffers of  Low Volatility  ETFs  In contrast   High Beta  or  High Volatility   ETFs have struggled to capture the imagination of investors  bringing in a modest  250 million  Rightly or wrongly  it is clear what the public thinks about stocks with greater price fluctuations  It is part of the reason that iShares MSCI USA Min Volatility  NYSE USMV  is featured prominently in my client accounts 
At the same time  funds like USMV should not supplant dynamic asset allocation pursuits  When stocks fall hard   when a bear finally arrives   I could hardly run a victory lap if a client has lost 35  when the market loses 40   I have been hired in large part to reduce risk in bearish environments  raising cash in volatile downturns as well as shifting assets to safer havens  And while it is true that losing 15  18  in this hypothetical scenario might not win me any awards  it will help my clients achieve their long term goals  after all  one requires 25  to recover from a 20  draw down  while one requires nearly 67  to recover from a 40  thrashing 
So what types of assets might I gravitate towards when  execute or when significant stock benchmarks breach respective trendlines   Over the last 25 years  I have found that certain assets and certain asset types minimize the volatility of stock ownership by their mere inclusion in a total portfolio  U S  sovereign debt is typically beneficial  e g   zero coupon  inflation protected  long dated Treasuries  municipal bonds  etc    Well regarded currencies from the dollar to the Swiss franc have been effective  The sovereign debt from influential economies like Japan and Germany also work  Commodities like gold have also served to offset stock scares 
When seeking ways to reduce  bad volatility  and the risk of significant loss  however  I prefer to employ a diversified basket of these assets rather than selecting one or two alone  I call it   multi asset stock hedging  and I believe the diversified approach is the only free lunch in stock risk reduction 
Recently  I partnered with FTSE to create the FTSE Custom Multi Asset Stock Hedge Index  FTSE Custom MASH Index   One cannot reduce the uncomfortable volatility associated with severe stock sell offs by investing in or trading the index directly   not yet  anyway  An exchange traded note or exchange traded fund could be available in 2015  In the meantime  I suggest that readers consider an equally weighted combination of the following funds for a portion of their overall portfolio 
PIMCO 25  Year Zero Coupon US Tr   NYSE ZROZ  iShares Lehman 10 20 Y Tr  Bond  NYSE TLH iShares S P National Mun Bond  NYSE MUB iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund  ARCA TIP  RYDEX CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  ARCA FXY Rydex CurrencyShares Swiss Franc  NYSE FXF  PowerShares db USD Index Bullish  NYSE UUP SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD  
For those who may not have the discipline or desire to come up with an appropriate amount of multi asset stock hedging  Pacific Park Financial offers separately managed accounts  I encourage interested individuals or groups to contact me about that alternative  Indeed  tracking the FTSE Custom MASH Index accurately requires the pursuit of Japanese Government Bonds and German Bunds on foreign exchanges 
One final thought regarding multi asset stock hedging as it pertains to volatility and risk management  You do NOT have to be bearish on stocks to do it  Indeed  you may feel stocks are going to rise without a hitch for years to come  And yet  owning a basket of non correlated assets in equal measure can still add value to your risk adjusted returns  For instance  the FTSE Custom MASH Index is up 5 0  in 2014 
There were scores of excellent ideas and presentations at this year s Global Indexing   ETFs Conference  Still  I found myself wondering why so many participants embraced the notion that central banks could permanently insulate them from severe stock losses in the future  Even in our breakout session on volatility  there had been more interest in  shorting volatility  than seeking ways to mitigate it or  go long   It is for this reason that I have strongly  throughout 2014  and will continue to recommend ETFs like Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury Bond Fund  EDV  for the left hand side of the barbell

173538,395054,AIG,A Message To Central Banks  Let The Economy Run Its Course ,opinion,"OK  so you know that I don t think governments should go too far to counter the natural cycles of the economy 
Those cycles have their own innate logic as they meander toward creating greater innovations  income and wealth  Markets and economies need the polar opposite of boom and bust  inflation and deflation  innovation and creative destruction 
When governments go too far trying to counter those realities  they end up doing more harm than good  They can t accept that growth isn t possible without pain  so they do everything in their power to keep the hurt at bay  Only  doing that simply prolongs the inevitable  and always makes the outcome worse than if they d just let the free market run its course 
And you know that I think government and central banks the world over have gone too far in their efforts to fight the natural winter season our economy is embroiled in until 2023  They ve created more than  10 trillion    3 5 trillion in the U S  alone   out of thin air  all in the vain and delusional attempt to keep the tide at bay and the bubble going 
That s just crazy 
Unfortunately  it gets crazier still  and this next part really makes me mad 
All of that money  created  has gone straight to financial institutions  where it s been used to speculate and create an even greater bubble in debt and financial assets  and that only works to the advantage of the ultra rich  I m talking about the top 10  to 0 1  plus here 
And we have special interest groups and lobbying in the areas of health care  military financial and education  in that order  to thank for that  They drive our political system   Save the big banks  save AIG  NYSE AIG   save GM  NYSE GM    they chant 
But why not save the average household that has been suffering from one financial blow after another since 2000  Real wages have declined by more than 10  since then  Many are still living in homes that have less value than what they owe on the mortgage  Their standard of living hasn t improved one iota  even with all the stimulus central banks have pumped into the system 
I think quantitative easing was the biggest mistake central banks could have made  Not only has it created yet another bubble that will crush millions more people when it bursts ahead  but such programs have done nothing to help the average household and even less to solve the underlying problems 
What those in charge should have done is actively work to restructure the massive debt build up in the private sector  which outweighed government debt by three times at the crescendo of the bubble in 2008 
They could have done this through a collective Chapter 11 debt restructure  requiring banks to write down loans to fair value  while giving liquidity to the banks to avert a total meltdown  That  3 5 trillion could have gone into orchestrating as much as a  22 trillion write down in the 2000 U S  bubble debt 
That would have helped the average citizen and the small or medium sized businesses as much of their debt would have been written down 
Or  they could have just sent a check to every household  proportionate to the number of people in the house  of course   With that  3 5 trillion newly  printed  money  each household could have received about  30 000 each 
That would have stimulated demand where it could be of most value to the economy and have tilted the gains to the middle class  not the 1  
But no  The foxes were brought into fix the henhouse and now we face possibly the biggest economic and market crisis in the last 90 years 
And with every day that passes  we hear new warnings and see new triggers that could be the one to bring the whole damn thing down 
There s falling inflation and commodity prices  despite unprecedented stimulus 
China is slowing  even after the greatest over stimulated government driven bubble in history 
Southern Europe and Germany are being lead downhill by declining demographic trends 
Terror is growing around the globe  as expected when we consider the current Geopolitical cycle 
And falling Crude Oil prices have and will continue to burst the fracking bubble that developed over the last six years of QE 
All it will take is just one of those things to break the camel s back  to be the last grain of sand that starts the avalanche 
Sadly  there s nothing we can do about the missed opportunities  There s nothing we can do to prevent central banks and governments from continuing to make foolish and damaging decisions 
What we can do is be prepared  As those citizens who didn t see the benefits of all of the stimulus money  we can now put ourselves in a position where we can improve our financial situation  or  at the very least  prevent it from getting worse 
All it takes is the right research  powerful  reality based insights  and a plan of action  all of which we aim to provide you daily  weekly and monthly ",2015-02-08,Harry Dent,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-message-to-central-banks:-let-the-economy-run-its-course!-241145,241145

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into March the strength that was anticipated to close February did not appear  but weakness did not show up either 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue the short term bounce higher while Crude Oil churns in the consolidation of the downward move  The US dollar Index seems ready to move higher again while US Treasuries are biased higher short term in the pullback  The Shanghai Composite is on the cusp of another leg higher and Emerging Markets are stalled at resistance but not showing any bias 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and may drift lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index  ARCA SPY  iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts are not as strong with consolidation or a pullback looking more likely in them  especially the SPY with the IWM next and QQQ strongest  holding level  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

173546,395062,AIG,A tranquil Muslim hamlet in the Catskills   until the attack plot,news,"By Laila Kearney
ISLAMBERG  New York  Reuters    Just beyond the gated entrance to the tiny Catskills community of Holy Islamberg  population 200  cows graze and ducks glide on a tranquil pond  Modest houses of wood and cinder block sit along the hamlet s single thoroughfare  a rutted dirt road without traffic signs 
Islamberg sits about 150 miles northwest of New York City  but the small enclave of Muslim families living on shared land feels a world away from city life  which is what its founders intended 30 years ago  when they established the hamlet on 70 acres of pasture land and dense woods in upstate New York 
Last month  however  the community s serenity was disrupted by news that a Tennessee man had pleaded guilty to charges of plotting an attack on Islamberg and its residents 
Formed by a group of African American Muslims from New York City  the community follows the teachings of Pakistani Sufi cleric Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani  who during the 1980s urged his American acolytes to leave metropolitan areas and establish rural communities centered on religious life 
Today  Islamberg is one of about a dozen Muslim enclaves formed in accordance with the cleric s ideas  It also serves as home to Muslims of America  a Gilani founded organization 
 We re living the American dream   said Faruq Baqi  39  who moved to Islamberg with his family as a child  and now works in telecommunications at a nearby hospital 
An array of far right organizations see things very differently  Dozens of internet postings and a documentary film have characterized the community as a training camp for terrorists and its residents as Islamist warriors 
One blog on the Christian Action Network  for example  described the settlement as  America s first Islamic government   and warned that children are being raised to fight a holy war  that girls are denied an education and that rule breakers  are often tied to trees and whipped for disobeying  
Robert Doggart  a one time congressional candidate from Tennessee  embraced that sort of overheated rhetoric as he plotted his attack on the Muslim enclave 
In wire tapped phone calls and in meetings with Federal Bureau of Investigation informants  Doggart put out the call for a militia to attack Islamberg  saying he intended to destroy its mosque and gun down residents who tried to stop him 
Doggart said he planned to take an assault rifle  armor piercing ammunition and other weapons including a machete   If it gets down to the machete  we will cut them to shreds   he said  according to the criminal complaint 
A GREAT PLACE TO RAISE CHILDREN
Islamberg residents say they are disheartened and puzzled by the vitriol leveled at them and alarmed by the plotting

ISLAMBERG  New York  Reuters    Just beyond the gated entrance to the tiny Catskills community of Holy Islamberg  population 200  cows graze and ducks glide on a tranquil pond  Modest houses of wood and cinder block sit along the hamlet s single thoroughfare  a rutted dirt road without traffic signs 
Islamberg sits about 150 miles northwest of New York City  but the small enclave of Muslim families living on shared land feels a world away from city life  which is what its founders intended 30 years ago  when they established the hamlet on 70 acres of pasture land and dense woods in upstate New York 
Last month  however  the community s serenity was disrupted by news that a Tennessee man had pleaded guilty to charges of plotting an attack on Islamberg and its residents 
Formed by a group of African American Muslims from New York City  the community follows the teachings of Pakistani Sufi cleric Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani  who during the 1980s urged his American acolytes to leave metropolitan areas and establish rural communities centered on religious life 
Today  Islamberg is one of about a dozen Muslim enclaves formed in accordance with the cleric s ideas  It also serves as home to Muslims of America  a Gilani founded organization 
 We re living the American dream   said Faruq Baqi  39  who moved to Islamberg with his family as a child  and now works in telecommunications at a nearby hospital 
An array of far right organizations see things very differently  Dozens of internet postings and a documentary film have characterized the community as a training camp for terrorists and its residents as Islamist warriors 
One blog on the Christian Action Network  for example  described the settlement as  America s first Islamic government   and warned that children are being raised to fight a holy war  that girls are denied an education and that rule breakers  are often tied to trees and whipped for disobeying  
Robert Doggart  a one time congressional candidate from Tennessee  embraced that sort of overheated rhetoric as he plotted his attack on the Muslim enclave 
In wire tapped phone calls and in meetings with Federal Bureau of Investigation informants  Doggart put out the call for a militia to attack Islamberg  saying he intended to destroy its mosque and gun down residents who tried to stop him 
Doggart said he planned to take an assault rifle  armor piercing ammunition and other weapons including a machete   If it gets down to the machete  we will cut them to shreds   he said  according to the criminal complaint 
A GREAT PLACE TO RAISE CHILDREN
Islamberg residents say they are disheartened and puzzled by the vitriol leveled at them and alarmed by the plotting 
 Unfortunately  it s not going to stop   said Hussein Adams  who grew up in Islamberg and is now a top official at Muslims of America   But we re not going to stop continuing to live our lives  
Adams and other residents say they are law abiding and hard working Americans who live harmoniously while practicing their faith 
During a recent several hour visit by a Reuters reporter  the community seemed organized and placid  Women tended vegetables in planter boxes  while young girls in head scarves and boys in knitted caps played nearby  Several Muslims of America leaders and two of the group s lawyers remained present  but did not try to control what other residents said 
Safiyya Haqq  67  who left Brooklyn with her five children as one of Islamberg s founding members  recalled the hamlet s early days   It was just so peaceful here  a great place to raise your children   she said

At a dinner gathering in an Islamberg home  residents dismissed the idea that they are training for a holy war or engaged in violence of any sort 
 If you come here  you see that there s no threat   said Bilqees Abdallah  a nurse practitioner 
They pointed with pride to the mosque  seasonal ice cream store and cemetery the town has built and talked of plans for a school and a health center 
During interviews  they condemned tactics used by the Islamic State  including beheadings  and said they did not consider the group to be true Muslims 
As to the women of Islamberg   We re not only confident  we re very strong and we are very opinionated   said 25 year resident Khadijah Smith  who is now retired from her job as a sales representative for American International Group  NYSE AIG   Inc  and serves as the assistant chief executive of Muslims of America 
CONTROVERSIAL PAST 
Much of the focus of Islamberg s detractors has been on Muslims of America founder Gilani  Islamberg residents say the cleric  who they believe has healing powers  preaches peace and has taught African American Muslims the importance of education and healthy living 
 He has been our inspiration  a guidance for us and our community   said Adams 
But during the 1980s and early 1990s  when the group went under the name Muslims of the Americas  it was linked by government and other researchers to a group called Jamaat ul Fuqra  Several people connected with ul Fuqra   though not any Islamberg residents   were implicated in plots against a Hindu sect and against a Muslim leader in Detroit  Gilani has said that he and the Muslims of America have  no knowledge of the existence  of ul Fuqra  
As recently as 2002  Muslims of the Americas also posted on its website writing characterized as  virulently anti Semitic  by the Anti Defamation League 
Gilani came under renewed scrutiny after the 2002 murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl  who was working on a story about  shoe bomber  Richard Reid at the time  On the morning he was abducted  Pearl believed he was going to meet with Gilani  Gilani was later cleared from involvement both with Reid and with the Pearl murder 
While allegations about today s Muslims of America still flourish on the Internet  experts and law enforcement officials contacted by Reuters dismissed the idea that the group has violent intentions 
 There is little evidence     to suggest that those compounds have any connection to terrorist training   said Oren Segal  director of the Center on Extremism at the Anti Defamation League  None of the Americans arrested on terror related charges since the 9 11 attacks have been connected to the Muslim of America hamlets  he added  
Current Muslim of America members say they respect people of all religious faiths  including those who are Jewish  Members could not be reached for follow up comment about past hate speech postings attributed to the group 
Law enforcement officials in nearby towns say they have seen little cause for concern about Islamberg 
 We haven t really had any big issues with them   said Delaware County Sheriff Thomas Mills  adding that he couldn t recall a time when law enforcers had responded to a civil or criminal matter in Islamberg during his 17 years as sheriff 
And although the traditional Muslim attire of the group s residents makes them stand out in nearby working class towns that favor flannel shirts and fishing waders  neighbors reported that the people of Islamberg generally keep a low profile 
Michelle Phoenix  town clerk in nearby Tompkins  says her exchanges with the Muslim group have been friendly  though she knows its members make some residents nervous 
Hancock resident Rose Mulqueen  56  summed up the most common sentiment heard in the area   I don t know much about them   she said  All I know is that they don t bother anyone  ",2015-06-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/a-tranquil-muslim-hamlet-in-the-catskills---until-the-attack-plot-344347,344347

173549,395065,AIG,AIG Ruling Leaves Bailout Questions Unanswered,news,"By   

On Sept  16  2008  American International Group  NYSE AIG  was burning  The insurance company s reckless bets on the subprime mortgage market had gone up in smoke  and the firm faced either government rescue or bankruptcy  As then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke later wrote   The Federal Reserve was the only fire station in town  
Seven years later  a judge has found that the government s bailout of AIG left the company smoldering  Judge Thomas Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled Monday that the government    and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York    overreached when they effectively nationalized AIG in 2008  The decision  however  raises as many questions as it settles    particularly around the issue of government bailouts  Namely  how far can the government go to right a ship that s quickly sinking  And where does that authority lie 
Even as Judge Wheeler ruled that the government lacked the authority to seize a 79 9 percent stake in the flailing company  he declined to award the  40 billion in damages former AIG CEO Maurice  Hank  Greenberg sought for himself and other shareholders  The ruling complicated the post crisis reckoning  Judge Wheeler admitted   A troubling feature of this outcome is that the government is able to avoid any damages notwithstanding its plain violations of the Federal Reserve Act   he wrote  referring to the 1932 statute that empowers the Fed to extend credit in a crisis 
The Brookings Institution s Philip Wallach sees Judge Wheeler s language as  strikingly sympathetic  to the plaintiffs but still not enough to alter the Fed   He s trying to lay out some strong language to limit the Fed   said Wallach  whose research explores the legal fallout of crisis era bailouts   On the other hand  there s the zero dollar judgment  which seems like it will inevitably cause the Fed to view this as a slap on the wrist  
Wheeler  who was appointed by President Bush in 2005  acknowledged as much   Any time the government saves a private enterprise from bankruptcy through an emergency loan  as here  it can essentially impose whatever terms it wishes without fear of reprisal  
The 90 year old Greenberg sought monetary damages on the argument that the government harmed shareholders and violated the Fifth Amendment when it essentially took the helm at AIG  Though Judge Wheeler agreed that the bailout constituted an  illegal exaction   he could not justify damages 
That s because the alternative to the government bailout  as Bernanke and then Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner knew  was bankruptcy    which would have left shareholders penniless  As a financial advisor told AIG s board in 2008   Twenty percent of something is better than 100 percent of nothing  
The Federal Reserve said as much in a statement released Monday   The terms of the credit were appropriately tough to protect taxpayers from the risks the rescue loan presented when it was made   the statement read  calling its actions  legal  proper and effective  
The terms were indeed tough  AIG faced interest rates more than three times what the Fed normally offers  Hundreds of government officials and advisers swarmed the firm to monitor compliance  The CEO got the boot  To Judge Wheeler  the Fed s response was  unduly harsh  
In part  that s because Fed officials hoped to use the penalties to avoid  moral hazard   the idea that companies are more likely to take unwise risks if they know the government will bail them out  AIG s bets were colossal  totaling more than  400 billion in high risk credit default swaps that were quickly becoming worthless 
But Wallach says regulators  actions reflected in large part the extraordinary demands of the crisis    something the ruling in this case is unlikely to change next time around   Even if there was a big monetary judgment  it s hard for me to imagine how that would really change the thinking of officials who are trying to stanch the bleeding  
Judge Wheeler s ruling adds some clarity to the legal issues surrounding bailouts    gobbling up shareholder equity isn t in the Fed s purview    but that its so toothless means the Fed is unlikely to be discouraged from taking similarly bold steps if a similar crisis erupts 
The issue remains a political lightning rod  Though the 2010 Dodd Frank Act included language that compelled the Fed to clear up its emergency lending guidelines  the central bank has resisted bipartisan congressional pressure to make its policies more stringent 
But the main impact of the case  says Wallach  may be in the Fed s communications department   This judge s opinion becomes a public relations black eye that further causes people to question the propriety of what the Fed did during the crisis   says Wallach   The Fed needs to do a better job of legitimating its actions in the eyes of the public  ",2015-06-16,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/aig-ruling-leaves-bailout-questions-unanswered-346790,346790

173566,395082,AIG,Global Anxiety Weighs On The S P 500,opinion,"The S P 500 futures had been up 10 out of the last 13 sessions going into Friday morning s job numbers  The economy added 288 000 new jobs in April  higher than expected  while the unemployment rate dropped to 6 3   the lowest since September 2008  In response  the S P 500  SNP  GSPC  picked up right where it left off all week going up and running more buy stops 
But by mid morning stocks failed to top the pre open high and dropped through the day to close down sharply 
The Dow Jones industrial average  DJI  DJI  fell 45 98 points or 0 3   to close at 16512 89 after being up as much as 61 points but was up  0 9  on the week  The S P 500   GSPC  lost 2 54 points or 0 1   to 1 881 14 and the Nasdaq Composite   IXIC  closed down 3 55 points or 0 1   to 4 123 90 
Perfect storm
After another round of S P 500 stock earnings reports  of the 371 companies that have reported for Q1 2014  74  were above the mean estimate and 52  have reported sales above the mean estimate  The Street now expects that once all 500 companies in the S P have reported  earnings will rise 1 5  from a year ago  better numbers than expected but not what investors want to see after last year s 30  gain 
Aside from the earnings  we have seen a slew of positive economic reports  capped off with last Friday s record job growth  When you add it all up  it s been a perfect storm to the upside for the S P futures  CME SPM14  
Fund flows  Out of bonds and into stocks
Bond futures are going back up  but that s not stopping more money moving into the stock market  While it appears the flows may be slowing  according to information provided by Lipper on the week ending 3 23 2014 equity funds reported inflows of  2 6 billion  taxable bond funds had inflows of over 2 9 billion  and ETF equity funds  3 1 billion 
Last week  or the week ending 4 30 2014  equity fund inflows came to  2 6 billion  taxable fund inflows  711 million  ETF equity fund inflows  1 6 billion  and taxable bond fund inflows  216mil 
One reason the public continues to pour money into stocks is the lack of return on bond funds  Over the weekend Pimco s Total Return Fund reported  5 5 billion in outflows across its U S  open end mutual funds in April  extending the company s record outflow streak to 11 straight months  data from Morningstar showed on Friday  The Pimco Total Return Fund is the world s largest bond fund with  230 billion in assets  and is now in its 12th straight month of investor outflows 
During that period  the Fed has gone through four tapers  reducing its buybacks nearly in half  and the unemployment rate has dropped 1 2   It also saw the exit of former Pimco CEO and co CIO Mohamed El Erian  The fund is now run by Pimco co founder and chief investment officer Bill Gross 
The point is that we live in a risk on  risk off world  With rates still close to zero and the stock market moving back up  money has been moving back into the stock market  What the totals do not take into account is all the geopolitical risk we are seeing this morning in the Ukraine

Our view  Mondays in 2014 have been 12 up   5 down
Putin is warning and there have been  dozens  of strategic bombers and fighter jets patrolling the skies above the Russian controlled Crimean peninsula  There is a very big possibility that Russian troops will intervene in eastern Ukraine  The S P may not like that but we suspect it will continue its ascent one way or the other 
The direct causes of the S P s price action mostly have nothing to do with macroeconomics  It has to do with money flows and algorithmic trading and chasing stops  If the range is 1840 to 1880 the S P has to run the sell stops under the low end of the range and then it has to run the buy stops above the upper end of the range  Once it accomplishes its task the likelihood of a reversal increases 
Our view is that while Monday is the lowest volume day of the week it also doesn t have a bad batting average  Of the 17 Mondays in 2014  12 have closed higher and 5 have been down  We fell short of our 1890 call by 4 handles last Friday and we have yet to see the E mini  CME ESM14  run the stops above 1888 70 to 1893 00  but we still think it s coming  Today we lean to buying the early weakness and selling rallies

173572,395088,AIG,Top Ranked Insurance ETF In Focus,opinion,Thanks to the ultra low interest rates environment  the insurance industry has been lagging the overall market and the broader financial space so far this year  This is because low rates dampened insurers  profits by lowering returns   major income sources   on their investment portfolios  However  the insurance companies are benefiting from longer dated bonds as the value of these bonds is rising with falling yields  The trend is likely to continue in the coming months as the Fed continued to keep interest rates at lower levels for a considerable period of time even after the QE wrap up  This would lead to a further fall in the bond yields and a rise in bond price     The sector is poised to profit from improving economic activities across the globe amid escalating turmoil in Iraq and growing tensions in Russia  After being stressed by brutal weather conditions in the first quarter  latest economic indicators related to manufacturing  servicing  housing  employment and consumer confidence point to a strong recovery  All these would lead to higher demand for all types of insurance services  read     Further  investors should note that the upside to this industry is confirmed by the Zacks Industry Rank  as three out of five insurance industries actually have a solid Rank at the time of writing  Property casualty has a Zacks Rank in the top 11  while two other segments   accident health and brokers   have Ranks in the top 40   This suggests smooth trading in this corner of the financial market over the coming months  Given the optimistic outlook  a good way to seek entry into the insurance world is by tilting toward companies in this segment  While there are a number of ways to invest in this corner of the market  a look at the top ranked ETF could be an excellent play  One way to find a top ranked ETF in the insurance space is by using the Zacks ETF Rank system  see    About the Zacks ETF Rank The Zacks ETF Rank provides a recommendation for the ETF in the context of our outlook for the underlying industry  sector  style box or asset class  Our proprietary methodology also takes into account the risk preferences of investors    The aim of our model is to select the best ETFs within each risk category  We assign each ETF one of five ranks within each risk bucket  Thus  the Zacks ETF Rank reflects the expected return of an ETF relative to other products with a similar level of risk  Using this strategy  we have found one ETF   iShares U S  Insurance ETF  NYSE IAK    that has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or  Strong Buy  rating with a  Medium  risk outlook  see  all the   IAK in Focus This ETF provides exposure to the insurance segment of the broader U S  financial sector by tracking the Dow Jones U S  Select Insurance Index  In total  the fund holds a basket of 67 securities and charges 46 bps in fees per year from investors  The product is heavily concentrated on the top two firms   American International Group  NYSE AIG  and MetLife  NYSE MET    with a combined 25  share  Other firms do not hold more than 7 23  of assets  It has a certain tilt toward large cap and value stocks as about two third of the portfolio falls in the large cap category while about 97  of it is classified as value  read     A combination of large cap value securities has the potential to deliver higher returns and reduce overall volatility in the portfolio  In addition  these securities tend to outperform when considered on a long term investment horizon and are less susceptible to trending markets  As such  these provide safety and could be the perfect choice for investors concerned about lower interest rates and its negative impact on the sector  Within the insurance sector  property and casualty insurance takes the top spot  accounting for less than half of the asset base while life insurance and full time insurance take the remaining portion  In terms of performance  IAK added just 2 9  year to date  easily underperforming the broad financial fund  ARCA XLF  and U S  market fund  ARCA SPY  by wide margins  However  the ETF is leading the financial space from a long term perspective given returns of 61 6  over the trailing three year period and 150 5  over the past five years  read     The fund has so far accumulated only  139 1 million in its asset base and is often overlooked by investors as depicted by its small volume of roughly 24 000 shares per day  This suggests that bid ask spreads are relatively wide and that total costs may be higher than the expense ratio Bottom Line Given that the sector is yet to see strength in the coming months on improving global economic conditions  investors should definitely take advantage of the weak stock prices by investing in this top ranked ETF ,2014-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-ranked-insurance-etf-in-focus-218190,218190
173573,395089,AIG,Former AIG head Benmosche dies  led insurer after bailout,news,By Luciana Lopez and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK  Reuters    Robert Benmosche  who took the helm of insurer American International Group  N AIG  after a massive government bailout at the height of the financial crisis  died on Friday at 70 after a battle with lung cancer   Benmosche is credited with steering AIG through the turbulent period following its near collapse and rescue by the U S  government  During his tenure  which started in August 2009  AIG fully repaid the  182 3 billion government bailout it received in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy  Benmosche  who stepped down in September 2014  weathered intense scrutiny and was sharp tongued at times  referring to federal officials as  those crazies down in Washington    Critics often likened the former CEO  who also tangled with then New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo over bonuses paid to AIG staff after the bailout  to a bull in a china shop   I can be   I can break things   he said in an interview at his villa in Croatia in August 2009  when asked about his sometimes pugnacious manner shortly after taking the AIG job  That was about 11 months after the insurer was brought to its knees because of a unit that sold credit default swap contracts on risky securities  as well as other investments in subprime mortgage backed securities  Benmosche also often defended AIG employees from public criticism of the company and its role in the financial crisis  which helped trigger the worst recession in the United States in 70 years    A lot of  employees  feel hurt  embarrassed  a lot of people have lived in fear because of what I call lynch mobs with pitchforks   he said in the Reuters interview   That defense of AIG employees won him praise from his workers  After Benmosche was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010  employees would tear up when discussing his illness    Bob was a brilliant man who brought tremendous leadership  energy  passion  and tenacity to his job  At AIG  we will honor his legacy by continuing to focus on integrity and performance  He will be deeply missed   said Robert S  Miller  chairman of AIG s board of directors  Benmosche was CEO of MetLife Inc  N MET  from 1998 to 2006  He came out of retirement to lead AIG  which announced his death in a statement on Friday   Maurice  Hank  Greenberg  who built AIG into a global financial services powerhouse during nearly 40 years at its helm  told Reuters on Friday that he had recommended Benmosche to the U S  government when it was looking for a new chief    He was a good man  strong  knowledgeable and honorable   everything we look for in a CEO   said Greenberg  who was chair of AIG from 1967 to 2005  before being forced out  Benmosche said an AIG failure could be devastating for the United States and other countries    Some of us need to come out of retirement   who have done this before   to help deal with the crisis   Benmosche said to Reuters in 2009   If I sit here  I just felt that there are going to be continuing problems  I felt I had some of the skills necessary to fix the problems of AIG in particular and it made sense to come back   Benmosche  who had undergone treatment for lung cancer since 2010  announced his intention to leave AIG in June of last year  He did so in September  and was succeeded as president and CEO by Peter Hancock  Benmosche  who died at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City  is survived by his wife Denise  three children  three siblings  and six grandchildren   The Brooklyn born Benmosche prided himself on a reputation for toughness  He earned a bachelor s degree in mathematics from Alfred University in Alfred  New York  later serving in Korea as a lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps ,2015-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/former-aig-head-benmosche-dies;-led-insurer-after-bailout-330127,330127
173574,395090,AIG,U S bailout of AIG in 2008 was  punitive   ex CEO s lawyer says,news,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government was  punitive  in its bailout of American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG  in 2008  a lawyer for the company s former chief executive argued during closing arguments of a trial that may impact how much flexibility regulators will have when they respond to future financial crises  Former AIG Chief Executive Maurice  Hank  Greenberg  who was in court on Wednesday for the first time during the trial  is seeking to convince a federal judge that the U S  government s rescue terms for the New York based insurance giant to save it from bankruptcy cheated its shareholders   They were punitive to AIG because someone had to be a political scapegoat   Greenberg s lawyer  star litigator David Boies  said on Wednesday in his closing arguments  which followed six weeks of testimony last fall  He said the government had singled out AIG and tried to  demonize  the company  Greenberg  89  through his Starr International Co  was AIG s largest shareholder with a 12 percent stake before the bailout in September 2008  AIG s problems stemmed from insurance it wrote on billions of dollars worth of shoddy mortgage securities   Greenberg sued the U S  government in 2011  arguing that the New York Federal Reserve s initial  85 billion loan package  which carried an interest rate of 14 percent and a nearly 80 percent U S  stake in AIG  was an illegal takeover from shareholders  Lawyers for the U S  government countered that the bailout  which ultimately rose to  182 3 billion  raised the value of AIG shares and that policymakers had to consider  moral hazard  concerns when calculating its terms   If the Fed had wanted to harm AIG in some way  all it had to do was nothing   Justice Department lawyer Kenneth Dintzer said  insisting that the government stepped in because the private sector deemed such a loan  too risky   AIG finished repaying the bailout in December 2012  leaving taxpayers with a nearly  23 billion profit  On Tuesday  Greenberg made a last ditch effort to avoid trial in a lawsuit brought against him by New York state which accuses him and Howard Smith  a former AIG financial officer  of accounting fraud at AIG from 2000 to 2005  Greenberg  who led AIG for almost four decades until 2005  is seeking as much as  50 billion in damages on behalf of AIG shareholders  The suit won class action status two years ago

173590,395106,AIG,AIG beats third quarter estimates  will buy back more shares,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Insurer American International Group  N AIG  on Monday reported better than expected third quarter earnings  bolstered in part by improved performance at core insurance operations 
After tax operating income jumped 23 percent from a year earlier  Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock said the company remains  disciplined in our approach to balancing growth  profitability  and risk and focused on maintaining the strength of our industry leading balance sheet  
The company also declared a dividend of 12 5 cents per share as it did in the previous quarter  In addition  AIG s board authorized a further up to  1 5 billion share buybacks  in addition to the  3 4 billion of AIG stock the insurer has repurchased this year  AIG shares rose 0 43 percent to close at  53 8 on Monday 
 Overall  it was a good quarter   said S P Capital IQ equity analyst Cathy Seifert   I think it was a triple  I don t think it was a home run  
Hancock took the reins at the company on Sept  1  moving from his previous post as head of the company s property casualty business 
Hancock succeeded Bob Benmosche  who was widely credited with helping turn the company around after bad bets on derivatives nearly sank the company during the financial crisis 
The company has since focused more closely on its core businesses and reinstated a dividend last year 
 Improvements in AIG s accident year loss ratio show management s underwriting efforts having an impact   said Sanford C  Bernstein   Co analyst Josh Stirling 
For the third quarter  AIG reported net income of  2 19 billion  or  1 52 per share  compared with net income of  2 17 billion  or  1 46 per share  a year earlier 
After tax operating income rose to  1 7 billion  or  1 21 per share  in the quarter ended Sept  30  from  1 4 billion  or  0 96 per share  a year earlier 
Analysts on average had expected earnings of  1 09 per share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
In property casualty  net premiums earned rose about 2 percent to  8 63 billion  and the combined ratio rose to 102 0 from 101 6 
A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit  meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims 
In commercial underwriting  net premiums earned rose about 4 percent to  5 34 billion  and the combined ratio rose to 101 1 from 100 2 
In consumer underwriting  net premiums earned remained flat at about  3 27 billion  The combined ratio fell to 98 8 from 99 9 

Shares of AIG have risen about 5 percent from the end of last year through Friday  The S P 500 gained about 9 percent over the same time

173591,395107,AIG,African insurers in vogue as incomes rise ,news,"By Carolyn Cohn and Helen Nyambura Mwaura
LONDON JOHANNESBURG  Reuters    A growing middle class in sub Saharan Africa is enticing European and South African insurers to buy local firms focussing mainly on life insurance and pensions  in the face of mature markets and strong competition at home 
Rapid economic growth in countries such as Ghana  Kenya and Nigeria has increased the number of people with money to spend on insurance to protect their wealth  while regulatory changes are encouraging the growth of domestic savings and pensions 
Several major companies  including Swiss Re  VX SRENH   Prudential  L PRU  and Sanlam  J SLMJ   are buying insurers in Africa  with the focus on life and pensions products in the more economically advanced sub Saharan countries 
Notwithstanding the challenges  the race is definitely on  David Hodnett  Barclays Africa s deputy CEO  told a banking conference in Johannesburg in November   Every insurer that you look at has probably about five or six suitors  
A Standard Bank report published in August said while the size of the  middle class  in sub Saharan Africa may have been overstated in some studies  growth rates were nevertheless dramatic 
Its study of 11 sub Saharan economies concluded the  middle class  had risen from 4 6 million to 15 million since 2000 and would be over 40 million by 2030  with Africa s biggest economy Nigeria leading the way 
Insurance penetration  or premiums written as a percentage of gross domestic product  was 11 5 percent in Britain in 2013 but just 0 6 percent in Nigeria  For life insurance  penetration was 8 8 percent versus 0 2 percent  according to Swiss Re data 
Life insurance premium volume in dollar terms rose 18 6 percent last year in Kenya  13 8 in Angola and 13 5 in Nigeria  compared with a 3 9 percent rise in Britain  the data showed 
 The level of life products and penetration is very low   said Davinder Sikand  head of Africa at private equity firm Abraaj   There are a lot of opportunities to develop products to fit the needs of the people  
One of the latest deals was French insurer AXA s  PA AXAF   250 million purchase last month of a majority stake in Nigeria s Mansard Insurance  which offers life and general insurance 
South Africa focused companies such as Old Mutual  L OML  and Liberty  J LBHJ  are also eager to expand in the life market in sub Saharan Africa 
LeapFrog Investments  which invests in financial services in emerging markets  launched its second Africa and Asia fund in September while British insurer Prudential  L PRU  has bought life insurers in Kenya and Ghana this year 
HARD TO REACH
Insurance specialists say middle class and lower middle class customers in Africa are not as affluent as developed world middle classes  tend to be harder to reach and can require a larger use of face to face agents 
The numbers in the Standard Bank survey are based on households that consume more than  15 a day 
A shortage of skilled insurance staff  fragmentation of the market across a large number of countries with many small insurance firms and regulatory hurdles present more obstacles 
 It s quite challenging  a lot of work is required   said Frank O Neill  head of Middle East and Africa at Swiss Re   It s not as straightforward as if you look at Brazil  one single country  
Getting regulatory approval can take more than a year for each new company bought  and frameworks differ from country to country  industry specialists say 
 Wherever you go there are new regulations to learn and comply with   said Victor Muguto  head of insurance for consultancy PwC in Africa 
 There are shortages of staff in some of the countries  experienced staff are not always easy to come by   he said 
Would be insurance buyers will also need to do their homework to work out which of the many local insurers offer the most value  Profits across the board in Kenya s insurance sector  for example  rose 24 percent last year  but that covers nearly 50 companies 
Insurers are more likely to do well if they partner with banks  said Dudu Tembo  portfolio manager at wealth manager Citadel Investment Services  as  the challenge has been issues around distribution

173615,395131,AIG,Six years after AIG bailout  trial asks  was it legal ,news,"By Aruna Viswanatha WASHINGTON  Reuters    One of the more unusual trials to come out of the 2008 financial crisis is set to begin on Monday  when a federal judge will consider whether the U S  government s rescue of American International Group Inc  N AIG  was  in fact  legal 
In a case that explores the limits on U S  government power in responding to major financial crises  the trial is expected to revisit in detail the New York Federal Reserve s September 2008 decision to extend a bailout package to AIG as the insurance giant was minutes from bankruptcy 
The AIG bailout  on the heels of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008  preceded the  too big to fail  auto and bank bailouts the federal government undertook during a U S  financial crisis underpinned by faulty mortgage lending 
The major players in that drama will be back on the Washington stage during the six week trial  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  and former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry  Hank  Paulson 
A lawyer for the insurance giant s former chief executive  Maurice  Hank  Greenberg  was expected to argue that the government unlawfully sought to punish AIG shareholders with excessively harsh terms 
Greenberg s lawyers have said in court papers the bailout  offer  from the New York Fed to provide AIG an  85 billion loan in exchange for high interest rates and a nearly 80 percent stake in the company amounted to unconstitutional theft from AIG shareholders 
Greenberg  through his Starr International Co  was AIG s largest shareholder at the time  Starr filed lawsuit  to considerable public scorn  in November 2011 
Government lawyers have defended the actions as appropriate  pointing out that the deal had been approved by the AIG board  as the company faced no other alternative to bankruptcy  Lawyers at the U S  Department of Justice have described the case as a  conspiracy theory  and  built on a mistaken premise  
 Starr s case stems from a misperceived entitlement     that when AIG faced an existential crisis in September 2008  AIG was entitled to dictate the terms of its own rescue   they said in papers filed before trial 
But U S  Judge Thomas Wheeler last month rejected the United States  bid to dismiss the lawsuit  which seeks as much  50 billion in damages  saying that the case involved  complex financial and economic issues  that deserved analysis 
The case poses two central questions  One is whether it was legal for the government to take  35 billion worth in AIG shares  and only effectively pay  500 000  The 5th Amendment to the U S  Constitution prevents private property from being taken for public use without just compensation 
The other is whether the government was allowed to condition its first  85 billion loan on an equity stake in the company  Starr s lawyers have argued that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow the government to demand a stake in the company in exchange for the loan 
AIG finished repaying the full  182 3 billion bailout in December 2012  leaving taxpayers with a nearly  23 billion profit 
Greenberg  89  led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster 
Arguing for Starr is David Boies  who represented former Vice President Al Gore before the U S  Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election 
Few experts even expected the case to go to trial 
 Certainly what the government did was unusual     my guess is that the government will win   said Hester Peirce  a senior research fellow at George Mason University who studies financial regulation 

 The standard idea is that during a crisis  what the government should do is lend freely  but they should do so at a penalty rate   Peirce said

173616,395132,AIG,Ex Treasury Secretary Paulson says AIG bailout was punitive,news,"By Aruna Viswanatha WASHINGTON  Reuters    Former Treasury Secretary Henry  Hank  Paulson told a packed courtroom on Monday that AIG shareholders were singled out for punishment as part of the U S  government s attempt to contain the contagion of the 2008 financial crisis 
The testimony from Paulson appeared to bolster some claims contained in a lawsuit brought by former AIG Chief Executive Hank Greenberg  who contends the terms of a government loan to AIG cheated its shareholders 
 AIG  either fairly or unfairly      became a symbol for all that is bad on Wall Street   Paulson said as he testified about the U S  government s bailout of the insurance giant  which began with a  85 billion loan from the New York Federal Reserve in September 2008 
Paulson  who appeared relaxed as he testified in federal court in Washington  said he supported the loan as appropriate for the circumstances  especially because officials needed to send a message that any bailout would come with strings attached 
But he did not shed much light on how the terms of the loan were selected  which is at the heart of the case 
Paulson was one of the chief architects of the U S  government s response to the unprecedented global credit crisis of 2007 2009  and he has since written a book about the experience  Monday s courtroom setting put Paulson on the hot seat in a way he has not experienced since Congress wrapped up its hearings on the subject years ago 
Legal experts have doubted the strength of the lawsuit  which is seeking as much as  50 billion from the government  The outcome of the lawsuit may affect how much flexibility regulators will have when they respond to future financial crises 
MORAL HAZARD
In the case of AIG  the Fed initially charged a high interest rate for the first loan and required a nearly 80 percent stake in the company in exchange  which Greenberg s lawyers have said was illegal 
While Paulson said he was not involved in setting the specific terms  he said the provisions were necessary to protect against  moral hazard   or concerns that other companies would take reckless risks under the belief that the government would bail them out with few consequences 
But in response to questions from a government lawyer  Paulson said Citigroup Inc s  N C  shareholders were not subject to similar terms when the bank also started to falter during the crisis 
Paulson said Citigroup was different  in part because policymakers were concerned about short sellers who were exerting pressure on Citi s stock and would profit if the rescue targeted Citi s shareholders 
Paulson said he was worried the traders would take the same strategy to the next bank  a concern he said he did not have about any of AIG s peers 
AIG s problems stemmed from insurance it wrote on  79 billion worth of shoddy mortgage securities  Citigroup and other banks facing mounting losses on toxic assets they held 
Paulson took the stand Monday morning wearing a dark suit and red tie  answering questions so directly that Greenberg s lawyer  star litigator David Boies  wrapped up what he expected to be six hours of testimony within a little over one hour 
The testimony by Paulson comes in the second week of what is expected to be a six week trial  Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are expected to testify later this week 
Boies has sought to portray the government as shutting down possible alternative rescues for AIG in 2008  including one from Chinese government investors  Paulson testified that such offers from China were unrealistic without a U S  government backstop  which he said he had not been authorized to provide 
On Monday Paulson also said he had spoken in 2008 to then presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama about the AIG bailout  and had informed them that AIG shareholders would be treated harshly  Paulson said he hoped that assurance would help convince the two candidates to avoid criticizing the deal in public 
Paulson  who served as President George W  Bush s Treasury secretary from 2006 to 2009  was previously the chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc  N GS  and now runs an institute that focuses on climate change and other issues 

The case is Starr International Co v  U S   U S  Court of Federal Claims  No  11 00779

173617,395133,AIG,Ex U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner defends AIG bailout ,news,"By Aruna Viswanatha WASHINGTON  Reuters    Former U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday defended the government s rescue of American International Group Inc  N AIG  in September 2008  saying the action was necessary to prevent the country from plunging into a possible second Great Depression 
Geithner s comments came in testimony he provided in the trial of a lawsuit brought by Hank Greenberg  AIG s top executive from 1968 to 2005  who contends the terms of the government  85 billion loan to AIG cheated its shareholders 
Greenberg s lawyer  star litigator David Boies  spent much of Tuesday morning introducing emails Geithner wrote and received when he served as president of the New York Federal Reserve in the chaotic days around the initial bailout offer 
Many of the emails were sent from other New York Fed officials after midnight  underscoring the round the clock effort the government undertook to contain the 2008 financial crisis 
Boies also read aloud  in Washington federal court  comments Geithner made in his book about AIG s deteriorating condition and the consequences the company s collapse could have on the broader financial system 
 It sounds like you are quoting me   Geithner said on multiple occasions after hearing a passage from Boies  who cited the book with enough frequency that the judge overseeing the case asked if he should go get his own copy at Barnes   Noble  N BKS  
Geithner  who appeared relaxed during his more than three hours on the stand  did attempt to walk back some comments he had made in the past about the AIG bailout  including statements that the insurance company s shareholders had been  effectively wiped out  and that the government had essentially  nationalized  AIG 
That was  not the most precise language   he said  to laughter in the courtroom 

Geithner is expected to continue his testimony on Tuesday afternoon

173622,395138,AIG,Ex Fed Chair Bernanke  wanted to stop AIG default  not punish firm,news,"By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON  Reuters    Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday that he was hesitant to bail out American International Group  N AIG  in 2008  but he was primarily concerned that the insurer  was on the brink of default  and not about punishing AIG  
Bernanke s comments came in a fifth day of testimony by former top government officials  who sought to convince a federal judge that their actions in rescuing the insurance company were legal 
Bernanke  on the witness stand for a second day  said he initially hoped that AIG might find a private sector solution and worried that the insurance giant s management underestimated the extent of its problems 
When the initial  85 billion loan package for AIG was approved by the Fed  Bernanke  who left the central bank earlier this year  said he was focused on the idea that  our intervention would spare it the discipline of the market  
Former AIG Chief Executive Hank Greenberg  who was the company s largest shareholder before the bailout  sued the government in 2011  He argued that the loan  which carried an interest rate of more than 12 percent and a nearly 80 percent U S  stake in AIG  resulted in an illegal takeover from shareholders 
David Boies  Greenberg s lawyer  has sought during the trial to show that AIG got a worse deal than ailing U S  banks and other institutions that got crisis era support 
On Friday  Boies pressed Bernanke about how much latitude the Fed had in structuring emergency loans and sought to show that AIG shareholders got short changed because regulators wanted to punish the insurer for perceived mismanagement in the run up to the financial crisis  
AIG ran into trouble during the crisis over insurance products it sold banks that were tied to bad mortgage loans  Former Treasury Secretary Henry  Hank  Paulson testified earlier this week that the bailout terms were meant to be punitive 
FED DISCRETION
Boies quizzed Bernanke about why the insurer was not allowed to access other Fed loan programs that already existed at the time 
To show how much discretion the Fed had over such lending  Boies asked whether it legally could have rejected companies  requests for cash because of their political leanings 
Bernanke said he was not directly involved in crafting the loan terms  But he said they needed to be tough so shareholders would not get a  windfall  from a bailout and to reflect the risk of making the loan 
 No reasonable person could conclude that it was anything other than a risky loan   he said 
He said Fed officials also worried that AIG did not have a plan to wean itself from government support 
The bailout ultimately rose to  182 3 billion  an amount AIG repaid in full by December 2012  yielding a  23 billion profit for the government 
The lawsuit  which is being tried in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington  won class action status in May 2013
