14438,235953,XRX,Activist hedge funds stepped up calls for asset sales and spin offs in 2019  data,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
NEW YORK  Reuters    Hedge funds that push for change at corporations stepped up their demands for asset spin offs and sales last year  making them part of nearly half of all activist investor campaigns waged in 2019  according to data released on Wednesday 
 A record 99 campaigns with an M A related thesis were launched in 2019   said Jim Rossman  the head of shareholder advisory at Lazard  which compiled the statistics  Calls for companies to be sold outright or for certain units to be divested accounted for 47  of last year s activity  up from 35  in previous years  Rossman said 
Some of the most noteworthy mergers and acquisition plays from last year include Carl Icahn pushing for Hewlett Packard to accept a takeover offer from Xerox  NYSE XRX   Icahn owns shares in both companies 
Icahn also pushed for a strategic review at Caesars which was later purchased by Eldorado Resorts 
At AT T  Elliott Management urged the company to consider selling off certain parts of its business  Elliott also called on Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  to break itself apart before the company spun off its Speedway unit 
The surge came as activist funds delivered their best returns in years  posting an average 18 3  return in 2019  Hedge Fund Research data show 
Activism has picked up dramatically since the 2008 financial crisis  But it was popular long before  including in the period form the 1970s to late 1980s when financiers including Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz were called corporate raiders for strong arm tactics used to replace top management and improve value for shareholders 
Activists also shifted their focus abroad with more non U S  companies being targeted  according to Lazard statistics

 you may begin John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  Last February  we put a three year plan in place  guided by our strategic initiatives to optimize our operations  drive revenue  reenergize our innovation engine and focus on cash  2019 was focused on building a strong foundation that will position us for sustainable long term growth  And among other things  We expanded Project Own It  our enterprisewide transformation initiative to optimize our operations  drive investments back into our business and create a culture of continuous improvement  We monetized our illiquid 25  stake in Fuji Xerox for over 20 times that asset s annual cash flow  unlocking significant unrealized value  We implemented a more frictionless  high velocity supply chain to increase flexibility and customer responsiveness  We invested in technology enhancements and product launches designed to increase revenue in core and adjacent markets  as well as new areas of innovation for future growth  We stood by our commitment to innovate and put the brainpower of our best scientists and engineers on solving some of the biggest challenges the modern world is facing And we promoted and attracted new talent at all levels of the organization to elevate our game  We ended 2019 stronger  delivering full year results that are ahead of schedule on almost all financial metrics  Our employees are excited about the future and direction of their company  and clients increasingly seek us out for Workplace Solutions  Our full year results position us well to deliver on our three year commitment of expanding adjusted margins by 200 basis points  growing adjusted EPS annually by more than 7   generating more than  3 billion of cumulative free cash flow and achieving flat year over year revenue in 2021  In the fourth quarter  we grew earnings per share  increased cash flow  expanded adjusted operating margin and maintained the momentum to improve our revenue trajectory compared with the first half of the year  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was  1 33  an increase of more than 40  year over year  Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 16 8   up 270 basis points year over year  Fourth quarter revenue declined 1 6  at constant currency year over year  Excluding an upfront payment from an OEM license we granted to Fuji Xerox in connection with the sale of our stake in the joint venture  fourth quarter revenue was down 4 7  at constant currency  slightly better than our expectations  For the full year  we increased EPS  cash flow and operating margins year over year  Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the full year was  1 24 billion  an increase of  162 million from a year ago  Full year free cash flow totaled  1 18 billion  up  187 million year over year  We accomplished this while returning more than 70  of free cash flow to shareholders  paying down  950 million in debt and increasing investments in growth areas  Full year revenue declined 4 7  at constant currency year over year  in line with our guidance  Our second half progress reversed the first half top line trajectory  but we have more work to do  and this continues to be an area of intense focus for us  Adjusted operating margin for the full year was 13 1   up 180 basis points year over year  At the heart of Project Own It is simplification  redesigning seven key areas across the organization so that we can better serve clients  generate savings that can be reinvested in the business and position Xerox for a return to growth  The seven areas of focus we laid out are  shared services  procurement  IT  delivery  supply chain  real estate and organizational design  We have made significant progress in each of these areas  For example  changes to our supply chain in 2019 improved our responsiveness and increased our sourcing flexibility  In June  we expanded our commercial relationship with HP to cover more equipment  supplies  software and services in both directions  Then in November  we restructured our relationship with Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox to both monetize an otherwise illiquid asset at an attractive valuation and establish a more traditional supply relationship  which will ensure we have the ability to source from the partner that can offer the highest value proposition  We also redesigned our logistics networks and inventory utilization model  By maximizing competitive tension among our sourcing partners and improving the speed and responsiveness of our supply chain  we are better positioned to serve our clients at a lower cost  thereby improving our revenue trajectory and margins  This will remain an ongoing process as we stay current and ahead of trends  Our investment initiatives under Project Own It are beginning to take hold as well  For example  we now have nearly 200 bots working across the organization in areas such as order to cash  delivery  human resources and finance  We are on track to double that number in 2020  Automation is key to having a frictionless  high velocity business  Clients  as well as employees  increasingly expect an Amazon like experience  and we are focused on implementing technologies that allow us to deliver exactly that  As a result of Project Own It  we delivered gross savings of  1 billion on a  9 billion cost base in just 18 months  In 2019  we achieved our target of annual gross savings of  640 million  Due to our disciplined approach to restructuring  we spent approximately  0 35 for every dollar saved  We expect to deliver at least  450 million of additional gross savings in 2020  We are making progress on our three year revenue road map as investments in our business gained traction  In the second half of 2019  the benefits of revenue generating initiatives began to flow through  and we expect the rate of revenue decline to continue to improve in 2020  We are focused on capturing growth in core markets  broadening services and software  delivering new technology solutions  and further penetrating the small and midsized business market  We also increased investments in areas such as supplies coverage to improve the attach rate on unbundled supply sales  With these investments  we saw an improvement in supplies compared to the first half  Geographically  Europe performed below our expectations  The uncertainty and geopolitical friction within the region continues to create a weaker economic environment  driving fewer deployments of large deals and delaying decisions  To counter the regional dynamics  we are taking targeted actions and making investments such as expanding our presence in the SMB market and investing in our distribution channels  The investments we made earlier in the year in the Americas continued to flow through the fourth quarter  largely within our U S  Enterprise account  the high end segment and the SMB market  In our core technology business  particularly at the high end  the Iridesse and Baltoro HF Inkjet Press  two cut sheet products that are unmatched in the marketplace  drove momentum  In the fourth quarter  competitive knockouts and new business accounted for more than a third of iIridesse and Baltoro placements  Tech enhancements we made in the fall also contributed to an improvement in iGen 5 sales  We have new innovations and enhancements in the pipeline for 2020  Xerox is unique in being able to offer an end to end solution that takes clients from document creation to distribution  For example  our FreeFlow Core software automates the prepress process on both Xerox and competitive printer products and is a key differentiator at the high end  And by extending its use to competitor products  we drove double digit new installed growth for FreeFlow Core year over year while opening the door to more competitive knockouts  In the mid range segment  PrimeLink  our new light production color printer offering  stands alone  We believe there s no other product that can match its capabilities at this price point  This new device was a key revenue driver in its segment  We will expand the PrimeLink platform in Q1  A4s in the low end are commoditized with numerous competitors and limited ways to increase price or margin  Key to growth here is offering a total solution plan that drives more value and simplicity for clients and us  which we will do in the coming months  We will introduce a very simple  all in plan targeted at small and medium businesses  which include the device  digital apps  service and supplies for a monthly price  In January  we expanded IT services for SMBs to all of our Xerox business solution cores  Our offering spans hardware procurement  pro engineering  IT product support and managed IT services  Leveraging our footprint in existing relationships  we believe that there s an opportunity for Xerox to fill this gap in the SMB market and drive growth  We plan to extend this offering in the U K  and Canada in the second quarter  Software is a key focus for growth  with benefits of investments made early in the year starting to flow through  One example is a new SaaS based version of DocuShare  Xerox s content management platform that makes work easier and more efficient  This new version accounts for more than half of new business for this product  a strong signal to continue to invest in this area  While we focused on improvements to our core and adjacent businesses  we are delivering on our commitment to reenergize Xerox s innovation engine  This year  we will celebrate PARC s 50th anniversary  a reminder of the strong legacy of invention at Xerox that benefit both business and society  Last year  we outlined four areas of focus in innovation  3D printing and digital manufacturing  AI workflow assistance  IoT sensors and services  digital packaging and print  Later in the year  we added a fifth focus area  clean technology  We have some of the world s best scientists and engineers focused on bringing new technologies to market  In 3D  our acquisition of Vader Systems about a year ago is accelerating our go to market strategy  We are developing what is likely to be the industry s first additive liquid metal printer  In a world that s on demand  now manufacturing can be too  With this technology  manufacturers will be able to make parts from start to finish in hours instead of days without sacrificing quality or strength  We re on track to deliver a commercially available product this year for AI workflow assistance  focused on addressing some of the most time consuming tasks businesses face  such as RFPs  an area where companies spend an estimated  60 billion annually  On IoT  we are expanding the testing of our sensing and analytics technologies with prominent partners across the world  from New York to Australia  Our pilots are demonstrating an improved level of sensing and insights in industrial predictive maintenance applications that were not available before  On digital packaging  we are engaging select customers to refine the requirements of our technologies and validate our value proposition  delivering greater personalization and operational efficiencies  including new use cases in in line marking and coating  The team is also exploring a variety of commercialization models and pathways such as licensing to bring these solutions to market  The significant impact of climate change is front in mind for many of us  We are applying business resources to develop new clean technologies that create a more sustainable world  One area we are focusing on is air conditioning  As the years get hotter and more people use air conditioning  there is a greater need for more efficient cooling technologies  Today  air conditioning accounts for significant global greenhouse gas emission  We are working with the U S  Department of Energy to develop a solution that can reduce energy consumption of air conditioners by up to 80   Our Powered by Xerox approach allows us to leverage our intellectual property to maximize reach and benefit commercially without having to build the end product ourselves  Today  one of the largest 3D manufacturers uses our inkjet printhead  Another example is a recent deal we made with Alcon  the global leader in eye care  Our engineers are working with Alcon to develop new eye care solutions that leverage our existing IP and will help millions of people who struggle with various eye conditions  Xerox has long defined the modern work experience  and we re investing in key areas that will ensure we do so for many years to come  Cash is critical to reinvesting in the business in the ways I ve described  We achieved  1 18 billion of free cash flow in 2019  the high end of our guidance range and representing 19  year over year growth  We ended the year with approximately  2 8 billion of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  which brought us to a net cash core position of  1 8 billion  In 2019  we returned 72  of our free cash flow to shareholders  exceeding our commitment to return at least 50   In 2020  we remain committed to returning at least 50  of annual free cash flow to shareholders  and we expect to repurchase at least 300 million of shares  Before wrapping up  I wanted to discuss our approach to M A  We have an established M A playbook that we use to evaluate all deals  from tuck ins to multibillion dollar deals  We have a disciplined approach to valuing and bidding on potential targets  All deal models include fully evaluated ROI and IRR  Revenue and expense synergies are fully analyzed  but deal models only include expense synergies in the evaluation of our returns  With respect to our proposed acquisition of HP  the value of this transaction goes beyond economics  The printing industry is decades overdue for consolidation  and the first mover will have a significant advantage  As laid out in the investor deck we released in December  we have identified significant costs and revenue synergies that are only achievable through a combination  A combined company would be both more profitable and better positioned to diversify into higher growth markets  Any restructuring that either company undertakes in the interim is simply incremental and does not diminish the scope or scale of this opportunity for both HP shareholders and Xerox shareholders  We received positive feedback from HP shareholders we spoke to  They immediately appreciate the industrial logic and believe in the value we can create  With their support in mind  we secured  24 billion in binding financing commitment from three top tier banks in order to remove any uncertainty over our ability to finance the transaction  And we recruited a slate of highly qualified independent director candidate for the election to the HP board  We are pressing ahead with our pursuit of this acquisition and are already working key elements of an integration plan so that we are well positioned to execute quickly when and if successful  Now I d like to hand it over to Bill to cover our financial results in detail  Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  John  We delivered a strong finish to the year  In the fourth quarter  we exceeded our expectations for EPS and revenue  and we delivered cash flow and adjusted operating margin in line with our expectations  Overall  we are pleased with the quarter and the resulting full year performance  On a full year year over year basis  adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points  Adjusted EPS was up 23   Free cash flow grew 19   and we saw improvement in the rate of revenue decline in the second half of the year as investments in our business began to gain more traction  and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020  Before going into details of our income statement  I want to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter  we completed a series of transactions to restructure our relationship with Fujifilm  which included the sale for more than 20 times related cash flows of our 25  equity interest in Fuji Xerox  as well as the sale of our 51  partnership interest in Xerox International Partners  XIP  which was fully consolidated  Consequently  the financial results presented here are from continuing operations and exclude the financial results attributable to our former equity stake in Fuji Xerox and our XIP business  which are now presented as discontinued operations  Also  I d like to point out that the reported numbers include the benefit of an upfront OEM license fee of  77 million we negotiated from Fuji Xerox  which was received in the fourth quarter in connection with restructuring that relationship  This benefit was included in our updated 2019 guidance measures filed with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8 K on December 3  2019  that reflected adjustments resulting from the transactions with Fujifilm  Looking at the income statement  Total revenues in the quarter declined 1 6  at constant currency and 2 2  at actual currency  including the impact of the OEM license fee  which is reported in post sale  Excluding this fee  total revenue declined 4 7  in constant currency  in line with the prior quarter  and as I mentioned  slightly better than our expectations  I will discuss revenue in more detail shortly  Turning to profitability  Adjusted operating margin of 16 8  in Q4 improved 270 basis points year over year  A significant portion of the improvement came from SAG  which improved 120 basis points year over year  driven by productivity improvements from Project Own It and the impact of a  10 million write off recorded in the prior year related to the termination of certain IT projects  Gross margin of 41 6  improved 160 basis points year over year  including the impact of the OEM license fee and an improvement in services post sale margin  which were partially offset by the lower equipment and supplies margins  as well as transaction currency  RD E was 3 8  of revenue  unchanged year over year  Below operating profit  other expenses  net of  8 million  was  136 million better than the prior year due to lower non service  retirement related costs and a prior year contract termination cost related to an IT services arrangement  as well as lower non financing interest expense resulting from lower debt and higher interest income from a higher cash balance  which includes  2 3 billion of proceeds from the sale of our interest in Fuji Xerox and XIP to Fujifilm in November  Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25   compared to 27 7  in the prior year and contributed approximately  0 03 to our fourth quarter EPS  Adjusted EPS of  1 33 was up  0 39 compared with Q4 2018  including a  0 25 benefit from the OEM fee and benefit from share repurchase  lower net interest expense and lower taxes  while the benefit from the IT write off in prior year was offset entirely by the costs associated with incremental tariffs  GAAP EPS of  1 17 was  0 80 higher year over year  including the aforementioned  0 39  plus an additional  0 41  primarily from lower non service pension related expense  the prior year costs related to the termination of an IT services arrangement  lower restructuring and related costs  and the income tax on those adjustments  In Q4  we recorded  53 million of restructuring and related costs  bringing the full year restructuring costs of  229 million  roughly in line with our expectation of approximately  225 million  For 2020  we expect restructuring charges of approximately  175 million full year  Moving now to Slide 7  I ll discuss cash flow  In Q4  we generated  398 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations  which contributed to full year operating cash flow of  1 24 billion  a growth of  162 million year over year and within our full year guidance range of  1 2 billion to  1 3 billion  Full year free cash flow was  1 18 billion  up  187 million compared with 2018 and was at the high end of our guidance range  driven by strong operating cash flow and slightly lower than expected capex of  65 million for the year  We expect the level of capex to increase to approximately  100 million for full year 2020  which includes planned investment in IT systems  The increase in full year operating cash flow reflects higher profit  including the OEM fee  better net working capital of approximately  25 million  driven by improvements in inventory management  and approximately  30 million of cash from finance assets  Cash from finance assets was primarily due to lower sales of equipment on operating lease  which more than offset a reduction in cash from finance receivables  which was less of a source year over year  Restructuring payments for the year were  158 million  less than expected as certain restructuring related payments in EMEA are expected to be made in 2020  For 2020  we expect payments for restructuring of approximately  175 million  Investing cash flow included an acquisition spend of approximately  42 million  including a 3D acquisition at the beginning of 2019 and two tuck in XBS acquisitions  For 2020  we expect approximately  100 million of tuck in acquisitions  Lastly  within financing cash flows  we returned  292 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter  consisting of  60 million in dividends and  232 million in share repurchases  For the full year  we completed  600 million in share repurchases and spent  243 million in annual dividends  for a total return of capital to shareholders of  843 million or approximately 72  of 2019 annual free cash flow  We also reduced debt by approximately  950 million full year   550 million of which matured in the fourth quarter  And we ended the year with  4 3 billion of debt and approximately  2 8 billion of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash on our balance sheet  Let s turn now to Slide 8 for more detail on revenue  Fourth quarter revenue declined 2 2  or 1 6  at constant currency  Excluding the impact of the OEM fee  Q4 revenue declined 4 7  at constant currency  which was in line with the third quarter and contributed to a second half rate of decline that is approximately 170 basis points better than the first half of 2019  Geographically  the improvement is in the Americas  which was down 3 3  in constant currency  driven by growth in equipment sales  particularly in our U S  large enterprise accounts  as well as a continued stabilization in our XBS channel compared to the first half  In EMEA  the rate of revenue decline deteriorated slightly compared to the third quarter with fewer large deal deployments in the quarter  We also continued to experience delayed decisions and see fewer large bids in the region  reflecting continued weak and uncertain macroeconomic conditions  Last  certain regions within EMEA were impacted by the rollout of Project Own It initiatives that occurred in the second half  We expect the modest disruption in operations resulting from this to begin to stabilize early in 2020 and have targeted actions to improve performance in the region  including deal management process changes and targeted product programs  Equipment revenue was down 1 5  at constant currency  which is a significant improvement compared to the first half and sequentially better  And as I mentioned  equipment sales grew from the prior year in the Americas  From a product perspective  we had a great quarter in the high end in both color and mono  In high end color  we continued to see strong demand for our Iridesse color production system  and the demand for our newly launched Baltoro inkjet press exceeded our expectation on a global basis  and we expect this momentum to continue into 2020  In mid range  the rate of decline improved significantly from the first half but was down slightly compared to Q3 as the better than expected performance in the U S  was partially offset by lower sales in the EMEA region  In the U S   the improvement came from installs and revenue from the recently launched PrimeLink  a new product in our light production portfolio  as well as from a large account refresh in the U S  and the ongoing improvement in our XBS business  And in entry  higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in developing market regions and EMEA  Looking at activity  there is a difference in equipment revenue performance and installs this quarter  particularly in high end color  where we saw a 12  decline in installs compared to growth in equipment revenue  This is primarily a result of product mix as growth in installations of high end production color systems  such as Iridesse and Baltoro  were more than offset by declines in lower end production systems  This mix shift drives a net positive impact on equipment revenues as the  higher end of the range  systems carry significantly higher price points  We saw a similar product mix impact in mid range installs with lower installs of MFP devices  partially offset by higher installs of entry production devices that are at the higher end of the mid range product category  This in part was driven by the recent launch of PrimeLink  which I referenced earlier  Turning to post sale  Revenue declined 1 7  in constant currency or 5 8   excluding the impact of the OEM fee  This rate of decline was an improvement over the first half  but slightly less than Q3  which included a large transactional IT services sale  Contractual post sale was stable in the quarter  while unbundled supplies rate of decline improved as we continued to see the benefit from the investments made to improve the attach rate of Xerox supplies in unbundled equipment sales  Services revenue declined 4 5  at constant currency as growth in U S  large enterprise accounts and improving performance within XBS and Eurasia was more than offset by declines in Latin America and in Europe  where the rate of decline was impacted by a strong fourth quarter in 2018  Services revenue comprised approximately 36  of total revenue in the quarter  and 30  of services revenue was from SMB  We have focused actions to drive new business growth  which include increasing sales resources and delivery teams in IT services  which we expect to benefit 2020  To summarize revenue  we are pleased with Q4 performance and with the second half performance trend  which contributed to a full year revenue decline of 4 7  constant currency  slightly better than our guidance of down 5   We expect the investments in our top line will gain more traction in 2020  and we will continue to invest in actions to drive improvement in revenue  Turning to Slide 9  Adjusted operating margin was 16 8  in Q4 and 13 1  for the full year  in line with our full year guidance of approximately 13   Our Project Own It transformational program was expected to drive at least  640 million in gross savings in 2019  and it did  offsetting the impact of revenue declines and contributing to 180 basis point expansion in full year adjusted operating margin  We achieved savings across the seven targeted functional cost areas  and we are continuing to focus on these areas to optimize operations for simplicity  Importantly  the continued efficiencies from Project Own It create capacity to be more competitive  such as enabling SMB focused marketing investments to drive revenue  In 2020  we expect Project Own It will deliver an additional  450 million in cost savings  making further progress toward our goals of delivering sustainable productivity improvements and driving earnings growth  Adjusted EPS grew  0 39 year over year to  1 33 in the quarter  And we delivered  3 55 of adjusted EPS for the full year  which  as I mentioned earlier  was a 23  increase year over year  Adjusted EPS growth in the quarter and for the year is driven by our cost reductions  which more than offset the impact of revenue declines  as well as benefits from the OEM license fee   0 25  and from share repurchases and other nonoperational items  which offset headwinds from currency and tariffs  Moving on to Slide 10 and the review of our capital structure  We ended the year with  4 3 billion of debt  which is approximately  950 million lower year over year  reflecting the repayment of two bond maturities in 2019  The majority of our debt supports customer financing activities and  therefore  we break down our debt between financing debt and core debt  Financing debt is allocated by applying a seven to one leverage to our finance receivables and equipment on operating leases  which together comprise our total finance assets  Core debt was approximately  1 billion  which is well within sight our targeted core debt level of less than two times annual free cash flow  We ended the quarter with approximately  2 8 billion of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  which puts us in a net cash position of  1 8 billion when netting cash against core debt  In 2020  we have approximately  1 billion in bonds maturing and believe we have access to capital resources sufficient to handle upcoming debt maturities  Our liquidity position is strong with approximately  2 8 billion of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and a  1 8 billion bank revolver which is undrawn  As of December 31  2019  our net unfunded pension liability was  1 2 billion  which is comparable to the net balance at the end of 2018  as the increase in pension obligation as a result of lower discount rates was offset by asset returns and contributions  The net balance includes approximately  815 million of unfunded pension liabilities for plans that by design are not funded  In 2019  we contributed  140 million to worldwide pension plans and expect a stable level of contributions going forward  Last  on Slide 11  I will review our 2020 guidance  As both John and I stated earlier  we made significant progress in 2019 against our three year plan presented last February  We are seeing the impact of our investments in revenue and the savings from our Project Own It transformational program  which contributed to significant earnings  strong cash flow generation and an improvement in the rate of revenue decline in the second half  We returned 72  of our annual free cash flow to shareholders in 2019 and repaid approximately  950 million in debt  In addition  by selling our equity interest in Fuji Xerox for over 20 times annual cash flow  we monetized an illiquid asset and increased flexibility to manage our business and the future of Xerox  Now let s look at our guidance for 2020  First  our full year revenue guidance is a decline of approximately 4  in constant currency  and we expect minimal impact from translation currency in 2020  Our revenue guidance excludes the impact of the  77 million OEM license fee from Fuji Xerox in 2019 so as to provide a better measure of the year over year progress against our strategy  The improvement in the rate of revenue decline in 2020 is attributable to investments in our top line  supporting our SMB growth strategy and expansion of integrated product solutions  We will continue to expand sales coverage and programs and have new product launches and refreshes planned through the year  I should also note that we expect revenue declines to be more balanced throughout 2020  That is the rate of improvement will be more gradual through the year as compared to 2019  For adjusted operating margin  guiding to approximately 13   a 60 basis point improvement compared to full year 2019 when excluding the impact of the OEM license fee as Project Own It savings are expected to continue to deliver margin expansion  For adjusted EPS  we are guiding to a range of  3 60 to  3 70 and  2 80 to  2 90 for GAAP EPS  This results in adjusted EPS growth of approximately  0 35  compared to 2019 when excluding the  0 25 benefit from the OEM license fee from 2019  The difference between GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs  non service retirement related costs  transaction related costs and amortization of intangibles  We continue to expect strong cash generation and are guiding to free cash flow of approximately  1 2 billion  which assumes approximately  100 million of capex and is approximately  75 million higher than 2019 when excluding the impact of the OEM license fee  We will also continue to target returns to shareholders of at least 50  of our annual free cash flow  which will include dividends and at least  300 million in share repurchases  Last  we will evaluate the use of unallocated cash as we progress through 2020  We will now open the line for questions  Ann Ann Pettrone    Director  Corporate Finance Before we get to the Q A with John and Bill  I will point out that we have in the appendix to our materials additional supplemental reconciliations and posted on our Xerox investor relations website  a full set of earnings materials  Operator  please open the line for questions now  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Our first question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse  Your line is now open Matt Cabral    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thank you  John  on the HP acquisition  you touched on this in your prepared remarks  but I m wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into what you see as the biggest benefits of industry consolidation  And just what gives you confidence in at least  2 billion of incremental costs takeout created through the combination John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Matt  We ve    when we looked at the combination of the  2 billion  one thing that s clear is you only get that    you only get that  2 billion if the two companies combined together  And what we did is a detailed analysis per pillar of what we believe would be savings of combining the two companies together  And in our document that we presented to the shareholders  we went into a level of detail that talked about it  So our confidence in the  2 billion is quite high  that we can hit that  And if you look at our team and our track record of what we ve done with Project Own It here  we delivered  1 billion over the last 18 months  and we re on track to deliver the  450 million plus in 2020  So we have the track record  This document and this    that we put together was built by our team  our management team  So you look at who s on our management team  and these are a lot of folks that have done restructuring in the past  I can tell you that the shareholders  they see the logic in the proposed transaction  They ve told us that the combination of the two companies bring tremendous value  Inside of our business case  we only focused and we only used the cost savings  but there are synergies that are detailed as well that we believe we can get by combining the two companies together Matt Cabral    Credit Suisse    Analyst Got it  And then now that you ve exited the JV with Fuji  I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what that supplier relationship looks like going forward  And how are you thinking about opportunity in Asia after the technology agreement ends with them in March of 2021 Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer Hey  Matt  it s Bill  So we looked at the renegotiation of the    our relationship with Fujifilm  and it s clearly a positive from a supplier perspective  Many benefits  a more normal type of relationship now  a supplier customer as opposed to before  where you also had to factor in the 25  interest  As far as    and the    when we renegotiated the relationship  there were actually benefits in the product or supply arrangements we have with them going forward  There were certain terms that existed in the prior agreements that we negotiated on more favorable terms going forward  And as we have discussed before  these product supply arrangements go out from a period of five to seven years  and really the earliest any of them come up for renewal on a staggered basis is 2023  As far as looking forward and the impact is we can go into the Asia Pacific market under without    for products other than xerographic products  For xerographic related products  we could potentially go in as early as April of 2021 under the Xerox name  However  if they choose to extend for two years the use of the Xerox name  we could still go into the Asia Pacific markets with xerographic products  but not under the Xerox name  So more likely  we would be going in a more significant way two years later in April of 2023 Matt Cabral    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital  Your line is now open Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital Markets    Analyst Hi  Good morning  John  Bill  Congratulations on the solid results and the second straight quarter of top line momentum  Two for me  if I could  Just starting back out    back with HP  John  what would be Xerox s next preferred actions  Given the letter with regards to board level elections that you guys published  would it be to engage in conversations  Or would it be to kind of go into the summer with the board level elections  And then I have a business model follow up John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Ananda  I can say we ve    the meetings we ve had with the HP shareholders have been quite positive  And they understand our transaction  They believe in the combination  Their concern  as is ours  is to    the refusal to engage in a normal course of action at this point in the process  So we re hoping to engage with the HP executives  and we ve offered that  engage with them and have a discussion on how we bring this to closure because we both see the logic of this combination  and we re not where we are yet Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital Markets    Analyst That s helpful  I appreciate that context  And then with regards to the 2020 guidance    and John  you alluded    or you didn t allude to  you made mention of the still existing goal of getting to flat constant currency revenue growth in 2021  The 4  guide for 2020  while quite favorable as I think you re probably trending a little bit ahead of schedule right now  how do you go from    how do you see footing from the 4  in 2020 to the flat in 2021 and as part of that conservatism  Actually  and let me just stop there  and then I have a quick one on the margins and free cash flow for 2020 as well John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Look  we re confident in the revenue guidance  And you think of our continued demand for high end production systems  our strength in the SMB channel  our new product launches that we re going to be doing  our new investments in 2020  So we re executing on the strategy  And while transformation is not linear  we ve seen that there s been bumps along the way  like we had in the first quarter of last year  but we re building an organization to respond quickly to this  Ananda  And for 2021  our road to flat revenue is just    we believe that we can get there  and we re going to do it by improving the organic revenue  and like I said  the traction on the above topics Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  And just to add on  Ananda  In 2020  we re expecting really minimal impact from inorganic  As you know  last year  we did approximately  40 million of tuck in acquisitions  We ve guided toward  100 million this year  but we re expecting minimal impact  But in 2021  factored into getting to flat when you have  100 million target in 2020 and 2021  that that would also have a favorable impact on getting to flat by 2021 Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital Markets    Analyst Yes  Got it  Understood  And then  Bill  just quickly on the 2020 op margin guidance and free cash flow guidance  I think you put the part of this to the 13  margin  which is flat  and the free cash flow  which is kind of relatively flat  It sounds like the    at least part of that  the reason for the flatness is that you re backing it    you re sort of saying  if you take out the license impact from Fuji Xerox  that actually    the margin would actually be up in 2020  And I guess you are pointing out there s a slight increase in free cash over 2020  But can you just sort of backfill for us  particularly given the  450 million of gross cost saves  why perhaps the OP margin expansion will be greater and the free cash flow expansion would be greater  And that s it for me  I appreciate it Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Great  So from an operating margin perspective  just taking a step back  when we laid out our three year plan last February  we said in year one  we d do 100  to 150 basis point improvement  This year  after you take out the OEM fee  we actually did 110 basis point improvement  going from about 11 3  to 12 4   So on plan with our three year plan  And we are also    it involves    in taking into account the 110  we were also able to make significant investments in our back office and in revenue  our top line  and still achieve that 110 basis point expansion in line with our 100  to 150 basis point guidance  As far as next year  you hit on the main point  that taking out that OEM fee  it s really about a 60 basis point improvement  And according to our three year plan  we said 100 to 150 in year one and then approximately 50 basis points plus in year two and year three  60 basis points being in line with that  And a lot of that continuing to come from Project Own It initiatives  which we re targeting  450 million in 2020  So we think    we believe that we re clearly on plan with respect to our adjusted operating margin expansion Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital Markets    Analyst Thanks a lot OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research  Your line is now open Shannon Cross    Cross Research    Analyst Thank you very much  John  I was curious  the    obviously  back and forth with HP  HP has indicated that the offer significantly undervalues what they believe the valuation of their assets are  So now that you have your slate of directors out there  is there a willingness to revisit your offer  Just how are you thinking about that  And I m also curious as to    and this is    I m not actually sure what the answer is  I m curious to how the two boards would work together post deal  So do we assume that the directors you put out for HP are kind of short term to get the deal done  Or would you assume you d have a significantly expanded board following a combination of HP and Xerox  Thanks  And I have a follow up John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I would say our slate is a group of highly qualified accomplished individuals  and they understand what the challenges are of a global enterprise  and that s what we brought forward  As we ve said  and that was after we got the  24 billion secured  on price  we re not going to speculate on potential actions  We said many times that we would be willing to meet with HP to begin negotiating a transaction  And we re asking HP to engage in a constructive dialogue so that we could explore ways of maximizing value for both our shareholders Shannon Cross    Cross Research    Analyst OK  So if they don t  then it just    it moves to the board vote  I guess  you don t anticipate  Anyways  you re not going to negotiate on the phone with me  so that s fine  I guess the question I have too with    from Bill is  in terms of cash flow  finance receivables was about  175 million of cash  I think  in 2019  which I believe was down year over year but still  obviously  was a source of cash  but it was a use in fourth quarter  I know these things can sort of be    are not linear by any means  But that  combined with the  58 million in cash that you got from the sale of the IP provides somewhat of a headwind when you look to next year  So I m curious how much more benefit do you think you can get from working capital  Is there any sort of one timers we should think about for next year in cash flow  Or is the vast majority of it just going to come from the improvement in operating profit  Thank you Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  As far as the working capital improvements for next year  the main thing that we re focusing on is improved working capital  In particular  we had over  100 million of improvement this year in inventory  We expect to have some continued improvement next year in inventory  but as well  we think there are significant opportunities in receivables and payables  As far as finance receivables  the  175 million source  obviously  that s a source that is not a good source  in fact  we prefer to be less of a source  And as part of our modeling for next year  with the improved revenues in ESR  in originations  we are in our model factoring in less of a finance receivable source  which is a good headwind to have  means that we re getting more ESR and more MIF out there  And you re right  it s about  58 million of the one timer for the OEM  So the two of those being headwinds  we expect to still overcome those mainly through improvements not only in our cost structure  but also in working capital components of AR  AP  And although we had over  100 million this year improvement in inventory  we still think there s some improvements that we can get in inventory for next year Shannon Cross    Cross Research    Analyst Great  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thank you  Good morning  Bill  a question for you on revenue  the 4  constant currency decline in 2020  how do you compare that to the 3  decline you had talked about at the Analyst Day a year ago  Are those comparable  And if so  how would you explain the difference Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So there have been adjustments  obviously  with the Fujifilm transaction in disc ops and everything  But at a high level  just taking a step back  we think that we re probably about 100 basis points off of where we would have liked to have been  We guided 3   And a lot of it is due to various reasons  And with a bumpy start at the beginning of the year  with the disruptions we talked about on the XBS side  that improved primarily in the second half  and there s clearly room for improvement  continued improvement in XBS going forward in 2020  But we believe we have levers in place and rates improvement to still get to flat by 2021  But you re correct  Just taking a step back  it s probably about 100 basis points less than where we would like to be at this point Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    Analyst You mentioned in the slide deck and also on this call that investments are beginning to impact revenue  You saw that in the back half of 2019  Any context for how much incremental revenue you were able to generate in 2019  Or what the incremental revenue impact is in 2020 Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer So at a high level  those investments played out in various areas  somewhat in ESR  We had significant improvements in the second half of the year with respect to ESR  on the 1  to 2  decline range versus the first half  Q1 was down around 5   Q2 around 8   so it s    so investments there  But in the post sale area in particular    and we ve talked about this quite a bit  In supplies  in particular  unbundled supplies  most of our supplies are part of bundled arrangements  So over 75  of our arrangements relate to bundled supplies  but there are what we call unbundled or unattached supplies  And earlier this past year  we expanded our organization  really created an organization to sell with respect to those unbundled supply agreements  And we saw a significant improvement from where we were like  in the first two quarters  9  to 12  year over year decline to significant low single digit decline in supplies  So we saw significant improvement in the second half of the year based upon our investment in the supplies area  And we started to see some improvement in the IT services area where we ve made investments in expanding that from where we had three of our XBS cores to where    10 by the end of the year  And early this year  we ll be pretty much all of XBS selling IT services Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thank you  And then just one last question  Separate from the discussion around valuation and what you d ultimately be willing to pay  any feedback from the banks who provided the debt commitment around whether there is the potential to take on even more debt  Or what leverage ratio they d be willing for you to exit a deal with HP with Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer We believe that we have flexibility  We lined up the  24 billion in financing commitments  and we believe our arrangements with those financial institutions allow us flexibility if need be John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  And you could imagine  Katy  the amount of analysis that the banks went through before they agreed to give us the  24 billion in financing  the due diligence that they had to go through with us to give them confidence Katy Huberty    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thank you  Congrats on the quarter John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Katy OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Paul Coster of JP Morgan  Your line is now open Paul Coster    J P  Morgan    Analyst Yes  So a couple of quick ones  Just building on Ananda s questions from earlier on  You ve explained why operating margins are    the improvement is attenuating a little bit in 2020  Can you just talk a little bit about the Own It payback on gross savings  Is it still sort of  0 65 on every dollar  Or is that also attenuating as we move into 2020 Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer So I think you re referring to  Paul  the cost of our savings  And we ve said that our cost to get those gross savings is less than  0 40 on the dollar  It was about  0 35 last year  but it s a little less than  0 40  And looking to next year  that  450 million of gross savings  that we expect a similar type of cost in the  0 35 to  0 40 range in order to achieve those savings Paul Coster    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  So no change in the payback on those savings  gross savings Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer No Paul Coster    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  Got it  And then the other question I ve got is  as you look to 2021  assuming the business as is  you re looking for a 300 basis point plus year on year improvement in revenues  And I maybe missed a little bit of the nuances earlier on  but can you just talk to us about why there ll be the sudden inflection  Is it that these new initiatives will suddenly mature at the same time  Or is there some other reason why you have that confidence Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer So if you look at what we re guiding toward in 2020 versus a normalized 2019  we re guiding toward about 150 basis point improvement year over year to get that approximately 4   and that s minimal  Inorganic involved in that  As I said  there was a little last year to have a rollover  And they re just    we re not factoring in that much for this year  We do expect those investments to accelerate to that 150 basis point improvement year over year from  19 to  20  We could see being in the 200  to 300 basis point improvement in 2021 versus 2020  But we will also    a part of it  as I said earlier  factors in that we ve allocated approximately  100 million per year of tuck ins  It can be more or less in any given year  As I said  last year  it was only  42 million  but that we would expect if those come to pushing  And by the way  those tuck ins  we re not just looking at the U S  We are looking in certain countries in Europe and expanding the XBS model to those countries  but we could see that having one point to two points of benefit also potentially in 2021 Paul Coster    J P  Morgan    Analyst Got it  One quick question  It just popped out at me that the high end 8  year on year improvement in black and white printers was    that was an amazing change there  Is it just simply the lumpiness of that business in the enterprise accounts  Or do you think that s sustainable Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer High end has  overall  had some significant improvement in the second half of the    for the full year  we actually grew our high end ESR in the    for the full year and in Q3 and Q4  But if you take a step back  and we ve talked about a lot of these things  that the new    the relatively new Iridesse product s been out for about a year or so now  continued strong demand for that  Baltoro  our high end inkjet machine  cut sheet inkjet  significant demand for that  And our iGen  we refreshed certain features on the iGen  iGen 5  that that has also contributed  So the high end is clearly a success area for us  Full year year over year growth from ESR and in the third and fourth quarters  2  to 3  growth from an ESR perspective  and we expect that will continue Paul Coster    J P  Morgan    Analyst Referring to the black and white segment in particular in the high end  is that just simply enterprise accounts  lumpiness  Or is there    do you view that as sustainable Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer You could still have on the high end enterprise  you could still have some of the iGen machines  Yes Paul Coster    J P  Morgan    Analyst Sorry  I m referring to black and white  but if    we can take this offline Bill Osbourn    Chief Financial Officer OK OperatorThank you  And ladies and gentlemen  this does conclude our question and answer session  I would now like to turn the call back over to John for any closing remarks John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  thank you for your time today  As we start 2020  Xerox is positioned to make further progress against our three year plan  We ve built a strong team and even stronger foundation  We will continue our efforts to achieve a success someone thought was impossible at Xerox  So we re moving forward  Thanks  everybody Operator Operator signoff  Duration  62 minutesCall participants John Visentin    Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBill Osbourn

153346,374862,XRX,Could Rising PC Sales Force Xerox to Raise Its Bid for HP ,news,"Global shipments of PCs grew 2 7  in 2019  according to IDC  marking the industry s first full year of growth since 2011  Microsoft s decision to end support for Windows 7 this January sparked enterprise upgrades to Windows 10 PCs  CPU shortage concerns eased as AMD picked up Intel s slack  and new convertible and gaming PCs gained momentum 
That growth sounds promising for top American PC maker HP  NYSE HPQ   However  investors should recall that HP has been trying to fend off a hostile bid by Xerox  NYSE XRX  since last November  Could rising PC sales force Xerox to raise its bid 
Previously on Xerox vs  HP   
Xerox approached HP with an unsolicited takeover bid at  22 per share in late November  The proposed  33 billion offer would give HP investors  17 in cash and 0 137 shares of Xerox per HP share 

The bid was surprising  since Xerox was smaller and would need to shoulder a lot of debt to close the deal  HP s board unanimously rejected Xerox s offer on Nov  17  stating that it  significantly undervalues HP and is not in the best interests of HP shareholders  
Analysts also questioned Xerox s ability to secure enough capital to close the deal  But on Jan  6  Xerox announced that it had secured  24 billion in funding from Citi  Mizuho  and Bank of America 
On Jan  23  Xerox announced that it would nominate eleven independent candidates to replace HP s board of directors at its annual meeting  HP dismissed the move as a  self serving tactic  that  creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders  
HP also claimed that Xerox s decisions were  being driven  by activist investor Carl Icahn  who owns a 10 6  stake in Xerox and a 4 2  stake in HP  according to The Wall Street Journal  HP claims that Icahn would  disproportionately benefit from an acquisition of HP by Xerox at a price that undervalues HP  
Reviewing HP s core business
HP s personal systems  notebooks  desktops  and workstations  generated 68  of its revenue last quarter  The rest came from the printer business  which sells hardware and supplies  Both units struggled over the past year  but the printing unit grew at much slower pace than its PC business 

YOY   Year over year  Source  HP quarterly reports 
HP s notebook and desktop shipments both grew during the fourth quarter  and lower component prices and tighter cost controls boosted the unit s operating margin year over year  Its consumer revenue dipped 4   but that decline was offset by its 8  growth in commercial revenue    which supports IDC s comments about enterprise upgrades 
HP s printing business  however  remains in dire shape  with tumbling shipments of commercial and consumer units  sliding supplies revenue  and declining operating margins  Long upgrade cycles are curbing sales of new printers  while competition from generic suppliers is crushing demand for its higher margin ink and toner 

The bears claim that that ongoing decline  which HP is trying to reverse with its Instant Ink subscription service  will flatten the company s growth and overwhelm its PC division  Proponents of Xerox s takeover of HP  including Icahn  believe that merging the two companies  printing businesses would offset their ongoing declines with economies of scale and cut costs  The merger could also accelerate the development of new 3D printing technologies 
Could rising PC sales make HP more attractive 
Stabilizing PC sales don t really give HP a better hand  for two simple reasons 
First  HP expects its personal systems revenue to decline  above the normal seasonal patterns  in the first quarter on a sequential basis  It also warned that its CPU supply would remain  constrained  in the first half of 2020  and that commodities would be  significantly less of a tailwind  in 2020 than 2019  Those warnings indicate that the momentum from Windows 10 upgrades will likely fade over the next few quarters 
Second  Xerox isn t really focusing on HP s PC business  It wants to merge its printing business with HP s  and believes that HP    which hasn t offered any solid turnaround plans for the printing business beyond Instant Ink and price hikes    also needs to strike a deal 
Therefore  Xerox will likely keep pursuing HP  but IDC s latest report on PC sales probably won t force it to raise its offer  But if the stalemate continues  Xerox might consider alternatives    like pivoting toward an all cash offer    to ramp up the pressure ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqxp8,2075535

Xerox Corporation  NYSE XRX  is a stock many investors are watching right now  XRX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 10 93  which compares to its industry s average of 14 41  Over the past year  XRX s Forward P E has been as high as 11 49 and as low as 6 05  with a median of 8 29 
We should also highlight that XRX has a P B ratio of 1 63  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 2 58  XRX s P B has been as high as 1 81 and as low as 1 05  with a median of 1 48  over the past year 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  XRX has a P S ratio of 0 86  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 31 
Finally  investors should note that XRX has a P CF ratio of 7 51  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 10 94  XRX s P CF has been as high as 9 13 and as low as 5 78  with a median of 7 90  all within the past year

153442,374958,XRX,Why Xerox Shares Gained 86 6  in 2019,news,"What happened
What a strange year Xerox  NYSE XRX  had in 2019  The office equipment maker s stock rose 86 6  last year  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  but it was anything but a smooth climb 
So what
Xerox shares rose 43  in January  lifted by a generally positive market trend and a strong fourth quarter report  Xerox also saw analyst firm Citi s arguing that the company might be an attractive buyout target  having proven that its turnaround efforts were bearing fruit 
That prediction felt ironic in November  as Xerox launched a buyout bid of its own for much larger rival HP Inc   NYSE HPQ   In a mostly debt powered offer of approximately  22 per HP share  Xerox hoped to create a titanic seller of workstations  printers  and copiers  HP s board of directors rejected the offer  saying that it undervalued HP significantly  But Xerox has not abandoned the original deal  turning it into a hostile takeover process instead  Last week  the company secured  24 billion of financing from a consortium of global banks  reassuring HP s investors that Xerox will be able to make the proposed payments 

Now what
Investors are largely ignoring the HP buyout drama at the moment  HP s shares have gained a measly 10  since the initial bid powered pop while Xerox shares have taken a 6  haircut  These small moves amount to atmospheric noise over a two month period 
Whether Xerox manages to close the deal or not  fellow Fool James Brumley argues that HP s shareholders should take the buyout boosted money and run  The same might be true for Xerox since the stock nearly doubled in 52 weeks even though its top line sales are dwindling  This proposed merger of troubled tech giants is unlikely to trigger any game changing synergies  Not to gild the lily or anything  but Xerox is putting some mighty fine lipstick on the pig here ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phgju,2058217

153444,374960,XRX,Xerox  XRX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Xerox  XRX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This business services provider and copier company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 93 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 32 billion  down 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xerox 
For Xerox  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xerox will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xerox would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 91  delivering a surprise of  7 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

The Stock Exchange is all about trading  Each week  we do the following 
Discuss an important issue for traders 
Highlight several technical trading methods  including current ideas 
Feature advice from top traders and writers  and
Provide a few  minority  reactions from fundamental analysts 
We also have some fun  We welcome comments  links and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders  If you have some ideas  please join in 
Review  Are You Guilty of Risk Creep 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked  Are You Guilty of Risk Creep  We noted the market had been performing very well this year  and that s when many investors forget that things can turn ugly quickly  No one can predict exactly when with 100  accuracy  but if you cannot handle a sell off then now is a good time to stay disciplined and manage the amount of risk you re taking in your portfolio so as to be consistent with your goals 
This Week  Models Gone Wild 
This week we consider what can happen when models go wild 
Of course we are talking about trading models  For example  in his book The Little Book that Beats the Market  Joel Greenblatt describes a magic formula trading model that 
 determines portfolio selections based on a combination of their relative cheapness and quality  as measured by earnings yield and return on capital  Formula Investing allows money to be managed in a disciplined manner that removes factors  like excess emotion and future projections  that often lead to bad investment results  
Of course there are many different metrics upon which you can build a model  For example  some of the popular Russell indexes benchmarks are just very basic models based on market capitalization and valuation metrics such as book value to price ratios 
And models can get much more complex  including machine learning  for example  as described here  Tools for Machine Learning Development by Jenn Webb at The Practical Quant 
There are also numerous examples of how NOT to build a model  For example  we wrote about the topic back in 2010 in The Hindenburg Omen  and included examples such as 
Starting with the conclusion 
Optimizing blindly 
Using as many variables as needed 
On one hand  one of the big advantages of trading models is objectivity  they lack the emotional distractions that cause many humans to make mistakes  On the other hand  models lack supposed common sense  And this of course leads to the debate over whether traders should let the models do their thing without human interaction ever  or if humans should oversee the models so they don t go wild  In fact  some people use trading models as nothing more than an idea generator  and then use their human experience to place manual trades based on suggestions from the models 
As we ll discuss later in this report  we use our models as an objective idea generator  but Jeff oversees them and interjects common sense so they don t run wild  The models hit challenging periods and less challenging periods as do all trading and investing strategies  for example growth has been beating the pants off value for the last 10 years an unusual occurrence that many investors expect to eventually end badly for growth stocks   And while we use the models to objectively identify trading opportunities that we do implement implement selectively in concert with our other long term fundamental investment strategies  for example  Great Stocks  and  Enhanced Yield   we don t just let our models run wild 
Model Performance
We are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models as our readers have requested 

Worth noting  our models increase and decrease their cash levels based on market conditions  so the performance in the table can appear more dramatic than reality  especially when considering the strategies are often combined with some of our longer term strategies as well 
Expert Picks From The Models
Note  This week s Stock Exchange report is being moderated by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  This week I purchased shares of VEREIT  VER  on 7 17  How do you feel about that 

Blue Harbinger  Well I like a lot of REITs for their big yields  but VEREIT went ex dividend at the end of June  and you ll be out of the position before the next quarterly dividend arrives  Besides  why should I pay attention to your trades anyway  Holmes  Your track record isn t exactly stellar over the last 12 months 
Holmes  I am a dip buyer  you can see the dip in the chart above   and I typically only hold for around 6 weeks  And I am a computer model  not a human  so my feeling aren t hurt that you asked about my track record  My strategy has been back tested through many tens of thousands of historical trading periods  and I am not discouraged by a rough patch 
BH  Well I admire your data driven back testing and your  sticktoitiveness   Here is a look at some fundamental data in the following F A S T  Graph if you change your  mind  and want to start paying attention to more fundamentals like Jeff when he actually manages investment accounts 

Athena  This week I bought Xerox  NYSE XRX   XRX  on 7 12  How do you feel about that trade 

BH  Xerox  Why d you buy 
Athena  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Xerox  A quick look at the chart should make the strength of the trend fairly obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or a stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
BH  Well Xerox is an old school blue chip in some investors  minds  and the dividend yield at 2 9  isn t horrible  Here is a look at the F A S T  Graph 

Roadrunner  I bought shares of Shopify  SHOP  on 7 12  As you know  I like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel 

BH  Shopify has been on fire lately  You know there was an article by Tae Kim in the print edition of Barron s a couple week s ago describing it as an  Antidote to Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN    Here is a picture of the article 

Athena  Thanks for the information  I am not in it for the very long term but that info still supports my thesis  Shopify s returns have been truly amazing so far this year

There are many different varieties and flavors of trading models  and just like humans they have their strengths and weaknesses  Whether you are pro or anti trading models  and whether you believe trading models should be used in coordination with human intervention and oversight is up to you  We like to use our trading models only with human oversight and in coordination with our other longer term fundamental investment programs  because left to their own devices  models can end up running wild  What are a few of your favorite trading model metrics  and how much human interaction do you allow into your trading programs ",2019-07-23,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-exchange-models-gone-wild-200442895,200442895
153468,374984,XRX,Argo to add new director  give hedge fund Voce say in adding others,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Insurance company Argo Group International Holdings said on Thursday that it will add one board member nominated last year by Voce Capital Management and give the hedge fund a say in seating two new independent directors in the coming months 
Carol McFate  who has held executive positions with a number of insurers and was a former chief investment officer at Xerox  NYSE XRX   will join the Argo board immediately and serve on its nominating corporate governance committee and an additional committee 
Voce will also participate in identifying and evaluating two new director candidates who will stand for election at the 2020 meeting and one of them will be selected from Voce s nominated slate  the company said in a statement 
The announcement comes three weeks after Argo said five directors  including the chairman  will leave its board at this year s annual meeting  marking a critical turn in a bitter corporate battle that has been dragging on for months 
A company spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement 
Over the last three months  Argo announced that its board chairman  Gary Woods  would leave  that CEO Mark Watson was retiring and would leave the board by the end of 2019 and that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company  Argo also said it was conducting a review of  governance and compensation matters  
Besides Woods  Sedgwick Browne  who heads the Risk   Capital Committee  Hector De Leon  a member of the Audit and Human Resources Committee  Mural Josephson  chair of the Audit Committee and John Power  chair of the Human Resources Committee will also depart at the annual meeting 
Earlier in 2019  Voce said it would run a proxy contest and planned to seat five directors  including McFate  It said the company should cut  100 million in expenses  including corporate jets and housing for Watson  and said the board was responsible for a  culture or indulgence   In November Voce said it had started the process of calling a special meeting to replace five directors  including Woods  the chair 
On Thursday  Voce sounded a positive note and praised the company for the steps it has taken  Tapping new board members  and the Company s ongoing governance improvements  are substantive and positive developments that give us confidence in the new course that Argo has charted   Voce s portfolio manager J  Daniel Plants said in a statement

It s a sign the company is pushing forward with an unsolicited  33B deal that its larger rival had rejected as too low and not in the best interests of its shareholders

153470,374986,XRX,Stock Market News  Newmont Looks Golden  Xerox Secures Funding for HP Acquisition,news,"Major benchmarks got off to a slow start on Monday morning  as investors remained worried about the rising tensions between the U S  and Iran  Having ignored geopolitical risk for a long time  market participants have now shifted their focus to assessing military threats even as they continue to keep trade and broader economic concerns in the back of their minds  Yet investors remained resilient  and as of 11 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  had recovered from triple digit losses to be down 75 points to 28 559  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  lost a point to 3 234  and the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  managed to gain 12 points to 9 033 
The rise in military tensions helped the gold market  and that spurred greater interest in Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   which gave shareholders a nice reward  Meanwhile  Xerox Holdings  NYSE XRX  said that it has managed to come up with financing sources for its ambitious takeover bid for HP  NYSE HPQ   turning attention back to a merger that many had dismissed as unlikely 
Newmont shines up its dividend
Shares of Newmont Goldcorp were up almost 1  after the gold mining giant said it would  significantly increase  its quarterly dividend  The move came in response to favorable developments in the gold market  which is a common safe haven play for investors fleeing the broader stock market 

Newmont said that it would deliver a whopping 79  boost to its quarterly dividend  raising it to  0 25 per share  The resulting  1 per share in annual payouts would give the gold miner a dividend yield of about 2 3   or about a full percentage point higher than its current yield  Newmont has paid  0 14 per share over the past several quarters 
Investors had already been pleased with the way Newmont has been performing fundamentally  Not only have gold prices been moving higher  but the company has also worked hard to divest itself of non core assets to help it drill down more squarely on its best business opportunities  Streamlining its mining assets has given Newmont a better chance of taking full advantage of higher prices in the long run 
If global conflict rises  then the recent push for gold prices toward  1 600 per ounce could be just the beginning of a new move upward for the yellow metal  Strong gold would lift Newmont further  and that in turn could deliver still higher dividends in the future 
Xerox shows HP the money
Meanwhile  shares of Xerox were down almost 1   The company known for its copiers moved forward on a previously proposed deal to acquire the much larger HP  completing a key step toward demonstrating that it s serious about its proposal 
Xerox announced that it had secured  24 billion in binding financing commitments to complete the HP acquisition  sending a letter to leaders at HP about the news  In the letter  Xerox CEO John Visentin acknowledged that some of HP s skepticism about the previously proposed buyout was that Xerox might not be able to persuade lenders to come up with the capital necessary to complete the deal  The commitments from global banks Citigroup  Mizuho  and Bank of America were intended to counter that hesitation 
Visentin also said that he s willing to meet with HP to discuss the matter further  Yet HP investors don t seem all that excited about the news  with the stock only up about 1  Monday morning 
At this point  the primary question will be whether HP does anything to acknowledge the letter other than repeating its previous statement that the proposed acquisition price was too low  Given the struggles that tech hardware companies have had  a combination might still be the best choice for HP    especially now that it seems that Xerox would be able to get a deal done ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pebhi,2053249

HP rejected the  22 per share offer in November saying it  significantly  undervalued the company  following which the printer maker took the offer directly to HP s shareholders 
Xerox has engaged in  constructive dialogue  with many of HP s largest shareholders  the company s chief executive officer  John Visentin  said in a letter addressed to HP s board on Monday 
 My offer stands to meet with you in person  with or without your advisors  to begin negotiating this transaction   Visentin said 
Activist investor Carl Icahn  who has a 4 2  stake in HP and a 10 9  stake in Xerox  in December urged HP shareholders who agreed with a merger with Xerox to reach out to the PC maker s directors for immediate action 
HP had said it was open to exploring a bid for Xerox  stating that it recognizes the potential benefits of consolidation

Aphria Inc   APHA 
APHA has been a swing trade since it fell down in the 5 6 area  then it spiked up near 11  at 10 95  and then consolidated for two months  Recently  a pullback completed it with a pop on Monday  gaining 62 cents  or 6 65   to 9 94  on 4 9 million shares  Of course  it has to take out resistance in the 10 65  70 zone  If it gets through that  look for it to start up towards 10 95  and then 12  13 1 2  and mid teens eventually 
Catasys  Inc   CATS 
CATS is a swing trade of ours  I love the long term look  It s an inverse head and shoulders  but a flat pattern of six or seven years  and may be ready to pop out  It did pop two weeks ago  formed a 2 week pullback wedge  and then popped out on Monday  jumping 1 72  or 14   to 13 95  on 174 130 shares traded  The volume is light  but it s a thinly traded stock  This may trigger a move  If it takes out 15  I m looking for 18 and 21 
California Resources Corporation  CRC 
CRC one of my favorite junior oils  popped a little bit on Monday  advancing 1 35  or 5 25   to 27 06  on 1 7 million shares  Not great volume  but it s decent  If it can get up above the recent high at 27 84  I m looking for 31 1 2 
HUYA Inc   HUYA 
HUYA had a nice follow through day on Friday  and then a little pop out on Monday  taking it up 1 17  or 4 16   to 29 30  on 3 55 million shares  That s good volume for this stock  The OBV  is moving up  It looks to me like this stock is ready to pop out of and across 30  and then to the low 30 s  in the 33 range  and then the high 30 s 
ION Geophysical Corporation  IO 
IO also swung around and popped on Monday  up 1 80  or 12 47   to 16 24  on 398 299 shares traded  Nearly 400 00 shares  That s good volume for that stock  the best in a couple months  If it makes a move above 17 1 2  we should see 19 to 21 zone 
Roku  Inc   ROKU 
ROKU had another pop and another really good looking angle  The wedge broke out on Monday with a pop of 4 60  or 7 13   to 69 11  on 14 4 million shares  The volume tells me that it may go higher  It can test and take out resistance at 74 25  targeting 78  and then the mid 80 s

Narratives in Financial Markets
Canadian retail sales came better than expected on the margin  with a headline of  0 1  vs  0 3  expected  Despite the details of the report were quite poor  it acted as a catalyst to propel the Canadian Dollar as the best performing currency on Friday 
The EU is preparing retaliation on Xerox  NYSE XRX   Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Samsonite  among other names  should the US decide to put tariffs on European imported cars 
US President Trump continues to keep positive semantics on an eventual trade deal  noting that a deal with China  is more likely than not   Trump remains open to the possibility of extending the March 1st deadline if enough progress  which is highly likely  As an anecdote  in live TV  and reported by Bloomberg  we even saw Trump give an earful to US trade chief over a disagreement in the usefulness of having an MOU vs a formal trade agreement contract 
There were a plethora of Fed speakers lined up on Friday  None of them moved the market  What became clear though  is the unified position on the balance sheet  with further hints provided about a not so distant end to the QT  Quantitative Tightening  process to keep base money at relatively high levels to buffer reserve stocks  Even Fed s Clarida said the Central Bank will review new tools not used before like capping Treasury yields 
On the Brexit saga  with the deadline for the UK to leave the European Union just a month away  the absence of any substantial progress remains the norm  According to Bloomberg  a vote on a new Brexit deal this new week is very unlikely as positions remain far apart  There are some reports suggesting a 21 month Brexit delay might be considered 
The headline that led to NZD weakness earlier on Friday was due to the RBNZ noting that higher bank capital reserves may lead to an eventual rate cut  Taken into context  the headline was conditional and hinged to other elements that had to happen first  so eventually  the market dismissed the comments and the beta currencies  NZD  AUD  CAD  recovered 
China s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a news conference Friday that  I would like to clarify reports China had banned Australian coal imports  are false

RORO   Risk On Risk Off Conditions

The microflows have reverted back to an environment of USD weakness in a context of rising equities  Such a backdrop is positive for beta currencies as seen by the robust recovery in the likes of the Canadian Dollar  the Kiwi and the Australian Dollar  If we add on top of the micro flows the macro  true risk on  layer  we can start to rationalize with a higher degree of logic the move seen  Both the most short term timeframes based off 1 day worth of price action  25 HMA slope   as well as the guidance based on 1 week worth of price information  125 HMA slope   both show the same direction as global equities remain well underpinned on the hopes of a US China trade deal 
Dashboard  Intermarket Flows   Technical Analysis

When it comes to the exchange of flows between the Euro and the US Dollar  it remains a market makers territory  In other words  the lack of impetus and fundamental driven stimulants to create enough demand supply imbalances is keeping the pair range bound  with the cluster of bids and offers at the extremities  for now  able to exploit the low engagement activity  A reflection of this low activity is the neutral measurements assigned to most of the technical intermarket elements monitored in today s forex outlook table above  Not a pretty market to trade unless range trading 

The V shaped rebound in the Sterling should be perceived  to a certain degree  on the basis of a market in an overall bullish context which had entered oversold conditions  What s most important  two critical pillars that have determined the pair s value in recent weeks  DXY  Yield Spread  were still in a macro trend based on the 5 DMA  which represented an excellent price point to engage in buy side action given the discrepancy in the pricing of the GBP USD  The more adventurous  system driven could have just been filled limit orders while the more discretionary type  could have drilled down to lower timeframes to find evidence that the market was ready to revert back up  The recovery in the DXY  inverted  depicted in blue is supportive going forward barring Brexit headlines 

If trading the EUR USD has been such a low key affair for the last 3 days  don t get me started on the USD JPY  It doesn t mean trading opportunities are not existent  it just means that one must adapt to the present range bound market conditions  With a backdrop dominated by risk appetite conditions  these two are the currencies the market is the least incentivized to resort to  which has led to a relatively low interest to find a resolution from its week long range  Overall  with macro  true risk on  conditions still the name of the game  while shorter term we need to contend with USD weakness  this is a market not enjoying the right background to breakout in either direction this Monday 

The Aussie met all the prerequisites for an adjustment in value to the upside last Friday  Whenever we get a market so oversold as the Aussie was  with the added incongruence of a fundamental driven catalyst  Australian coal imports ban to China  later denied by both sides  and on top of that  the macro scene  5 DMA slope  still look constructive based on the mood in the equity market coupled with a rising Yuan  lower US Dollar index  the risk of a significant rebound was evident  As we enter a new week of trading  the backdrop remains positive  hence even if the last sell off created an impulsive movement that qualifies as a valid bearish cycle  the conditions are far from ideal to engage in sell side action  hoping  that a retest of the lows can occur unless the rampant dynamics in the S P 500  the DXY or the Aussie US yield spread exhibit spontaneous sharp reversals 

A similar bearish story setting up since Friday  which has also played out fantastically well in line with the discrepancies spotted in intermarket studies was the USD CAD  Any swing or day trader with an interest to engage at relatively cheap prices with the trend would have probably been all over this short trade  as the conditions were just pristine  We saw a bullish trap during the Asian session  by price breaking up the descending trendline  only for the price to be smashed back down as the market re anchored its support towards the Canadian Dollar in line with a macro positive backdrop in Oil prices and a gloomy one on the US Dollar  both exhibiting 5 DMA slopes supportive of a lower USD CAD  Remember  if the slow stoch enter  in this case  overbought conditions  while intermarket signals argue to support the opposite direction  that s what we understand as price offered at a discount and it makes for interesting exploitable trade opportunities 

In terms of Gold prices  the U turn lower in the US yields alongside the matched downside movement in the DXY did suffice to see flows back into the appeal of Gold  At this stage  as the correlation coefficients demonstrate  gold continues to be treated as a function of USD weakness  with the correlation against the DXY in crescendo for the last 10 days or so  current just under 70   Ever since the last FOMC minutes  when US yield received its last major catalyst  Gold has also been tracking in lock steps the inverted performance of the short dated US yields as a proxy for Fed funds pricing 

The AUD JPY  similarly to the AUD USD  was a market that had written all over the wall clear signs of cheap prices being offered to engage in the buy side activity if one judges the correction lower as being an abnormal event in disagreement with the rising slope of the intermarket macro trends  As a result  fast forward to Monday s Asian trade  and the pair is trading over 80 pips from its recent low 

At the risk of repeating myself to death  I will argue that the vigorous rebound in the EUR AUD also faced analogous bearish conditions to be unsustainable  this time simply predicated on the dominant 5 day trend  125 HMA slope  in the USD CNH  alongside the uptrend in the S P 500  Note  this is a market paying a lot more attention to the state of fundamentals in the Australian economy  that s why we are seeing Aussie flows now tracking much more closely the AU US bond yield spread  so that s definitely  together with the VIX SP500 and the Yuan  a third element to monitor 

Lastly  for those trading the Kiwi  as in the case of the Australian Dollar  this is a market that is starting to look a lot more inwards to determine the next directional bias  By inward  what I mean is that the flows in the NZD USD are being determined by the trajectory of the NZ US bond yield spread  So  with the micro slope having recovered to the bullish side in the last 24h  but with the macro outlook in terms of the yield spread not conclusive  breaking 69c will still prove a tall order

153506,375022,XRX,Insane Stock Market Rally Due To Massive Global Monetary Liquidity,opinion,"If you re puzzled by the magnitude of the stock market correction since late December  you can thank the central banks for the rally  Yes  that s correct  after the Dow Jones suffered the worst Christmas Eve trading day ever  the massive central bank monetary liquidity helped push the index up 20  from its low over the next two months 

Of course  the markets were due for a reversal as nothing goes down in a straight line  but to see the sort of buying in the face of negative economic news and lack luster earnings means that the inevitable CRASH will be even bigger when it finally arrives 
Now  according to the article  Back To Fundamentals  Daniel Lacalle stated the following in regards to the markets 

 In 2018 we saw the first drop in global liquidity in more than a decade  and that generated significant losses in financial markets  Since the end of December stock markets have rebounded strongly because the data  although poor  is not as bad as feared  and mainly because the Federal Reserve changed its tone on the number of rate hikes  the ECB announced that it would be much more accommodative and the Central Bank of China introduced the largest injection of liquidity in five years 
In fact  between December 26 and February 15 we have seen the largest injection of liquidity in the markets of the last two years  bringing the global money supply to record levels 

The two key points stated above were that a drop in global liquidity in 2018 generated significant losses in the financial markets and the largest injection of global liquidity from December 26 to February 15th brought the money supply to a record level and pushed global stock markets back higher  This can be clearly seen in Lacalle s charts 

Thus as the global money supply jumped by more than  3 trillion within two months  the global stock markets enjoyed one hell of a rally  But  how far can money printing go if the fundaments are lacking  Well  that s a good question  Now  if we look at another chart comparing the S P 500 to forward earnings per share  we can see another fundamental disconnect 
This chart and quote below came from the Zerohedge article  The Profit Party Is Over  Q1 Earnings Growth Crashes  Set For Biggest Drop In 3 Years 

As the chart above clearly shows  the Fed s dovish flip has made earnings largely irrelevant for the market s near term direction  as Powell s stated intent to pause hiking and ostensibly slow the Fed s balance sheet shrinkage has taken priority over everything else 
Expect even more market upside irrelevant of what historicals companies report or what guidance they deliver 


So  the insanity of higher stock prices will likely continue for a while until the markets are no longer able to ignore the increasingly lousy economic data 
With that being said  technical analysis still does play a part in providing clues as to how the market will play out  While my forecast of the Dow Jones Index  a few months ago  to peak at a lower level than the 26 000 hit at the beginning of this week was incorrect  I had no idea of the massive central bank money printing that would start of Dec 26th  LOL  Regardless  don t be fooled that the central banks can fix anything  All they are doing is propping up asset prices for a while longer 
To get an idea just how screwed up the markets have become  let s look at XEROX  Xerox  NYSE XRX  is a well known name in the market  When the stock markets started to fall  Xerox s stock price fell 36  from the beginning of November to the day after Christmas 

Xerox fell from nearly  29 at the beginning of November to a low of  18 30 on December 26  However  due to the Fed s  Dovish Market Policy  and the massive central bank monetary injection  Xerox s stock not only made up for all of the losses  but it also added another  3  to gain 72  in a cool two short months 
Now  if we look at Xerox on a weekly chart  the movement is even more extreme 

As we can see in this weekly chart  Xerox s share price has gone nearly straight up  Of course  nothing changed all that much at Xerox for its stock price to lose more than a third in a short period and then bounce back 72  in the same amount of time  According to the company s data  their fourth quarter earnings were better than Wall Street expected  but really nothing to write home about 

Interestingly  Xerox s Q4 2017 results of  2 747 million in revenues and  1 108 million in gross profit were higher than the last quarter of 2018  So  this goes to show that fundamentals don t play much of a role in determining the value of stocks  However  as I have mentioned  the technical analysis still provides us with a guideline  even though there are market rigging and intervention by central banks 
Xerox is still extremely overbought and will have to experience a selloff shortly  Again  nothing goes up or down in a straight line  Furthermore  while I thought the Dow Jones Index might show some sort of a correction lower after reaching 26 000 this week  it looks as if we are going to see another BIG GREEN DAY today 
Lastly  even though the markets could go even higher for a while  don t forget that central bank market intervention will only make the crash much worse when it finally arrives

SYDNEY  Reuters    Asian shares napped near multi month peaks on Thursday while bonds eked out a bounce as reports of delays in sealing a preliminary Sino U S  trade deal left investors frustrated at the lack of concrete progress 
In early European trades  the pan region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up slightly while those for German DAX were flat  London s FTSE futures rose 0 2  
MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan dipped a slight 0 2   just off a six month high hit earlier in the week 
Japan s Nikkei dithered either side of flat in very quiet trade  having touched a 13 month top on Wednesday  South Korean stocks eased 0 15  after hitting their highest since May  while Shanghai blue chips lost 0 08  
E Mini futures for the S P 500 eased 0 1  
Reuters reported on Wednesday a meeting between U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign an interim trade deal could be delayed until December as discussions continue over terms and venue 
Among various suggestions was to sign a deal after a scheduled NATO meeting in early December 
 One could take the view that by not committing to meet the original deadline it gives more time for a somewhat more comprehensive agreement to be thrashed out   said Ray Attrill  head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank 
 But markets have understandably jumped the other way  exhibiting a slight loss of confidence that anything more substantial than an agreement not to further lift tariffs  in return for some increase in US agricultural purchases  can be agreed by way of an initial deal  
Wall Street was underwhelmed by the news and the Dow ended Wednesday all but flat  while the S P 500 gained 0 07  and the Nasdaq dropped 0 29

That in turn restrained the dollar  which eased to 108 74 yen from a weekly high of 109 24  The dollar was steady on a basket of currencies at 97 965

153529,375045,XRX,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,news,"Investing com    Saudi Arabia bows to the inevitable and scales down the Aramco IPO   but it could still be the world s biggest ever  Hong Kong s stock market defies the most violent clashes yet between police and students  HP rejects Xerox s bid  and sterling surges after weekend opinion polls show Boris Johnson s Conservatives on track to win a majority in parliament and break the Brexit deadlock  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday  18th November 
1  Saudi Aramco  the trimmed down blockbuster
 Saudi Arabia scaled down plans for the initial public offering of oil company Saudi Aramco in response to tepid demand from international investors 
Aramco is now aiming to sell only 1 5  of its shares on the domestic stock exchange  barely a quarter of initial hopes for a  100 billion deal  It also announced a price range valuing at between  1 6 trillion and  1 71 trillion  some 15  short of the hoped for valuation even at the top end of the range 
Tellingly  plans to market the offering in the U S   Canada and Japan have been scrapped  That leaves it highly dependent on selling to local investors  To make that easier  The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority will allow smaller retail investors to borrow twice their cash investment  double the leverage it usually allows at IPOs  according to Bloomberg 
2  Police battle students in Hong Kong  but the stock market rises
Protests in Hong Kong escalated still further at the weekend  with police and protesters inconclusively battling for hours for control over one of the city s university campuses  There were over 150 arrests 
 The police might not storm the campus but it seems like they are trying to catch people as they attempt to run   Democratic lawmaker Hui Chi fung told Reuters 
The Hong Kong stock index closed 1 4  higher  however  on hopes that the police action may break the back of student resistance without any further escalation in violence and casualties 
3  Stocks set to open higher
U S  stock markets are set to open at fresh highs  extending an unbroken six week rally  ostensibly reflecting confidence that the U S  and China will reach some kind of trade deal before too long  despite the lack of fresh evidence to suggest an agreement is near 

By 6 15 AM ET  Dow futures were up 60 points  or 0 2   while S P 500 Futures were up 0 1  and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0 2  
With 92  of companies in the S P 500 having now reported earnings for the quarter through September  the average annual decline in earnings is around 2 3   according to FactSet  If that trend is confirmed  it will be the biggest annual drop in earnings since the middle of 2016   and also complete the longest sequence of declining earnings in three year

Both sides are making more and more expensive promises on taxes and spending as the campaign runs into its last month  Johnson is scheduled to outline a cut in corporate income tax at a rally Monday  hoping to win over businesses that have stayed overwhelmingly skeptical about the benefits of Brexit  By 6 15 AM ET  1115 GMT   the pound was at  1 2967  up 0 5  from late Friday  and at 1 1720 against the euro  its highest in nearly seven months

153550,375066,XRX,EU Draws Red Line for Trump on Cars  Calling Quotas a No Go,news," Bloomberg     The European Union signaled it would reject any U S  push to curb imports of EU cars and auto parts  highlighting the risk of greater transatlantic trade tensions 
EU trade chiefs meeting in Brussels dismissed an idea floated by President Donald Trump earlier this month of fixing quotas on European automotive exports to the U S  He claimed such shipments pose a threat to national security 
On May 17  Trump put off a decision on auto tariffs for 180 days  but said that  domestic conditions of competition must be improved by reducing imports  and instructed U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to address the matter in talks with the EU and Japan  Voluntarily restraining exports is illegal under World Trade Organization rules 
 That is something that we are 100  against   Swedish Trade Minister Ann Linde told reporters on Monday in the Belgian capital before the gathering with her EU counterparts  France s junior foreign affairs minister  Jean Baptiste Lemoyne  echoed the point by saying the 28 nation bloc is determined to respect WTO requirements 
Being played out in the shadow of a U S  China trade war that has unnerved investors worldwide  the transatlantic discord over tens of billions of dollars in European auto exports to the American market risks morphing into a new headwind for the global economy 
The issue could scuttle planned EU U S  negotiations on eliminating tariffs on industrial goods across the board and end a trade truce struck by both sides in July 2018  That in turn would increase the likelihood of U S  duties on European cars and an EU tit for tat response 
Last year  Trump declared American imports of steel and aluminum a national security threat and imposed levies of 25  and 10   respectively  on shipments from around the world including the EU  That prompted the bloc to retaliate with a 25  tariff on 2 8 billion euros   3 1 billion  of American goods including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  NYSE LEVI   jeans and bourbon whiskey 
A 25  U S  levy on foreign cars would add 10 000 euros to the sticker price of EU vehicles imported into the country  according to the European Commission  the bloc s executive arm 
 We hope that the tariffs will not be put into practice at all   Linde said   That is a really  really tough situation for the Swedish car industry and the European car industry  So that would be a catastrophe  
U S  tariffs on European cars and auto parts would mark a significant escalation of transatlantic tensions because the value of EU automotive exports to the American market is about 10 times greater than that of the bloc s steel and aluminum exports combined  As a result  European retaliatory duties would target a bigger amount of U S  exports to Europe 
The EU plans to hit as much as 20 billion euros of U S  goods with tariffs should Trump impose duties on European cars and auto parts  Jean Luc Demarty  the commission s outgoing director general for trade  said in late January

European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom criticized Trump s assertion in May that EU cars and auto parts shipped to the American market pose a security risk to the U S  The Trump administration faces a self imposed deadline of mid November to decide whether to curb such imports 
 We firmly reject that we are a security threat   Malmstrom told a conference in Brussels on Friday   That is absurd  If there will be tariffs there  we would take countermeasures  
Transatlantic trade ties    the world s biggest economic relationship    are approaching a crucial juncture largely in the shadow of the U S  China commercial war 
Planned EU U S  negotiations to eliminate duties on industrial products remain blocked by American demands to include agriculture in any market opening dealBoth sides are set for a tit for tat tariff fight over aircraft aid deemed illegal by the World Trade OrganizationTrump is keeping alive the possibility of automotive import levies The EU is deeply concerned about a looming deadlock at the WTO s appellate body  to which the U S  has refused to consider any appointments on the grounds the forum s members have strayed from their original mandate   Relations are tense   said Malmstrom  a Swede whose five year term as EU trade commissioner ends on Oct  31  She is due to be succeeded by Ireland s Phil Hogan  who is currently EU agriculture chief and who earlier this month called Trump  reckless

in the second quarter  Lower corporate and individual tax rates along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3  target Tax Cuts  Trump s Business Friendly MovesThe Trump administration remains focused on improving the ease of doing business as evident from the recent tax cuts  The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35  to 21  has given a boost to corporate earnings  investments and in some instances reflected in employee rewards  In addition  Trump s pledge to spend  1 trillion on infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years and regulatory rollbacks remain tailwinds Employment and Manufacturing and Non Manufacturing ActivityThe employment index registered growth of 54 2  in April  which indicates employment growth in April for the 19th consecutive month  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  12 reported employment growth  The increase came as companies are hiring more skilled workers and indirect personnel Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in April and the overall economy grew for the 108th consecutive month  U S  manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in April as the PMI measured by ISM touched 57 3   This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 20th consecutive month  driven by continued increase in new orders  production activity and employment and inventories  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  17 reported growth in April As far as the non manufacturing sector is concerned  NMI stood at 56 8  in April  recording the 99th consecutive month of expansion  While the Prices Index gained 0 3  to 61 8   the Employment Index declined 3  to 53 6   As many as 18 non manufacturing industries reported growth Continuous upsurge in the PMI  NMI as well as greater number of jobs offered by manufacturing giants buoys further optimism What are the Headwinds Expenses on a HighBusiness service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies  which involves continued spending on research and development  Moreover  training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  in turn affecting margins  Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is the possibility of a high turnover rate  which further adds to cost Higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure  For example  Avis Budget or Budget continues to face hurdles like high fleet costs and unfavorable currency headwinds  Though the company is progressing well with its disciplined pricing initiatives and expects these to offset the rising fleet costs  we would wait to see more pronounced results on this front before turning optimistic Competition IntenseMaintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So  target customers for both may at times be the same  Strategic mergers and consolidations also pose competition for players Therefore  business service providers need to be adequately equipped to win over customers  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification  hotel companies are broadly grouped under the Consumer Discretionary sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our X industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  In fact  ourback testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much  The Zacks Industry Rank for Business   Services industry is currently  201  bottom 21   The ranking is available on the  Earnings TrendsSo far  the first quarter 2018 financial performance for business services companies has been encouraging  While First Data Corp  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues  Xerox beat the consensus mark for revenues but missed on earnings Earnings prospects for Q1 are encouraging with the sector expected to be up 22 6  from the year earlier level on 6 8  higher revenues You can see  Valuation PictureLooking at the industry s trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  the space s valuation picture remains rich  The sector is currently trading at 25 3X trailing 12 month earnings  Over the last 5 years  the sector has traded as high as 25 8X and as low as 19 8X  with a median of 23 1X  The S P 500 index is currently at 20X trailing 12 month earnings  with the broader index s 5 year high  low and median at 21 9X  15 3X  and 18 1X  respectively Looking at forward estimates  the sector is currently trading at 21 5X forward 12 month earnings estimates  Over the last 5 years  the sector has traded as high as 22X and as low as 17 2X and 5 year median of 19 4X  The S P 500 is currently trading at 17X  with the index s high  low and median of 19 1X  14X  and 17 1  respectively In other words  the sector s valuation picture is far from attractive Bottom LineThe U S  economy is now improving and population continues to increase in a nation  The business services industry  being labor intensive  involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses the issue While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services  these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies  However  given the

Business Services industry have been strong performers of late  reflecting overall favorable trends  These are expected to further drive the companies in the near  to medium term GDP Growth to

employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning In April  unemployment dropped to 3 9   the lowest since December 2000  indicating that the labor market continues to be robust Meanwhile  U6  the most rigorous metric of unemployment in the U S   declined to 7 8   its lowest level in 11 years  This measure takes into account individuals who are

services  webstore in a box solutions  cloud based point of sale operating system and value added solutions  First Data has made steady progress with its SMB turnaround plan  which is expected to

effective services that would otherwise be far more expensive for companies With specialized services  these providers reduce operational cost and  in turn  lower the overall cost of companies  Notably  a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers  This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies  thereby fueling margin expansion Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters and will likely retain the momentum in the near term too  Importantly  Business Services margin expansion is better than that of S P 500 Index Key PicksTop ranked stocks in the business services space include First Data Corp   Avis Budget Group and

153615,375131,XRX,Fujifilm wins appeal in battle with Xerox over aborted merger,news,"By Makiko Yamazaki TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s Fujifilm Holdings Corp  T 4901  has won an appeal in its legal battles with  Xerox Corp   N XRX   with a New York court overturning preliminary injunctions requested by an activist investor that had blocked their planned merger  Xerox in May scrapped a  6 1 billion deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also handed control of the U S  photocopier giant to new management  The ruling by the New York State Appellate Court could give the Japanese firm leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table  Fujifilm is also suing Xerox in a separate U S  suit that seeks well over  1 billion  accusing it of breach of contract in abandoning the deal  Its chances of success are  however  unclear as Xerox s new management  backed by Icahn and Deason  is opposed to the proposed merger  Analysts have said the only way for Fujifilm to gain any traction with Xerox now is to raise its offer  Fujifilm said in a statement it stands by its view that the original planned merger remains the best option for the shareholders of both companies    The  Court s decision will allow us to discuss with Xerox the fulfillment of the original agreement  All Xerox shareholders ought to be able to decide for themselves the operational  financial  and strategic merits of the transaction to combine Fuji Xerox and Xerox   it said  The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control  That prompted Icahn and Deason  who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U S  firm was being undervalued  to launch a proxy fight  Representatives for Xerox  Deason and Icahn were not immediately available for comment  The New York court found in its Oct  16 ruling that Xerox s former CEO Jeff Jacobson  accused by Deason of negotiating the deal to save his own job  had neither misled or misinformed the board   The board  which engaged outside advisors and discussed the proposed transaction on numerous occasions prior to voting on agreeing to present it to the shareholders  did not engage in a mere post hoc review  nor was the transaction unreasonable on its face   the ruling also said  The bitter legal wrangling has created much uncertainty for the two firms which are seen by many analysts as inextricably intertwined through their Fuji Xerox joint venture  The venture accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm s revenue while Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers  instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox  Xerox has said it would start sourcing products from new vendors for sale directly to customers in Fuji Xerox s primary Asia Pacific market  The U S  firm is now led by John Visentin who worked as a consultant to Icahn in the proxy fight and just this month it appointed Louie Pastor  previously deputy general counsel at Icahn Enterprises  as general counsel   Fujifilm Chief Executive Shigetaka Komori said in June the company was  not opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board  but added many of its shareholders were demanding that its money would be better off spent on its healthcare businesses   The latest ruling is a step forward for Fujifilm to make the deal happen   said Masayuki Otani  chief market analyst at Securities Japan who believes Fujifilm should focus on healthcare   But concerns remain about whether taking over Xerox is the right step for the company

153622,375138,XRX,Dollar Trades Like A Roller Coaster After Fed  Eurozone Inflation Coming Up,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index  which gauges the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was practically unchanged on Thursday after it touched its highest level in 2018 yesterday  in the aftermath of the Fed s policy meeting 
STOCKS  US markets closed lower yesterday  following the FOMC meeting  Although stock indices spiked higher immediately on the decision  that sentiment quickly turned around and equities edged lower to finish in the red  The S P 500 and Dow Jones both fell by 0 72   while the Nasdaq Composite declined by 0 42   Futures tracking the S P  Dow  and Nasdaq 100 are currently in positive territory  albeit marginally so  In Asia  Japanese markets remained closed for a public holiday  while in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng tumbled by 1 4   In Europe  futures tracking the major indices were a sea of red  pointing to a lower open for these benchmarks today 
COMMODITIES  Both WTI and Brent are down on Thursday  but by less than 0 1   Prices responded little to a surprisingly large build in US inventories yesterday  Another interesting point is that oil has remained elevated lately despite a resurgent US dollar  which typically exerts downward pressure on the precious liquid  The obvious conclusion is that expectations around fresh sanctions being imposed on Iran soon are currently strong enough to offset both signals that US production is soaring and recovery in the dollar is underway  In precious metals  gold is trading 0 4  higher today  last seen near the  1 308 per ounce mark  The safe haven traded like a roller coaster yesterday after the FOMC decision  initially surging and then quickly giving those gains back  overall moving in opposite directions with the dollar  Major movers  Dollar drops after Fed but quickly recovers to touch 2018 high

The Fed kept borrowing costs unchanged yesterday  as was widely anticipated  There were three noteworthy changes in the accompanying statement  Starting with the dovish ones  policymakers removed a sentence that previously stated the economic outlook had strengthened  signaling that economic data have begun to moderate  In addition  the Fed included the word  symmetric  when describing its 2  inflation target  This was interpreted as a hint it may be comfortable allowing inflation to run above 2  without raising rates for a while  since it was running below it for so long  The result was a sharp drop in the dollar immediately following the decision 
However  the tumble was short lived  and the greenback recovered all its losses to trade higher in the following hours  as the dust settled and market participants digested the hawkish signals in the statement as well  The Fed also erased a sentence that previously indicated  the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely   which is likely a hint that officials are becoming more confident inflation will rise  and that downside risks have dissipated  The dollar index surged to reach a fresh high for 2018 in the aftermath 
Overall  the key takeaway was that the Fed is becoming a little more cautious about the economy s performance  but considerably more optimistic on the inflation outlook  As for the dollar  all eyes will now turn to tomorrow s employment report  which should provide some direction   particularly if there are any surprises in the wage figures  Lastly  the greenback may also be impacted by fresh signals on trade  Note that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin arrived in China for negotiations today  so we may see some market attention fall back on trade issues 
In the antipodean currencies  aussie dollar and kiwi dollar are higher by 0 4  and 0 35  respectively today  catching their breath following roughly two weeks of continued declines for both  Day ahead  Eurozone inflation  UK services PMI  US trade data and services PMI on the agenda
Thursday s calendar features a number of important releases  including flash inflation figures for April out of the eurozone 
At 08 00 GMT  the Norges Bank s decision on interest rates will be made public  No change in rates is expected though the Bank s communication could well lead to positioning in Nokkie pairs  At the same time  the Swedish central bank will be holding an open hearing with Governor Stefan Ingves on the report  Account of Monetary Policy 2017   In this respect  Swedish krona pairs will also be monitored 
Attention will next turn to the UK which will be on the receiving end of PMI data for the all important services sector  which contributes around 80  of the nation s GDP  an acceleration in activity is expected  In the two preceding days  the respective PMI readings for the manufacturing and construction sectors surprised to the downside and delivered a beat correspondingly 
Politics are also in focus in the UK which holds local elections today  PM May s Conservatives Party is projected to lose council seats  Should the number of lost seats exceed expectations  then a leadership challenge could be put back on the table  further complicating things and leading to additional losses for sterling pairs  Meanwhile  Brexit uncertainty looms large with an ongoing debate on whether the nation should remain within a customs union with the EU after it officially exits the bloc 
Preliminary inflation figures for the month of April are due out of the eurozone at 09 00 GMT  Headline inflation  as gauged by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  HICP  that uses a common methodology across EU countries  is anticipated to grow at 1 3  y y  the same as in March  This compares to the ECB s target for annual inflation of close to but below 2   Core inflation  that excludes volatile food and energy items  will also be watched  Euro area producer price data for March are scheduled for release at the same time 
Trade data out of the US will be in focus at 12 30 GMT  with the country s trade deficit expected to narrow in March after rising to a nine and a half year high in February  The numbers pertaining to the bilateral trade deficit with China will also be closely monitored amid ongoing trade tensions   which have eased somewhat lately   between the world s two largest economies  Weekly jobless claims data  as well as numbers on Q1 labor costs and productivity will hit the markets at the same time  while Canada will also be seeing the release of March trade data at 1230 GMT 
Later in the day  14 00 GMT   factory orders for March and April s ISM services PMI will be generating attention out of the US  On an annual basis  factory orders are forecast to grow at a faster pace compared to the month that preceded  while service sector activity as gauged by the ISM s PMI is anticipated to ease  though still comfortably remain in expansion territory  above the 50 threshold  
Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  and Xerox  NYSE XRX  are among companies releasing quarterly results on Thursday  both corporations will be reporting after today s US market close 
Policymakers making appearances include ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio and ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure  who will be talking on fostering a banking and capital markets union within the eurozone at 12 00 GMT and 12 30 GMT respectively  Technical Analysis  EUR GBP short term bullish  trades not far below 9 week high
EUR GBP advanced considerably after hitting a near one year low of 0 8620 on April 17  eventually posting a nine week high of 0 8830 during Wednesday s trading  The Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines are positively aligned in support of a bullish bias  Notice though that the two have flatlined  this being a sign of easing positive momentum in the short term 
Stronger than anticipated inflation figures out of the eurozone are likely to refuel the positive momentum  pushing the pair higher  EUR GBP is currently marginally above the 100 day moving average located at 0 8808  but could still be meeting resistance around it  the region around this MA also includes the Ichimoku cloud top at 0 8817   Further above  additional resistance could come around yesterday s high of 0 8830  with attention next turning to the 0 89 round figure 
On the downside and in case of weaker eurozone data  support could come around the current level of the 50 day MA at 0 8781  including the Ichimoku cloud bottom at 0 8779   and further below from the Tenkan sen  0 8755  and Kijun sen  0 8725  lines

153625,375141,XRX,Business Services Industry Outlook   May 2018,opinion,"The business services industry s outlook is a function of the health of the broader economy  which is currently quite favorable 
A rise in GDP  an improving employment scenario  inflation approaching 2   easing of the U S  dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement in the U S  economy  which in turn is positive for the business services industry  The Trump administration s business friendly policies  including tax cuts and the repeal of regulations  are additional tailwinds

What s in Favor for Business Services 
Stronger GDP a Key Catalyst
Gross Domestic Product  GDP  grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 3  in the first quarter of 2018  following 2 6  gain in the fourth quarter of 2018  per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
The slowdown in growth was mainly due to seasonal quirk and economists expect growth to accelerate in the second quarter  Lower corporate and individual tax rates along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3  target 
Tax Cuts  Trump s Business Friendly Moves
The Trump administration remains focused on improving the ease of doing business as evident from the recent tax cuts  The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35  to 21  has given a boost to corporate earnings  investments and in some instances reflected in employee rewards  In addition  Trump s pledge to spend  1 trillion on infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years and regulatory rollbacks remain tailwinds 
Employment and Manufacturing and Non Manufacturing Activity
The employment index registered growth of 54 2  in April  which indicates employment growth in April for the 19th consecutive month  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  12 reported employment growth  The increase came as companies are hiringmore skilled workers and indirect personnel 
Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in April and the overall economy grew for the 108th consecutive month  U S  manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in April as the PMI measured by ISM touched 57 3   This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 20th consecutive month  driven by continued increase in new orders  production activity and employment and inventories  Of the 18 manufacturing industries  17 reported growth in April 
As far as the non manufacturing sector is concerned  NMI stood at 56 8  in April  recording the 99th consecutive month of expansion  While the Prices Index gained 0 3  to 61 8   the Employment Index declined 3  to 53 6   As many as 18 non manufacturing industries reported growth 
Continuous upsurge in the PMI  NMI as well as greater number of jobs offered by manufacturing giants buoys further optimism 
What are the Headwinds 
Expenses on a High
Business service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies  which involves continued spending on research and development  Moreover  training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  in turn affecting margins  Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is the possibility of a high turnover rate  which further adds to cost 
Higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure  For example  Avis Budget  CAR  or Budget continues to face hurdles like high fleet costs and unfavorable currency headwinds  Though the company is progressing well with its disciplined pricing initiatives and expects these to offset the rising fleet costs  we would wait to see more pronounced results on this front before turning optimistic 
Competition Intense
Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So  target customers for both may at times be the same  Strategic mergers and consolidations also pose competition for players 
Therefore  business service providers need to be adequately equipped to win over customers  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services

Valuation Picture
Looking at the industry s trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  the space s valuation picture remains rich  The sector is currently trading at 25 3X trailing 12 month earnings  Over the last 5 years  the sector has traded as high as 25 8X and as low as 19 8X  with a median of 23 1X  The S P 500 index is currently at 20X trailing 12 month earnings  with the broader index s 5 year high  low and median at 21 9X  15 3X  and 18 1X  respectively 
Looking at forward estimates  the sector is currently trading at 21 5X forward 12 month earnings estimates  Over the last 5 years  the sector has traded as high as 22X and as low as 17 2X and 5 year median of 19 4X  The S P 500 is currently trading at 17X  with the index s high  low and median of 19 1X  14X  and 17 1  respectively 
In other words  the sector s valuation picture is far from attractive 
Bottom Line
The U S  economy is now improving and population continues to increase in a nation  The business services industry  being labor intensive  involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses the issue 
While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services  these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies  However  given the inherent strengths  the business services space has enough steam left to drive the engine toward growth

153649,375165,XRX,Xerox explores sale of leasing finance unit  sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B  Baker
 Reuters     Xerox Corp   NYSE XRX  is considering the sale of a leasing unit that lends money to customers to rent printers and equipment  to make itself more attractive to potential acquirers following the termination of its  6 1 billion sale to Fujifilm Holdings Corp  people familiar with the matter said on Friday 
Divesting the leasing unit would relieve Xerox of roughly  3 6 billion in debt  one of the sources said  Activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason  who took control of Xerox earlier this year  are preparing to launch an auction for the company  which has a market capitalization of  6 4 billion and total debt as of the end of March of  5 5 billion 
Xerox has not made a final decision on selling the leasing finance unit  the sources said this week  asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential 
Xerox declined to comment  while representatives for Icahn and Deason did not respond to requests for comment 
Reuters reported in May that buyout firm Apollo Global Management approached the company to express its acquisition interest  Reducing Xerox s liabilities through the sale of the leasing finance unit would allow private equity firms to place more debt on the company to juice returns 
Xerox has said it is exploring its strategic options after it ended its deal with Fujifilm  following pressure from Icahn  a billionaire investor  and Deason  a former executive at a company that Xerox acquired several years ago  The two together own 15 percent of Xerox shares 
The company has been engaged in a legal fight with Fujifilm since their merger agreement ended in May  Fujifilm sued Xerox in June for more than  1 billion  accusing it of breaching its merger contract and engaging in  intentional and egregious conduct   Xerox has disputed these claims 
The head of Fuji Xerox Co Ltd  a 56 year old joint venture between Fujifilm and Xerox  said this week he was confident that the escalating dispute between the partners would not lead to the venture s dissolution  Fujifilm owns 75 percent of the joint venture and Xerox the remainder 
Xerox said last month it would start sourcing products from new vendors to lower its dependence on Fujifilm  and cautioned it may not renew a technology agreement with Fuji Xerox

153670,375186,XRX,Xerox board seeks better terms from Fujifilm  will resume talks,news,By Sonam Rai and Arjun Panchadar  Reuters    Xerox  NYSE XRX  Corp s board said on Wednesday it intended to resume merger discussions with Fujifilm Holdings  seeking a superior deal to terms announced at the end of January that have spurred a proxy fight over the company  Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason  who own 15 percent of Xerox  have been trying to unravel the deal and unlock more value out the company  Asserting the Fujifilm deal values Xerox at just  28 per share  they said this week they would consider an all cash bid of at least  40 per share  Analysts say the prolonged fight for Xerox could ultimately push higher any offer price from Fujifilm or other interested parties  Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC considered a bid for Xerox last week  sources have said  Fujifilm said on Thursday it has not yet received a new proposal from Xerox and believes the current deal provides the best value for the shareholders of both firms   If we receive a new proposal  we will need to study whether it offers value to the shareholders of Fujifilm   it said in a statement  The two companies in January agreed to a complex  6 1 billion deal that would merge Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox  which Fujifilm would control with a 50 1 percent stake  Xerox shareholders were also due to receive a  2 5 billion special cash dividend  The firms have not  however  disclosed a per share valuation for Xerox for the deal  UBS analysts estimated in February that the deal valued Xerox at  40 a share    9 80 in cash for every Xerox share held and calculated the stake in the proposed new Fuji Xerox to be worth  30  That value mostly matches the current demands of the activist shareholders  except they want it all in cash  Shannon Cross from Cross Research said an incremental five dollars plus benefit from synergies from the Fuji Xerox deal should result over time in a value for Xerox stock that would be above the  40 per share   At the end of the day  Carl Icahn has always wanted more money for this deal  I am not sure that running the business is what he looks to do   said Cross  While some Tokyo based analysts say Fujifilm would be better off putting its money into its non copier and printer businesses  others argue that the Japanese firm  which relies on the joint venture for nearly half of its revenue  should cede to the activist shareholders  demands  Xerox had at one stage reopened talks on the deal with Fujifilm but those discussions were suspended after Deason won a temporary court order blocking the deal  The judge said  however  that Xerox was not prohibited from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm  Xerox said on Wednesday that it will pursue an appeal of the lower court s ruling in the Deason lawsuit  which it believes  was wrongly decided and will be reversed   Fujifilm is also pursuing an appeal  Shares of Xerox closed 1 6 percent higher at  28 96 on Wednesday  Fujfilm s shares were flat in Thursday afternoon trade ,2018-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xerox-board-seeks-better-terms-from-fujifilm-will-resume-talks-1439334,1439334
153671,375187,XRX,Xerox abandons planned deal with Fujifilm in victory for Icahn and Deason,news,By Alwyn Scott and Makiko Yamazaki NEW YORK TOKYO  Reuters     Xerox Corp   N XRX  has scrapped a planned  6 1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp  T 4901  in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also hands control of the U S  photocopier giant to new management  The victory for the billionaire investors puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox  although it is by no means out of contention as Xerox is now expected to go up for sale in an auction at a higher price  Xerox said that it had over several weeks repeatedly asked Fujifilm to immediately start talks about improved terms for a proposed transaction   Despite our insistence  Fujifilm provided no assurance that it will do so within an acceptable timeframe   the U S  firm said in a statement on its decision to drop the deal  Fujifilm was quick to take a combative stance  saying it disputes Xerox s right to terminate the deal and would look at all options including legal action seeking damages  The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control  That prompted Icahn and Deason  who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U S  firm was being undervalued  to launch a proxy fight  The activist investors have also said they are unhappy with the current structure of the joint venture  and settlement creates uncertainty concerning potential changes to a business that accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm s revenue  Icahn and Deason have said they believe other investors are  waiting in the wings  for Xerox while people familiar with the matter have previously said that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC  N APO  has expressed interest in a bid for Xerox  INSEPARABLE  But analysts believe the two firms are inextricably intertwined and that Fujifilm is not without bargaining power  while also doubting that talk of other buyers is that substantial   It wouldn t be good if it goes elsewhere  But are there really other potential buyers  Icahn and Deason say there are  because they want a higher price  but you don t really know whether that s for real   said Ichiyoshi Asset Management senior executive officer Mitsushige Akino  Fuji Xerox  75 percent owned by Fujifilm  handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe  and Fuji Xerox services in Asia  Moreover  Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers  instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox  Xerox said its new board would meet immediately and  begin a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value   Icahn and Deason have said they would consider an all cash bid of at least  40 per share  In contrast to the investors  argument that Fujifilm is only offering  28 per share  analysts have said the Japanese firm s offer is not too far off that per share valuation  albeit not in cash  The settlement will see Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson   the main architect of the deal with Fujifilm   as well as five other directors step down  John Visentin is expected to take the helm   Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox  He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year  according to court documents  It is Xerox s second settlement with the activist investors in just two weeks  The first settlement agreement was allowed to expire as Xerox came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm and also took into account a stock dive that followed the agreement   We are extremely pleased that Xerox finally terminated the ill advised scheme to cede control of the company to Fujifilm   Icahn said in a statement  Xerox also said it was ending the deal partly because Fujifilm had failed to provide audited financial information for Fuji Xerox by an April 15 deadline and that there were  material deviations  between audited Fuji Xerox financial statements and unaudited statements provided previously ,2018-05-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xerox-ending-fujifilm-deal-settles-with-icahn-deason-1444792,1444792

153673,375189,XRX,Xerox Corporation  Is XRX A Good Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Xerox Corporation   NYSE XRX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Xerox Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 9x  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 9x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Xerox Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 9 5x over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 9x  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should point out that Xerox Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 4x  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Xerox Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 7x  This is way lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1x right now  Thus  the stock is undervalued from this aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Xerox Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Xerox Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Xerox Corporation is just 6 7x  a level that is lower than the industry average of 8 3x  Clearly  XRX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Xerox Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives XRX a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has tumbled 10 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Xerox Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineXerox Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  While the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  its solid Zacks Industry Rank  Top 39  out of 265 Zacks industries  indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-23,Zacks Investment

153676,375192,XRX,Explaining The Messy Drama Going On In Uber s Boardroom,opinion,"Last week  Travis Kalanick  Uber Technologies  co founder and ex CEO  surprised the ride hailing giant s board of directors when he appointed two new members  former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain and Former Xerox  NYSE XRX  CEO Ursula Burns 
  this was an alarming move  as Uber s board is currently considering instilling some changes that would see Kalanick lose  much of his power   When Kalanick resigned from his role as chief executive earlier this summer  he still kept his position on the company s board and controlled a majority of voting shares 
 Ursula   John bring 50  years of combined executive experience to  s board   helping the company become stronger now   for the future   travis kalanick   travisk  Uber s board is voting today on these reforms  which have two other main objectives in addition to limiting Kalanick s power  to create equal voting power among shareholders  as well as move the nearly  70 billion company toward its much talked about   New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reportedly wants an IPO to happen within the  
Citing sources  Bloomberg writes that  Kalanick sees the changes as poor corporate governance  meant to shift authority to Khosrowshahi and away from the board  
The company is also set to vote on whether or not to pursue a major stock deal with Japan s SoftBank Group   OTC SFTBY     last week that the tech investment firm is expected to invest at least  1 billion in Uber  and buy  9 billion in stock from existing investors  And  SoftBank is also willing to block attempts to promote Kalanick to  the company s top ranks  
One of Uber s biggest investors  venture capital firm Benchmark  particularly wants this guarantee  According to Bloomberg s sources  Benchmark desires a written assurance from SoftBank that  it would reject reappointing Kalanick as chief executive officer and block his appointment as chairman of the board or head of one of its subcommittees  
Benchmark was one of the parties that helped lead to Kalanick s ouster  but the firm is also suing the former chief executive for fraud  Kalanick  however  says he is the victim of malicious slander  Benchmark initially sought a  status quo order   which would basically freeze any involvement Kalanick had in Uber s business

153698,375214,XRX,Business Services Challenged By Regulatory Hurdles,opinion,"Despite the positives in the Business Services  we cannot ignore the headwinds limiting the positives mentioned in                                                                   Discussed below are some inherent challenges faced by the Business Services sector 
Continuous Spending on Research and Development  Importantly  consulting service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development  The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimate to or adopt new services to cope with the latest developments 
Maintaining Skilled Workforce Involves High Costs  Since skilled workers are always in demand  there is a possibility of a high turnover rate in the sector  The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs  in turn affecting margins  This space needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a rapid pace 
Competition  Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers  As discussed earlier  the main business of one company can be a business service for another  So target customers for both may at times be the same 
Therefore  a business service provider needs to be adequately equipped to win over customers  While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures  the relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services 
Regulatory Hurdles  By virtue of having operations across the globe  service providers face regulatory hurdles and compliance related issues  The Western Union Company  NYSE WU   WU  expects compliance costs to be at the higher end of 3 5 4  in 2017 
MoneyGram International Inc   MGI  is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti fraud and anti money laundering programs for 2003 to early 2009  The company is also involved in many other government investigations and litigations  Any adverse results from the investigation might lead to potential liability against damages  which could put pressure on margins and cash flows 
Based on an unfavorable Zacks Rank  we prefer to avoid Xerox Corp   XRX   Performant Financial Corp   PFMT   General Finance Corp   GFN   Acacia Research Corp   ACTG   Avis Budget Group  Inc   CAR  and PRGX Global  Inc   PRGX   While Xerox  Performant Financial  and General Finance carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Acacia Research  Avis Budget and PRGX Global carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
You can see  
To Conclude
The dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can affect its prospects  Non availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs 
In addition  the highly fragmented nature of the industry makes it difficult for such companies to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it

153767,375283,XRX,Japan s Fujifilm to take over Xerox in  6 1 billion deal  create joint venture,news,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Ritsuko Ando
 Reuters    Japan s Fujifilm Holdings is set to take over  Xerox Corp   NYSE XRX  in a  6 1 billion deal  combining the U S  company into their existing joint venture to gain scale and cut costs amid declining demand for office printing 
The acquisition announced on Wednesday comes as Xerox has been under pressure to find new sources of growth as it struggles to reinvent its legacy business amid waning demand for office printing  Fujifilm is also trying to streamline its copier business with a larger focus on document solutions services 
Consolidation of R D  procurement and other operations would enable Fuji Xerox to deliver at least  1 7 billion in total cost savings by 2022  the two companies said 
Fujifilm now owns 75 percent of Fuji Xerox  the joint venture going back more than 50 years ago which sells photocopying products and services in the Asia Pacific region 
The two companies said that Fuji Xerox will buy back that stake from Fujifilm for around  6 1 billion  using bank debt  Fujifilm will use those proceeds to purchase 50 1 percent of new Xerox shares  Plans were for the deal to be completed around July August  they added 
The combined company will keep the Fuji Xerox name and become a subsidiary of Fujifilm  with dual headquarters in the United States and Japan  and listed in New York  It will be led by Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson  while Fujifilm CEO Shigetaka Komori will serve as chairman 
The joint venture accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm s sales and operating profit 
Both companies have struggled with slow sales of photocopy products  as businesses increasingly go paperless  Fujifilm on Wednesday reported a 29 4 percent drop in operating profit at its document solutions operations  which includes Fuji Xerox  for the third quarter  underperforming its imaging and information segments  Overall  the company reported a 3 4 percent increase in operating profit for the quarter 
Xerox reported a net loss from continuing operations of  196 million in the fourth quarter  mainly due to a one off  400 million charge as it sought to take advantage of changes to U S  tax law but also reflecting the steady decline in office printing 
 This has been a speedy decision  but I believe it s a creative one   Fujifilm CEO Komori told reporters at a briefing   The new structure will leverage the strengths of our three companies  
As part of its own restructuring  Fujifilm said it was cutting 10 000 jobs at Fuji Xerox  more than a fifth of its workforce at the joint venture  in the Asia Pacific region 
Sluggish performance at Xerox had prompted investors to call on the U S  company  which had owned 25 percent of the joint venture  to explore strategic options 
Xerox has been targeted by activist investor Carl Icahn and shareholder Darwin Deason  who joined forces last week to push Xerox to explore strategic options  oust its  old guard   including its CEO  and negotiate better terms for its decades long deal with Fujifilm  Icahn is Xerox s biggest shareholder  with a 9 72 percent stake 
Xerox s CEO said the combined company would gain an increased edge in new technologies  along with higher revenues and cost synergies  while Xerox shareholders would also benefit from a  2 5 billion special cash dividend resulting from the deal 
 This transaction   offers substantial upside for shareholders of the combined companies  including current shareholders of Xerox and Fujifilm Holdings  who will own shares in a more competitive company that has enhanced opportunities for long term growth and margin expansion   Jacobson said in a pre recorded video message 
The takeover deal comes less than a year after Fujifilm admitted improper accounting standards at Fuji Xerox  but Komori said that Xerox s strong governance standards could be beneficial to the new company 

Fujifilm shares fell 8 3 percent on Wednesday ahead of its announcement of job cuts but after the Journal report about a deal with Xerox  Xerox shares ended down 0 5 percent on Tuesday ",2018-01-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fujifilm-nears-deal-with-xerox-wsj-1173742,1173742

5 Stocks with Low Price to Cash Flow Ratio to Buy Now

 It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price     Warren Buffett    The strategy is quite simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth 

	Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but are fundamentally sound  So the chances are these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward 

	There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks  but none alone can conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better 

	You must be wondering why we are considering this  when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company 

	Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same 

	A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves 

	However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap 

The Bargain Hunting Strategy

	Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks 

P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median  

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median    This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers 

P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain 

P S less than or equal to X Industry Median    The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is 

PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

Value Score of less than or equal to B    Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening

4 Low Price to Cash Flow Stocks for Assured Returns

	Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you know the trick 

	When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher 

	There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest considering Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better 

Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health

	Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company 

	Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same 

	A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves 

What s the Optimum Strategy 

	However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book  price to earnings and price to sales ratios  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap 

	Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks 

P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median  

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000    A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers 

P B less than or equal to X Industry Median    A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain 

P S less than or equal to X Industry Median    The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is 

PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

Value Score of less than or equal to B    Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

153776,375292,XRX,5 Low Price to Book Stocks For Investors In August,opinion,Risk averse investors who can t buy high priced stocks are always on the lookout for low priced valuable stocks  As it is  finding the right stock that matches all your criteria is not an easy task  On top of that  choosing a stock that offers great value but is trading cheap at the same time is a herculean task Thus value analysis is the best approach to identify great bargains  Though price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use metric for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects  The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization   book value of equityExplaining the P B RatioTo begin with  it is important to understand what book value is  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets of a company  In most cases  that would equate to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from total assets to determine the book value By comparing book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means the stock is trading at less than its book value  which can also mean the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less that one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative return on its assets  or the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without its limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on their books  However  it can be misleading for firms with large R D expenditures or high debt companies or service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the P B is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision The Winning ScreenPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Low Price to Book Stocks for Investors This Month 

Risk averse investors who can t buy high priced stocks are always on the lookout for low priced valuable stocks  As it is  finding the right stock that matches all your criteria is not an easy task  On top of that  choosing a stock that offers great value but is trading cheap at the same time is a herculean task 

Thus value analysis is the best approach to identify great bargains  Though price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use metric for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects  The P B ratio is calculated as below 

P B ratio   market capitalization   book value of equity

Explaining the P B Ratio

To begin with  it is important to understand what book value is  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities 

It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets of a company  In most cases  that would equate to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from total assets to determine the book value 

By comparing book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries 

A P B ratio less than one means the stock is trading at less than its book value  which can also mean the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive 

But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less that one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative return on its assets  or the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock 

Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without its limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on their books  However  it can be misleading for firms with large R D expenditures or high debt companies or service companies or those with negative earnings 

In any case  the P B is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision 

The Winning ScreenPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain 

Price to Sales less than X Industry Median   The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive 

Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better 

PEG less than 1   PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher

153780,375296,XRX,Clean Harbors Grows Inorganically Despite Economic Woes ,opinion,"On Sep 9  Zacks Investment Research updated the research report on waste management services provider Clean Harbors  Inc    NYSE CLH   
Headquartered in Massachusetts  Clean Harbors is a chief provider of environmental  energy and industrial services in North America  The company serves a wide array of customers  including Fortune 500 companies and government agencies  It provides a number of services such as end to end hazardous waste management  emergency spill response  industrial cleaning and maintenance  and recycling services 
After the acquisition of Safety Kleen  Inc  in Dec 2012  Clean Harbors became the largest re refiner and recycler of used oil in the world and the largest provider of parts cleaning and environmental services to commercial  industrial and automotive customers in North America  The company is currently concentrating on making strategic acquisitions to expand its business in the oil collection and refinery markets  Expansion of the existing services portfolio  especially in non disposal services  is expected to generate incremental revenues in the future 
During the last reported quarter  the company completed a series of six acquisitions totaling approximately  175 million  The transactions augmented its presence on the West Coast and supported its North American renewable lubricants program  This included terminals  re refineries  waste oil collection and blending packaging capabilities  which are critical components to the success of the  closed loop  initiative The company also plans to divest a subsidiary in the Industrial Services group for approximately  50 million  This non core business generated approximately  55 million in revenues in 2015 
However  decline in fuel prices and new policies are rapidly transforming the American energy sector  while escalating wars in the Middle East and a nuclear deal with Iran are clouding the global oil picture  The company s exploration  drilling activity and production are largely dependent on the operation of oil rigs  as well as global and North American oil prices  The recent oil price instability and future price uncertainties have resulted in lower activity levels which are negatively impacting the company s business 
In addition  Clean Harbors  demand cycle is highly seasonal  The company s first quarter sees a decrease in demand for environmental services owing to the frigid weather  mainly in the Northern and Midwestern U S  and Canada  As a result  reduction in volumes of waste and higher costs associated with operating in sub zero temperatures with high levels of snowfall impair the smooth functioning of the business  However  during the first quarter of every year  demand in Industrial and Field Services and Oil and Gas Field Services segments increases in Canada due to the cold weather  while it falls during the warmer months  This is because areas in which the company provides its services are easier to access during winter months when the cold conditions make the terrain more suitable for the deployment of equipment  During the warmer months  thawing and muddy conditions hamper this process  The seasonal variations reduce the predictability of income and impair the company s earnings 
Clean Harbors is also highly exposed to foreign exchange rate risks  The primary exposure relates to operating expenses in Canada  where a large number of the company s manufacturing facilities are located 
Clean Harbors currently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the same space include InnerWorkings Inc    NASDAQ INWK    RPX Corporation   NASDAQ RPXC   and Xerox Corporation   NYSE XRX    All three stocks hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  You can see

153781,375297,XRX,4 Low P CF Stocks To Add More Value To Your Investment,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest considering Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening Vishay Intertechnology Inc    NYSE VSH    the manufacturer

153784,375300,XRX,5 Rock Solid Dividend Stocks To Buy On New Fed Outlook,opinion,"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  and the Federal Reserve chairwoman  Janet Yellen has been rightly following the saying  as she and her policy making committee voted to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at least for the time being 
However  the policy makers hinted that the tightening of monetary policy is still in the cards and signaled a likely rate hike before the end of the year  This points to a steady and meticulous approach  after factoring in all the economic indicators 
So  the federal funds rate is left untouched at 0 25  to 0 50  for now  providing the stock market with the much needed impetus  The major indices ended trading in the green yesterday  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 163 74 points or 0 90  to 18 293 70  while Nasdaq Composite rose 53 83 points or 1 03  to 5 295 18  The S P 500 advanced 23 36 points or 1 09  to 2 163 12 
The Fed still remains cautiously optimistic about the U S  economy and as the situation improves worldwide  the U S  will be ready to lead the squad  The economy is not in bad shape as some of the risk averse investors perceive  The employment picture is good enough and economic activity is gradually picking steam  However  the Fed pointed out that business investment remains sluggish and inflation level is still far below the desired level of 2  
What Influenced the Fed s Decision 
The tussle among the Fed members ended yesterday  after they unanimously agreed not to go for a rate hike  Industry experts believe if all goes well with the economy and in line with the Fed s objectives  the rate hike might occur in December  They deny the chances of a hike in November due to the Presidential election 
Definitely  the Fed will decide its course of action only after taking the global as well as domestic economic climate into account  Let s see what factors played a role in shaping the Fed s final decision 
The U S  stock market displayed a sluggish performance at the start of the year owing to fears of overseas turmoil and plunging oil prices  But since then the market has recouped much of the losses  The economy navigated brazenly through the rough tide caused by the sluggishness witnessed in emerging markets such as China and Brazil  and fears of challenging economic political conditions in Europe post Brexit  Further  the recent rebound in oil prices  higher consumer confidence  lower unemployment rate and a gradual improvement in the housing market signaled that the economy is gaining momentum 
However  the sentiment boosted by the aforementioned factors was toned down when soft retail sales date surfaced  U S  retail sales in August declined 0 3   marking the first drop since March  The dismal sales report came on the heels of soft job addition and contraction in the manufacturing and service sectors witnessed last month 
Cumulatively  these influenced the Fed s decision to hold off on increasing interest rates  The Fed now anticipates the U S  economy to expand at a pace of 1 8  this year  marginally lower than 2  projected earlier  and by 2  in both 2017 and 2018 
Where to Bet Your Bucks  
Well  following the outcome of the Fed s meeting  the clouds of ambiguity have drifted away and the economic scenario is much apparent now  However  the question that still lingers is where to bet your bucks  On that note  while building a portfolio  one should consider stocks with a high dividend yield  Investors prefer an income generating stock  and therefore a dividend paying stock is always a preferable option 
John Davison Rockefeller once said   Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure  It s to see my dividends coming in   People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to be inclined toward those companies that have a track of consistent and incremental dividend payments  They are safer bets  particularly in a low rate environment  as they provide a cushion during economic uncertainties 
5 Rock Solid Stocks with Great Dividend Yields
We have picked five stocks that hold promise  Not only do they carry a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  but also have a dividend yield of 3  or greater  and a  of  A  or  B  
Packaging Corporation of America   NYSE PKG    a manufacturer and seller of containerboard and corrugated packaging products  is a solid bet  The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank  1 and has a long term earnings growth rate of 11 5   The company has a dividend yield of 3 1  with a VGM score of  B  
Investors can also count on Outerwall Inc    NASDAQ OUTR    which provides automated retail solutions  The company has a dividend yield of 4 6  with a VGM score of  A   The stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 10  with a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
We also suggest investing in Xerox Corporation   NYSE XRX    which carries a Zacks Rank  2 and a long term earnings growth rate of 10   This provider of business process and document management solutions worldwide has a dividend yield of 3 1  with a VGM score of  A  
Another stock that investors may look forward to is L Brands  Inc    NYSE LB    holding a Zacks Rank  2 with a long term earnings growth rate of 11 3   This specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products has a dividend yield of 3 3  with a VGM score of  B  
Last but not the least is Macy s  Inc    NYSE M    an omnichannel retail company operating stores  websites and mobile applications  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and a long term earnings growth rate of 8 5   It has a dividend yield of 4 2  with a VGM score of  A  
Final Verdict
A dividend is a distribution of part of the company s earnings  given to its stockholders either on a quarterly basis or semi annually or annually  The willingness and ability on the part of the company to pay dividends regularly and increase the same from time to time sends a loud message about its soundness  prospects and performance as well as its underlying fundamentals  These together form the base of our investment strategy  Definitely  do not forget to use the  to find other stocks with a winning combination

Factors at Play
Lexmark s first quarter results were not very encouraging  given the earnings miss  Also  both earnings and revenues decreased on a year over year basis primarily due to a strong U S  dollar  a decline in non MPS revenues  and the ongoing exit of the company from the Inkjet business 
Although Lexmark has a strong market position  reduced demand for traditional printing hardware and overall macroeconomic uncertainties have been dampening demand 
Also  synergies from the acquisitions of Kofax and Readsoft and renewed focus on the software space could set it back on the growth path  Moreover  the Inkjet exit  software prospects and the MPS approach are positives that will drive shares in the to be reported quarter 
However  competition from players like Canon Inc   Xerox Corp  NYSE XRX   and HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   is a concern LEXMARK INTL Price and EPS Surprise
    
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lexmark will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 82 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  Lexmark s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Key Factors in the Second Quarter
In the soon to be reported quarter  Xerox continued to work on streamlining its business by selling its Information Technology Outsourcing unit and restructuring its government healthcare business  Additionally  under the Document Technology segment  Xerox introduced nine new products  reconfirming its position as the leader in market innovation 
The company also unveiled the names of the companies to be formed following its split into two publicly traded entities  Its Business Process Outsourcing  BPO  firm would be renamed  Conduent Inc   while its Document Technology  DT  division would retain the Xerox brand name 
Xerox is focused on reprioritizing its investments and accelerating restructuring actions to improve revenue and margin  As part of the restructuring  Xerox has decided to execute a three year strategic transformation program which will target incremental savings of  600 million across all segments 
When combined with savings from cost streamlining actions currently in process  Xerox is  aiming to realize cumulative cost reduction of  2 4 billion over three years   Xerox also remains committed to its five plank strategy that is centered on portfolio management  global growth  cost transformation  operational excellence and analytics 
Meanwhile  the company announced the availability of its Dokmee Capture Scanner software integrated in its DocuMate Scanners  allowing office workers to directly export scanned or digital files to Xerox DocuShare 7  an enterprise content management platform  The combination efficiently converts a large backlog of files into business intelligence  This launch is likely to give a boost to the company s top line growth 
However  Xerox is expected to feel some impact of the Brexit fallout as 5  of its total revenue reportedly comes from the U K  However  Xerox has no manufacturing facilities in the UK as the last remnants of research  development  and engineering  RD E  were outsourced a couple of years back  Brexit could result in higher tariff and non tariff barriers for trade between the U K  and the European Union  Considering the trade relations Xerox has with the U K   this could lower the productivity of the company 
In addition  continuing appreciation of the U S  dollar with respect to other currencies might weigh on Xerox s international revenues and margins  The company garners a major portion of its aggregate revenues from Japan  and thus the currency headwind is likely to have a significant impact on upcoming results 
Alongside  Xerox has been grappling with slow demand in its printing business for years  while its attempts to leverage the business process outsourcing market failed to lend growth momentum to the company s operations  The company also endured a number of slip ups in its Medicare and Medicare information services for several government agencies across the U S XEROX CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xerox is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here 
Zacks ESP  Xerox has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   as the Most Accurate estimate is in sync with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents

153841,375357,XRX,How Xerox  XRX  Will Survive The Brexit Carnage  revised ,opinion,"As global equity markets went in a tizzy with the U K s shocking decision to exit the European Union or Brexit  various U S  companies from diverse sectors also felt the ripple effect  Although the Brexit referendum is not legally binding and offers a likely two year window for the entire process to be completed  it has certainly created a wave of uncertainty among investors Exposure of U S  Firms in the U K 
Several U S companies have a lot of exposure to the U K  market  which they use as a base to reach out to the larger continent  These companies mostly prefer the U K  cities like London and Birmingham to Paris  Frankfurt  Berlin  Amsterdam and others for establishing a European footprint  About one third of the sales of these firms in the European continent are reportedly eked out through their British counterparts  which usually tend to be their regional headquarters   
The companies in the benchmark S P 500 index draw average revenue of 2 9  from the U K  Some top firms in the list include the transportation services firm Penske Automotive Group  Inc      which generate 33 4  from the U K   automobile major Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co     with 18 8  and e commerce retailer eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY      with 16 3   For these companies  operating costs are likely to escalate as they restructure their resources to maintain access to both the European Union and Britain  Currency conversion will likely add to the woes as the news has led to a freefall in pound to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985 at around  1 3407 Impact on Xerox
According to research firm Factset  the sectors that are expected to be the biggest casualties based on their revenue exposure to the U K   are energy  information technology and materials with respective exposures of 6 4   4  and 3 7  
With 5  of the total revenue coming from the U K   information technology services provider Xerox Corporation  NYSE XRX     is expected to be a high profile victim of the Brexit fallout  Xerox has a significant number of manufacturing and engineering facilities in the U K  The company has also high pension obligations in the U K  Pension Plan for salaried employees 
The revamped market dynamics are expected to affect many U S  firms like Xerox that import or export from the U K  They are likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members  Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non tariff barriers to trade between the U K  and the European Union  lowering productivity of the company Adding to the Woes
Xerox has been grappling with slow demand in its printing business for years  while its attempts to leverage the business process outsourcing market also failed to lend growth momentum  The company also endured a number of slip ups in its Medicare and Medicare information services for several government agencies across the U S 
In 2015  the company conducted a review of structural options for its portfolio and capital allocation  On the basis of this review  the company decided to split into two independent  publicly traded entities in the first quarter of 2016  The process is expected to be completed by the end of 2016  The separation will see Xerox segregating its hardware operations and its services business  While one would comprise Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses  the other its Business Process Outsourcing  BPO  business  Both these entities would likely feature among the Fortune 500 companies and will be leaders in their respective markets 
With a strategic focus on various markets  Xerox expects to capitalize on the unique strengths of its Document Technology and BPO businesses and capture the value creation opportunities post split  As part of the restructuring  Xerox has decided to execute a three year strategic transformation program to improve its productivity and reduce costs across the businesses

U K  vote shocks world  markets in Europe and Asia plunge
European equities finished deep in the red  after the U K  s stunning vote to leave the European Union  EU  known as a Brexit after four decades sent shockwaves through the global markets a complete about face from yesterday s optimism that the U K  would vote to remain in the EU  The final vote tally was 52  for an exit  48  against a close election  as many had expected  however not the outcome that investors had banked on yesterday  In the wake of the results  Prime Minister David Cameron stepped down  saying   The British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path  and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership   Cameron said he will remain at 10 Downing Street for the next three months  with a new Conservative leader to be appointed by October 
Financials were in the eye of the storm  with the European bank index falling the most ever  while the British pound tumbled to touch a level not seen in over 30 years  Amidst the turmoil  and following Cameron s announcement  Bank of England  BoE  Governor Carney issued an early morning statement  saying the BoE will pledge 250 billion pounds   345 billion  to the financial system in what he called   a period of uncertainty and adjustment   The BoE had previously supplemented funding auctions this month for lenders  Meanwhile  central banks across the globe have shifted to crisis management mode  as the Swiss National Bank intervened in order to prevent a surge in the franc  the European Central Bank  ECB  said it stands ready to provide liquidity in euros or other currencies  and Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda said the central bank will do its best to provide cash 
Economic news in the region took a backseat to the developments surrounding the Brexit  with France s final GDP data unrevised from previous reports  Italy s retail sales rising less than expectations and Germany s Ifo Business Climate Index was slightly better than forecasts  The euro pared solid early losses  but did finish firmly lower versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were negative 
Stocks in Asia finished sharply lower  being the first to react to the decision by the U K  to quit the European Union  with Japanese equities posting their largest decline in more than 15 years  and triggering a circuit breaker on Nikkei futures  Japan s Nikkei 225 Index tumbled 7 9   with the yen surging against its foreign counterparts  Stocks in mainland China lost ground  but were somewhat insulated from the fray after policymakers in the nation championed their management of corporate debt  saying that defaults would not pose a systemic threat as long as the economy continues to be within an acceptable range  Meanwhile  securities trading in Hong Kong snapped a five session winning streak  while equities in Australia  India and South Korea were sharply lower 
The U K  has left the building
Stocks finished lower for the week as gains were wiped out early Friday morning on the heels of the U K  s highly anticipated vote  where it decided it will exit the European Union  Britain shocked the financial community and global equity markets plunged as traders searched for perceived safety in the midst of uncertainty  Since the end of the financial crisis induced global recession in 2009  a series of shocks have helped to keep growth  inflation and stock market performance subdued  The shocks that have taken place in Japan  United States  and Europe may offer us some insight as to the potential duration of the market impact of Brexit 
The added uncertainty from the long awaited Brexit vote seemed to disproportionately increase the volatility in the financials sector  The Financials sector has been under attack by politicians and unloved by investors since the financial crisis  resulting in some very volatile performance  He also hints at the heavy regulatory burden placed on the financials sector over the past several years  But there are some glimmers of hope here as well  Despite the heated political rhetoric being leveled against the financials sector  there does seem to be an increasing realization that the regulations may have gone too far and had unintended consequences

JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  
Financials   Diversified Financial Services
JPMorgan is the biggest of the retail banks in terms of assets under management  Its large assets base and robust balance sheet have left the company vulnerable in the event of another crisis  The company came under intense scrutiny in April after failing to pass the living will standards which are set so that the government will never have to bail out banks again  JPMorgan was one of 5 big banks that would not have access to enough capital in the event of a new crisis  If the Brexit materializes into anything more severe  as many experts suspect it will  then the big banks will be in trouble  Already we have seen fall out from the world s largest financial institutions which could very well continue given low interest rates and increasing currency headwinds 
Regardless  JPM has exceeded earnings expectations in 4 of the last 5 quarters and is typically viewed as one of the better performing financial institutions  Last quarter  the company featured increases in consumer banking and asset management sectors  Net interest income increased as well  despite rates staying close to zero during the period  However  significant declines were seen in commercial and investment banking sectors  Overall net income and revenue were down on a yearly basis with a high likelihood of continuing through the remainder of fiscal 2016  The Estimize community is just as pessimistic on Chase s growth prospects in Q2  The consensus data is looking for earnings per share of  1 42 on  23 76 billion  an 8  decline on the bottom line and 3  on the top

Ford Motors is perhaps the most iconic automaker in American history  It was started by Henry Ford on the premise that the assembly line could create an affordable car for consumers  The concept not only revolutionized the automobile industry but influenced significant changes in all of manufacturing  It hasn t been all smooth sailing for Ford  though  and after the bailout in 2008 it took the company nearly 7 years to bounce back  Last year was one of the best in recent history as Ford reported double digit bottom line gains and high single digit revenue growth in each quarter  Unfortunately its gains might be short lived  Amongst the American automakers  Ford has the biggest presence in the United Kingdom and will be hit the hardest from the Brexit  The stock is down 10  since the announcement and if forward guidance indicates this is a bigger problem shares could tumble further  Ford  along with Ebay and Xerox  are amongst the most vulnerable companies when it comes to the Brexit decision  This quarter  the Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 62 cents on  36 81 billion   26  higher on the bottom line and a 1  decline on the top  Ford stock  like GM  has struggled to make gains despite a recent surge in earnings

Xerox has had a rough 2016 so far  Earlier this year the company announced its intent to split into 2 publicly traded companies to become leaner and more efficient  The first company will focus on its core document services and other will primarily deal with its business processes and consulting services  Around the same time Carl Icahn took a stake in the company  placing himself on the board with the intent to push a new strategy  The stock has not reacted well to that news and is down 15  since the start of the year  With the news of Brexit  shares have dropped 10  with a high probability of falling further  Xerox is one of the high profile losers from the Brexit fallout  The company generates about 5  of its total revenue from the U K   which doesn t sound like much  but with slowing demand in the printer business lately  Xerox can t afford anymore problems  Major foreign currencies currently comprise 24  of its total consolidated revenue and they way things are going  this portion of Xerox s business should be largely impacted

153845,375361,XRX,Xerox To Lay Off 95 Orlando Employees  Brexit Risks Loom  revised ,opinion,"Information technology services provider Xerox Corporation  NYSE XRX     recently revealed its plans to lay off 95 employees in its healthcare division in Orlando  Although the company did not divulge the reason behind the strategic decision  it refused to attribute the lay offs to its split into two independent entities 
The affected employees are part of the Xerox State Healthcare LLC unit in Orlando  This Xerox subsidiary offers healthcare program administration services and administers Medicaid  state children s health insurance programs  long term care programs  and pharmacy benefits management programs  It also offers care coordination and management services along with health information analysis and fraud and abuse protection services Corporate Statement
In a statement issued by the company  the affected employees were encouraged to seek possible employment opportunities in other business divisions  The statement read   Unfortunately  due to a business decision of a single client  we are making the necessary yet difficult decision to reduce our workforce   We realize this affects individuals and every effort is being made to ensure that all employees are treated fairly  
Such unfortunate yet bold decisions seemed to be the call of the hour as the company aimed to improve its revenues and lower the operating costs Grappling with Challenges
Xerox has been grappling with slow demand in its printing business for years  while its attempts to leverage the business process outsourcing market also failed to lend growth momentum  The company also endured a number of slip ups in its Medicare and Medicare information services for several government agencies across the U S 
In 2015  the company conducted a review of structural options for its portfolio and capital allocation  On the basis of this review  it decided to split into two independent  publicly traded entities in the first quarter of 2016  The process is expected to be completed by the end of 2016  The separation will see Xerox segregating its hardware operations and its services business  While one would comprise the Document Technology and Document Outsourcing business  the other its Business Process Outsourcing  BPO  business  Both these entities would likely feature among the Fortune 500 companies and will be leaders in their respective markets 
With a strategic focus on various markets  Xerox expects to capitalize on the unique strengths of its Document Technology and BPO businesses and capture the value creation opportunities  post split  As part of the restructuring  Xerox has decided to execute a three year strategic transformation program to improve its productivity and reduce costs across the businesses Impact from Brexit
Despite the prudent efforts  Xerox is expected to feel some impact of the Brexit fallout as 5  of its total revenue reportedly comes from the U K  Further  Xerox has a significant number of manufacturing and engineering facilities in the U K  The company has also high pension obligations in the U K  Pension Plan for salaried employees 
The revamped market dynamics from the Brexit referendum are expected to affect Xerox that has a significant trade relationship with the U K  The company is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members  Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non tariff barriers to trade between the U K  and the European Union  lowering productivity of the company

It s Friday and also the last trading day of the month 
For the week  the Dow gained 2 3   the S P added 1 7  and the Nasdaq increased 0 5  That left the Dow down 5 5  for the month  or a loss of 959 points  The Nasdaq lost 7 9   or 394 points in January  its largest monthly loss since May 2010 
The S P was down 103 points  or 5   although at one point last week the S P was down 11  since the start of the year 
An index of US Treasury bonds returned 1 8  for January  which has been the best month of the year for bonds  at least over the past few years  The yield on the 10 year note dropped 24 basis points for the month 
Gold and silver shared the safe haven spotlight with Treasuries  Gold gain  58 60  or 6  for the month  Silver added 53 cents or 3 8   year to date 
The dollar has gained just over 1  year to date  but is still below November highs Even with today s gain  oil closed out the month of January with a loss of  3 37 or 9  
The U S  economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter  Gross domestic product rose at a 0 7  annualized rate in the three months ended in December after a 2  gain in the third quarter  GDP expanded 2 4  for a second straight year  led by the biggest gain in consumer spending in a decade 
Household purchases rose at a 2 2  annualized pace in the fourth quarter  down from 3  in the third quarter  so consumer spending slowed in the quarter  but businesses saw big cuts in spending 
Business investment decreased at a 1 8  annualized rate  the first drop since the third quarter of 2012 and compared with a 2 6  pace in the third quarter  Businesses cut spending on stockpiles to try to pare unwanted inventories  That effort trimmed growth by 0 5 percentage point in the fourth quarter  Home construction grew at a solid 8 1  annual rate 
Separately  the Labor Department reports wages and salaries rose 0 6  in the fourth quarter   the same pace as in the previous three months  indicating gradual tightening in the labor market has yet to put pressure on employers to boost pay  Wages of all employees  including government workers  advanced 2 1  from the same period in 2014 
The Bank of Japan said that it would adopt a negative interest rate policy for the first time  in an attempt to kick start the world s number three economy  The central bank said it cut the deposit rate it pays on cash parked at the BOJ by commercial banks in excess of legally required reserves  to minus 0 1  from the previous plus 0 1   The goal was to push down borrowing costs across a broad time spectrum to stimulate inflation Just one week ago  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was not thinking of adopting a negative interest rate policy now  signaling that any further monetary easing will likely take the form of an expansion of its current massive asset buying program  So  this really was shocking news for global markets 
The yen tumbled after the announcement  The benchmark Topix index closed 2 9  higher  Money is pouring into bonds all over the world  pushing yields lower  Germany s 10 year yield is off 6 bps at 0 33   making for the lowest reading in nine months  and yielding about the same as a US 3 month note 
Now  these negative rates in Japan are not being applied at the retail level  this is directed at the banks  and the reserves held by banks with the central bank  But if the negative rates last long enough  it could work to the consumer level  For now  the idea is to nudge banks to make loans and circulate money through the economy  with a little punishment for banks that hoard the cash 
In theory  interest rates below zero should reduce borrowing costs for companies and households  driving demand for loans  In practice  there s a risk that the policy might do more harm than good  If banks make more customers pay to hold their money  cash may go under the mattress instead  We have seen negative rates over the past year or so in the Eurozone  and Sweden  Denmark and Switzerland 
We don t really know yet how it will play out  and we don t have historic data to guide us  This time it really is different  We ve heard that before  but it is true this time  For the Eurozone and now for Japan  rates are at the lowest levels in at least 500 years   and  yes  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  did look that far back in sovereign debt records 
So what do negative interest rates tell us about the global economy  We appear to be in a long term low growth and low inflation environment  Perhaps the central bankers  including the Fed  need to re think their ideas about acceptable levels of inflation  perhaps a 2  rate of inflation is too low  Today s action by the Bank of Japan will almost certainly influence the Fed s thinking on future interest rate hikes  At the very least it should lead to discussion of how monetary and fiscal policy is conducted and coordinated on a global scale 
And for investors  we need to consider whether the US economy really is so much stronger than our global business partners  and we should also consider the spread between global and international rates and the spread between US long term and short term Treasuries  it is flattening  and you know that s not good   also the impact of negative interest rates on a variety of asset classes  including equities  currencies  and commodities 
Oil prices started the session with big gains but pared losses throughout the day as the dollar index gained more than 1   It proved near impossible to prop up oil on the notion of a Russia OPEC deal to cut production  The Wall Street Journal reported that an Iranian oil official said the country would not join an immediate OPEC production cut  The paper said Iran wants to boost crude exports by 1 5 million barrels a day  Baker Hughes reports energy firms in the US cut oil rigs for the sixth straight week and were expected to shed more 
Puerto Rico plans to propose a debt exchange to investors  offering to swap existing bonds for two new types of securities to help the U S  commonwealth alleviate its debt burden  Both classes of debt would delay payments  giving the island time to make fiscal adjustments and spur economic growth  One would eventually pay interest at 5   while the other would carry a value determined by Puerto Rico s fiscal health

Xerox  N XRX  said it would split into two companies  one holding its legacy hardware operations and the other its business process outsourcing unit  in which activist investor Carl Icahn will get three board seats  The company  whose shares had fallen more than 30  in the past 12 months  has been trying to turn itself around by focusing on software and services as businesses cut costs and a switch to mobile devices hits demand for printers

Chevron  N CVX  reported its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years on Friday as the oil producer struggled to cope with plunging crude prices that are eroding profitability across all its divisions  The company posted a fourth quarter net loss of  588 million  or 31 cents per share  compared with a net profit of  3 47 billion  or  1 85 per share  in the year ago period  The last time Chevron posted a quarterly loss was the third quarter of 2002  Chevron last month announced it would cut its 2016 budget by 24  to  26 billion

Stocks traded higher on light volume on Tuesday with the S P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average charting fresh closing highs  Momentum continues to show signs of waning as the abrupt rebound rally from the October low appears to be reaching a short term peak  Hints of a short term high are becoming apparent as the 20 day moving average pushes above the 50 day in a bullish cross formation  often perceived as a positive sign for the intermediate trend  using these short term crossovers as buy or sell triggers can often realize unfavourable results  A bearish crossover of the 20 and 50 day moving averages was recorded on October 10th  just three sessions prior to the low for the month  suggesting it would have been better used as a signal to buy the S P 500 rather than selling it  The opposite scenario may become apparent now that a bullish crossover has been realized 

Despite the unprecedented rebound in equity prices over the last few weeks  the Volatility Index  VIX   a gauge of fear and uncertainty in the equity market  continues on a positive path  The rising trendline stretching from the summer lows remains intact  the 50 day moving average of the  fear  indicator remains at the highest level since the start of 2013  The benchmark is also testing longer term support around 12  What this index is telling is very much open to interpretation  however  it is interesting to note that the previous instance of a rising multi month trend of at least five months in length  characterized by higher highs and higher lows over an intermediate timescale  was back in 2007  just as the equity market was continuing a trend of higher highs and higher lows  Of course we now know that this was the first sign of destabilization prior to the ultimate peak in the market later that year    It is certainly premature to imply anything as extreme as the decline realized back in 2008 2009  however  at current prices in the equity market  the risks are starting to outweigh the potential reward over the near term  suggesting better levels to buy may be around the corner 

And finally for today  Sugar prices soared on Tuesday on news that production in Brazil fell sharply as mills shut for the season    The price of the commodity has been in a decline since the start of 2011  but evidence is starting to amount that a significant low has been reached  For most of this year  the price of sugar has been trading above a declining trendline that constrained trading activity for the past few years  Sugar has also tested double bottom support at 13 cents per pound  Price has very recently tested support at a now rising 50 day moving average  suggesting intermediate term strength  momentum indicators are beginning to curl higher  Sugar just entered a period of seasonal strength that runs through the end of the year  benefiting from the seasonal decline in production and the pickup in demand surrounding the holiday season  Look for a move above resistance at 17 2 cents to confirm the start of a new leg higher within the period of seasonal strength 



Sentiment on Tuesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended close to neutral at 0 99

153949,375465,XRX,Thin Film Electronics  Licensing Partner Disclosed As Xerox ,opinion,"Thin Film has announced the licensing agreement it signed at the end of December with a Fortune 250 company is with Xerox  NYSE XRX   Through its wholly owned subsidiary PARC  Xerox has an existing relationship with Thinfilm  which should make the transfer of knowledge swifter and the likelihood of success greater than if it were with a completely new partner  It also has an extensive network of suppliers  customers  distribution channels and production facilities that should help Thinfilm s printed memory products reach scale quickly 

As we described in our January update note  the licensing agreement is a key step in the scale up of Thinfilm s revenue  In our opinion Xerox is a good partner for the first licensing agreement as it has a history of innovation and has experience working with Thinfilm through its subsidiary PARC  which is also a minority shareholder  estimated  1   in Thinfilm  It is therefore more likely that Xerox will have the technical expertise  willingness and determination necessary to make an innovative product such as Thinfilm Memory a success  Xerox will be modifying a production line in one of its existing facilities in New York State  which may mean the time for scale up is towards the closer end of the 12 14 month period estimated in our update note  The detailed terms of the licensing agreement such as expected scale of production and royalty rate are now the key sensitivities to the share valuation  This will only start to become clear once larger scale production is reached  which we expect in FY16

153950,375466,XRX,Crude Oil  Trouble For Some  Opportunity For Others,opinion,"In 2008  Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway bought a large stake in ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  at a time when oil prices were climbing past  100 a barrel  When oil topped out at  146 and then dropped  eventually to just over  32 a barrel  Buffett sold his COP shares  losing billions  but getting out   He called it one of his biggest 
In 2013  Buffett went back in the oil business with an even larger stake in Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   While the price of crude oil has plummeted  though not as much as in  09   Exxon shares have held remarkably firm so far  They may fit Buffett s criteria for long term value and quality management  but like all energy companies this quarter  it s losing money and so is Buffett  That hasn t stopped him from holding a stock before and we may well see him doubling down in the months to come 
Buffett s advantage is that while falling oil prices hurt his Exxon Mobil holdings  Berkshire also owns stock in Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   NetJets  a major car dealer network  and of course  the largest auto insurer  GEICO  Cheap gas means cheaper shipping costs  cheaper jet fuel  and more people driving  It s a case study in smart diversification for value investors 
Others are not so well hedged and are getting out of the oil business  In an ironic twist  the Rockefeller Brothers Fund  a large philanthropic trust  is divesting itself of fossil fuel investments   The fund  of course  started with money from Standard Oil  the parent of Exxon and Mobil  They announced the divestment last September  when oil was still  100 a barrel  and it was widely reported that the move was to stop investing in a major cause of global warming  But the timing couldn t have been better 
Others with more financial than environmental motives still paid attention to the trend and got out  Danny and I were talking about  50 a barrel back in September  Our friend Jeff Hirsch of Stock Trader s Almanac called for  40 75 towards the end of 2014  Plenty of people called it and gave good reasons  Bloomberg said yesterday   The crash caught investors and lenders by surprise   and gives the example of Energy XXI  an investment firm that sold way too many bonds that would only make money if oil kept gaining  and is now  4 billion in debt  Serves them right  That s not investing  it s gambling  Badly 
But some professionals in the energy  no longer fossil fuel  business are smarter  A college buddy of mine  Gerard  runs an oil and gas services company  I asked him if he s hedged with crude oil puts now that the fields are shutting down  He said no   We just save up in the good times and ride out the bad   He s survived and thrived for two decades that way  And he s mentally preparing for when solar takes over 
That s why long term  I think the oil crash is an opportunity and a help to the rest of the economy   It s not even as big a crash as 2009   Short term  I sympathize with those who depend on oil prices and even those who closed their eyes for six months and got  caught by surprise   But that s why we have put options  Or like my buddy  careful planning and guts

The S P finds support  Will it hold 

Our View 
After a nearly 20 point drop before and at yesterday s open  the S P futures  ESH15 CME  found support and rallied nearly 40 points to close up 27 00 at 2018 50  In Globex overnight it dropped and retested a support trendline at 2001  just above the psychological support of the big round number 
Volume was heavier than it has been  with the bulk of the trading coming during yesterday s early decline  With the number of short sellers who hammered away at the downside yesterday  only to get caught and then pulled into their buy stops  we see the possibility of a turn back upwards  But it won t be pretty 
We expect a retest of the 1990 level and possibly 1987  If it continues below that  expect a new low  But after that  we may see the return of the Late Friday Rip to the upside  The pickup in volume suggests that funds are making some end of month decisions  and we suspect most of those decisions are to buy 
Sell the early rallies  watch for support but don t be hasty  then buy weakness  But even if we do get another lovely 40 point run up  we suggest you take it in pieces rather than holding through the drawdowns 
As always  please use protective buy and sell stops when trading futures and options

153951,375467,XRX,Thin Film Electronics ,opinion,"Substantial orders now the key catalystThin Film s  OSLO THIN  launch of its OpenSense platform has been the key event of the quarter and the company is now firmly focused on sales of its three key product lines EAS  OpenSense and Smart Labels  Revenue is still predominantly driven by technology access and development fees and we therefore view the commercial milestones   such as the licensing agreement with Xerox  NYSE XRX   launch of OpenSense  and demonstration of a  smart bottle  in partnership with Diageo  LONDON DGE    as the key measures of progress  Announcements of substantial new product orders are now the key catalysts for growth

153974,375490,XRX,U S  officials seek business help to sell Pacific trade pact ,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  officials and lawmakers urged business leaders on Thursday to get behind a Pacific trade pact as they vowed an all out effort next year to get the deal through the U S  Congress  Negotiators from 12 countries sealed the Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact  a key plank of U S  President Barack Obama s outreach to Asia  in October  but it has so far won a mixed reception in Congress  Senior White House officials told a gathering of top CEOs who advise Obama on trade that they planned an all out push next year for the TPP  mirroring a campaign for key trade legislation this year  That took six weeks to clear Congress and passed the House of Representatives on a 218 208 vote   Trade votes are always hard  this is going to be a tough battle   U S  Trade Representative Michael Froman told a meeting of the President s Export Council  adding that lawmakers needed to see the concrete benefits for workers and firms at home   We look forward to working with you in that regard   Although the deal has won backing from some industry groups and companies including Metlife  N MET  and Cargill  CARG UL   major business groups  including the U S  Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers  have yet to declare a final verdict on the TPP   Pharmaceutical firms are unhappy with monopoly periods for some drugs  carmaker Ford  N F  laments a lack of sanctions for currency manipulation and financial services firms are unhappy that they are excluded from a ban on countries forcing firms to store data locally  Republican lawmaker Dave Reichert said an exemption allowing TPP members to shield anti smoking measures from lawsuits by foreign investors would lose around 15 Republican votes  and trade advocates would have to woo new supporters   Your input  your visitations with a variety of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will be absolutely critical   he said   Still  executives at the meeting  including UPS  N UPS  CEO David Abney  backed the deal and export council chair Ursula Burns  the CEO of  Xerox Corp   N XRX   said the business community was generally supportive   I think that you will find that members with more representation in the service economy  high tech innovation economy  services and goods as well do support it   she told reporters later

153976,375492,XRX,2 Cheap Dividend Growing Refiners,opinion,"Back in May  I uncovered two dirt cheap dividend growers in the technology sector  NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  and Xerox  NYSE XRX  
Since my article on these tech gems  the stocks have logged total returns of 15 7  and 13 4   respectively  Meanwhile  the S P 500 is up only 5 7  over the same time frame 
It seems as though the market is starting to appreciate just how attractively valued these two stocks have become 
But that analysis wasn t just a one off exercise  We can apply the same methodology to other sectors and industries  as well 
It just so happens that there are two companies within the energy sector that look fantastic based on the same metrics  and they can even help you profit from persistently high gasoline prices 
Here s how 
Refining Margins
The fuel that winds up in your gas tank has been transformed to make it suitable for combustion 
Refiners take the thick  black crude oil extracted from the Earth s crust and process it into petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel fuel 
Ultimately  if refiners can find cheap crude and turn it into expensive gasoline  then they can be very profitable 
And this is exactly what s been happening 
The price of retail gasoline in the United States is actually priced off of Brent Crude  the international oil standard   and not West Texas Intermediate  WTI   the U S  oil standard  Brent is currently trading around  102 a barrel  and WTI is approximately  93 
Needless to say  this spread between Brent and WTI represents more opportunity for refiners 
This spread may persist  too 
Burgeoning oil production from the Bakken formation in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford formation in Texas has kept a lid on WTI due to increased supply   thus driving a wedge between the two crude oil benchmarks 
Interestingly  zero new refineries have been built since the 1970s  Instead  technological advancement has been required to increase supply to meet increasing petroleum demand 
Indeed  robust foreign demand has been a boon for the U S  refining industry  The chart below shows the skyrocketing volume of U S  finished petroleum exports 

The macro picture certainly has been positive for refining businesses  But instead of charging into the industry head on  let s stack the odds in our favor a bit more 
Refined Value
The profit opportunities I ve discussed are perhaps most clearly evident in the rapidly rising dividend payouts at Valero Energy  NYSE VLO  and Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  

They may not have outsized dividend yields  but these two companies are growing their dividends very quickly  Remember  fast dividend growers tend to outperform 
Companies with low enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratios also tend to outperform the market  Based on this golden ratio  both MPC and VLO have insanely cheap total valuations 
Perhaps these refiners are inexpensively valued because the market is fearful the crude oil export ban will be lifted  collapsing the Brent WTI spread and crimping refining margins 
This is actually refreshing because far too many companies in this market are priced to perfection  In our current environment  it s rare to find stock prices that actually reflect some type of serious risk  or should I say any type of risk 
Low EV EBITDA ratios also mean these companies aren t overly leveraged  The combination of low valuations and reasonable debt levels paves the way for capital efficient stock buybacks 
Marathon Petroleum has been very aggressive in buying back shares over the past year  This has reduced its float by over 10  and given the stock a stellar   net buyback percent plus dividend yield  
Far too many companies that are priced to perfection are also conducting buybacks  but that s not something you have to worry about with either MPC or VLO 
In addition to fantastic metrics  Valero and Marathon have stellar managements  which are diversifying their companies  businesses  For example  Valero now has 11 ethanol plants and a 50 megawatt wind farm  And Marathon aims to reduce its refining contribution to EBITDA to a little more than half of the total  from more than three quarters currently 
Bottom line  MPC and VLO have high dividend growth  good total yields  low EV EBITDA multiples  and are positioned to benefit from several macro tailwinds 
Cumulatively  these factors give both stocks a great shot at outperforming the market 
Safe  and high yield  investing

   European shares slip  BNP Paribas rises 
   Yen off highs after Japan s Fujii comments
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  Sept 29  Reuters    World stocks steadied on Tuesday
as weaker oil prices and caution following a recent rally
prompted investors to lock in gains and stay on the sidelines 
 The yen slipped from the previous day s 8 month high versus
the dollar after Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said
he would not rule out taking action if currency moves were
irregular   ID nSP127557 
 Oil fell towards  66 5 a barrel as investors anticipated a
weak demand outlook from weekly inventory from the United
States  This weighed on basic resource shares 
 However  BNP Paribas  move to pay back state financial
support and growing corporate takeover activity bolstered
confidence about economic recovery provided underlying support
for risky assets 
  There s a degree of profit taking with many investors quick
to cash in after yesterday s gains  but the underlying market
sentiment remains positive   said Howard Wheeldon  strategist at
BGC Partners 
 MSCI world equity index  was almost unchanged
on the day  The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of leading
European shares was also steady 
 Shares of BNP Paribas  France s biggest bank by market
capitalisation  rose 3 percent  after it launched a
capital increase for 4 3 billion euros as part of its move to
reimburse the French state early   nLT458563 
 Its move follows similar paybacks from UBS  Goldman Sachs 
JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley 
 Emerging stocks  rose 0 9 percent 
 U S  stock futures were down around 0 1 percent  
pointing to a slightly weaker open on Wall Street later 
 U S  stocks rallied on Monday after Xerox Corp 
agreed to buy Affiliated Computer Services  for  5 5
billion and Abbott Laboratories  said it would pay  6 6
billion for Solvay s  drug unit 
 The cost of financing has fallen significantly since the
start of the credit crisis as central banks around the world cut
interest rates to near zero  making it easier for corporates to
raise funds to conduct merger and acquisition activity 
  Whilst some companies are still in the process of repairing
their balance sheets from the credit binge earlier in the
decade  there are also a number sitting on large amounts of
cash  which sooner or later they will need to put to work  
Calyon said in a note to clients 
  We feel it is too early to be calling the beginning of
another M A cycle just yet though     However  as economic
visibility improves  we believe the M A theme could be big next
year  
 U S  crude oil  fell 0 3 percent to  66 61 a barrel 
 The yen fell 0 2 percent to 90 23 per dollar   having
risen as high as 88 22 on Monday  The dollar  was steady
against a basket of major currencies 
 The September Bund future  was steady
