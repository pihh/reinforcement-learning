14803,236318,CCMP,5 Top Picks To Tap Momentum In Semiconductor Space,opinion,The semiconductor industry had a rough 2018  with most of the major chipset manufacturing stocks closing in the red  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  was down 2 6   The disappointing performance can be attributed to a prolonged trade conflict and fear of global demand slowdown  chipset supply glut and crash of cryptocurrency However  the semiconductor industry has rebounded impressively in 2019  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  is up 25 8  year to date compared with 14 9  growth of the benchmark S P 500 Index Meanwhile  the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  SMH     the fund that closely tracks companies in the industry    has advanced 27  this year  Moreover  the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index has witnessed a jump of 18 9  in 2019 Disappointing 2018 for Semiconductor IndustryChipset industry s downturn in 2018 was the effect of several negative factors  First  is the trade related conflict between the United States and China  which commenced in March 2018 and aggravated throughout the year Secondly  the fear of global economic slowdown  especially the downturn of the Chinese economy  was a major concern  The IMF has reduced global economic growth forecast for 2019 due to trade war concerns Finally  the crash of the cryptocurrency industry in 2018 took a heavy toll on the semiconductor industry  Several chipset manufacturers  especially those which manufacture flash memory were optimistic about the growth potential of cryptocurrency  Consequently  chipset supply glut occurred  resulting in price reduction Semiconductor Industry Rebounds in 2019The semiconductor industry has recovered so far this year buoyed by several positive developments Firstly  despite a tepid stock market performance in 2018  all was not bad for the semiconductor industry  On Feb 6  the Semiconductor Industry Association announced that in 2018  more than a trillion chips were shipped globally  for the first time in industry s history  Sales of chips grew 13 7  year over year to  468 8 billion worldwide in 2018 Secondly  since the beginning of 2019  both United States and China are negotiating earnestly to find out an amicable solution to the trade spat  After a successful round of negotiation in Beijing between high level delegations of two sides  the second round of talks was completed in Washington this week  A permanent solution seems possible within a month or two Thirdly  a dovish monetary stance adopted by the Fed bodes well for the semiconductor manufacturers as this industry is debt prone  Notably  the central bank raised interest rates four times last year  with a hike of 25 basis points each time Semiconductor Industry to Largely Benefit From Likely Trade TruceA trade spat with the United States resulted in significant slowdown of the Chinese economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  chipset makers a solid boost as China is the largest market for high tech products  Meanwhile  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to U S  chipset industry An amicable solution to the U S   China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U S  chipset giants  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for U S  semiconductor behemoths Our Top PicksThe major gainers of a possible trade deal will be semiconductor companies  We have narrowed our search to five such stocks that have moved higher in the first quarter and still have upside if a trade deal materializes  All five stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Xilinx Inc    NASDAQ XLNX   designs and develops programmable devices and associated

14806,236321,CCMP,Shun NVIDIA  Opt For These 4 Top Ranked Semi Stocks In 2019,opinion,NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   suffered a bumpy ride in 2018  thanks to a string of weaknesses plaguing the semiconductor market since the second half Notably  the company  which impressed investors with a stellar performance in the past couple of years  has been witnessing a downward trend since October  Moreover  the chip maker has remained tremendously stressed ever since it reported lower than expected top and bottom line results on Nov 15 Additionally  the company s bleak near term guidance dealt a severe blow to investor confidence  This is further evident from a recent Bloomberg report  which stated that SoftBank Group Corp is planning to sell its stake in the company early next year We note that this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock is currently one of the worst performers  lagging the S P 500 index and the industry it belongs to over the past year Shares of NVIDIA have plunged 31 3  in the past year compared with the   16 8  decline and the S P 500 Composite s 12  fall Year to Date Price Performance The market cap of the stock as of Dec 26 is  81 billion  down from more than  175 billion recorded in September end What s Bothering the Company NVIDIA is having a real tough time due to the end of the cryptocurrency mining boom  which weakened demand for its GPUs The company was overly optimistic that demand for its GPUs will shift from miners to gamers  which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset the revenue loss from miners  As a result  the company continued with its production of GeForce graphics cards  However  drawing proof from its last result  this has not been the case Slowdown in demand for older and newer gaming chips hit the company badly  Inventory level of midrange Pascal gaming cards remained higher than expected as demand from gamers failed to grow rapidly to counter the sluggish cryptocurrency related requirement On the last earnings call  management mentioned that it will take two quarters to normalize the channel inventory  The company s outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter indicates its suspension of mid range Pascal GPU shipments in order to stabilize the channel inventory levels Moreover  due to the normal seasonal build cycle  the company anticipates lower sales of Tegra chips for game consoles to be an overhang on its gaming revenues Additionally  although the company is witnessing growth in its datacenter business  the growth rate seems to have waned from the previous levels This apart  a robust competition from Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD    which is ramping up its CPU   GPU portfolio to strengthen position in the gaming and datacenter business  poses a serious threat to NVIDIA Moreover  growth in in house chip production of NVIDIA s datacenter partners like Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Alphabet s Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Alibaba  NYSE BABA  will further intensify rivalry in the market Given such circumstances that NVIDIA is currently in  it is advisable for investors to steer clear of the stock Our PicksAlthough NVIDIA s prospects may not seem appealing at the moment  there are

14807,236322,CCMP,Look To Boring Stocks In This High Risk Environment,opinion,"Those who don t like my writing style may already call me boring  or worse   but as far as stock holdings go I willingly take on that description  If you re looking for words about Wednesday s FOMC meeting  you won t find them here  There are plenty of people picking that thing apart and trying to make chicken salad  news  out of chicken shit  a non event  
I am not going to go on about the precious metals  big rip on Wednesday because that is for casino patrons to get excited about  I ve expected the sector to bounce from oversold conditions  When it takes out real upside parameters  that  will surely manage  we ll amp up the hysterics  not really  
The stock market  It s scenarios are Thing 1 and Thing 2  The 1st Thing is to resume upward now and bring on the climactic suck in sooner rather than later  The 2nd Thing is the healthier one  where the market corrects now and makes new highs and sucks  em in later  I ve favored Thing 2  but now it is time to watch short term events and do what the market says  Okay  before I get off track  on to the boring stuff 
First  look at the Consumer Staples  NYSE XLP  vs  the S P 500  weekly   In relative terms  it looks like XLP is at a buy point 

Also  look at XLP vs  its consumer related bro  NYSE XLY  monthly   I don t like the looks of this leading indicator if I am a stock bull hopped up on momo and other substances 

So what do I do  In a high risk market environment I get scared when the average momo is brave and I look to boring companies with constructive charts like VeriSign Inc  NASDAQ VRSN   bought a few weeks ago for its chart   I look around for others and find Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO  and like its chart  the daily more so than the weekly below   Same goes for Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   which had a good quarterly report  is making online inroads and had pulled back a bit 
The Homies presented me with a crazy good chart on KB Home  NYSE KBH  a couple weeks ago and a subscriber gave me a heads up on the company with the most old fashioned name I ve ever heard  Rexnord Corporation  NYSE RXN   Good chart  IBM  NYSE IBM  was bought back on a pullback to the daily SMA 50  Several of these items have been NFTRH  technical setup ideas  either here at the site or in the weekly reports 
So anyway  here in a latter stage bull market  rotation and rebalancing seems to make a lot of sense  For instance  1 year ago we were preparing to get bullish on the Semiconductor sector as Semi Equipment bookings were on the verge of establishing a bullish trend  Here is a  
Remember the multi stock charts I used to produce back then  They included currently overbought  over loved items like Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT   Lam Research Corp  NASDAQ LRCX   Cabot Microelectronics Corporation  NASDAQ CCMP  and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor  NASDAQ SOXX  ETF  Well  here is a multi stock chart of a different kind for a different time  Boring stuff  I grant you  But times change and so should peoples  perspectives and strategies ",2017-03-17,Gary Tanashian,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/call-me-boring,-but…-200179253",200179253
14808,236323,CCMP,4 Tech Stocks To Avoid If Market Pulls Back From Highs,opinion,"The stock market has witnessed an impressive run so far this year  The Nasdaq Composite  IXIC   S P 500  GSPC  and Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  have gained 20 4   12 4  and 14   respectively  year to date 
The market added to its winning streak yesterday with another round of all time highs from these three major U S  equity gauges on strong economic reports 
So  as they continue with their impressive run in the market  there are at least three good reasons why a pullback appears to be around the corner 
Factors that Could Trigger a Pullback
The Fed has started reducing its balance and it s worth noting that this event has had an adverse impact in the past  KM Partners data shows that five out of six times the Fed has made efforts to reduce its balance sheet  it has resulted in a recession 
So  this sentiment can lead to market volatility going forward especially if the Fed takes up a hawkish approach  As of now  the Fed is taking it easy and therefore chances of market disruption are low 
Heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea can also cause stocks to fall  Though a full fledged war is unlikely  investors would surely prefer to move out of equities and place their hard earned money in safer products 
Another major trigger could be the growing threat of cyberattacks  After global ransomwares WannaCry and Petya that affected 150 and 65 countries respectively  hackers breached the data of credit agency Equifax  NYSE EFX   affecting 143 million Americans  That s close to half of the US population 
So  the threat of exchange data been hacked and a market collapse must have started to concern investors 
Is a Correction Due 
Well  we have got mixed views on that  For example  while the Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Bear Market Indicator continues to rise  economists opine that the current accommodative monetary policy environment will prevent equity markets from turning bearish 
Again  while Wall Street analysts indicated  extreme bullishness  on stocks at the end of September  based on a monthly survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   BAML   BAML itself says that it s historically been a bearish signal when Wall Street is extremely bullish 
Stocks to Steer Clear Of
While there are arguments in favor of both bullish and bearish trends  it remains to be seen in which direction the market moves  We highlight four technology stocks which are better avoided if the market retreats from the recent highs 
Cabot Microelectronics Corp    NASDAQ CCMP   supplies polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of integrated circuit  IC  devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization  CMP  The stock has a Momentum Score of F and has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

14811,236326,CCMP,Qualcomm Meets Broadcom After Rejecting Revised Offer,opinion,"Qualcomm s   NASDAQ QCOM   CEO Steve Mollenkopf  CFO George Davis and Chairman Paul Jacobs and other office bearers met Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO   representatives in a two hour meeting  Neither party said anything about what transpired at the meeting but Broadcom representatives reportedly came away with the feeling that they were listened to without comment  Qualcomm representatives said that the board would meet to discuss the next steps 

The Broadcom Offer
Broadcom s attempt to acquire Qualcomm to create a wireless powerhouse was thwarted yet again when its revised bid was rejected unanimously by Qualcomm s board of directors   
In November  Broadcom offered  70 a share  of which  60 was to be paid in cash and the rest in shares  The revised offer  which is Broadcom s  best and final offer   values each share at  82   60 a share in cash and the rest in shares  
Considering the fact that the deal reduces competition  there s a good chance that regulators in several countries will oppose it  If the deal is cancelled on account of regulatory opposition  Broadcom will pay  8 billion for the disruption caused 
Broadcom expects to obtain necessary approvals to close the deal within a year  If it takes longer  it will pay 6  a year of the amount to be paid in cash as compensation 
Since this is an unsolicited  hostile bid to take over control of the company  Broadcom is also looking to replace the entire Qualcomm board with 11 people of its own choosing  Shareholders will cast their votes on Mar 6  
Is Qualcomm s Concern Justified 
Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs stated in the open letter to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan   Your proposal ascribes no value to our accretive NXP acquisition  no value for the expected resolution of our current licensing disputes and no value for the significant opportunity in 5G   and  Your proposal is inferior relative to our prospects as an independent company and is significantly below both trading and transaction multiples in our sector   Moreover  the bid contains  serious deficiencies in value and certainty  
It s true that the automotive and IoT segments are greatly expanding Qualcomm s addressable market  being new areas it is expanding into  Moreover  Qualcomm has also taken a lead in 5G technology development and recently announced agreements with 19 carriers and 18 handset OEMs  so it s clearly getting ready to charge into the market  Any merger related disruption in this schedule  or if it resulted in the loss of major customers  could come in the way of its capturing the dominant share of the market that it is targeting  So it s true that if after this disruption  the merger doesn t go through because of regulatory opposition  the amount proposed to be paid wouldn t compensate Qualcomm adequately   
Also note that customers won t be thrilled with the combination because it has the potential to become even more dominant in the wireless market  thereby driving up prices   
Summing Up
Qualcomm was initially not considering a buyout offer at all but it has now softened its stand because some shareholders have expressed interest in the deal should it prove to be truly attractive  Broadcom for its part  and especially CEO Hock Tan has considerable experience wrapping up acquisitions although the size of this deal makes it a different animal altogether  Whether the hostile bid for the company will be successful is still an open question 
Qualcomm shares carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  while Broadcom shares have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Semiconductor peers worth buying instead are  1  Strong Buy  ranked Cabot Microelectronics Corp    NASDAQ CCMP    or  2  Buy  ranked Diodes Inc    NASDAQ DIOD   and Mellanox Technologies   NASDAQ MLNX    Or  simply head over to

in business equipment orders placed with factories indicated resilient demand at the start of the second quarter  Philly Fed factory orders also touched a 45 year high in May The pace of economic boom

land  The Republican administration s  1 5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed corporate tax rates from 35  to 21  from this year and offered an additional tax break on repatriated overseas profits of U S  corporations  The signature legislative plan is helping to improve liquidity of the American businesses   However  the absolute benefit of lower corporate taxes has not yet materialized  Going forward  tax cuts will likely speed up investments in factories  new equipment and other capital goods  We also certainly believe that additional tax cuts prior November will further spike up

14814,236329,CCMP,A Deep Dive Into The Semiconductor Sector,opinion,"We have been using the Semis as a one of several economic signposts  and as an investment trading destination since the Semi Equipment  bookings  category in the Book to Bill ratio began to ramp up several months ago  But those who say that Semiconductors are subject to pricing pressures are correct  It is a segment in which people need to be discrete with their investments  NFTRH 410 updated some details about this market leader 


Semiconductor Sector
Semi has been a leader for our overall market and economic view  which has been bullish since noting that a trend of three straight months of increased bookings was established in April  The Book to Bill for July came in strong once again  with a new high in the key  bookings  category 

From SEMI   Monthly bookings have exceeded  1 7 billion for the past three months with monthly billings trending in a similar manner   said Denny McGuirk  president and CEO of SEMI   Recent earnings announcements have indicated that strong purchasing activity by China and 3D NAND producers will continue in the near term  
China  That does not sound like a long term  stable fundamental underpinning  This Semi ramp up may be relatively selective  aside from Chinese demand  which could cut out at any time  it would pay to focus on 3D NAND  
From Market Realist   Applied Materials   AMAT  strong guidance for fiscal 4Q16 reflects the overall semiconductor industry s health  AMAT revised its forecast for 2016 WFE  wafer fab equipment  spending from flat to single digit growth  The slight growth would be driven by a 40  YoY  year over year  increase in 3D NAND spending and a 5  10  YoY increase in foundry spending  However  this growth would be partially offset by a 25  YoY decline in DRAM  dynamic random access memory  spending and a slight decline in logic spending  In 2016  AMAT is witnessing a broader mix of foundry customers from different geographies  especially China  

Also from SEMI  in a mid year update   While many are forecasting low single digit unit growth for semiconductor devices  average selling price  ASP  trends will drag down the overall revenue outlook for the industry  
This is important because I agree that the Semiconductor manufacturers are a crap shoot  as many of their products are in essence  commodities  in that they are in a highly competitive industry and readily available  The Equipment and Materials sectors service the whole of the sphere with specialized equipment and materials 
 One bright spot are semiconductor equipment bookings that are showing a 6 percent year over year increase  see figure below   The strength in bookings is boding well for a stronger second half of the year and is supported by 2016 capex plans by Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Samsung  KS 005930  and TSMC as detailed by IC Insights  recently released bulletin 
Other segments are showing positive momentum  First quarter silicon volume shipments  as well as equipment bookings and billings were higher than the fourth quarter of last year  Quarterly increases continued into the second quarter for equipment bookings and billings  silicon wafer volumes  and leadframes  The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics showed that device shipments increased 5 percent  resulting in a 1 percent increase in chip revenues in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter  Based on past data trends gains are expected to continue into the third quarter as the third quarter  on average  is the strongest quarter for semiconductors 
The lingering question is   will the gains in the second quarter and anticipated gains in the third be enough to offset the typically slow fourth quarter   The answer is   it depends   From a device perspective it does not appear it will  as evidenced by the current mid year outlooks depicted above  graph omitted   However  from an equipment and materials point of view the future is more promising  SEMI is expecting the semiconductor equipment market to increase a nominal 1 percent this year  while the materials market will increase just under 2 percent  which would put the equipment and materials markets at  36 9 billion and  44 1 billion  respectively  
How does this affect our view  As a leading economic indicator I d say that the Equipment and Materials ramp up remains a positive  although we should tamp down any enthusiasm that a grand new economic era may be upon us and continue to cross reference other indicators like PALL Gold  Commodities vs  Gold  etc  for cyclical indications  As a view on direct investment or trading in the Semi sector  I d say we d need to be very discrete  Quality  leading equipment companies like Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  and Materials companies like Cabot Microelectronics  NASDAQ CCMP  are the focus 
This chart shows the bullish state of 2 Equipment companies  the constructive state of another  and one still bullish Materials company  We ll look at others going forward if as the situation remains constructive ",2016-08-30,Gary Tanashian,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/semiconductor-sector,-updated-200150672",200150672
