3328,224843,CCBG,US Banks  Stock Outlook  Growth Will Not Be Easy,opinion,"U S  banks are on the verge of releasing their first quarter 2014 results  which are likely to reflect the tough backdrop endured since the beginning of the year  The quarter remained challenging with dreary consumer and corporate activities  soft trading volumes  sluggish mortgage banking activities  and high legal costs  Further  reserve release is not expected to be strong enough to support bottom line growth similar to the past year  Overall  U S  banks are apparently losing their luster with too many mandatory defensive measures thwarting growth  Moreover  top line growth remains uncertain as a dearth of significant loan growth  primarily the home equity lines of credit  and pressure on net interest margins from a nagging low rate environment  prevail  However  banks have been gradually easing their lending standards and trending toward higher fees to dodge the pressure on the top line  Then again  continued expense control and stable balance sheets should act as tailwinds in the upcoming quarters  Further  a favorable equity and asset market backdrop  and favorable macroeconomic factors   such as falling unemployment  a progressive housing sector and flexible monetary policy   should pave way for stability  Of course  financial institutions that depend less on risky activities and resort to other profit making ways seem to have a brighter future  Now that the interest rate environment has reached a reversal point with the Fed s tapering of fiscal stimulus  net interest margins are likely to improve and support top line to an extent  But revenues from mortgage fees will lessen as the boom in mortgage refinancing fizzles out  Whether the loss of fee revenues will be compensated by gains from interest rate spreads can however be said only in the course of time  We don t see this issue ridden sector returning to its pre recession peak anytime soon  What encourages us though is that the U S  banks are getting accustomed to increased legal and regulatory pressure and resorting to safer alternatives for higher earnings  This indicates their ability to encounter challenges and grow at a moderate pace  But structural changes in the sector will continue to impair business expansion and investor confidence for some time 
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  U S  banks are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into six industries at the expanded level  Banks Major Regional  Banks Midwest  Banks West  Banks Northeast  Banks Southeast and Banks Southwest  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  As a guideline  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for Banks Southwest is  14  Banks West is  34  Banks Midwest is  38  Banks Southeast is  58  Banks Northeast is  86  and Banks Major Regional is  94  Considering the Zacks Industry Rank of the six banking industries  one could safely say that the outlook for the group is leaning toward  Positive  
Earnings Preview of the Broad Sector
The broader Finance sector  of which U S  banks are part  is expected to witness year over year earnings decline in first quarter 2014  The sector s earnings are expected to decline 3 9  compared with 22 8  growth in the preceding quarter  On the revenue front  a 7 3  decline is expected  compared to a 12 4  plunge in the prior quarter     Though the numbers for the 7 medium level  or M level  industries in the sector will most likely be positive  the growth rates are mostly expected to decline  Particularly  Major Banks and Banks and Thrifts are expected to witness 6 8  and 15 2  decline  respectively      Among major Industry players  JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM   The Goldman Sachs Group  Inc   NYSE GS  and Citigroup Inc   NYSE C  are expected to experience year over year earnings declines  The consensus earnings expectations for full year 2014 and 2015  however  look decent with 5 5  and 11 2  growth rates  respectively 
 Too Big To Fail  Advantage
Mega banks have been continuously benefiting from lower funding and operating costs since the financial crisis  This is because of the impression that the Federal Reserve will always protect these banks from failing in case of any major financial trouble  A recent study by Federal Reserve economists suggests that the biggest banks still enjoy low borrowing costs and take bigger risks than smaller players because of the U S  government s  too big to fail  impression about them  The study estimated that the five largest banks have enjoyed 0 31  funding advantage over their smaller peers since 2009  This is statistically significant according to the researchers  This malformed notion will continue to keep these banks at an advantageous position unless anything unfavorable happens 
Does the  Problem Bank List  Indicate Anything Good 
The unofficial number of banks on the FDIC s  Problem List  increased to 533 as of April 4  2014 from official number of 467 as of December 31  2013  There were 515 problem banks as of September 30  2013  The numbers look extremely high considering that the financial crisis happened five years back  There were only 76 banks on the  Problem List  at the end of 2007  just before the crisis   Considering the recovery witnessed by the economy and stock markets so far  the number of problem banks should have been much less  This indicates that the industry is still fraught with trouble  During first quarter 2014  just 5 banks have failed  Though the number compares unfavorably with 4 failures in the first quarter of 2013  it still looks decent  Though fewer bank failures are expected in 2014 compared to 2013  the industry is still to see an average failure of just four or five banks annually  which would indicate maximum strength in the industry 
Growth Will Not Be Easy
As the gap between loss provisions and charge offs is gradually narrowing  reduction in provisions is not likely to remain a significant earnings driver in the upcoming quarters  So banks are trying to look at other areas    primarily non interest income and operating costs  But opportunities will be curbed by regulatory restrictions and a still shaky economic recovery  Efforts to cut interest expenses and take additional risks to improve net interest margins could be marred by a still flat yield curve  Further  shifting assets to longer maturities for strengthening net interest margin could backfire with the expected increase in interest rates in the near to mid term  The low interest rate environment following the financial crisis has a mixed impact on banks  While it reduced their borrowing costs  limitation to charging high interest on loans marred revenues  When interest rates finally start rising  benefits of banks will depend on their ability to charge more for loans than what is paid on deposits  On the other hand  increasing revenues through non interest sources    charges on deposits  prepaid cards  new fees and higher minimum balance requirement on deposit accounts    could be hampered by regulatory actions and soaring overhead  However  with a rebound in capital market activity  the propensity to invest in the market has increased  which may lead to more non interest revenue sources  Eventually  banks will have to resort to cost containment through job cuts and reduced operational size  But any cost cutting measure will act as a defense  The industry witnessed more than half a million layoffs over the last five years just to stay afloat  and the story will continue 
Is Balance Sheet Recovery On Track    
Steady deposit growth from lack of low risk investment opportunities is quite possible  but high charge offs and delinquency rates plus weak demand could keep loan growth under pressure in the near to mid term  Though banks are easing lending standards to accelerate loan growth  credit quality concerns are likely to mar the effort  Moreover  though growth in gross domestic product  GDP  and reducing unemployment will help banks strengthen their balance sheets  expected unrealized losses on underlying securities due to a likely rise in interest rates will act as dampeners  However  banks are trying to reorganize risk management practices to address potential solvency issues from rising interest rates  Efforts are also being given to address asset quality troubles by divesting nonperforming assets  Yet  we don t expect balance sheet strength to return to pre recession peak anytime soon

3332,224847,CCBG,5 Top Stocks To Buy During This Bull   Bear Tug of War,opinion,Wall Street is bracing for higher bouts of volatility  after a rebound in U S  stocks on Feb 6 followed the largest sell off in more than six years  While bullish investors show a lot of optimism on corporate earnings and prospects of tax cut  those with a bearish view fear that the Fed s embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run Given such widespread concern over the future course of the equity market  investing in stocks unperturbed by market gyrations won t be a bad proposition Greater Uncertainty in Equity MarketThe U S  stock market finished a wild day of trading on Feb 6 with the Dow jumping 567 02 points  or 2 3   to 24 912 77  after losing 567 points at the

or 1 7   But  the broader index is now down more than 5  from its all time intra day high of 2 872 87 on Jan 26  And it s all because of the healthy pullback on Feb 5  Before that day  the index had enjoyed the longest stretch without a 5  pullback in 20 years This shows that the market is unpredictable and often erratic in the short term  After all  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   Wall Street s

Winning StrategyAs the broader market struggles for direction  smart investors should simply look for stocks that provide superb risk adjusted returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 But  even though low beta stocks pose less risk they provide lower returns  So  in order to boost your returns  we have further zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision  usually on a quarterly basis  Rising earnings

3333,224848,CCBG,5 Domestic Stocks To Gain From Thaw In Trade Talks,opinion,U S  China trade talks could take longer to reach a definitive solution  owing to several unresolved disagreements between them  Issues such as intellectual property rights and China s proposal of a six year rise in its imports of U S  goods need affirmative resolutions before an effective trade deal is cut Given the uncertainty on the trade deal front  it might be prudent to invest in a couple of domestic stocks that are well positioned for gains ahead and are less likely to bear the brunt of a prolonged trade war An Immediate Resolution to Trade Dispute is UnlikelyHighly unpredictable equity markets and a global economic slowdown have surfaced after the trade war commenced last July  with the United States and China slapping tariffs on each other s imported goods Declining growth in China s market has affected American companies that operate in the Asian nation as well  incurring strong dips in business  Recently  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   missed its revenue target due to falling iPhones demand in China  Automakers such as Ford Motor   NYSE F   and General Motors   NYSE GM   also suffered losses because of profit hits According to a Bloomberg report  a seven month investigation concluded in early 2017 by the United States revealed China s usage of foreign ownership restrictions to force U S  companies into sharing technology with local firms and its theft of U S  trade secrets via cyber attacks China assured in January that it would speed up the implementation of a new foreign investment policy to protect intellectual property of foreign companies operating there and relieve strain on them to transfer technology  However  insufficient means of criminal penalties for violating the policy deemed the law ineffective Also  China s offer to buy more U S  goods over a span of six years is too long term and could have little effect to ramp up the U S  economy in the near future U S  China Trade Deal Predictions Strategists at JP Morgan Asset Management are doubtful whether any significant issue could be resolved between Washington and Beijing to reach a trade agreement  a CNBC report cited earlier this month Karen Ward  chief market strategist at J P  Morgan Asset Management  said   I think  the deal  would have to be extremely far reaching for the markets to breath an enormous sigh of relief   She added   I don t think  unfortunately  that  the trade war  is something that will disappear from our horizon for the full year  JP Morgan s skepticism echoes a Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  report released last month which said that a deal is unlikely to be reached by Mar 1 to prevent higher tariffs  In case of a no deal scenario  levies are scheduled to increase from 10  to 25  on  200 billion worth of Chinese products In addition  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  economists noted that China s slowdown could start reversing over the next few months owing to a large amount of domestic incentives such as monetary and credit easing  tax cuts  a weaker currency and spending increases While these factors could help China in fighting the ongoing trade war  the United States could see a dip in confidence as it has inadequate room for loosening policies  This could lead to a reversal in roles toward the end of 2019  when China s economy could stabilize but U S  economic growth might wane 5 Domestic Stocks to Buy We have hand picked five stocks that have their business operations confined to the United States and are thus unperturbed by geopolitical

3373,224888,CCBG,Can Value Investors Consider Capital City Bank  CCBG  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Capital City Bank Group   NASDAQ CCBG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Capital City Bank has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 62  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 8  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Capital City Bank s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 26 75 over the past five years However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 66  This indicates that the stock is quite overvalued right now  compared to its peers Also  Capital City Bank has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 68  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the times ahead P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Capital City Bank has a P S ratio of about 2 48  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Capital City Bank currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Capital City Bank a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Capital City Bank might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives CCBG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen no upward and four downward revisions in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision versus four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 6 3  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 7 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Capital City Bank Group Price and Consensus   Such bearish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCapital City Bank is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Also  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 39  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the rank and industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you
