14838,236353,DGII,HP Rejects Xerox Offer  But Remains Open To Persuasion,opinion,"Hewlett Packard s   NYSE HPQ   board rejected Xerox s   NYSE XRX   offer of  22 a share  of which it would like to pay 77  in cash and the rest in Xerox shares 
What HP basically said is that Xerox hasn t adequately explained its financial situation and the reason its revenue slipped 9 8  on a trailing twelve months  TTM  basis  So on the face of it  the deal didn t look great for its shareholders  particularly when Xerox s balance sheet didn t look much better than HP s 
The two companies hold total debt of  9 89 billion  HP  5 058 billion  Xerox  4 832 billion  and cash of  5 84 billion  HP  4 919 billion and Xerox  922 million   Moreover  they generated operating cash of  3 049 billion and  1 032 billion  respectively on a year to date basis 
The board also said that the offer undervalues HP  which was trading at  18 40 on November 5  before the offer became public  On Nov 15  the shares closed at  20 18  reflecting positive sentiment on the value of a shrinking business  It was however still below the offer price  which seems to indicate that investors are perhaps not as hopeful as HP s board   
But there could be some real advantages to getting together because these two companies lack certain capabilities that could be useful in a shrinking market  Labels  packaging and signage for instance are fast growing areas of the market where Xerox doesn t have any offering  Similarly  the corporate copier business is where Xerox shines and an area where HP has no presence 
Together  they can bring customers the full range of paper based solutions their clients need  Although this entire pie is shrinking  it helps to remain relevant as long as possible to generate strong cash flows that can support any refocus of the business 
HP is already in the middle of a massive restructuring that will help it slash headcount by 9 000 and generate annual cost savings of  1 billion  Xerox claims that the merger will also generate a billion dollars in savings 
Activist investor Carl Icahn seems to think the deal makes sense  He owns a 10 6  stake in Xerox  a 4 24  stake in HP and has been pushing for a merger of the two companies  And that s because he thinks shrinking markets like this can continue to generate strong cash flows far longer than investors probably expect 
So it all boils down to the extent of gains to be had from the deal and whether the price makes sense  as HP s letter to the Xerox CEO said 
 We believe it is critical to engage in a rigorous analysis of the achievable synergies from a potential combination  With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox  we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction    
And also 
 We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation  and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox   
Here s a quick glimpse at the share prices over the past month 

Recommendation
Both HPQ and XRX carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Better technology picks include ManTech International Corp    NASDAQ MANT    NetApp  Inc    NASDAQ NTAP    Groupon  Inc    NASDAQ GRPN   or Digi International   NASDAQ DGII    Or any the others from the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

14840,236355,DGII,Explore These 4 Momentum Stocks Using Driehaus Strategy,opinion,Investors who have the propensity to take higher risk can consider momentum stocks to boost their gains  In this respect  the Driehaus strategy can be used to choose the best momentum stocks using the  buy high and sell higher  theory  Richard Herman Driehaus earned his place in Barron s All Century Team following the success of this investment strategy The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer higher than market returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed based on the Driehaus strategy  has returned more than 300  since the end of the last bear market compared with 85 5  gains registered by the S P 500 A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening ParametersIn addition to the 50 day moving average and relative strength  we have considered a few parameters for picking the best stocks  As companies with a strong history of beating estimates usually outperform the market  we added this to our screen  Also  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1No matter whether good market or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2 Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  Trailing 12 month EPS growth greater than 0 and industry medianHigher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior earnings performance  Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5 Solid EPS surprise history indicates better price performance  Positive percentage change in 50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeksPositive percentage change in 50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  Momentum Score equal to or less than BFavorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 6 828 stocks to only 14 Here are four of the 14 stocks Aspen Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AZPN   is an asset optimization software company  It has a Momentum Score of B and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 35 9  TopBuild Corp    NYSE BLD   is an installer and distributor of insulation and building material products  It has a

14842,236357,DGII,Stock Charts To Watch  AG  DGII  INSG  LK  MAXR  SEED,opinion,"1   First Majestic Silver  Corp  NYSE AG  looks really good  I think the long term pattern is indicative of what s going on in the metal s market  The base that developed from May 2018 to June 2019 took off at the 5 1 2 range  it ran up to 11 1 2  pulled back and consolidated for four or five months  and now it s setting off again  on Monday breaking out 52 cents  or 4 37  to 12 41  with a high of 12 60  on 5 6 million shares  I m now looking for 14 1 2 15 zone  and then maybe 17 3 4 18 going forward  This stock looks pretty darn good 
2  Digi International Inc  NASDAQ DGII  is one of my picks for the year  It popped  broke out  pulled back in an orderly fashion  popped again  pulled back  retested support  and on Monday  it reversed and ran up 70 cents  or 4   to 18 06  reaching a high of 19 14  on 343 634 shares traded  That was an engulfing  bullish day for this stock  Next targets are 22 and 25 
3  Inseego Corp  NASDAQ INSG  is also one of our picks of the year  Near term  it popped out  then broke out  formed a wedge  and on Monday  it popped out of the wedge  gaining 37 cents  or 5 2   closing at 7 48  to a high of 7 62  on 2 million shares traded  I think this stock is going to run up to 9  11  and maybe 15 16 by the end of the year 
4   Luckin Coffee   NASDAQ LK  continues to look good  It is a swing  but not a top pick because I m not sure of the price and how much further it can go from a percentage standpoint  However  on Monday  it jumped 1 34  or 3 68   reaching a 52 week and Monday s closing session at 38 68  on 12 7 million shares  I do believe we re going to see something in the high 40 s near or intermediate term 
5  Maxar Technologies Inc  TSX MAXR  has a beautiful long term base  it broke out  formed a wedge  and on Monday  it broke out of the wedge with a breakaway gap  jumping 2 20  or 15 4   to 16 49  reaching a new 52 week and session high of 17 59  on 8 8 million shares  I m looking for a move to 20 21  and maybe to as high as 29 30 over the next few weeks 
6  Origin Agritech Ltd  NASDAQ SEED   on very positive news out of China on Monday  exploded 1 13  or 24 4   to 5 76  with a high of 6 70  on 552 389 shares traded  This stock literally went from 2 00 to 4 76 to 6 70  With that kind of volume on Monday  which I ve never seen before on this stock  I wouldn t be shocked to see 7 7 1 2 near term

14843,236358,DGII,Buy These 4 Stocks For Solid Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Earnings growth interests almost everyone  from the top brass to research analysts  After all  earnings are a measure of the money a company is generating  Notably  earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time Nonetheless  earnings acceleration works even better when it comes to boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in stock price What is Earnings Acceleration Primarily  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Meanwhile  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Therefore  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 4 Solid ChoicesLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1

22903,244418,DGII,5 Breakout Stocks For Stellar Returns ,opinion,Picking breakout stocks is one of the most favored methods for those utilizing an active investing approach since this strategy offers the promise of superlative returns  This method involved zeroing in on those stocks whose prices are varying within a narrow band If the price of the stock falls below this channel  it could be the best time to sell of this stock  However  the best time to buy a stock as per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band  Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains Identifying Breakout StocksThe essence of this strategy lies in calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The lower bound of a stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the ceiling is a stock s breakout level and it can gain substantially if it breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand  demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a bona fide breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price

Investor Relations website Now I  ll turn the call over to Ron Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jamie  And welcome to everyone that has joined our call today  We are off to a good start in our fiscal 2020 year  clocked by the closing of the Opengear acquisition  We welcome Opengear to the Digi family  As indicated by the Opengear acquisition  the growing maturity of our IoT Solutions business segment and our annual guidance  Digi is focused on profitable growth  Because of our low capital requirements and acquisition activities  we ve been presenting both GAAP and non GAAP profitability metrics  The non GAAP metrics EBITDA and adjusted EPS provide our stakeholders with a run rate view of our operating profitability  Growth will continue to be an imperative  but will be viewed with a profitability lens for both our organic and inorganic initiatives  In that context  I will provide an update on our business segments Our IoT Products and Services business segment now includes the results of our Opengear acquisition  To reflect the integration of Opengear with Digi and to comply with SEC regulations  we will not be providing stand alone results for Opengear  We are ahead of our new products revenue projections  which we expect to increase from  40 million to  70 million in fiscal 2020  led by our cellular product family and enhanced by new and improved service offerings that complement our products We continue to experience high win rates  on our key account and top opportunities with strong performance from our direct sales team  We commenced deployment of our Smart City project and has a strong portfolio built to take the collective experience to other opportunities  Gross margin improved and operating expenses were well managed to produce strong profitability  We are working hard to improve our channel partnerships to ensure they are supported and enjoy profitable growth while managing inventory levels With the addition of Opengear  we expect fiscal 2020 and our most recent fiscal quarter  second fiscal  excuse me  results to show higher revenue  improved gross margins and expanded EBITDA margins  Our SmartSense IoT Solutions business experienced subscriber additions closer to both our history and expectations  We added over 3 000 new sites with virtually no subscriber churn during the quarter to end with nearly 67 000 subscribers  We have approximately  15 million  Phonetic  in annualized recurring revenue  Gross margins improved reflecting the contribution of higher margins from our growing recurring revenue  We have transitioned nearly all of our customers that were on 2G gateways to 4G LTE gateways ensuring continuity of service  We continue to progress SmartSense 4 0  which is the destination consolidated mobile web platform  We are adding new sites and expect to transition some existing customers throughout the year Larger enterprise deals slipped out of the quarter and we are working hard to compress cycle times to bring value to our customers more quickly  We re not losing any opportunities in the quarter and we are highly focused on gaining customer confidence and moving quickly to capture ROI  The IoT Solutions business had a modest loss based on lower expected revenues  but we expect growth in a profitable fiscal 2020 As indicated last quarter  topline growth will moderate year over year to reflect our focus on building our subscriber count and recurring revenues through bundled offerings  At least a portion of our new customers will like an operating versus capital pricing model  In any event  subscriber additions will continue to be a key metric to follow  We expect top and bottom line performance to improve throughout the fiscal year At the corporate level  we ve made progress in our journey to simplify and automate our business model and processes  Software services and subscription will continue to be emphasized across our business segments amid a higher overall annualized recurring revenues  We went live on our CRM ERP system for the entire company in fiscal quarter one  which was an exciting and rewarding accomplishment  We now have one database to run the company and we will get better at both using the system and making it easier for our customers to do business with Digi We closed  150 million in attractive debt financing to close the Opengear acquisition without shareholder dilution  We are in compliance with all of our covenants  We expect to lower our debt position as we generate free cash flow  which will help prepare us for potential future acquisitions  We have more work to do to improve our working capital as inventory and accounts receivables increase to end fiscal Q1  We have process improvements and resource changes in supply chain finance that we expect will produce quick results The Coronavirus outbreak is serious and we are monitoring the situation closely  We have worked with our China based resources to ensure their safety and health is protected  including closing our offices temporarily in China  In addition  we are monitoring the impact of the outbreak on our supply chain  While most of our manufacturing is outside of China  many raw materials are sourced in the area  It is unclear what impact the Coronavirus will have over time  but we will work to minimize its impact on our results Lastly  we consider Digi to be sensitive to our environmental impact  our social standing within Digi and our communities and to a diverse and independent governance model  We are embarking on both documenting our ESG efforts and pushing Digi to do more  Expect future updates on this key initiative as this is important to all of our shareholders and is increasingly becoming a key investment criteria  I will now turn the call over to Jamie for more detail on our financial performance Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerThanks  Ron and good afternoon everyone  Starting with some of the key financial highlights that contributed to the financial results of our fiscal first quarter  Quarter revenue performance was  62 3 million with adjusted EBITDA performance of  6 4 million which is 10 3  of revenue  Both of those items are better than the top end range from the last guidance that we provided you  On a per diluted share basis  our adjusted EPS was  0 15 per diluted share  also exceeding our quarterly guidance range  while our GAAP EPS was  0 01 per diluted share compared to our guidance range of a loss of  0 02 to  0 02 gain per diluted share Finally  we put our cash to work during our first fiscal quarter with the successful closing of the Opengear acquisition  We funded this acquisition through approximately  38 million of domestic cash on hand  combined with an additional  110 million in proceeds from our credit facility  through our lending partners  While we now have net debt position on our balance sheet for the first time in company history  we do expect to generate significant cash during fiscal year 2020 Breaking down the results by business segment  I ll start with our Products and Services business  The financial impact of Opengear was not material to the overall performance of the business in the first fiscal quarter  Integration efforts are quickly embedding Opengear into the IoT Products and Services business  Standalone Opengear results will not be presented and we will stay consistent with segment reporting requirements  IoT Products and Services revenue increased year over year 2 5  in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 to  54 6 million  There are several factors that contributed to the growth  while not material  incremental revenue associated with the Opengear acquisition  higher sales from our cellular products and increased services revenue  These increases were partially offset by lower sales of other product offerings compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2019  Our IoT Products and Services gross margins were 48 8  compared to 47 6  in fiscal Q1 of  19  an increase of 120 basis points  This increase was driven primarily by incremental margin performance associated with the Opengear contribution  increased margins in our services category  product mix and lower manufacturing costs Shifting to our IoT Solutions segment  As Rob mentioned  IoT Solutions is now servicing nearly 67 000 sites  That really continues to be the main focus area for us in that business  Depending on which model customers utilize at the time of purchase  either a capital purchase or an OpEx purchase  one time revenue experience is variability and that can make year over year or even a sequential comparison a bit less intuitive than just looking at revenues  So we continue to focus on adding more sites into the business and growing annualized recurring revenue  With that said  our ARR finished at approximately 50  of total solutions revenue for the quarter We finished the quarter with revenue of  7 7 million  down from the prior year of  9 0 million  The decrease was attributed to less one time revenue recognized by our site additions than prior year  which was partially offset by the growth in our recurring subscription revenue  During the quarter our IoT Solutions gross margin was 49 5   up 50 basis points compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2019  which was at 49   The main driver is the larger percentage of revenue from recurring compared to one times  And this continues to demonstrate the leverage in our business model as recurring revenues grow in the business segment To wrap up  I want to touch on a few additional balance sheet items  Our fiscal first quarter cash position ended at  49 million  Our M AR  Phonetic  position landed at  81 million which is up from approximately  56 million at the end of our fiscal year on September 30  2019  We had a handful of collections that spilled over into the first part of January  We believe this is the result of customers managing their year end cash positions  combined with the holidays and we already now have cash in hand on those collections  Our inventory position  which includes the incremental addition of Opengear  has increased to  47 3 million  up from our year end position of approximately  40 million And finally  our ending debt position as of the fiscal first quarter 2020 is at approximately  107 million  That puts us at a total debt leverage position of approximately 2 5 and the net consolidated leverage position of under 2 0  both well within our internal targets Let s now discuss the upcoming quarter  We expect revenue of  72 million to  78 million with adjusted EBITDA of  11 million to  13 million  We expect GAAP EPS to be  0 07 to  0 11 per diluted share  while our adjusted non GAAP EPS to be  0 29 to  0 33 per diluted share  That quarterly guidance supports no update to our full year guidance that we previously provided of revenues between  310 million and  325 million and adjusted EBITDA of  45 million to  50 million  That guidance includes our previous guidance for Opengear of  45 million in revenue and  15 million in adjusted EBITDA We recognize that the guidance above does have a heavier weight on the back part of the year  which is not unexpected  Our newly acquired Opengear business has historically had a seasonality  and is more weighted to the back half of the calendar year  We also expect similar seasonality in the IoT Products and Services business  And if you combine that with our continued focus from our sales teams on more project based revenue  our year becomes more back end loaded We are maintaining our non GAAP EPS guidance of  1 14 to  1 27 per diluted share  However  we are updating our GAAP EPS targets  As we now work through our purchase accounting and our debt position  we now see the impacts on the new amortization associated with the intangible assets created  combined with the interest expense from the credit facilities  neither of which were included in our previous guidance  As such  we are moving our EPS guidance to  0 31 to  0 41 per diluted share  That completes our prepared remarks  At this time  Ron and I are pleased to take your questions  The team  could you please provide instructions to our callers Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Scott Searle of Roth Capital  your line is open Scott Searle    Roth Capital Partners    AnalystHey  good afternoon  Thanks for taking my question  Congratulations on the Opengear transaction closing  Hey  Ron and Jamie  just to follow up on your comments on the guidance into the March quarter  It does seem even more back end loaded  I was hoping we could work through a little bit more details in qualitative comments in terms of how you re expecting the Opengear to ramp  it sounds like it s more of a seasonal business  Is there anything else that s really changed on the margin  And is the Coronavirus and any sort of impact kind of factored into that seasonal impact as well  And then I had another follow up Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll just make some comments and then maybe Jamie can offer any additions as well  Historically  Opengear has had a ramp  They have been growing and they ramp throughout the year  sequentially  So we think that will continue as well inside Digi  So we have that revenue ramping  And we also    we knew the first quarter was going to be a lighter quarter for us but we re seeing the ramp continue based off that quarter  we did a little bit better than we thought we would initially  But we do see both the Digi IoT business as well as solutions ramping throughout the fiscal year as well  So you ve got three entities that were expecting sequential quarterly improvement  On the Coronavirus  right now  we have not felt any specific impact in terms of delivering products and services  We do have some suppliers in China in particular that had been told to stay home and not go to office for a week or two  And that s not going to have any material impact on us  but I don t think any of us know how serious this will get and if there ll be any continued extensions of the Chinese New Year holiday  If the extensions go long enough  then we ll certainly get worried  And so that s the kind of stuff we re monitoring very closely  We don t generate high revenue from China  but we are dependent on them from a supply chain perspective Scott Searle    Roth Capital Partners    AnalystGotcha  And if I could  Ron  just follow up on Opengear  maybe a little bit more granularity  I think it s heavily skewed toward a data center  but there s a lot of branch office built into there as well  I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of the demand trends that you re seeing right now  both from an end market standpoint and a geographic standpoint and ultimately  what is the growth rate in the market here for out of band solutions  Thanks Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  those are good questions  What Opengear has experienced that really had started off with strong results in  what we would call  core datacenters  and the growth of the Edge has really outpaced the growth of core datacenters  For a lot of people we tend to think of datacenters as being the hyperscalers like Amazon and Google and Facebook  but there is a lot of investment going on across various industries in both cloud as well as hybrid cloud and increasingly Edge deployments  More and more companies are looking to have intelligence closer to where activities are being generated and reducing latency and improving responsiveness of their solutions So we expect those secular trends to continue  We do believe Opengear  their growth rate  which has been in double digits is outpacing the markets growth rate for our band which has been estimated to be 79   So we do think that they ve been taking share Scott Searle    Roth Capital Partners    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Anthony Stoss of Craig Hallum  Your line is open Anthony Stoss    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystHi  guys  Great    great job on the gross margins  I m curious  maybe for Jamie  If you think there s a shot in fiscal  20 on a quarterly basis that you could crest over that 50  mark  and maybe a little bit more detail on what drove the strength on the gross margin side in December  And then I have a couple of follow ups Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerYeah  Thanks  Tony  I think  margin improvement is something that we ve kept an eye on  It s nice to see that flow through  I think one of the risks on crossing over that threshold at an aggregated level  and it sounds funny to say that it s a risk  but depending on that mix of the solutions business  there is a lot of capital purchasing that takes place  those equipment margins will spike up a revenue number and those would come sub 50 sometimes  And so that could place some pressure there  It s more OpEx dependent  then I think we would have a better chance  I think we continue to see the margin improvement activities that we re taking on the Products and Services side  we have good mix  We are seeing good cost actions continuing to flow through  especially as we moved our manufacturing to third parties  and so it is definitely something that I think is in iShop but probably a little too early for me to give you a firm commitment on  But I do think it s a possibility Anthony Stoss    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystOkay  thanks for that  And then  Ron  I know you ve only had Opengear under your belt for about a month  I m just curious what kind of cross sell opportunities you re seeing  also if there is any kind of cost of goods synergies or best practices that you folks are learning from the Opengear team  And then also  I didn t hear much talk about the legacy products  so I m just curious if that s expected to be down sequentially from March Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerThose are all really good questions  We re off to a really fast start with the integration of the Opengear team  And again a lot of it is because we share some dna with Digi with Opengear and with Accelerate  so culturally  it s been a really good fit  We absolutely are learning things from Opengear and how they do with channel  how they go to market  how they focus on their customers and we have identified some great opportunities to do some account ramping  There are several customers where they ve been invited from an  Indecipherable  perspective and those some same customers  many times retail are looking for business continuity So we think there s going to be some opportunities to really collaborate between the two on the go to market as well as we have been working to consolidate our supply chain operations in terms of sourcing  We ve established a strategic sourcing group for that very purpose  So we do think there is opportunity for us to enhance our cost of goods and hopefully continue to capture that in gross margin percentage  We re also working closely with our contract manufacturer strategy to make sure we get good spend and low transformation rates there Anthony Stoss    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystOkay  Then last question on the IoT Solutions group being down sequentially in the December quarter  I d love to hear just a little bit more on why that happened  And then do you expect that group to be up flat or down sequentially in the March quarter Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerYeah  We have some nice subscriber additions  So we re happy with the subscriber additions  The mix of the subscriber additions didn t have quite as much one time revenue upfront  We had a good chunk of those that shows the bundled model  which of course depresses your top line revenue even though  again it feels nice subscribers are there  We do expect sequential improvement not only in our Q2 but throughout the year  We have some larger enterprise deals  in particular in the food segment that we expected to have closed and they slipped into future quarters  So as I mentioned in my comments  we don t feel like we are losing opportunities as much as we re not getting them to move more quickly and making sure they understand the ROI Anthony Stoss    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystThanks Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity  Your line is open Michael Walkley    Canaccord Genuity Inc     AnalystGreat  thanks  Ron  just to build on that last question  as we think about the IoT Solutions business  I know it can be lumpy  depending on whether the customers buy upfront or not  but is there another way we could think about maybe how to track the health and growth of the business  Is there    is the site additions you think 3000 to 4 000 a quarter kind of a good run rate or you think some of these large products    large projects that you re bidding on that you should see bigger site additions throughout the year in terms of sequential site addition with growth Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerMike  great question  And we are really focused on that subscriber count because we think it s closely tied to annualized recurring revenue  It s a high margin portion and most investors will look at the margin on that recurring run rate business that both is growing and we re retaining and keeping customers happy  3000  4000 site adds    it s been something we ve publicly commented as our target and I think we can go further in certain periods when we get larger enterprise deals that complement that sort of move our work run rate business Michael Walkley    Canaccord Genuity Inc     AnalystOkay  thank you  And just going back to the stronger seasonality in the back half of the year  Thanks for sharing kind of the Opengear seasonality  As part of the seasonality to some of these smart city potential deals in the pipeline  maybe you can comment on the one  how it s rolling out  is that more back half fleeted and do you think given your pipeline  you might have some others to maybe that add to that back half of the year revenue trajectory Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  That s another good question and the first large smart city project that we announced last year and have begun deployment  That certainly will pay some of the revenue  The other applications we re chasing  and the pipeline is building  do have longer sales cycles  We ve got many times a government entity involved and there s an RFP procurement process  So we do think that the pipeline is building and that we ll be able to capture some of the opportunities  but they are going to happen toward the second half of the year Michael Walkley    Canaccord Genuity Inc     AnalystThanks  Last question from me and I ll pass on  Jamie  just a little housekeeping  can you just help us maybe with the purchase accounting  just kind of what your e modeling now for the non GAAP to GAAP walk through for amortization and interest expense Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerSo  Mike  Thanks  It s a good question  I m not ready to do that  We are still working through that  As you know  we ve got a couple of quarters before we finalize that  So we ve got some prelim numbers that are on the book based on a first pass on the valuation  But we will continue to work through that in terms of our Q2 numbers  And as we finalize that  I ll be a little bit more ready to actually give you the sort of what we project on a permanent go forward basis  But right now it s awfully early in the purchase accounting cycle Michael Walkley    Canaccord Genuity Inc     AnalystOkay  understood  But thanks for the updated non GAAP EPS guidance  Good luck with the year  And thanks for my questions Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt of Lake Street  Your line is open Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street Capital Markets    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my questions  Just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on some of the deals in the IoT Solutions that slipped out of the December quarter  Curious if you could just quantify how much revenue that related to  and provide some color on why those deals got pushed Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerYeah  As I mentioned  I think one of our opportunities is to help customers that have not had an opportunity to deploy IoT projects in the past to help them have success  And many times we re helping  giving them training and then they re on their own for a period  and we re going to have to have boots on the ground during those key testing periods to make sure they understand how the system works if they run into problems  we re there to advocate for them and for the solution  So I think that s the big challenge we have in front of us  The opportunity is to help customers have success initially and gain confidence in the rollout  I don t have specific numbers for you  but the pipeline is very strong  It s the best it s ever been in terms of the opportunities that we re chasing  The key for us is to help customers gain the confidence that they can get this ROI quickly as they look at the initial pilots that typically start these enterprise deals Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  and then just lastly  curious your thoughts on what inventory looks like in the distribution channel Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerIt s really    it s really around  20 millions which is pretty    pretty standard for us  So there is no excess of inventory in the channel or    neither is it necessarily  particularly at a low point Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thanks a lot Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat number of course excludes any Opengear  Opengear  generally does not have a ton of inventory from the channel Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street Capital Markets    AnalystOkay OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Greg Burns of Sidoti   Co  Please go ahead Greg Burns    Sidoti   Company  LLC    AnalystGood morning  All right  The    when you guided for this quarter  were you assuming any Opengear in that guidance Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  we did not  we did not  So we had  I think  nine business days of Opengear that we had not previously incorporated  And we expected the January 1 close date in our guidance Greg Burns    Sidoti   Company  LLC    AnalystOkay  Then  could you    can you let us know just  I assume it s a small number  but how much revenue and did it contribute anything to EPS Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerYeah  Greg  it is a small number  And because it s embedded in the segments  I think the best I can tell you is that it was not material to the quarter in terms of revenue or in terms of EPS  So it was not material  but because of the way we got it integrated right now  we won t be able to carve it out because it s cutting into our segment reporting as we ve laid it out Greg Burns    Sidoti   Company  LLC    AnalystOkay  And then in terms of the solutions business  I think the    you had mentioned the ARR was about  15 million at the end of the year  at the end of the fourth quarter  similar type number this quarter despite the site growth or ARPU is declining or what s    why aren t we seeing a little bit sequential   Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think we actually    I think we    correct me if i m wrong  Jamie  but I think it was approaching  15 million   Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerYeah  so the reality is  we re kind of    we re kind of directionally guiding to that number  Greg  So we said it s approaching  it s a function of rounding  So when you really break it down the sites  times the ARPU  Now the ARPU on the incremental sites is down a little bit as Ron kind of talked about based on what the site adds were which    you have different ARPUs based on the verticals you re filling  So it s not anything that s artificially low or lower than the acceptable range  It s in the range based on the verticals that we provided and that    we actually talked about this pre call  we do run into this area where you kind of get a nuance of approaching to  15 million and it doesn t look like it moved  But if you took it out past that decimal point on  15 million  you d see that there was actually a pretty decent move on it Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Our ARPUs are generally holding both in an aggregate level as well as per vertical Greg Burns    Sidoti   Company  LLC    AnalystOkay  thanks  And then lastly  what was the rate on the debt Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerIt was    it s a tiered structure on the debt based on our leverage position  The coming out was 2 25 plus and then as our leverage goes down  it will    it will stagger itself down from there Greg Burns    Sidoti   Company  LLC    AnalystOkay  thank you Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorThank you  Your next question comes from David Gearhart of First Analysis  Your question please David Gearhart    First Analysis Securities Corp     AnalystHi  good afternoon  Thank you for taking my questions  My first question relates to the IoT Solutions business  I know you ve said that it should ramp sequentially as you go through the year  In the past you said 20   last quarter I think you said 15  plus  Can you give us an update on that estimated growth rate that we should kind of think about as a CAGR Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerYeah  there s really no update to that    to the estimate from last quarter kind of consistent with our reiteration of the annual guidance  So we do expect    it is going to vary depending upon what portion of the market relax a bundled or OpEx pricing model  but with the take rates we ve assumed which are going to be more directed toward the food or restaurant segments that   that will still be able to hold those expectations David Gearhart    First Analysis Securities Corp     AnalystGot it  And then lastly from me  it s been a while since you ve talked about the mature legacy business as part of Digi  Wondering if you could give us an update in terms of where it stands in terms of absolute revenue and the percentage declines  something we can model out the drag and kind of when you should see relief from that drag Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s a really good question because what s happening is the Opengear portfolio really really fits nicely into that product family  There s also some active dialog on the sales forces of Digi and Opengear  what set of products do each sales force want to take advantage of  It s a little bit early and we want to be very sensitive to how Opengear runs our business and vice versa  In our    in our model  we assumed a 5  to 10  decline in our network business  which is consistent with previous years  We have done some new product introductions  our Anywhere USB and Connect IT  which we think can have the potential to moderate that type of trajectory  But we    we also are reviewing that with the Opengear team to make sure we ve got a good go to market  There are a number of Digi customers  for example  that could benefit from the Opengear solution and in some cases  as I mentioned earlier  we could complement Opengear solution with cellular routers from our Digi portfolio David Gearhart    First Analysis Securities Corp     AnalystThanks for the color  That s it from me OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  The next question comes from the line of Dick Ryan of Dougherty  Your line is open Dick Ryan    Dougherty   Company    AnalystThank you  So  just a housekeeping one  Jamie  I m not sure I caught or if you provided the services revenue in the quarter Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerAre you    Dick  for solutions or inside of IoT Products and Services Dick Ryan    Dougherty   Company    AnalystInside Product and Services Jamie Loch    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and TreasurerNo  we haven t called that out  Typically we report just the segments  And so we reported that  but we didn t call out services stand alone  I ll tell you that we have seen growth in there and    but we haven t    we haven t traditionally carved that outside of the segment Dick Ryan    Dougherty   Company    AnalystOkay  thank you  Ron  your ES G documentation obviously  that s kind of an investment focus  People are looking at what s your    what are your expectations for your documentation when will you provide and what are you hoping to do there Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s a good question  We re early in this    in this journey and I think that the good news is we have a number of actions and accomplishments that we have already implemented or have taken advantage of  that are consistent with  I think some really nice ESG programs  And we expect really on a quarterly basis to give at least some updates on the program and have it documented on our website  And again a lot of these things  we just moved into a a Gold Leaf headquarters  We do have a a diverse independent Board  we re active in many of our communities and with our employees and so we re going to provide data to back up these things  In addition to the spirit of our policies and one of the challenge as you ve seen from some announcements is they re bold on ambition but lack maybe some data points  And one of the objectives we have is to really provide data to back up any statements that we have Dick Ryan    Dougherty   Company    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  At this time  I d like to turn the call back over to Ron Konezny for closing remarks  Sir Ron Konezny    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Latif  In closing  I want to thank the entire Digi team  our customers and our partners  We are steadfast in our commitment to profitable growth and to building shareholder value  Thank you and have a good evening Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  36 minutesCall participants Jamie Loch
