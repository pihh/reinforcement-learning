105930,327445,HOPE,Top 10 U S  Small Cap ETFs,opinion,There are currently over 50 U S  Small Cap issues whether categorized as growth  value or blend  This is overwhelming for most investors  Using our long experience as an ETF publication  we try to help select those ETFs that matter even if they might be repetitive  The result is a more manageable list of issues from which to choose  We stick with the  blend  category since they should satisfy most investor needs  We believe these constitute the best index based offerings individuals and financial advisors may utilize  Uniquely  investors should remember  small cap issues usually carry higher beta  volatility or higher risk levels  than their large cap peers  This means during times of higher economic growth combined with accommodative Fed monetary policies  returns in this sector will outperform larger cap issues  But  the opposite situation does occur  should conditions reverse   Investors should remain aware of these risk characteristics One thing you ll note is similarities in trends and performance in the charts posted below  This isn t a coincidence given overall index constituents We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average  When prices are above the moving average  stay long  and when below remain in cash or short  Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high  but  this is not our approach For traders and investors wishing to hedge  leveraged and inverse issues are available to utilize from ProShares and Direxion and where

Officer  Chief Credit Officer  Peter Koh  is also here with us today and will participate in the Q A session With that  let me turn the call over to Kevin Kim  Kevin Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Angie  Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us today Let s begin with Slide 3  Our fourth quarter results capped a successful year of consistent execution on our strategic priorities for enhancing the value of the Bank of Hope franchise  We continued to deliver a high level of profitability  generating  43 million in net income or  0 34 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019  This reflects a slight improvement over the  42 6 million or  0 34 in the preceding third quarter Taking a step back and looking at the full year  you may recall  on our fourth quarter earnings call last January  we discussed a number of key priorities for the year  I m very pleased to report that we have made excellent progress on these initiatives  First and most notably  over the course of 2019  we dramatically improved our core deposits  particularly at the branch level where we are having a great deal of success in attracting retail depositors to our lower cost deposit accounts During 2019  we increased our money market and NOW deposit balances by 31   our savings deposits by 21  and our non interest bearing deposits by 2   This strong growth in core deposits enabled us to significantly reduce our dependence on higher costing time deposits  As a result  at the end of 2019  time deposits have declined to 41 2  of our total deposits  down from 48 3  at the end of the prior year  The success we had in executing on our core deposit gathering initiatives proved critical in helping us to better manage our deposit costs  which plateaued during the third quarter of 2019 and then declined significantly during the fourth quarter Second  another key priority was tightly managing our non interest expense levels  Through a consistent focus on enhancing efficiencies throughout our organization  we were able to reduce our non interest expense as a percentage of average assets to 1 86  for the year  down from 1 88  in 2018  We were able to achieve this improvement despite the ongoing investments and continued spending on projects  including the implementation of CECL And third  which is always a priority for Hope Bancorp  was effective capital management  Through our stock repurchase program and attractive dividend  we returned  84 7 million of capital to shareholders in 2019 while maintaining strong capital ratios to support future growth Moving on to Slide 4  in addition to the success we have had in gathering lower cost deposits  we were able to be more active in our loan production  As a result  we generated a record level of loan originations in the fourth quarter  We had  848 million in new loan originations funded in the fourth quarter  up from  694 million in the preceding third quarter  We also saw a record level of payoffs  which totaled  486 million in the fourth quarter  up from  461 million in the prior quarter  Aggregate payoffs and paydowns totaled  668 million in the fourth quarter versus  633 million in the preceding quarter We continued to see the large mainstream banks targeting smaller lending opportunities than they have in the past and offering very aggressive pricing to win deals  However  with our record level of loan originations  our total loans increased  171 million or 1 4  from the end of the preceding quarter  This equates to 5 7  on an annualized basis Looking at the breakdown of our loan production by major category  we continue to have a well balanced mix of new loan originations  Commercial real estate loans comprised 61  of total production in the quarter  Commercial loans accounted for 31  and consumer loans  comprised primarily of residential mortgage loans  accounted for 8   We originated  530 million in CRE loans for the quarter  up from  349 million in the preceding third quarter  With the lower interest rate  we saw a modest increase in the demand for CRE loans and we capitalized on some attractive opportunities in a number of areas  including hospitality  mixed use facilities and warehouses We had another strong quarter of C I loan originations  We funded  266  Phonetic  million in new C I production in the fourth quarter  In addition to the expansion of our Corporate Banking Group targeting lending opportunities with middle market mainstream entities  we have also been focused on building on our relationships with existing seasoned operators of top tier franchises  which has been contributing to our C I loan production Turning to our SBA business  we originated  62 million in SBA loans  which reflects an increase from  55 million in the preceding third quarter  And since we are retaining this production  which is booked at higher rate than our overall average loans  we continue to see the positive impact this strategy is having on our average loan yields With that as an overview of our business development efforts  I will ask Alex to provide additional details on our financial performance for the fourth quarter  Alex Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Kevin  As I review our financial result  I will limit my discussion to just some of the more significant items in the quarter Beginning with the Slide 5  I will start with our net interest income  which totaled  113 5 million compared with  116 3 million in the preceding third quarter  This decrease was mainly due to lower interest income on loans due to the impact of the interest rate cuts in September and October Our net interest margin declined by 9 basis points to 3 16   On a core basis  excluding purchase accounting adjustment  our net interest margin declined by 10 basis points  This was relatively in line with our expectations given the impact of both the September and October rate cuts on our earnings asset yield Our core loan yield  which exclude accretion income  declined 24 basis points from the preceding third quarter  This was driven by the repricing on our variable rate loans following the September and October rate cuts  the payoffs of higher yielding loans and lower rate on new originations in the lower interest rate environment  This was partially offset by a substantial decline in our cost of deposits due to the mix    funding mix that Kevin discussed Our cost of deposits declined 13 basis point from the prior quarter to 1 49   And I would note that  this is the first quarter over quarter decrease in deposit costs in three years  The last time deposit costs declined was in the fourth quarter of 2016  when the total cost of deposits decreased by 1 basis point As we guided last quarter  our total cost of deposits has continued its downward trend since the peak in July 2019  On a month by month basis  our cost of deposits was 1 54  in October  1 49  in November and 1 44  in December 2019  With a full quarter impact of October rate cut and assuming no further changes in the Fed Funds rate  we expect to see a decline in our net interest margin  excluding accretion income of approximately 2 basis points to 3 basis points in the first quarter of 2020 Now moving on to Slide 6  our non interest income was  13 million  essentially unchanged from the preceding third quarter  The primary variance from the preceding quarter was a  1 1 million increase in the net gain on sale of other loans  During the quarter  total sales of mortgage loans amounted to  32 5 million compared with  30 9 million in the preceding quarter In addition  we completed note sale of an aggregate  26 million of CRE loans  which had been transferred to loans held for sale at the end of the 2019 third quarter  This increase in gain on sale of other loans was partially offset by a  900 000 decline in swap fee income quarter over quarter  which reduced our other income and fees Moving on to non interest expenses on Slide 7  Our non interest expense was  70 4 million  up modestly from the preceding third quarter  In terms of significant variances  our salaries and employee benefit expenses declined by  1 8 million due to lower levels of retirement benefit expenses as well as lower self funded group insurance cost  which fluctuates each quarter based on the volume of insurance claims in a given quarter  These declines were offset by an increase in our FDIC assessment fees  for which we reported no expense in the third quarter of 2019  We utilized the remainder of our small bank assessment credit to offset some but not all of our assessment fee expenses this quarter And now  we also had an increase in credit related expenses and a lower amount of OREO related income driven by fluctuation in OREO fair value adjustments  For the quarter  our non interest expense to average asset ratio was 1 85   unchanged from last quarter which reflects our continued success in expense management Now moving on to Slide 8  I will discuss some of our key deposit trends  Our total deposits increased by approximately 2 4  from the end of the prior quarter with all of the growth coming in our lower cost categories  Our non interest bearing deposits increased 2 5  in the quarter  while money market and NOW deposits  and savings account balances increased by 6 2  and 5 7   respectively  As a result of the improvement in our deposit mix  non time deposits increased to 58 8  of our total deposits compared with 57 6  at the end of the prior quarter We also continue to see positive trends in the repricing gap on time deposit renewals or the delta between a CD expiring rate and the renewal rate  During the fourth quarter  renewed CDs were issued at a weighted average rate that was 59 basis point lower than the weighted average rate on those CDs that matured  As a result  the average cost of our time deposits declined 4 basis points from the preceding quarter Now moving on to Slide 9  I ll review our asset quality  Overall  our asset quality remains healthy and we continue to see positive trends  Our total criticized loans declined by another  7 7 million and now at a lowest levels since our MOE in 2016  However  our non performing loans increased by  20 7 million from the end of the prior quarter  Approximately half of the increase was attributable to a  10 million construction loan that matured before the completion of the projects  We chose not to extend the maturity date of the loan and stopped funding new advances  which dictated that we placed a loan on  Phonetic  non accrual status  The project is about 85  complete and the current appraisal data shows that we are very well secured and no impairment exists  This is another example of our effort to proactively identify and manage potentially problematic credits We are currently in a workout with a borrower with our expectation that the loan will be refinanced by another lender  The remainder of the increase in non performing loans this quarter primarily relate to temporary delays in the renewal process  which also impacted the balances of our 90 day plus delinquent loans on an accrual status  We have worked through these delays for the most part already and we expect to see this loans migrate back to performing status by the end of the month Our loss experience continues to be very low  We had just  738 000 of net charge offs in the quarter or 2 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis  For the full year  our net charge offs amounted to just 4 basis points of average loans  Given the low level of net charge offs and the lack of impairment in the new inflow into non performing loans this quarter  we had a modest loan loss provision requirement of  1 million With that  let me turn the call back to Kevin Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Alex  Let s move on to Slide 10  I will conclude with a few comments about our priorities and expectations for 2020  Similar to last year  we will be highly focused on deposit gathering and controlling expenses  And we expect to see a continuation of the positive trends we have had in both areas  We anticipate that the environment for loan growth will continue to be challenging As we expect  the transaction activity in CRE market will remain sluggish  However  we expect to be more active in new loan production in 2020  We are also focusing on better defending our existing portfolio from the high level of payoffs we have seen in recent quarters  But importantly  our focus will continue to be on generating profitable growth  We will continue to be very disciplined in the loans we originate to ensure that we meet our targeted levels of profitability  Over the last year  we have made considerable investments in expanding our lending capacity beyond our traditional core markets Our Corporate Banking Group is focused on originating C I loans and gathering corporate deposits from the middle market customer base  The experience of our expanded team of bankers has been diversified beyond financial services and now includes broader industry expertise in other areas  We believe we have established a highly scalable business model and can continue to originate loans and gather deposits without the need to hire substantially more personnel  We are also optimistic about the growth opportunities in our residential mortgage and warehouse line business  We believe that we can add a number of new clients for our warehouse line business over the course of the year  which should result in higher funding volumes that will generate interest income And in terms of our retail mortgage business  we are working to better leverage our entire branch network to generate more referrals from our existing customer base  To date  we have had most of our residential mortgage originations coming from our mortgage loan production offices  which target the mainstream customer base More recently  we have been focusing on growing our referrals that come through our Southern California branches  And we are pleased to see growing origination volumes from these business units  We believe that with some additional focus and training in our other geographic markets  we can increase the referrals generated from our branches in other parts of the country  which will have the positive impact of generating higher levels of non interest income from the gain on sale of other loans Collectively  with the contributions from our Corporate Banking Group and our warehouse line of credit business units  supplementing our traditional business lines  we believe we can generate a higher level of loan growth this year than we did in 2019  For 2020  we are budgeting for organic loan growth to range in the low  to mid single digits  And as always  we remain committed to strong capital management that includes strong shareholder returns while maintaining strong capital ratios that support our continued growth  We have an attractive dividend that currently yields approximately 4  and we plan to remain active with our  50 million share repurchase program currently in place To wrap up  we ended 2019 on a strong note and we have a lot of momentum on our key initiatives as we start 2020  We believe we are well positioned to deliver another good year for our shareholders and further enhance the value of our franchise With that  let s open up the call to answer any questions you may have  Operator  please open up the call Questions and Answers OperatorYes  thank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  And the first question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW Chris McGratty    KBW    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good afternoon  Kevin  maybe we could start    or Alex  on the margin  Obviously  the environment has got a little bit tougher for the banks  But you have this    the ability to bring down deposit costs  which you talked about in your prepared remarks  Appreciating the guidance for the first quarter  But if the rate outlook remains steady  how do we think about ultimate stability in the floor in the margin  where and kind of when Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerSure Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  As I indicated  we would expect to have continued compression next quarter given the rate cuts that we have experienced  especially October rate cut  it will continue next quarter  But as we indicated  our proactive deposit initiative as well as very disciplined pricing on the deposit  even though we have a very competitive    competition on the loan rate is very still severe  we would expect to stabilize in the second quarter of 2020 in terms of net interest margin  And then second half of the year  we would expect to start to increase Chris McGratty    KBW    AnalystOkay  great  And as rates have come down  maybe kind of a strategic question  Kevin  with the SBA business  any thoughts on potentially going back to the originating sell  Phonetic  model  Maybe comment on where you thought  I think  premiums might be today Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Yes  Because the average rate on SBA loans are considerably higher than the other loans  we have stopped selling the loans more than a year ago  And obviously  keeping this higher rate loans in our portfolio is an important element of our overall profitable growth strategy  So it is our intention to continue the retention policy for the time being  But as always  we have been very diligently monitoring the market situation and the current premiums in the secondary market is becoming better  So  we will continue to reevaluate  but at this time and for the time being  our intention is to continue to retain them on our books Chris McGratty    KBW    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Gary Tenner with D A  Davidson Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystHi  good morning  This is actually Jake Stern on for Gary  How is it going today Angie Yang    Senior Vice President  Director of Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsGood Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystGood  So  first question is the 10b5 1 trading program you announced in early December only runs through the end of January  Is it reasonable to expect you would utilize the full authorization by then or are 1Q buybacks likely closer to 4Q levels Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  as we noted in our earnings release  we were fairly active in the fourth quarter in buying back our own shares  And we will continue to remain active in the first quarter  Whether we will be able to complete that  50 million program by the end of the first quarter will depend upon the overall market activity Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  And how are you thinking about buyback once the current authorization is fully used Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe do not have any additional plan in place at this time  But as in the past  we will continue to monitor our capital situation  and I would not be surprised  Depending upon the market situation and our capital situation  the Board will consider another program later this year Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  Thanks for answering that Angie Yang    Senior Vice President  Director of Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsJust to clarify  Jake  February is not a blackout period  So the 10b5 1 ends in January and our blackout    which is when our blackout period ends Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  I appreciate you answering the question  Just another one to follow it up  What is the quarterly CD maturity schedule and expected repricing gap looking like for 2020 Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  CD  we have  let s say  starting with the first quarter of 2020  total about  1 9 billion at an average rate of 2 17  is expected to mature  And the second quarter of 2020  about  1 billion at a rate of 2 33   And Q3  it s about  1 2 billion at a rate of 2 3   And last quarter  or Q4 of 2020   960 million at a rate of 1 9   So if I just aggregate all the 2020 maturity  that is about a 2 18   total of  5 2 billion Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystI appreciate the color on that  Just one more to    and then I ll step out here  So it looks like your expense to average assets has been at the 1 85  level for the    for three of the last four quarters  Are there opportunities to lower that level further or is that the level you are comfortable operating at Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI feel comfortable operating it  but I would expect to have some improvement  And the reason for such improvement is we will continue to grow but with a profitable growth  So  as the average assets continues to grow and our very disciplined expense monitoring  especially  there is some professional fees that we are monitoring very closely and also no more need such as a CECL  we did have a sizable amount of investment in 2019  But we do not expect that happen or substantially decline in 2020  But those are some offsetting the increases such as the FDIC assessment fee and some others  So even assuming a similar level of total non interest expenses  let s say  70 million or  71 million  I would expect to see the non interest expense over average asset ratio slightly below that 1 85  Jake Stern    D A  Davidson    AnalystWonderful  I appreciate you guys for answering my questions Angie Yang    Senior Vice President  Director of Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsThank you OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And the next question comes Steve Marascia with Cap Security  Phonetic  Management Steve Marascia    Capitol Securities Management    AnalystGood afternoon  everyone  Just couple of questions  What percentage of your loans for the past quarter were fixed versus variable  And how do you see that trending during the next 12 months  And also  what yields are you anticipating from the loan portfolio going forward  lower or higher from the current level of 5 04  Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  Let me start with the mix of the fixed and the variable rate loan  But as you know  we have mortgage loans  so let me break into fixed  hybrid and variable  So hybrid  what I mean is it is hybrid  but if it is at a fixed rate  let s say  first five years fixed and then variable  it s called hybrid  But if it is within the fixed  we call it as a fixed  So total fixed percent    fixed rate is 24  at a rate of about 4 6   and hybrid is 37  and the variable is 39  And that 39  of  Phonetic   4 8 billion of variable rate loans consisted of mainly prime based and also LIBOR based  So out of that entire variable rate loan  about 55  of loans are based on the prime  and the remaining is based on the LIBOR and some other indexes  But the other index is very minor  So that s the kind of composition of the fixed and the variable And I think you did asked the second question about the loan pricing or the loan volume Angie Yang    Senior Vice President  Director of Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsThe yield expectation for loan   Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo  going forward  who knows how the interest rate will be in the next 12 month or so  but the competition on the lending side is still very competitive  So I don t think in the rules  Phonetic  did increase on our loan yield  More realistically  we will see a small compression on our loan yields Steve Marascia    Capitol Securities Management    AnalystAnd final question from me  You have    what is your dividend policy going forward  because you haven t raised the dividend in six quarters  What would be your criteria for potential dividend increases going forward Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe factor into a lot of considerations when we determine the dividend rate  And as I mentioned in the script  our current dividend yield is around 4  and which is pretty good compared to other    compared with other players in the market  And we also look at our overall capital position  And dividend is one way of returning returns to our shareholders  but there will be other methods  And currently  the  0 14 per quarter is the good level of dividend payout we believe  So unless there is a dramatic change in the market situation or our capital position  I think that will continue for the time being Steve Marascia    Capitol Securities Management    AnalystOkay Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo the dividend payout ratio is at 41   which we believe that s very healthy  And also just to add  we have active in the share repurchase programs  And as Mr  Kim indicated  as needed  we will continue maximize our level of capital through either dividend or share repurchase and so forth Steve Marascia    Capitol Securities Management    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much  I appreciate it OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Tim Coffey with Janney Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everybody Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerHey  Tim  Good morning Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystLooking at the decline in the gas station and car wash loans  down about  135 million   136 million last year  What are some of the dynamics that are bringing those balances down Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe are looking at different marketplaces  And depending on the industry and things  we are trying to tighten up in certain areas we do see some risk  We have not made any proactive efforts strategically to bring down some of those balances  But we are also just    looking at the industry  we are also looking at the competition in terms of how aggressive they re getting  And I think you re seeing some of the competitiveness show up in terms of our balances there But we don t see in terms of the overall market  We have concerns  as we stated before  in terms of where we are in the overall cycle  But in terms of the general markets and the industries  we don t see any big concerns in those balances  I think it s more of a reflection of the competition Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystAnd if I may  the competition that is  I guess  driving that market right now  are those local banks or more national banks Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe re in a position where we see the competition from various places  So we are seeing some of the large banks competing for our space  but we also have the smaller banks  So we do see a variety of all size banks Tim Coffey    Janney    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you  The rest of my questions have been answered Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you Angie Yang    Senior Vice President  Director of Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsThank you Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And the next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler Bob Shone    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  This is actually Bob Shone on for Matthew  How are you guys doing Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Bob Shone    Piper Sandler    AnalystI just was wondering if you guys had a CECL update for us and any implementation guidance you can give Alex Ko    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  We did kind of disclosed in the past and we are in a good shape in terms of the progress there because we are doing the second parallel run testing and there is not much changes from the previous  Our expectation is says  Phonetic  about the allowance for loan losses might increase on day one through the CECL implementation  about 30  to 40  increase  But it is subject to change  And the capital impact from the CECL is kind of relatively minor  So I don t think there is any major changes from previous conversation  And I do not expect a major changes going forward as well Bob Shone    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  thanks  And if I could sneak one more in  Regarding the strength of your customers  have you seen positive trends in the cash flow ratios and loan to values of your customers  or how has that trended over the past couple of quarters Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe see in certain areas a much stronger cash flow continuing  Phonetic  I think in hospitality space  particularly  It s been a very good industry so far  And so  I think    generally speaking  I think they ve been pretty stable  I think we are seeing some industries that are showing improvements as hospitality  as I mentioned before  But we have    we are not seeing any like major changes  I guess  if that s the question you re asking  I think basically  we are seeing positive or stable trends across industries Bob Shone    Piper Sandler    AnalystAll right  thanks  I ll step back OperatorThank you  And that does conclude our question and answer session  So I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments Kevin S  Kim    President   Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thank you  Once again  everyone  thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again in three months  So long  everyone Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  42 minutesCall participants Angie Yang    Senior Vice President  Director of Investor Relations

105934,327449,HOPE,Is Hope Bancorp  HOPE  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Hope Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ HOPE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Hope Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 69  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 15  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Hope Bancorp s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 12 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 62  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Hope Bancorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 04  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  so it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Hope Bancorp has a P S ratio of 2 52  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 33x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Hope Bancorp currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Hope Bancorp a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Hope Bancorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of C  This gives HOPE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  While the current quarter estimate has seen one upward and four downward movements  the current year estimate has seen three upward and three downward movements over the past two months This has had a negative effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus dropped 6 1  over the past two months  the current year estimate has inched down 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Hope Bancorp  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite such negative analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHope Bancorp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 20  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  industry rank and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of
