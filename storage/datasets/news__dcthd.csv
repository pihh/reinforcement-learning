1815,223330,DCTHD,Delcath s Melblez Kit Rejected  Profusely  By FDA,opinion,The FDA Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting held today  May 2nd  2013  to review the NDA submitted by Delcath Systems  DCTH  resulting in 16 0 vote against the Melblez Kit in terms of demonstrated benefits versus potential risks given the clinical trial materials included in briefing materials  2013  The Melblez Kit  which was formerly known as CHEMOSAT  is a hybrid drug device product that utilizes percutaneous hepatic perfusion  PHP  to deliver high doses of a chemotherapeutic agent directly to the liver  The product is designed to reduce the unwanted side effects of chemotherapy as a result of introduction of toxic agents into the rest of patients  bodies while maximizing the efficiency of a chemotherapeutic regimen to patients  livers  Specifically  the company chose Mephalan  aka Alkeran  as its chemotherapeutic agent  From the briefing documents   Melphalan was selected as the chemotherapeutic agent for PHP treatment because it binds melanin precursors  is an alkylating agent with a steep dose response  Teicher et al  1988   and has been used successfully in an analogous regional procedure  IHP  for treating unresectable hepatic metastases from melanoma  Trading was halted just before 1 00 PM EST for shares of DCTH  As initially mentioned on the update on Catalyst Watch update on April 30th  the market had already reduced the valuation of Delcath significantly after the release of the FDA briefing documents  DCTH is already down  47  since Monday s open  although the extremely negative vote on the Melblez NDA is likely to bring the stock even lower  The PDUFA goal date for Melblez isn t until September 13th 2013  While the FDA is not required to follow the advice of the advisory panel  it is extremely likely that Delcath will receive a CRL based on the adverse events that were seen during the clinical development process  The proposed REMS that was submitted along with the Melblez NDA was also deemed insufficient to mitigate the risks of a commercial launch of the Melblez Kit  These risks are outlined with results from Phase I studies   The most common adverse events were hematologic events  including thrombocytopenia  neutropenia  febrile neutropenia  and anemia  and increases in liver function tests  bilirubin  AST  and ALT   Table 26   Thrombocytopenia  neutropenia  and febrile neutropenia were predominantly grade 4 events whereas anemia was predominantly a grade 3 event   Details on the REMS    A REMS for the melphalan PHP System has been issued by FDA to communicate important safety messages and safe use conditions for melphalan PHP treatment to healthcare providers by the following     Informing healthcare providers of the risks of hepatic failure  gastric ulceration  coagulation bleeding diatheses  and procedural complications associated with the melphalan PHP system drug device combination product    Ensuring dispensing of the melphalan PHP system only to specially certified hospitals    Ensuring only appropriately trained and certified team members  interventional radiologist  anesthesiologist  perfusionist  and medical or surgical oncologist  participate in procedural aspects and administration of melphalan PHP treatment As of their latest 10 K filing  reporting the company s balance sheet up to December 31st 2012  the company held  23 7M in cash and cash equivalents and had total stockholder s equity of  20 M  If investors ultimately believe that the Meblez Kit developmental program cannot be salvaged after a CRL  the stock may move closer to an enterprise value of zero  DCTH is likely to open lower tomorrow ,2013-05-03,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delcath’s-melblez-kit-rejected-(profusely)-by-fda-165483,165483

1993,223508,DCTHD,Medical Device Stocks Looking Very Attractive,opinion,Looking through my biotech stock watchlist  I ve been noticing that pharmaceutical stocks have been having a great year as a whole  While I believe that the sector is very attractive for investment based on the  health  of the healthcare industry  no pun intended   I ve noticed that there are quite a few medical device companies that might make long term buys  Here are 4 companies that caught my interest  and may become additions to my own portfolio in the near future   1   Delcath Systems  DCTH  Delcath is a medical device company that I was considering for a buy since the start of this year  and unfortunately I ve already missed a lot of the upside  DCTH is up 73  YTD  Despite this  I think the company has more upside potential ahead of its PDUFA goal date of June 15  2013 for CHEMOSAT  Even after its big rally  DCTH s market capitalization is only  160 million  I think this could jump to  200 million or more just with anticipation of the PDUFA action date   CHEMOSAT is a delivery system that aims to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to patients with liver cancer while reducing the side effects  This is achieved through isolation of the blood supply of patients  livers  which is then pumped into the CHEMOSAT system itself   What makes me bullish on Delcath is the potential for adaptation of this device following potential FDA approval later this year due to the adverse side effects of traditional chemotherapeutic regimens  In general  I also think that liver cancer is one of the better indications for companies to target in the cancer space from a financial perspective due to the difficulty in treating it as well as the alarmingly low 5 year survival rate   2   PLC Systems  PLCSF   PLC medical systems is developing a device known as RenalGuard to address a very specific problem known as contrast induced nephropathy  which threatens patients undergoing particular cardiac and vascular imaging procedures  The toxicity of certain contrast agents is enough to adversely affect the kidneys of 10 20  of at risk patients  according to PLC s own estimates   What I find especially intriguing about PLC systems is the valuation of the company relative to the huge market potential of the CIN indication  which could be as high as  500 million in annual revenues  PLC systems has a market capitalization of  12 18 million  Yahoo finance is wrong   and seems to be attracting a bit more attention after its recent  4 million financing   It s also worth noting that PLC s RenalGuard is already approved in Europe  which is providing the company with some revenue prior to the potential FDA clearance next year  While PLCSF is a very risky play  I think there is massive upside potential if the company plays its card right with the FDA   3   Sunshine Heart  SSH  Sunshine is another medical device company with a small market capitalization     58 million  that targets a huge market with its C PULSE heart assist system  Heart failure has been a very tough indication for medical device companies  although the difficulty factor also reduces Sunshine s competition if it were to hit the market   C PULSE has recently started enrollment for their big pivotal trial for C PULSE  and results are expected in 2016 according to the FDA  While this is a long wait  I think that SSH might be a decent play on anticipation of these phase III results alone   It s also worth noting that C PULSE has already been cleared in Europe  although it  and many other  medical devices have trouble gaining the kind of traction there that they would in the United States  This is something that C PULSE actually shares in common with both CHEMOSAT and RenalGuard ,2013-03-18,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/medical-device-stocks-looking-very-attractive-159272,159272
