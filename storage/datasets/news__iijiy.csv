4049,225564,IIJIY,Pitney Bowes  PBI  Q1 Earnings  Revenues Lag  View Intact,opinion,Pitney Bowes Inc    NYSE PBI   reported first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 34 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents by 17 1   Also  on a year over year basis  adjusted earnings declined 15  Incremental advertising expenses and absence of earnings from Imagitas that was sold in May last year proved to be a major drag on earnings  Also  the dismal top line performance compounded the earnings decline Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenue in the quarter was  844 6 million  down 5 2  year over year on a reported basis  Also  on a constant currency basis  revenues fell 4   The top line took a beating due to the company s exit from direct operations in Mexico  South Africa and five markets in Asia  Absence of revenues from these geographic segments made year over year comparisons difficult  Also  currency fluctuations impacted revenues adversely As for the segments  on a reported basis  Small and Medium Business   SMB   Solutions revenues slipped 5  year over year to  453 million  Softness in the North American Mailing business  down 3   stemming from a decline in recurring revenue streams proved to be a major drag Also  the decline in recurring revenue streams hurt the International mailing business  down 11    worsening the fall  However  new go to market strategy and improving equipment sales in certain geographies including France  Germany and Japan arrested the sales decline at this segment to a great extent Enterprise Business Solutions   EBS   revenues declined 2 7  year over year to  215 million  This segment s production mail business  down 12   was hit by fewer equipment installations on account of unfavorable timing of deal closures  However  this decline was partially offset by an uptick in Presort Services  up 5    mainly driven by higher volumes of First Class and expansion into the St  Louis market The Digital Commerce Solutions reported an 8 6  year over year rise in sales to  176 million  A fall in sales from Software solutions  down 10   was more than offset by a rise in sales from global e commerce business  up 30    thereby driving an overall increase  Smaller number of large licensing deals and lower data related revenues resulted in the lackluster performance of the Software solutions business This sub segment particularly benefited from the Borderfree acquisition and growth in U K  revenues  In addition  a surge in retail clients and robust outbound U S  package shipments proved to be major growth drivers at the segment Notable ActivitiesPitney Bowes fortified its shipping logistics portfolio with the acquisition of Enroute Systems Corporation  a cloud based  software as a service enterprise retail and fulfillment solutions company  The deal will help Pitney Bowes enhance the shopping experience for clients across channels by integrating a range of physical and digital processes in the fulfillment management chain Moreover  the company launched the Clarity solutions suite that will utilize the power of Industrial Internet to transform the production mail industry  The offering is expected to be commercially available from the first quarter of 2016 in North America and from the second quarter in Europe  The suite will be launched globally in 2017  Also  the company announced that its EngageOne Video solutions are to be deployed by American Family Insurance as well as financial services and technology company   The Bancorp Meanwhile  Bancorp announced that it will leverage Pitney Bowes  EngageOne Video interactive video solution in order to deliver a distinctive educational resource for clients in the company s Institutional Banking practice Liquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Mar 31  2016  adjusted free cash flow was  60 2 million compared with  84 9 million as of Mar  31  2015 As of Mar 31  2016  the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  613 0 million compared with the year ago tally of  650 5 million  Long term debt as of Mar 31  2016  was  2 775 2 million  up from  2 489 6 million as of Mar  31  2015 OutlookPitney Bowes has reiterated its 2016 earnings guidance in the range of  1 80  2 00  on both adjusted and GAAP basis  Moreover  the revenue projection is maintained in the range of a decline of 1  to 2  growth from the 2015 level Double digit growth in the Digital Commerce Solutions is expected to boost revenues in 2016  excluding the impact of currency  While the company expects flat to modest growth in the Enterprise Business Solutions segment  SMB Solutions is expected to see a low single digit decline In addition  implementation of the new ERP program is expected to slash SG A expenses in the second half of 2016  which in turn  should drive margins  However  incremental marketing expenses related to the new advertising campaign can prove to be a drag Our TakeExpectedly  Pitney Bowes faced the brunt of the weak performance by its software business during the quarter  Additionally  escalating operating and marketing expenses have impacted financials  Meanwhile  the planned ERP implementation in the U S  is driving operating expenses while aggressive advertising and marketing strategies are also proving be challenging  Benefits from the ongoing ERP materialization in the Canada and the U S  are expected to materialize in the second half of 2016 while a rise in marketing expenses throughout first quarter 2016 is likely to hurt margins Despite these negatives  improving equipment sales in North America Mailing business during the quarter signals that the restructuring activities undertaken by the company are gradually paying off  Also  Pitney Bowes believes that the implementation of the  go to market  strategies in major markets  expansion of the Presort Services network  robust pipeline of product launches and the acquisition of Borderfree  Real Time Content  RTC  and Enroute Systems Corporation are expected to supplement top line performance in full year 2016 Pitney Bowes currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Better ranked

4334,225849,IIJIY,5 ADRs That More Than Doubled The S P 500 In 2018,opinion,According to the European Central Bank  ECB   the global economy is likely to cool down next year  The comments were made in an economic bulletin released on Thursday and are in keeping with investor expectations  Given this backdrop  the U S  economy looks like a safe bet for 2019 since GDP is likely to decline but remain firm However  the recent turbulence in U S  markets left investors scurrying for cover  The situation has worsened particularly over the last few months and currently  all major benchmarks are in the red year to date  The S P 500 is down 7 5  over this period  But can domestic investors afford to indulge in foreign diversification On closer examination  some economies do offer a glimmer of hope  since they are expected to perform well or show resilience in 2019  These include Japan  Ireland and India  Investing in stocks from these countries  which have beaten the S P 500 this year by a wide margin  looks like a smart choice Global Economic Slowdown Likely in 2019Per the ECB   global economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2019 and remain steady thereafter   However   inflationary pressures  in the Eurozone and the world at large will persist next year  Recently  the ECB decided to end its bond purchases but said it will continue to reinvest maturity proceeds for an extended period after its first rate hike  The comments about the global economy were made in this connection The views of the International Monetary Fund  IMF  about next year s growth prospects are in consonance with the ECB s  According to the IMF  the global economy will expand at 3 7  next year  This represents marginal softening since the IMF had initially pegged global growth for 2019 at 3 9   Investors and analysts think that the projected slowdown is attributable to a spike in borrowing costs for dollar debtors and U S  China trade tensions  Skepticism about trade relations between the two global powers persists despite recent assuagements from key figures in the Trump administration  Meanwhile  the dollar has surged this year on the back of a strong U S  economy and shows no signs of backing down Japan  India  Ireland Offer HopeHowever  doom and gloom aren t in the cards for economies across the board in 2019  Japan  for instance is likely to grow at a solid space  even though some critics predict a marginal slowdown  According to Japan s government  the country s economy will expand at 0 8  till next March and by 1 3  in fiscal 2019 The optimistic view on Japan assumes that the U S  economy  the engine of global growth  will remain robust  President Trump is likely to utilize every single policy measure to boost the economy ahead of his re election bid  Further  Japan s government will take several steps to mitigate the impact of a proposed sales tax hike next year  Overall  analysts think Japan faces fewer headwinds than other economies Meanwhile  India s pace of expansion will decline but remain impressive in 2019  per the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD   While India s GDP came in at 6 7  in 2017 2018  its economy is projected to expand 7 3  next year  Key structural reforms and credible inflation targeting are some of the factors likely to boost growth  The U S  China trade war is likely to benefit India s exports  Coming to Ireland  EY DKM Economic Advisory predicts Ireland s economy will expand by 4 2  in 2019  According to EY Ireland s chief economist Neil Gibson  the country s economy is in a  positon of strength   Further   domestic strength provides Ireland with short term insulation against a slowdown globally   Notably  employment is expected to expand at 2 7  while wage growth will increase by 3 6  next year  Our ChoicesGlobal economic growth is likely to taper off next year even as the U S  economy cools but remains firm  However  the recent market turbulence will have investors looking for international diversification  The economies of India  Japan and Ireland are likely to remain robust in 2019 and remain lucrative investment destinations Adding stocks from these countries which have more than doubled the S P 500 this year would make for a prudent choice  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

5 ADRs that More than Doubled the S P 500 in 2018
 
 
According to the European Central Bank  ECB   the global economy is likely to cool down next year  The comments were made in an economic bulletin released on Thursday and are in keeping with investor expectations  Given this backdrop  the U S  economy looks like a safe bet for 2019 since GDP is likely to decline but remain firm 
 
 However  the recent turbulence in U S  markets left investors scurrying for cover  The situation has worsened particularly over the last few months and currently  all major benchmarks are in the red year to date  The S P 500 is down 7 5  over this period  But can domestic investors afford to indulge in foreign diversification 
 
 
On closer examination  some economies do offer a glimmer of hope  since they are expected to perform well or show resilience in 2019  These include Japan  Ireland and India  Investing in stocks from these countries  which have beaten the S P 500 this year by a wide margin  looks like a smart choice 
 
 
Global Economic Slowdown Likely in 2019
 
 
Per the ECB   global economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2019 and remain steady thereafter   However   inflationary pressures  in the Eurozone and the world at large will persist next year  Recently  the ECB decided to end its bond purchases but said it will continue to reinvest maturity proceeds for an extended period after its first rate hike  The comments about the global economy were made in this connection 
 
 
The views of the International Monetary Fund  IMF  about next year s growth prospects are in consonance with the ECB s  According to the IMF  the global economy will expand at 3 7  next year  This represents marginal softening since the IMF had initially pegged global growth for 2019 at 3 9   
 
 
Investors and analysts think that the projected slowdown is attributable to a spike in borrowing costs for dollar debtors and U S  China trade tensions  Skepticism about trade relations between the two global powers persists despite recent assuagements from key figures in the Trump administration  Meanwhile  the dollar has surged this year on the back of a strong U S  economy and shows no signs of backing down 
 
 
Japan  India  Ireland Offer Hope
 
 
However  doom and gloom aren t in the cards for economies across the board in 2019  Japan  for instance is likely to grow at a solid space  even though some critics predict a marginal slowdown  According to Japan s government  the country s economy will expand at 0 8  till next March and by 1 3  in fiscal 2019 
 
 
The optimistic view on Japan assumes that the U S  economy  the engine of global growth  will remain robust  President Trump is likely to utilize every single policy measure to boost the economy ahead of his re election bid  Further  Japan s government will take several steps to mitigate the impact of a proposed sales tax hike next year  Overall  analysts think Japan faces fewer headwinds than other economies 
 
 
Meanwhile  India s pace of expansion will decline but remain impressive in 2019  per the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD   While India s GDP came in at 6 7  in 2017 2018  its economy is projected to expand 7 3  next year  Key structural reforms and credible inflation targeting are some of the factors likely to boost growth  The U S  China trade war is likely to benefit India s exports  
 
 
Coming to Ireland  EY DKM Economic Advisory predicts Ireland s economy will expand by 4 2  in 2019  According to EY Ireland s chief economist Neil Gibson  the country s economy is in a  positon of strength   Further   domestic strength provides Ireland with short term insulation against a slowdown globally   Notably  employment is expected to expand at 2 7  while wage growth will increase by 3 6  next year  
 
 
Our Choices
 
 
Global economic growth is likely to taper off next year even as the U S  economy cools but remains firm  However  the recent market turbulence will have investors looking for international diversification  The economies of India  Japan and Ireland are likely to remain robust in 2019 and remain lucrative investment destinations
