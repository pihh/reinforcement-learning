102438,323953,XEL,Bobrovsky  streaking Panthers set sights on Wild,news,"The Florida Panthers spent all of last week battling a goaltender problem  but Sergei Bobrovsky provided some necessary relief on Saturday night in Detroit 
Bobrovsky  who is the main source of Florida s difficulty in net  was back in the crease after missing two games with an upper body injury  The two time Vezina Trophy recipient registered 27 saves as the Panthers earned an important 4 1 win over the reeling Red Wings 
The Panthers will need a similar showing Monday when Florida visits the Minnesota Wild in Saint Paul  Minn 
Bobrovsky  who signed a seven year   70 million contract  was injured last weekend prior to the Panthers  game Sunday against Atlantic Division rival Toronto  Florida s high flying offense staked goaltender Chris Driedger to a six goal lead  however  and the club went on to post an 8 4 win over the Maple Leafs 
With Sam Montembeault again as his backup Thursday against Los Angeles  Driedger was injured in the game s first 10 minutes  Montembeault  23  came on in relief and held down the crease in Florida s 4 3 win over the Kings 
But Saturday s news on Driedger wasn t good  The 25 year old Winnipeg native s lower body injury will keep him out at least a couple of weeks  turning over more of the work to Montembeault 
Bobrovsky was exactly what Florida needed Saturday  yielding just a breakaway goal to Dylan Larkin as a penalty ended  The 31 year old Russian also stuffed a pair of breakaways with his club up nursing a 2 1 lead in the third period 
 I missed only two games  but it feels like I haven t played for a whole month   Bobrovsky said   The guys helped me get into the game  the  penalty kill  was pretty good and we scored important goals  especially the third one  
Florida s potent power play  which failed to score on its first five man advantages  gave the Panthers some breathing room when it tallied on its sixth and final one for a 3 1 edge with 6 55 left in regulation  Captain Aleksander Barkov chipped in defenseman Keith Yandle s point shot for the goal 
The Panthers bring their season best four game winning streak to  Xcel Energy   NASDAQ XEL  Center  and the Wild have now won two straight after dropping four a in a row  0 3 1  
Minnesota owns a 10 0 2 career home mark against Florida  with the Panthers  most recent victory being a 3 2 shootout win on March 9  2010 
The Wild are also coming off their most dominating performance this season  Saturday night s 7 0 trouncing of the visiting Dallas Stars  It was the second time in franchise history Minnesota recorded a 7 0 shutout 
Seven different Wild players scored  with Jason Zucker recording in a three point performance  one goal  two assists  
Goalie Alex Stalock stopped all 27 shots by the Stars to record his second shutout this season and seventh career  He moved to 7 1 1 with a 2 10 goals against average and  924 save percentage at home 
Minnesota coach Bruce Boudreau said he was happy to see his squad put together a complete effort 
 We ve played games 45 minutes  55 minutes  but you had that lull  I never felt there was a lull  tonight  where we were doing the wrong things and we got carried away  cheating the game type thing   Boudreau said   I thought we played the right way for 60 minutes

your questions Today  we will discuss and review our 2019 results  update you on financial plans and objectives  share recent business and regulatory developments  Slides that accompany today s call are available on our website As a reminder  some of the comments during today s conference call may contain forward looking information  Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC  On today s call  we will discuss certain metrics that are non GAAP measures  including ongoing earnings in electric and natural gas margins  Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release I ll now turn the call over to Ben Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you  Paul  and good morning  everyone  2019 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments  Let me share a few  We delivered EPS of  2 64 in 2019  which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance We raised our annual divided by  0 10 per share  which is the 16th straight year we ve increased our dividend  Our stock hit an all time high of  66 05 in September and subsequently hit all time new high of  67 69 this week  We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32   Our O M declined almost 1  even while making incremental investments in our system  The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of a Longroad Wind asset  and finally we resolved multiple rate cases We also had a strong year operationally  We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail  Lake Benton and Hale projects  These three projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget  In addition  we have almost 2 000 megawatts of wind projects under construction  which are expected to be completed in 2020  We re very excited to continue our clean energy transition  which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance  while reducing cost  The fleet achieved the capacity factor of 92 6  in 2019 even with two refueling outages  We have one of the top performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO  And in addition to strong performance  we have continued to lower our cost structure with O M costs declining a little over 2  in 2019  and this is the fourth straight year of declining O M in our nuclear operations  I m extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry Moving to the wire side of our business  our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security  faster storm restoration  better efficiency and new offerings for our customers  In 2019  we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado as planned with full scale implementation to follow  In November  we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers  and we expect a commission decision later this year Beyond our strong financial and operational performance  I m also very proud of our ESG leadership  In 2009  we estimate we ve reduced carbon emissions by more than 40  from 2005 levels  and we remain on track to achieve an 80  carbon reduction by 2030  In recognition of our carbon free vision  S P Global gave us their Award of Excellence  And we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities  We provided assistance to impacted employees  offering retraining and relocation opportunities  and we re levering natural attrition As a result  we ve managed to transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements  We ve also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites  And we ve worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well  In Minnesota  there s continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing charcoal coal plant  In Colorado  we ve worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill  which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo  where we are closing two coal units Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base  And our results have been recognized by others  We were named as one of Fortune magazine s Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year  one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine s 100 Best Corporate Citizens  and among Newsweek s Most Responsible Companies  We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign s Corporate Equality Index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ Equality In addition  various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer  All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record  which is becoming increasingly important to investors  So I m really pleased with our accomplishments and  looking forward  I m excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond  We will continue executing on our multi state wind investment program  which will provide clean affordable energy to our customers  Longer term  we ll add more universal solar storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80  by 2030  We ll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade  This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system  and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future Implementation of our Advanced Grid program will also keep the grid reliable  secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables  while enabling new offerings for our customers  We will continue working with our customers  policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation leading EV programs  which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector So with that  let me turn the call over to Bob  who ll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update  Bob Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ben  and good morning  everyone  My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results  For details on our fourth quarter results  please see our earnings release We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results  We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of  2 64 per share  which is a 6 9  increase compared with  2 47 per share in 2018  This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of  2 55 to  2 65 per share  Similar to last year  weather was a positive factor contributing almost  0 07 per share compared to normal  However  we also incurred additional O M expense  including approximately  0 03 per share due to storms  partially offsetting the weather benefit The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins  which increased earnings by  0 37 per share  including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments  Lower O M expenses increased earnings by  0 02 per share  and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by  0 15 per share  However  the majority of the lower EPR is due to an increase in production tax credits  which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts  both of which are largely earnings neutral  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense reflecting our capital investment program  which reduced earnings by  0 29 per share  and lower AFUDC  due to project timing  decreased earnings by  0 08 per share Turning to sales  our weather adjusted electric sales declined by 0 3  in 2019  We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth  partially offset by lower use per customer  And in the C I space  we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to co generation and lower frac sand mining sales  which cause sales to be unfavorable  Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2 7  in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer  partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin  For 2020  we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1   which includes the impact of leap year Turning to expenses  O M costs were almost 1  lower than last year  driven by continued efficiency gains in transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleet  partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations  We remain committed to improving operating efficiency and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers as we have for the past five years And as a result  our consolidated base O M forecast is essentially flat  However  we do expect incremental O M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021  which is largely rider recoverable  as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity  wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience  As a result  we expect total O M expense will increase approximately 1  to 2  in 2020 Next  let me provide a quick regulatory update  In December  the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal  including the extension of the sales  capital and property tax true up mechanisms  along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs  We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities  including our integrated resource plan  our Advanced Grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts In January  the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPA  We closed on the acquisition earlier this month and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the upper Midwest system and to our customers  especially as we retire additional coal plants As we discussed in the past  we anticipate this asset will generate utility like returns over its life  However  we expect the non regulated returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust toward the back end of the forecast  We continue to progress    we continue to progress on our PPA acquisition strategy  and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment  We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company Moving to Colorado  the commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9 3  at current test year ended August 2019  and an equity ratio of 55 6  along with other decisions  We view this report for a strong capital structure and progress in improving more current test year as positives  particularly for the credit support that they provide But we re disappointed in the low ROE  which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition  We are waiting on a written commission order  which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts  However  we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues  We expect new rates to be effective in February 2020  We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas  In New Mexico  we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately  31 million  an ROE of 9 45   an equity ratio of 54 8  and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement  Hearings are scheduled in February with the commission decision to follow In Texas  we re seeking an increase of  136 million based on a historic test year  an equity ratio of 54 7  and an ROE of 10 35   The request largely reflects investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth  Intervener testimony will be filed in February  And as in the past  we ll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties  We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020 We re planning to file several cases next year  In February  we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November  We ll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in the summer  We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November  And finally  we ll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the costs for the Sagamore Wind project in the first quarter of 2021  With a strong year behind us  we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of  2 73 to  2 83 per share  which is consistent with the long term EPS growth objective of 5  to 7  With that  I ll wrap up  In summary  2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy  We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year  We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year  We issued  750 million of equity  representing the majority of our equity needs over the next five years  Our stock hit an all time high in September and more recently in January  We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32   eclipsing that TSR of the S P 500 for yet another year The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the long road assets into rate base  and we put in service three wind projects  largely on time and under budget  We resolved multiple rate cases and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental  social and governance arenas  We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5  to 7  This concludes our prepared remarks  Operator  we ll now take questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Greg Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everybody Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Greg Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystSo  it doesn t look like there were any real substantive changes to your medium to long term outlook from your last disclosures  Your capex budget is the same  but you did slightly tweak some of your guidance drivers for  20  including a modest reduction in expected O M growth  Yes  I m wondering as you look this year and then you look out over like a five year planning horizon  you guys have done a great job as you say it bending the cost curve and controlling costs to reduce regulatory lag  And we re just wondering  yeah  in general  I wonder about the industry  but also specifically with regard to Xcel  as you circle back around and look at your organization  how much leaner do you think you can get given improvements in technology and the cost of deploying renewables  etc Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Greg  It s Bob  It s a great question  As we give guidance  we do expect modest increases in O M over the next year or two as we bring the wind on to the system and we spend some money in very strategic areas like cyber and wildfire risk mitigation  Over the longer term  we expect to keep O M flat probably beyond the  21 period  And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that  So it s a continuous effort  but I think the guidance for us is flat in  22 and beyond to what is  21 Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  Second and last question  I think  tomorrow we re expecting unless things have changed rate decisions in Texas for two of your competitors  CenterPoint than AEP  I know that you ve got a pending case in that    where a decision is not expected until later this year  There has been concern about regulatory risk both lower equity ratios and lower ROEs in that state  CentrePoint looks like they re coming out a little bit better than where they otherwise would have landed  but it s still not a great outcome relative to industry average  How do you think you guys differentiate Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Hi  Greg  it s Ben  I think historically there has been a lot of differences in the pure T D utility with no customers in ERCOT  like CenterPoint  and a vertically integrated company like SPS outside of ERCOT  And you see that  we ve been in front of the regulator numerous times in the last five years and the equity ratios are what they are as well as the ROE  So  I think the more relevant case that I look to as I think about how Texas might get resolved is actually the settlement we had in New Mexico  As you know  Greg  many of the same interveners in Mexico    excuse me    are going be the same ones in Texas  So  we ll obviously look at those cases  but we re cautiously optimistic that we ll have some opportunities to potentially settle the Texas case in the March timeframe of this year Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystFantastic  Thank you  guys OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Insoo Kim  Goldman Sachs Insoo Kim    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you  My first question is on the    good morning    on the 2020 outlook for whether adjusted low growth  Thank you for the color that you gave on what impacted especially on the electric side  whether it just a load  as you look out toward this year and just having gone through just a month of this year  Does it still give you confidence that you could achieve the 1  increase in load  including the leap year impact Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Insoo  it s Bob  Thanks for the question  and I appreciate you are on the call  I think our sales forecast is reasonably conservative  We did have some discrete declines in our large C I customers in 2019 that we don t expect to continue in  20  And underlying those discrete items  we do have strong customer growth  which is slightly moderated by use per customer  But I think our forecast is as expected  and we don t expect to adjust that from guidance Insoo Kim    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thank you  And my second question  In Minnesota  with the ongoing discussions on the Clean Energy First potential legislation  how did those    how did the latest discussions fit in with your overall timing and shape of fleet transformation that you ve laid on the RP  And do see    and if there are changes do you see potential opportunities or challenges relative to their original plan Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  it s a really good question  I think Clean Energy First basically clarifies what we re already planning to do  And so  this would be the second time that it was    the state is looking to legislate that Clean Energy First  legislation  and I think there will be some opportunities that come out of it  For us  it s important that we make sure we do this in the most efficient way possible  We recognized the very strong importance of our nuclear energy  And we recognize the fact that as we close and shut coal plants on a voluntary basis to achieve that 80  carbon reduction that our investors have some opportunities to be rewarded as well  So  we ll see where it goes  We re going to move forward  We re plowing our IRP plan  And that s    as you know  that s we filed it rather and that will be discussed throughout the year  And it s    I think it s pretty extraordinary plan  which has a lot of renewables  some gas at the continuation of our nuclear plants  So  I think we are well positioned Insoo Kim    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin Smith of Bank of America Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  JulienJulien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystHey  Can you hear me Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Good morning Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe can hear you Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystHey  good morning  Thank you for the time  So perhaps just to follow up a little bit on the tax extenders bill and some of the developments on the PTC  I know you guys are always vocal about your opportunities in the wind side  Can you elaborate your latest thinking on repowering specifically  given the extension  And I know it s a little early  but just altogether how do you think about the repowering opportunity and the PPA buyout strategy at large given the extension Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think it s helpful  I mean that s the short answer  The 60  PTC expansion allows you to lock in technology through 2024 with a 60  PTC  so I think that will potentially create some more opportunities to your point for repowering  Julien  As you know  we don t have those opportunities embedded in our forecast  but we are certainly going to be looking for those opportunities Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystGot it  Excellent  And then  as you think toward the rate case in Minnesota  do you want to give any kind of premise as to how you think about that again obviously being pushed out  but at any premise you think about in setting expectations going forward in that case specifically  I know you just alluded to some potentially on the last question here  but maybe just to start to open up that conversation Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I mean  we pushed it out a year and I think the terms were constructive  We    unless we can figure out a way to push it out another year  we ll file in November with interim rates to go into effect in January of like I said would be  21  So I don t really have much more details than that  We were pleased to work with the staff and stay out  I think that allows us to focus on the resource plan  And it s nice to be able to take a little burden off the staff too  as they ve got quite a workload  So  could we stay out another year  Well  I don t know  But I guess I can t add much more color than that  Julien  that s where we are Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystThat is fair  All right  Excellent  Thank you  guys OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar Travis Miller    Morningstar    AnalystThank you  Good morning Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Travis Travis Miller    Morningstar    AnalystHi  As you re looking in the industry  obviously you re quite active both solar and wind  2020 and 2021 as you re negotiating contracts both regulated and possibly the PPAs outside of those  what are you seeing just in terms of cost comparisons  where costs are going both wind and solar or are they still going down or they re changing terms  I just wonder if you could characterize what you re seeing going 2020 and 2021 in wind and solar Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think you re still seeing the technology s fall in price  The    you then have to match that up with the    where we are with PTCs and ITC s  But as we just talked about that 60  extension I think is going to be helpful  Without that 60  PTC extension  Travis  I would have told you that perhaps we ll see some bump up in wind and we still might  which is why I m really pleased we locked down 100   I think that s a no regrets strategy in every sense of the word  But I think that technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives even in a low natural gas environment Of course  the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we re all connected to than anybody else  but we re going to need more than just renewables and battery storage  Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid  20s  But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota  we ll address this in Colorado next year  we re also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas and then ultimately we re going to need to start developing technologies    carbon free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a 0  carbon system by 2050  So maybe that s a little bit long winded  but I thought I d throw that out there for you  Travis  That s the plan  I will also   Travis Miller    Morningstar    AnalystYeah  Don t   Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOur industry is really  really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction  I mean  we re proud to have been the first to establish the goal  But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing  it is really significant  And I m quite proud of this industry Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll add up real quick  Our year over year fuel cost decline was about  325 million  And while half of that was just lower commodity prices  natural gas and coal  the rest of that is our Steel for Fuel program coming home to roost to the benefit of our customers  And while we are investing steel in the ground and have capital cases for recovery  you re seeing the real benefit on the fuel line  And that does attribute    that does accrete to the customers and that provides some headroom in the bill for us for continued investment in the distribution and transmission grids  which we know we need Travis Miller    Morningstar    AnalystYeah  great  Thank you  And then  did I hear you correctly  you do not plan on any unregulated renewable energy acquisitions  but you would possibly keep doing the PPA type acquisitions  just to make sure there is not a change there from what you said Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOur goal is to look for PPA buyout opportunities or repowering opportunities with the benefits flowing to the customers  So that means putting them in regulated operations and into rate base  That s always been the plan  Of course  we offer that as well for a gas fired plant in Mankato  and commission decided the benefits which were primarily back end loaded weren t sufficient enough to go forward  So we made the decision that we would    the asset was important enough and we thought    valuable enough that we would hold it in our portfolio  but as a non reg selling into the utility under long term power purchase agreement  But I try to say you that more is an anomaly than anything else and I would challenge anybody to find a utility that is more focused and has more of their growth    100  of their growth coming from regulated operations  There s nobody that s more pure play and vertically integrated than Xcel Energy  and that s the way we mean to keep it Travis Miller    Morningstar    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Ali Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThank you  Hi  good morning  First question  in 2019  as you noted in the slides  at the OpCo level you earned a 9 06  ROE  Can you just remind us what earned ROE is embedded in your 2020 guidance at the OpCo level Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Ali  its Bob  Our weighted average regulated ROE is about 9 4  across all of our jurisdictions and we still have approximately 50 basis points of leakage and lag in that  So high 8 s is probably a good number right now Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystBob  you d expect a little bit of leakage or a reduction from what  19 ended up earning Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI do mostly driven by a lower ROE in Colorado electric case  We re still working on trying to close that ROE gap  and we think we have some opportunity over the longer term to do that Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAli  I think it s important to note though that we are    I will tell you  we are disappointed in the ROE we received in Colorado  But as Bob mentioned  there were some positive things there too  But as you    as we re into the end of January and we see the puts and takes that we ve had so far  I would tell you that we re solidly positioned to be in the middle of our earnings guidance range Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystOkay  And secondly  I know your current 2020 through 2024 capex five year is roughly around  22 billion  And Ben  you alluded to looking at additional opportunities  whether it s renewables  etc  if they do arise  Just from a constrained perspective  in terms of whether it s a rate case  I mean rate impact of customers or balance sheet  etc  how much can you stretch that  22 billion if there were opportunities or do you not see any constraints if the right opportunities are there Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAll right  The right opportunities are there  There are no constraints  and we re focused on capex that helps reduce total bills for our customers  And where we can find those opportunities and if it s a PPA buyout  well that s great  If it s trading O M for capital  that s great  If it s more Steel for Fuel that saves customer s money on their fuel bill more than offsets the capital cost and the associated return  that s great  We re always going to be looking for that  And longer term  I think we re in the early days of beneficial electrification and saving customers  money on their total energy bill with EVs and other opportunities  So  I m excited about the capital opportunities we have to invest  And I think we ve demonstrated we can grow our regulated rate base  Again that s a 100  of where we get our earnings from  and keep our bills flat for our customers Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystOkay  And last question again  a quick reminder  when you look at this 5  to 7  growth rate target that you laid out  can you remind us    as you stand here today and you look at the opportunities in the capex  are you comfortable in the upper half of that range  the higher end of that range  can you just remind us where you stand on looking at that growth rate from where we are today Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think  we re positioned to be on the upper part of the range  I mean   Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystUpper part of the range Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Bob  I don t know if you have anything to add Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI agree with that Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystSo higher end is the way we should think about it Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystI see  Thank you Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Ali OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHi  good morning  and thank you for taking my question  Most of the topics have been discussed  I guess  but I just wanted to circle back on Colorado Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSophie  a lot of background noise  we can hardly hear you Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystCan you hear me now Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMuch better Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOh  sorry about that  So most of the topics have been discussed  but I just want to circle back quickly on Colorado  Could you discuss where kind of the regulatory environment in this space is going directionally  I guess  with the disappointing rate decision and the initiative of    in Boulder  like would it be fair to say overall it s    it s more difficult maybe or is it not a fair statement  Thank you Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I don t  I wouldn t categorize it that way  Boulder s been    we ve been talking about Boulder for 10 years now and probably be talking about at least for another 5 years  and that s more centric I think to Boulder and we continue to  I think  do quite well on a legal basis there with supportive commission decisions as well  As far as the regulatory environment in Colorado  yeah  I mentioned  Bob and I both  that were disappointing in 9 3  ROE  We think we re one of the best performing utilities in the nation and that ROE quite frankly doesn t reflect that  So likely look for reconsideration on that  But longer term  Sophie  I believe that what we re doing and what we re doing was codified in the law last legislative session  we re highly aligned with what our customers and our stakeholders want to see in Colorado  And when I think about how you achieve long term success  that s exactly how you do it aligned with stakeholders and then execute on a clear spaces  And that is what Xcel is doing  and I think that bodes well for future success Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystTerrific  thank you OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAndy  how are you  doing Andrew Levi    ExodusPoint    AnalystHey  guys  Good  I want to ask you about the growth rate  I guess   Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerDisappointing  Andy Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s a dividend Andrew Levi    ExodusPoint    AnalystThen I just wanted really to get your thoughts on this  Obviously you ve mentioned ESG and that kind of taking out a big role kind of the industry as far as how people are investing  But I guess another part that didn t been talked about relative to ESG natural gas  And whether it s    as in the LDC  whether it s midstream  whether it s fracking  whether it s even using it in your power plant as the fuel  Ben  I just wanted to get your thoughts just on natural gas as a commodity and whether you think it s clean or dirty or    and then in the context of ESG if you kind of agree with some people s view that it s a dirty fuel Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Well  Andy  I think that is a very good question  It s a challenging question  because we re going to need natural gas to achieve that 80  carbon reduction that I mentioned and you know early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change  So  we re going to get pushed back on natural gas  but I think the key is to make sure that people understand you shouldn t make perfection be the enemy of a great plan  And we re moving away from coal completely here in the upper Midwest  That s the plan  We re going to need gas to back it up  We had    this time last year  we were in a polar vortex  Reliability is critical  so I think we ve got a really pragmatic plan  Our challenge as an industry  Andy  is going to be making sure that people see that you know 2050 is a long way away  We re going to need different types of innovation  We ll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid  but experts tell us that the big grid that we re all connected to does get saturated by depending on where you are in the country between 50  and 70   That s amazing  You know that s the big grid  but that s where we re going    but after that we re going to need things to back it up  and that s when new technologies So  as part of the leadership of EI  that s a message I want to get out there  Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas  I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions  I think that s really important and we can do something about that  We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side  And then ultimately I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix  I will also tell you that here in the upper Midwest heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work  At least with today s technology so  we got to keep customers warm  So it s a challenging issue but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating  we ve got a great plan  I think we can persevere Andrew Levi    ExodusPoint    AnalystThank you Ben  That was actually a great answer  Thank you Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    AnalystHey good morning  How are you doing Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Paul Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Paul Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    AnalystJust really quickly on Ali Agha s questions  I just want to follow up  are you guys indicating that you in general just to make sure I understand this a bit  you don t expect any rate increases when everything is factored into fuel and everything else with respect to your regulatory objectives or your capex objectivesRobert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  Paul  I hope I didn t give that impression  I mean  our goal is to keep our total bills to customers at or below the CPI index  And if you look back on some of our    and like in our investor deck  you can see that we ve done that over the last five years  Now what    the other    you will see increases as well in the kWh rate  But remember that s only one component of a total bill So we re really focused on keeping bills again  CPI or less as we go through this timeframe  And our analysis says we can with the right deployment of technology and support of public policy  That s really important because you can also make it much more expensive than it needs to be And that s where we are Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    AnalystOkay  And is there any thought of that maybe going to serve a PBR sort of a CPI minus X or something like that if that s sort of the objective maybe and maybe not have all these sort of rate cases and rate proceedings Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou mean like change the regulatory compact for something around that Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    Analyst Indecipherable  regulatory compact so much as just the regulatory  I mean you guys are going in all the time for rate increases or rate cases if you follow me and they re kind of    they re    you re seeing them more about than I do  They can be kind of technical  And what have you in some places around  in some jurisdictions internationally you have something like a CPI minus X    CPI X where basically this sort of performance based rate making sort of thing where your rates do  where inflation is taken into account in terms of where your rates are set periodically Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    AnalystI don t know  I just was wondering if there is any thought about something like that or   Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I mean  we re always open to new ideas  But I think you have to be pretty cautious when you start addressing those sorts of things  Paul  And we do file a number of cases and we spend a lot of time on calls like this talking about it  But we ve got a great track record of managing that  And we got  I think  a very good track record of aligning with policy makers which again on a long term basis gets you where you need to be  So  my experience some of those mechanisms aren t necessarily good for the companies that have done    that have those in place  They can be  but they can also be harmful as well  So    Sure  Sure  I was just wondering if there is any thought about that  That s all  I just hearing and I just thought to ask you that  that s all Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Performance based rate making is great  but sometimes it s not symmetrical  I guess  So that s    so we re pretty pragmatic about that Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    AnalystAbsolutely  And then  in terms of    there has been some questions about as you know coal and coal dispatch and you guys major filing in December in Minnesota  I m just wondering if going forward you see additional activity in that or anything that you guys are looking at in terms of coal plant retirement or any sort of flexibility that might be worked into in terms of potential additional savings that might be enhanced by    I know you guys are looking at all the time  but in terms of coal plant retirements or dispatch changes that might also drive savings for customers or for you  How should we think about that  I mean  is there anything    other than what you guys have been doing for some time now  is there any additional sort of things on the horizon Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I mean  first of all  thank you for recognizing what we do with our coal plants up here  I think    I mean I think that working with the commission here  I thought that was a great example of partnership  And moving from must run to economic dispatch  I think that was a positive first step  The commission is very interested in understanding how a pause in coal dispatch could work as we start to ready for the day when we don t have any coal in the upper Midwest  So I think it s    the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward  And to your point Paul I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants particularly when you look at the variable costs of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy  So we re definitely looking at that down in the SPS region  We ve got some water issues that we need to address  and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch  So  again  with economics in mind  so    yeah  it does look for us    to look for more opportunities like we re doing here in the upper Midwest Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks a lot Ben Fowke    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Thank you OperatorThank you  We have no further questions in queue  I ll turn it back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks Robert Frenzel    Executive Vice President and Chief

102513,324028,XEL,Power to the drones  utilities place bets on robots,news,By Stephen Jewkes and Christoph Steitz MILAN FRANKFURT  Reuters    Flying robots that can travel dozens of kilometers without stopping could be the next big thing for power companies   Utilities in Europe are looking to long distance drones to scour thousands of miles of grids for damage and leaks in an attempt to avoid network failures that cost them billions of dollars a year  However the technology faces major safety and regulatory hurdles that are clouding its future in the sector   Snam  MI SRG  and EDF s  PA EDF  network subsidiary RTE have tested prototypes of long distance drones that fly at low altitudes over pipelines and power lines   Italy s Snam  Europe s biggest gas utility  told Reuters it is trialing one of these machines   known as BVLOS drones because they fly  beyond the visual line of sight  of operators   in the Apennine hills around Genoa  It hopes to have it scouting a 20 km stretch of pipeline soon   France s RTE has also tested a long distance drone  which flew about 50 km inspecting transmission lines and sent back data that allowed technicians to virtually model a section of the grid  The company said it would invest 4 8 million euros   5 6 million  on drone technology over the next two years   At present  power companies largely use helicopters equipped with cameras to inspect their networks  They have also recently started occasionally using more basic drones that stay within sight of controllers and have a range of only about 500 meters   However an industry wide shift toward renewable energy  and the need to monitor the myriad extra connections needed to link solar and wind parks to grids  is forcing utilities to look at the advanced technology   It s a real game changer   Michal Mazur  partner at consultancy PwC  said of drones   They re 100 times faster than manual measurement  more accurate than helicopters and  with AI devices on board  could soon be able to fix problems   In sight drones cost around 20 000 euros each and BVLOS ones will cost significantly more  according to executives at tech companies that make the machines for utilities  and a fleet of dozens if not hundreds would be needed to monitor a network  Power grid companies are expected to spend over  13 billion a year on drones and robotics by 2026 globally  from about  2 billion now  according to Navigant Research   But that is still dwarfed by the amount of money the sector loses every year because of network failures and forced shutdowns   about  170 billion  according to PwC   REGULATORY RISKS The growing demand from utilities is coming at a time of swift technological advances in civilian long distance drones  The prototypes  which are about a meter long and wide  not only have aircraft systems but can avoid obstacles  detect other flying objects   from helicopters to hang gliders   while mapping grids with thermal and infrared sensors   However the future of these flying robots in the utility sector hinges on regulation   BVLOS drone flights are largely prohibited because of safety concerns  However over the past year European watchdogs have for the first time granted special permits to allow utilities   namely RTE and Snam   to test prototypes   The European Commission is working on new Europe wide regulations to govern the use of civilian drones  including long distance ones  but has disclosed few details  A Commission source said the EU executive expected to put forward the rules by the end of the year  with a view to adoption in early 2019  The new regulations should make it simpler for companies that need to operate BVLOS drones to receive clearance  the source said   The objective is to speed up the opening of the drone services market   the source added  Yet without any clear guidance as to how the new rules will look  or will work in practice  many companies have adopted a wait and see approach   The situation is mirrored in the United States   As in Europe  special permits are needed for BVLOS flights but the aviation regulator  the FAA  is looking to simplify and speed the process of winning such waivers  including by automating it   Xcel Energy   O XEL  in April became the first American utility to gain approval for BVLOS flights  ULC Robotics  which provides technology for the energy sector  said a growing number of U S  utilities were looking at the technology   While only a handful of beyond visual line of sight flights have been granted in the utility space  we believe developments in long range flight are going to advance within the next two to three years   said business development manager Tom Barracca  CHAIN REACTION It is still early days for drones in the utility sector  which is known for its slow pace of change  Companies have only started using in sight drones over about the past two years  While their short range limits them to specific tasks  such as inspecting a known problem  utilities say they are more efficient at that than helicopter surveys    You are not only saving time but also money   said Sven Bender  key account manager at Innogy  Germany s second largest energy group by market value  adding that the use of drones in the industry would pick up further in the coming years   The company s Westnetz grid unit has a handful of in sight drones  which can stay in the air for as long as 30 minutes  to inspect parts of its 182 000 km of power lines in Germany   France s RTE said it avoids 1 400 days of interruption of high voltage lines each year because it uses drones alongside its helicopters   Out of sight droning is set to be the next frontier for grid operators with their miles of pipes and pylons to inspect  Most energy infrastructure players manage assets scattered over large areas  located often in hard to reach places like mountains or deserts   As the industry gradually moves from large conventional power plants to smaller  more fragmented green energy sources  such as wind turbines and solar panels  it also increases the number of assets and connections that need to be maintained  A drone flying along a gas grid can detect methane leakage  while along a power line it can do a lidar survey to map the lines  the health of the cable and the vegetation on either side   We ve identified that it can save as much as  180 for every mile of data capture when compared with traditional methods   said Michael Chasen  CEO of drone maker PrecisionHawk  It was a tree too close to high tension power lines at the Italian Swiss border that led to Italy s most extensive blackout in 2003 triggering a chain reaction across the grid experts say could have been averted with drone technology  Thomas Nicholls  chief marketing officer at French drone company Delair  said power groups in France and Italy were most advanced with regard to the technology  He added that safety played a major role because inspecting power lines could be a hazardous job for humans  Dor Abuhasira  CEO of Israel s Percepto  which supplies drones to utilities such as Europe s biggest group  Enel   MI ENEI   sees the technology as ultimately providing a kind of private satellite service to grid operators    We are their Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Maps with a few high tech bells and whistles on top

102535,324050,XEL,Xcel Energy  XEL  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Lag Estimates,opinion,"Xcel Energy  XEL  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 01 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 96 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  3 81   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility would post earnings of  0 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 46  delivering a surprise of  13 21  
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates 
Xcel  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  3 01 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 47   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 05 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Xcel shares have added about 30 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Xcel 
While Xcel has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Xcel was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 50 on  3 06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 61 on  11 87 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Utility   Electric Power is currently in the top 29  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xcel-energy-xel-q3-earnings-and-revenues-lag-estimates-200477333,200477333

NEW YORK  Reuters    Environmentally conscious investors are using their pocketbooks to protest President Donald Trump s plans to slash environmental regulations  fueling a rally in funds that only invest in companies that meet progressive criteria for sustainability 
From the start of November to the end of January  investors poured  1 8 billion into actively managed equities funds in the  socially responsible  category  according to Lipper data  In the same period  there was a net outflow of  133 billion from funds that do not have environmental or social mandates 
Trump was elected president on Nov  8 
Investors worried that Trump s policies may imperil causes they believe in are hoping an influx of flows will help keep companies alive 
 If clients see the federal government withdrawing from a space they think is important  they may actually be more active in wanting to enforce their views through the dollars allocated   said Vincent Reinhart  chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management 
The inflows are a boon for fund managers but also a challenge  requiring them to find companies whose share prices have a chance to climb despite less favorable federal policies 
For instance  shares of solar energy companies took a beating after the election  sliding 11 percent by year end on concerns the future of U S  tax credits under a Trump administration  though they have recovered somewhat since then 
Still  cautious fund managers from Fidelity  New Alternatives  Calvert Investments and others are scrutinizing water technology and wind power shares  which should benefit from new federal infrastructure spending and a push by states such as California toward more renewable power generation 
Managers say water technology stocks should see an uptick from Trump s campaign promise to spend  1 trillion on repairing and improving the country s infrastructure  Wind stocks are attractive as that energy source is proving more cost effective in growing areas of the country like California  which plans to get half its energy from renewable sources by 2030 
 If you look at where the policy is changing the fastest  it s at the state level  and we see places like California continuing on that trend regardless of what is happening on the federal level   said Kevin Walenta  who manages the Fidelity Select Environment and Alternative Energy portfolio  He has been adding to his positions in Spanish wind energy company  Iberdrola   MC IBE  SA and US based water and plumbing company Comfort Systems USA Inc 
BETTING ON STATE POLICIES
Trump has not yet called for ending tax credits for solar and other renewable energy  though he has expressed doubt about the role of solar energy  bemoaned the loss of coal mining jobs and blamed wind turbines for ruining picturesque landscapes 
Ahead of the election  power companies had already started to pivot away from solar and invest more in wind  with companies including Southern Co   NextEra Energy Inc   NYSE NEE  and  Xcel Energy  Inc  NYSE XEL  announcing plans to expand wind generating capabilities at a time when technology has helped lower its cost   L1N1FZ1GR  
Wind power costs average between  32 and  62 per megawatt hour before subsidies  compared with an average between  49 and  61 per megawatt hour for utility scale solar arrays without subsidies  according to a December 2016 report from Lazard  Coal power  which Trump has pledged to revive  costs between  60 and  143 per megawatt hour  the report notes 
With that cost structure  along with the potential increase in jobs from building and maintaining wind turbines  even solidly Republican states should continue to invest in renewables  said Murray Rosenblith  co portfolio manager of the New Alternatives Fund 
Rosenblith has been adding to his positions in wind companies Vestas Wind Systems and Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA  both of whose shares are up 10 percent or more since the start of the year

102576,324091,XEL,The Case Against Exxon Mobil,news,"By   

New York regulators are investigating  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  over reports that the company knew for decades the risks posed to its business by climate change  yet failed to properly alert investors and the public  The investigation  reported by the New York Times  follows revelations that although the oil giant s own researchers acknowledged global warming decades ago  the company proceeded to sow doubt about climate science 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is looking into whether Exxon did wrong by shareholders    the same shareholders who have enjoyed the fruits of Exxon s record profits from extracting carbon intensive fuels for decades  In the last decade  for instance  the company s stock has risen more than 46 percent 
The issue is whether Exxon s apparent shift in its stance toward climate change in prior decades    from internal acceptance to publicly questioning its very existence    led investors to buy Exxon stock when they might have been more circumspect  given the consequences of global warming  If the investigation proceeds  it could prove a watershed case 
 I d be really curious to know who within the C suite was told about climate change as a fundamental threat to our business  and who decided to combat this with what was basically a disinformation campaign   said Mark Latham  a climate law professor at Vermont Law School 
Why Is This Investigation Being Brought Under Securities Law 
Although environmentalists are the group most outraged by reports into Exxon s knowledge of climate change  the company didn t break any environmental laws  Instead  investigators are hoping to make the case that by failing to disclose its knowledge of climate change sooner  Exxon violated its fiduciary duties to investors 
Numerous politicians  including both Democratic presidential front runners  have called for federal investigations into Exxon  but the Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet announced any inquiries 
New York law  however  provides a broader toolkit for prosecuting securities fraud  In 2007  former attorney general and current New York governor Andrew Cuomo used the Martin Act of 1920  a powerful state law  to subpoena power companies over their disclosure of business risks associated with greenhouse gas heavy projects  Since then  the Martin Act has become a regular weapon in the New York Attorney General s arsenal  though it remains contentious in the legal world 
Exxon denies that it ever deviated in its stance around climate change   We unequivocally reject the allegations that Exxon Mobil has suppressed climate change research   Exxon s vice president for public affairs Kenneth Cohen told the New York Times Thursday 
What Does The Government Need To Prove  
Though the case law around disclosures doesn t have clear cut guidelines  investigators would generally have to show that Exxon executives knew  or should have known  that climate change was a business risk  and that the information was something a reasonable investor would like to have understood before buying or selling shares 
The reason is simple  An investor would likely shy away from a stock if she knew that the company s business model would become obsolete in the short to medium term due to regulations 
According to reporting in InsideClimate News  top executives were apprised of cutting edge climate science as early as 1977  It was then  according to documents  that company researcher James Black told Exxon s Management Committee   There is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels  
By the 1990s  however  Exxon executives were questioning the certainty of the global climate science community   Let s agree there s a lot we really don t know about how climate will change in the 21st century and beyond   former CEO Lee Raymond said in 1997  The company did not so much as mention climate change in securities filings until 2001 
According to climate law experts  it would be highly problematic if the company had outwardly denied what had been accepted internally  especially as climate science solidified in the 1990s   There would have been a point reached where Exxon s efforts to claim that the science was uncertain would have no longer been accurate   said Latham 
Is There Precedent  
The Martin Act has been used several times since 2007 to push energy companies to disclose the risks to their profits associated with climate change and regulations to address it  In the law s first climate related application   Xcel Energy   N XEL  agreed to tell its shareholders how climate change regulations might impact its coal power business 
Securities law experts also point to 2014 s Reese vs Malone circuit court ruling  in which shareholders sued British oil major  BP   L BP  over failures to disclose the seriousness of a pipeline leak in Alaska  When an initial leak was discovered  the company told shareholders that a particularly corrosive form of oil was to blame  and that the event was a one off occurrence  But those contentions were undermined by a second leak  after which BP shut down operations 
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that  the facts alleged in the complaint support the conclusion that BP had been aware of corrosive conditions for over a decade  and yet chose not to address them   That case could provide a useful corollary for the investigation into Exxon  whose public statements apparently contradicted its own internal findings around climate change for decades ",2015-11-06,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-case-against-exxon-mobil-370084,370084

102600,324115,XEL,US Non Hydro Generation To Rise 14  In 2020  Stocks In Focus,opinion,Over the last decade  electricity generation from non hydropower renewable sources  particularly wind and solar  has grown steadily in the United States  This is evident from the fact that nearly 90  of the increase in renewable electricity between 2008 and 2018 came from wind and solar generation  per a report by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  Per the EIA  wind power generated 6 5  of the total electricity in 2018  Wind generation rose 400  to 275 million megawatt hours  MWh  from the 2008 levels  Meanwhile  solar generation increased to 96 million MWh in 2018 from 2 million MWh in 2008 and accounted for 2 3  of the total electricity generated in 2018 Factors Driving Non Hydro Power GenerationOver the past few years  the U S  wind energy market witnessed considerable growth on several factors like increasing corporate investments  reduced component costs and favorable tax credits  Per a report by National Renewable Energy Laboratory  wind energy investment in the United States has averaged nearly  13 6 billion annually in 2018  since 2006 Moreover  improving project economics and favorable state policies have boosted offshore wind activities of late  Notably  these developments contribute a great deal to the growth of wind power generation in the country Meanwhile  deployment of utility scale projects continues to be a major growth driver for the U S  solar market  Favorable federal and state policies  declining solar module costs  among others  are factors contributing to solar power generation Non Hydro Sources Growth in 2020 and BeyondIn 2016  renewables accounted for around 15  of the net U S  electricity generation  with the bulk coming from hydropower sources  However  things are likely to change as wind power is expected to emerge as the leading source of renewable electricity by 2020  per EIA  Notably  the EIA currently expects wind  solar and other non hydropower renewables to provide 10  of the total utility scale generation in 2019 and 12  in 2020 Solar power generation is on the rise as the number of solar installations in the United States surpassed 2 million in May this year  It is now expected to go beyond 3 million installations in 2021 and 4 million in 2023  per a report by the Wood Mackenzie Power   Renewables Per the EIA  electricity generation from renewables  principally wind and solar  is expected to grow 14  to 467 billion kWh in 2020 from 409 billion kilowatt hours  kWh  in 2019 Stocks to ConsiderConsidering the abundant prospects of wind and solar power  we have zeroed in four stocks from the  industry that investors might want to keep a tab on  While these utilities are expanding their renewable generation portfolio  they also have favorable Zacks Rank and earnings prospects NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE    the world s largest producer of wind and solar energy  has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   It has an average earnings surprise of 2 92  for the last four quarters and an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 8   You can see  Avangrid  Inc    NYSE AGR    a developer of wind projects in the United States  carries a Zacks Rank  3  It has a year over year earnings growth estimate of 8 55  for 2020 and an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 7 5  Alliant Energy Corporation   NASDAQ LNT    a developer of U S  solar projects  has a Zacks Rank  3  It has a year over year earnings growth estimate of 7 74  for 2020 and an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 5 5  Xcel Energy   NASDAQ XEL    a developer of wind and solar energy projects  carries a Zacks Rank  3  It has a year over year earnings growth estimate of 6 55  for 2020 and an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 4 9  Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-09-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-nonhydro-generation-to-rise-14-in-2020-stocks-in-focus-200467086,200467086

102656,324171,XEL,Xcel Energy  XEL  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Xcel Energy  XEL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 78 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 05  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xcel 
For Xcel  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xcel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xcel would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line

What s Next for Xcel

energy sources to produce electricity is constantly increasing in the United States  The rising awareness of utility operators has resulted in ramped up investments in research and development in the renewable space  New technology and advanced products have lowered the cost of operating utility scale renewable power plants Per a recent forecast from the Energy Information Administration  EIA   wind  solar  and hydropower will collectively produce 18  of domestic electricity in 2019 and almost 20  in 2020  It foresees renewables as the fastest growing source of electricity production in the United States EIA expects energy related carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions to decline 2 0  in 2019 and 0 9  in 2020 after the 2 7  rise in 2018  Electricity from wind sources is predicted to grow 12  and 14  in the next two years  EIA expects the share of total electricity generation from wind to increase from 7  in 2018 to 9  in 2020  Electricity generated from wind in 2019 will surpass hydropower generation The U S  Department of Energy s  DOE  latest Wind Vision Study Scenario projects 10  of the nation s end use demand will be served by wind by 2020  20  by 2030 and 35  by 2050  DOE also announced funding of up to  28 1 million targeted to advance wind energy nationwide across the land based  offshore  and distributed wind sectors Utilities Show More Interest in WindWind is gradually becoming the preferred renewable source of electricity generation in the United States owing to declining cost of production and usage of bigger turbines which allow production of greater volumes compared with earlier times  Innovation in the wind power generation technology will further bring down cost of operation Though flow and direction of wind is still a pressing concern  power generation from wind is on the rise  Utility players like Xcel Energy  NextEra Energy  Inc  and WEC Energy Group  Inc  are focusing on wind generation with extensive plans to produce more Xcel Energy aims to provide 100  carbon free electricity to customers by 2050  The company s steel for fuel initiative enables the addition of renewables  Nearly 3 000 MW of its new wind projects has received regulatory approval  with construction underway  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has returned 30 2  in the past 12 months compared with  s return of 12 4   You can see  NextEra Energy has decided to invest  39 5 billion in the 2019 2023 time frame in various projects  During 2018  the company added in excess of 6 500 MW renewable projects to its backlog  which includes 1 300 MW of wind repowering and in the first quarter of 2019  the backlog was 953 MW  which includes 195 MW of wind repowering  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has returned 21 7  in the past 12 months WEC Energy is focused on reducing carbon emissions by approximately 40  below 2005 levels by 2030 and 80  by 2050  The company is pursuing acquisitions to expand its wind operations  After acquiring Forward Wind Energy Center and Bishop Hill III  the company took over an 80  ownership in Coyote Ridge Wind Farm  which has a capacity of 97 MW  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has returned 29 3  in a year s time Is the Focus on Wind Long Term A few market experts opine that the focus on renewable sources like wind is primarily due to the incentives provided by the government  Experts believe  once the Production Tax Credit  PTC  is phased out  interest of utility operators will shift from the renewable energy space However  we expect the interest of utility operators to remain despite the gradual phasing out of PTC  Few utilities have already chalked out long term plans to provide 100  electricity from clean sources with or without PTC Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit

102767,324282,XEL,No Rate Hike A Boon For Utilities  4 Utility Stocks In Focus,opinion,The Federal Reserve acted as expected and kept the interest rate unchanged at 2 25  to 2 5  in the first half of 2019  Why Fed Changed its View After raising rates nine times since December 2015  the Federal Reserve decided to take a cautious approach on rate hikes  The ongoing trade dispute with China  data pointing toward a softening economy and inflation rate below the committee s 2  target are the primary reasons for the rate freeze  In fact  these could even lead to a rate cut  per Fed Chair Jerome Powell  who backed the central bank s decision with an intention  to sustain the economic expansion  with a strong job market and stable prices  for the benefit of the American people  Powell added that given the prevailing uncertainties and subdued inflation pressures  the Fed will observe the implications of all new information for the economic outlook and  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2  objective  Inflation is expected to be about 1  in 2019  1 9  in 2020 and 2  in 2021  According to Powell   Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective  but we have expected it to pick up  supported by solid growth and a strong job market  Possibility of Rate Cuts  Welcome Change for UtilityRate hikes are welcomed by some sectors like Banking in anticipation of higher interest income  But the capital intensive Utility sector might cringe at the thought of it for it takes recourse to external sources of financing to meet its capital requirements  In a way  the interest rate freeze lowers this sector s cost of capital allowing it to continue with capital intensive infrastructural development work Fed officials kept the 2019 interest rate at 2 4   unchanged from its March FOMC meeting  However  interest rate projection for 2020 and 2021 has been revised down  The rate is now projected at 2 1  down from 2 6  for 2020  and 2 4  versus 2 6  expected earlier for 2021  The same should be 2 5  over the long haul  down from the 2 8  forecast made at the meeting held in March  This development will certainly benefit the cause of utility companies Our  report indicates that Utility sector earnings will improve 2 5  in the second quarter of 2019 on the back of a 2 5  improvement in total revenues 4 Utility Stocks in FocusAgainst such a macro backdrop  investors may like to focus on utility stocks with strong fundamentals and provide steady returns to investors It s an intimidating task to zero in on underpriced stocks with high growth potential  The  makes this work relatively simpler  The year to date returns of these companies were better than the Zacks S P 500 composite s return of 15 1

102815,324330,XEL,Xcel Energy  XEL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Xcel Energy  XEL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 17 billion  up 7 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 94  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xcel 
For Xcel  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 43  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xcel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xcel would post earnings of  0 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 42  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Xcel doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xcel-energy-xel-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200408317,200408317

102817,324332,XEL,Ameren  AEE  To Add 300 MW Third Wind Facility In Missouri,opinion,"Ameren Corporation s   NYSE AEE   unit   Ameren Missouri   recently announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire a third wind generation facility in Missouri  The facility was developed by Tradewind Energy and is expected to be operational in 2020  The facility with a capacity of 300 megawatts  MW  and will be located near the town of Tarkio 
When completed  the project is anticipated to create more than 300 high quality jobs and power 90 000 homes  The construction of the facility is subject to the approval of Missouri Public Service Commission This wind power project will be the most advanced unit in the state and have the capability to harness wind more efficiently with fewer turbines 
Steps to Reduce CO2 Emissions
Ameren Missouri is striving to increase generation from cleaner source  The company s Integrated Resource Plan  IRP  is a 20 year program to promote cleaner energy in Missouri  Ameren aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 80  by 2050 from the 2005 base levels  The company intends to offer electricity through cleaner and more diverse sources of energy generation that include solar  wind  natural gas  hydro and nuclear power 
To achieve its goal  Ameren Missouri inked agreements with two developers to acquire two plants with wind generation capacity of 557 MW after construction  Once completed  these facilities will represent about 80  of Ameren s compliance needs with the state s requirement of achieving 15  of native load sales from renewable energy sources by 2021  The company plans to invest nearly  1 billion for the two wind generation facilities and expects them to be in service by the end of 2020 
Increasing Wind Generation
The utility sector is currently undergoing a notable transition  Utilities are shifting to renewables through the replacement of coal by natural gas and clean energy  Per an Energy Information Administration  EIA  report  all renewable sources of energy that include wind  solar and hydropower will produce 18  of U S  electricity in 2019 and almost 20  in 2020 
EIA expects that wind generation will surpass hydropower generation for the first time to become the leading source of renewable electricity generation in 2019 and maintain that position in 2020  EIA expects that U S  energy related carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions will decline by 2 1  in 2019 and by 0 8  in 2020 
Rising awareness regarding emission  federal and state policies as well as declining costs are driving renewable technologies in the United States  particularly in wind and solar  Thus  utilities and corporations are increasingly shifting their focus to renewables  Utility companies like WEC Energy Group  Inc   NYSE WEC    NiSource   NYSE NI   and Xcel Energy   NASDAQ XEL   are focusing on renewable sources to add more clean generations in their production portfolios

102871,324386,XEL,Here s Why Xcel Energy  XEL  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Xcel Energy  XEL   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Xcel Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for XEL that show why this utility shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For XEL  shares are up 1 37  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 63  compares favorably with the industry s 2 93  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Xcel Energy have risen 8 35   and are up 28 38  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 6 11  and 1 87   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to XEL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  XEL is currently averaging 3 468 174 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with XEL 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost XEL s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 61 to  2 62 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that XEL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Xcel Energy on your short list ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-xcel-energy-xel-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200396927,200396927

103025,324540,XEL,Xcel Energy  XEL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"The market expects Xcel Energy  XEL  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  3 01 billion  up 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xcel 
For Xcel  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 39  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Xcel will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Xcel would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 96  delivering a surprise of  2 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Xcel appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xcel-energy-xel-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200378919,200378919

103114,324629,XEL,Solid Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Betting On Now,opinion,"Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum  But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on revenues and not earnings  as top line growth  or decline  usually reflects a company s future earnings performance  Notably  in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios  which can turn negative and cease to be relevant  the price to sales  P S  ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters Also  a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth  Further  earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation  significant charges and inventory  But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales  which further underscores the importance of P S ratio A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are

103117,324632,XEL,Utilities Week In Review For June 11 15,opinion,"Summary
Utilities were the best performing sector this week 
However  analysts have been downgrading the sector due to rising rates 
The best performing issues are heavily invested in renewable energy 
This week brings good news for utility investors 

Utilities were the best performing sector on the week  rising 2 66  
The charts  however  tell a somewhat different story 
Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU 
 
The 5 minute weekly chart shows a clear uptrend with prices using the 200 minute EMA for technical support 
 
But the 30 day  15 minute chart shows that prices have recovered 50  of the May 31 June 7 sell off  It s also possible to look at this time as a sideways consolidation 
 
And the daily chart is slightly bearish  The 200  and 50 day EMAs are both moving lower while prices have had a difficult time maintaining momentum above the 200 day EMA  The main reason for this lack of upward movement is that we re in a rate rising environment  More than most other industries  utilities are dependent on the credit markets for financing  so when rates go up  the sector is disproportionately hit by rising costs  And this week  the Fed raised interest rates and signaled it may raise rates an additional 50 basis points  This explains why some analysts have downgraded the sector  But also remember that this sector is known for its dividends  which will help to provide a floor under some of the issues 
As for industry news  the NY Times published an article that detailed why coal is having a difficult time making a comeback 

When Mr  Trump came into office  he vowed to revive America s coal mining industry by rolling back Obama era environmental regulations  But coal keeps getting edged out by cheaper and cleaner alternatives  At least 15 4 gigawatts of coal capacity is set to retire this year  one of the biggest years on record  according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis  And the coal units that are left now operate far less frequently than they used to  replaced by natural gas  wind and solar power 
For many utilities  the decision to abandon coal comes down to simple economics  Xcel Energy  Colorado s largest electric utility  recently concluded that it could save  213 million by retiring two of its older coal fired units a decade ahead of schedule and replacing them with a mix of wind  solar  battery storage and natural gas 

Meanwhile  Barron s ran a story arguing that improved battery life was making renewable energy more cost effective 

Bigger  better batteries are speeding up change in the U S  electricity sector and could help power a rally in Xcel Energy Inc  NASDAQ XEL   American Electric Power Co Inc and other utility and renewable energy stocks  Barron s reported 
After a decade of steep cost declines  wind and solar installations  often paired with battery storage  are increasingly displacing older coal and gas fired power plants  benefiting battery makers and some utilities  the Barron s cover story said 
Batteries can now store enough electricity to help power small towns when wind and solar supplies ebb  Barron s said  The United States is expected to install more than 35 gigawatts of battery storage through 2025  which could save more than  4 billion in annual operating costs  Barron s said  citing the Washington based Energy Storage Association trade group 

This leads nicely into a discussion about the performance of the largest XLU members  First  here are its charts for the last year 
 
Three stocks are clearly in a rally  Exelon Corporation  NYSE EXC   NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE   and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc  NYSE PEG   What do these companies have in common  Two are heavily invested in renewable energy  Here is a table of EXC s generation mixture from its latest 10 K 
 
Nuclear and renewable account for about 2 3 of its generating capacity 
As for NextEra  it is also heavily invested in renewable sources  from its latest 10 K  
 
As for PEG  it has no generating assets  it is strictly a transmission and distribution company  As it notes in its latest 10 K 

 Our utility operations primarily earn margins through the transmission and distribution of electricity and the distribution of gas  

Finally  Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE  popped on news about potential changes to its Board of Directors 

Activist investor Paul Singer s Elliott Management on Monday revealed its latest target in the power and utilities space  Sempra Energy 


Now  Elliott and Bluescape Resources   frequent allies in activist campaigns in the utility space   are taking issue with Sempra s business mix less than a year after Singer helped add Oncor to its portfolio  The investors on Monday called for an overhaul of Sempra s board of directors and a strategic review of its assets and operations

103118,324633,XEL,XEL Vs  LNT  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Utility   Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with Xcel Energy  XEL  and Alliant Energy  LNT   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Xcel Energy and Alliant Energy are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
XEL currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 08  while LNT has a forward P E of 19 38  We also note that XEL has a PEG ratio of 3 17  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  LNT currently has a PEG ratio of 3 47 
Another notable valuation metric for XEL is its P B ratio of 1 95  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  LNT has a P B of 2 25 
Based on these metrics and many more  XEL holds a Value grade of B  while LNT has a Value grade of C 
Both XEL and LNT are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that XEL is the superior value option right now ",2018-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xel-vs-lnt-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200326419,200326419
103119,324634,XEL,Utilities Week In Review For The Week Of June 18 22,opinion,"Summary
The utilities sector outperformed this week for the second week in a row 
Utilities are also one of the better performing sectors for the last month 
Morgan Stanley upgraded the utilities sector this week 
This week  utilities were once again the best performing sector 

And they are one of the best performing sectors for the last month 

Part of the reason is that yields have steadied as of late 
 
The 10 year yield rose  60 basis points until the beginning of June  It has since come in a bit  This chart of the yield curve puts the situation into a more recent historical perspective 
 
The yield curve has really moved since May 1 
Another reason for utilities  outperformance is the more defensive nature of the recent price action among the sector  Over the last week and month  utilities  consumer staples  and health care are outperforming other sectors 
Several articles this week highlighted the more defensive nature of the recent market action  From Barron s 

All of this leads Wilson to be more positive about defensive sectors  He s yet another voice calling for a potential turn in the consumer staples sector  and he also upgraded the utility sector to overweight today  citing his expectation on peak 10 year Treasury yields and improving relative earnings breadth  The firm has Overweight ratings on American Electric Power  NYSE AEP   PG E  NYSE PCG   Public Service Enterprise Group  NYSE PEG   and XCEL Energy  NASDAQ XEL  

ETF Trends also noted utilities  overall outperformance  emphasis from the article  


Utilities stocks and utilities ETFs rallied over the past week as trade war concerns and a return to safety helped support this defensive play 
Over the past week  iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Utillities  NYSE UTLF  gained 3 9   John Hancock Multifactor Utilities  NYSE JHMU  rose 3 2   Reaves Utilities  NYSE UTES  added 3 2  and Invesco DWA Utilities Momentum Portfolio  NASDAQ PUI  increased 3 0   The Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU   the largest utilities related ETF  was 2 5  higher over the same period 

Turning to the largest members of XLU  we have the following year long charts 

Three are at near 52 week highs  Exelon  NYSE EXC   NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   and Public Service Enterprise  NYSE PEG   all three are in the middle row   Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE   bottom row  left  recently rallied after an activist investor publicly called for a change in the board of directors  All the other issues are trading at near 52 week lows 
There was a smattering of news from the major issues 
American Electric Power gained approval from a regulator to build the largest windfarm in the US 

A titanic  4 5 billion plan by AEP Corp  to build the largest wind power in the United States has landed another key approval 
The Columbus based utility s proposed Wind Catcher Energy Connection project has landed required approvals from two of the four states it will ultimately serve  The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the project on Wednesday  following the May approval by its counterpart in Arkansas 
That leaves Texas and Oklahoma to approve the plan 
The project would create a 2 000 megawatt wind farm in Texas and in Cimarron County on the Oklahoma panhandle  About 800 wind turbines supplied by GE Renewable Energy will power the project that would be developed by Chicago based Invenergy LLC 


After a report  Duke could see an 11   increase in rates due to this winter s cold snap  the Carolina Utility Board approved a 3 6  increase 
Exelon has signed on to a lobbying effort to impose a carbon tax in the US 
NextEra  NYSE NEE  and AT T  NYSE T  signed a deal for NEE to deliver 300 MW of wind power

growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are above historical levels Total earnings for the 87 S P members that have released results as of Apr 20  improved 25  year over year on 10 7  higher revenues  The beat ratio for the bottom line was 82 8   while that for the top line was 67 8  Notably  we expect total Q1 earnings for the index members to rise 18 3  from the year ago period on 7 7  higher revenues  At present  14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings Amid this backdrop  let s see how the  sector is poised for this earnings season  Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 12 4  in the first quarter   For more details check out our latest  A Glance at the Utility SectorUtility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow  with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services  The U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   predicted that annual average U S  residential electricity price will increase 2 6  in 2018  Thus the sector is expected to tread on a growth trajectory Therefore  staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic focused utility stocks will provide investors with steady returns  Currently  the sector is undergoing a transition  wherein the primary fuel source   coal   is being replaced by natural gas and renewables However  utility stocks are subject to stringent regulations  both at the federal and state levels  Moreover  being capital intensive in nature  higher interest rates dent the growth of these stocks  In March 2018  the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since December 2015 when the Federal Open Market Committee began increasing rates from near zero  This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector Nevertheless  to maintain their performance level  utilities are undertaking cost savings initiatives  modernizing transmission and distribution lines  upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity  Further  new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness improvement in earnings in the first quarter The quarter was also a witness to a colder than normal winter in most parts of the United States  Utilities are likely to benefit from this as it will drive heating expenditures for households  boosting the companies  earnings However  earnings projections for the sector hint at an unimpressive quarter  when compared to its Q4 performance The sector s earnings

103168,324683,XEL,Xcel Energy Had A Tough First Quarter,opinion,"Summary
Revenue and operating income were flat  net income rose thanks to a lower tax bill 
All of their base rate increases requests are in a holding pattern until the company recomputes their revenue needs by taking the TCJA into consideration 
The second quarter doesn t look much brighter 
 This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community  Turning Points  
Investment thesis  While Xcel energy is attractive due to its size and large geographic footprint  investors should consider other utilities that have better revenue growth with a higher dividend 
Of 53 electric companies  Xcel Energy  NASDAQ XEL  

is the 7th largest  market capitalization  23 92 billion  
is the 11th most expensive  PE 20 77  
is the 14th most expensive on a forward PE basis  FPE of 18 06 
has the 30th highest dividend  current yield of 3 25   

Xcel provides electricity and gas service in Colorado  Michigan  Minnesota  New Mexico  North Dakota  South Dakota  Texas  and Wisconsin  A broad geographic footprint is good because it broadens its exposure to various markets  However  it does mean it has to deal with a larger number of energy markets 

  
This potentially increases the company s compliance costs 
The electric utility sector is down for the year 

 chart from Finviz com 
The industry sold off in mid December as Treasury yields started to rise  The industry continued to sell off in February with the broader market  Since then  the industry has been moving higher 
As of this writing  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU  is the best performing ETF of the week 

 Data from finviz com 
XEL s chart is in a solid uptrend 

Prices sold off with the broader market starting in mid December  Prices hit a hard bottom in early February and have been moving higher since  Prices are now above the 200 day EMA  The shorter EMAs are rising  prices are using them for technical support  The MACD  top panel  shows rising momentum  which supports a bullish case for the stock 
Here are XEL s main developments over the last quarter  data from their latest 10 Q  

Total revenue was up modestly  as was net income 
The company applied for a  245 million base rate increase in Colorado  That is on hold for now as the company has to recompute its demand by taking the TCJA into consideration  Colorado PUC has told the company the request must come down by  101 million 
The company applied for a rate increase of  43 million in New Mexico which the NMPUC lowered by  11 million 
XEL asked for a rate increase of  55 million in Texas  which the Texas PUC lowered by  32 million while also asking for an addendum that explains the TCJA effect on the company s request 
The Minnesota PUC has asked the company to lower its recent request by  136 million due to the TCJA changes 

Let s turn to the numbers from the 10 Q  please see   
First up  is the simple quarter on quarter comparison 

Total revenue and operating income were up marginally  But the increase could just as well be classified as statistical noise  Net income increased due to a lower tax bill 
The following table breaks the data down into operating segments 

For all practical purposes  the numbers barely moved  any increase or decrease is analytically meaningless 
We see the exact same result in the per share earnings results for the various operating segments 

Across the board  we see modest increases and decreases  There was no significant movement in either direction 
The reason for earnings standing still is weak weather normalized sales growth 

The above table shows  weather normalized  sales  where the company attempts to remove the weather impact from the numbers  It s very similar to an economist performing a seasonal adjustment 
The numbers really aren t that surprising  large utilities have been coping with lower overall demand for the duration of this expansion  As a result  industrial production for utilities has been flat 

 data from the Federal Reserve 
What can we expect in the next quarterly report  As I recently noted  probably 

Overall utility output continues to move sideways 
Although natural gas prices increased last year  they re still contained within a longer historical trend that most utilities have probably hedged against 
Pricing is increasing  which should lead to higher gross revenue in second quarter earnings 

How does this fit with the rest of the utility industry  Overall  Eastern utilities  those that are east of the Mississippi River  have had a more difficult time growing revenue  instead relying on increasing margins to send more money to net income  In contrast  utilities in the NW have seen better top line revenue growth and  in some cases  improved margins  The current quarter s earnings place XEL squarely in the middle of standard  east of the Mississippi River utilities  it is difficult for them to grow revenue 
Conclusion
Xcel is facing the same problem as many utilities  increased energy efficiencies are lowering or stagnating overall demand  That makes the selection process for utility candidates that much more important  While Xcel s size  it is the 7th largest electric utility by market capitalization  and 3 25  dividend might be attractive  there are other utilities that have either higher dividend yields or better revenue growth for investors to consider 
It pays to look at the whole picture  not just where markets are headed  but what the economic data tells us about that  and how that can inform our investment decisions

	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5    Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 3 estimate has gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if XEL stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development  You can see

103368,324883,XEL,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  NextEra Energy  Dominion Resources  DTE Energy  Xcel Energy And American Electric Power,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   October 27  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Coal  part 3  including NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NYSE     Dominion Resources  NYSE D   NYSE     DTE Energy  NYSE     Xcel Energy Inc  NYSE XEL    NYSE     and American Electric Power Co   Inc   NYSE      

	Industry  Coal  part 3

	Link  

	The coal industry continues to fight a very difficult battle  with challenges being flung from all quarters  domestic and international  In the U S   declining natural gas prices  stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily driving away utility operators from coal 

	Jittery development in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia  and  importantly  a stronger greenback  are making the export market fiercely competitive for U S  coal players 

	The new Clean Power Plan  unveiled in Aug 2015  calls for CO2 reductions of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29  by 2025 and 30  by 2030  Utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE     andDominion Resources  NYSE      are investing consistently to increase their green generation portfolio 

	Another operator in this space  DTE Energy  NYSE      is planning to wind down its old coal fired electricity generation units  Meanwhile  the company will add increase the share of natural gas and renewable energy in its generation portfolio in order to its carbon footprint over the long run  This stock has surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters  It currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   

	Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal  some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy  The latest on this list is Peabody Energy  preceded by names like Arch Coal Inc   Patriot Coal  Alpha Natural Resources and Walter Energy  These companies tried all possible means to remain solvent  but we have to accept the harsh reality that coal demand is down and almost out 

	In response to the anti carbon drive  utility operators are shutting down coal based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables  U S  coal production during the second quarter of 2016 was 160 5 million short tons  MMst   This reflects a decline of 7 2  sequentially and 24 4  year over year 

	Per a release from the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   the decline in U S  coal production is expected to continue through 2016  with output expected to tumble 19 1  or by 171 1 MMst from the 2015 levels 

	Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against 

Environmental Legislations  Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the U S   vis   vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector 

	This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power 

	The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U S  will go down from the present level  unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants 

Xcel Energy Inc     NYSE      has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22  since 2005 and American Electric Power Co   Inc   NYSE      has eliminated over 5 500 megawatts  MW  of coal fired capacity  NextEra Energy s unit  Florida Power   Light Company decided to purchase a 330 MW coal based power plant with the intention of phasing it out gradually to lower carbon emission 

	Due to such legislative stringency  coal usage in electric generation is expected to witness a decline this year  In fact  the EIA forecasts coal consumption in power generation of 673 MMst  down 9 1  from 2015 

Natural Gas Substituting Coal  A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel   natural gas  Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas  which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U S   is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past 

	Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency  low emissions  quick construction timelines and low capital costs  This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas fired ones but to build new units 

	The EIA expects natural gas to contribute to 35  of the total generation in 2016  while coal represents 30   However  in 2017  the share of natural gas is expected to dip to 34  while coal s inches up 31  

	Besides power generation  clean burning natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors 

Competition from Alternative Energy Sources    Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy 

	The EIA report reveals expectations of a 6 3  year over year increase in renewable energy consumption to 10 513 Quadrillion Btu in 2016 and a 3 7  rise to 10 533 Quadrillion Btu in 2017 

	These renewable additions will eat into coal s share of electricity generation  Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U S  states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix  However  the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans  use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution 

	The extension of the Investment Tax Credit  ITC  for solar and Production Tax Credit  PTC  for wind will drive further additions in renewable generation units at the cost of coal  Making use of the government support  NextEra Energy expects to bring on line nearly 2 400 3 800 MW of new wind projects over the 2017 2018 timeframe 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

103446,324961,XEL,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  NextEra Energy  Dominion Resources  Xcel Energy And American Electric Power,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 30  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Coal  Part 3  including  NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE      Dominion Resources  NYSE D      Xcel Energy Inc  NYSE XEL        and American Electric Power Co   Inc     

Industry  Coal  Part 3

Link  

The coal industry continues to fight a very difficult battle  with challenges being flung from all quarters  domestic and international  In the U S   declining natural gas prices  stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credit are steadily driving away utility operators from coal 

Jittery development in key global markets and higher production countries like Australia and Indonesia  and  importantly  a stronger greenback  are making the export market fiercely competitive for U S  coal players 

The new Clean Power Plan  unveiled in Aug 2015  calls for CO2 reductions of 28  by 2025 and 32  by 2030  from 2005 levels  This is slightly stricter than the draft proposal wherein the EPA had proposed total CO2 reduction of 29  by 2025 and 30  by 2030  Utilities like NextEra Energy    and Dominion Resources     are investing consistently to increase their green generation portfolio 

Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal  some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy  The latest on this list is Peabody Energy  preceded by names like Arch Coal Inc   Patriot Coal  Alpha Natural Resources and Walter Energy  These companies tried all possible means to remain solvent  but we have to accept the harsh reality that coal demand is down and almost out 

In response to the anti carbon drive  utility operators are shutting down coal based power plants and are directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables 

Per a release from the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  coal production in May 2016 was 50 million short tons  MMst   down 28  from May 2015  Coal production declines are forecast to continue through 2016  with output expected to decline 17  or 155 MMst from 2015 levels 

Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against 

Environmental Legislations  Coal has been losing its importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the U S   vis   vis other sources that are much less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector 

This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power 

The final version of the Clean Power Plan will ensure that coal consumption for power production in the U S  will go down from the present level  unless the utilities pour more money to upgrade existing plants 

Xcel Energy Inc     has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions during power generation by around 22  since 2005 and American Electric Power Co   Inc      has eliminated over 5 500 megawatt  MW  of coal fired capacity  NextEra Energy s unit Florida Power   Light Company decided to purchase a 330 MW coal based power plant with the intention to phase it out gradually to lower carbon emission 

Natural Gas Substituting Coal  A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel   natural gas  Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas  which due to extensive exploration and production and a shale gas boom in onshore U S   is seeing significantly lower prices than in the past 

Natural gas is usually an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency  low emissions  quick construction timelines and low capital costs  This trend is encouraging power generators to not only convert their existing plants to gas fired ones but to build new units 

The EIA expects natural gas to feed 34 4  of total generation  while coal will fuel 29 9  of total production in 2016  The EIA however forecasts the share of natural gas to fall slightly to 33 3  and coal to rise to 30 9  in 2017 

Besides power generation  clean burning natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors 

Competition from Alternative Energy Sources  Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy 

The EIA report reveals renewables used in the electric power sector to increase by 13 0  in 2016 and by 3 3  in 2017  These renewable additions will eat into coal s share of electricity generation  Production of power from renewable sources is supported by most of the U S  states though there is no national consensus regarding the percentage of renewables in the total energy mix  However  the Clean Power Plan will encourage energy conservation and efficiency plans  use of renewables and clean alternative technologies for lowering air pollution 

The extension of the Investment Tax Credit  ITC  for solar and Production Tax Credit  PTC  for wind will drive further additions in renewable generation units at the cost of coal  Making use of the government support  NextEra Energy expects to bring on line nearly 2 400 3 800 MW of new wind projects over the 2017 2018 timeframe 

Rising Competition and Stronger Dollar    Besides competition from renewables and natural gas  U S  coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia and a stronger dollar  which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets  International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs  which also make their coal cheaper than their American peers 

The EIA release sums up that weak coal demand  lower international coal prices and a higher output in other coal exporting countries have led to a decline in U S  coal exports  U S  coal exports are expected to decrease by 8 MMst each in 2016  down 10   and 2017  down 12

103474,324989,XEL,Xcel Energy Misses Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Minneapolis based Xcel Energy Inc  NYSE XEL  recorded operating earnings of 46 cents per share in the first quarter of 2015  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents by 8   Quarterly earnings also declined 11 5  from the year ago figure due to lower revenue contribution from electric and natural gas sales

Total Revenue
Xcel Energy s first quarter revenues of  2 962 2 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 258 million by 9 1  and dropped 7 5  year over year  Lower revenues were largely due to a much milder winter this quarter as compared to a precipitous drop in temperatures in the year ago period 
Segment Revenue
Electric  Revenues from this segment in the quarter declined 3 3  year over year to  2 224 9 million 
Natural Gas  Quarterly revenues from the Natural Gas business also decreased 18 6  to nearly  716 million 
Other  Segment revenues of  21 4 million in the reported quarter increased a marginal 0 7  from the year ago period 
Quarterly Highlights
Total operating expenses decreased 3 6  year over year to  2 611 4 million  The costs shrunk primarily due to cost of natural gas sold and transported and reduced expenses from electric fuel and purchased power 
Operating income for the quarter inched plunged nearly 29  year over year to  350 8 million 
Total interest charges and financing costs  after Allowance for funds used during construction   AFUDC    increased 7 2  year over year at the end of the first quarter of 2015 to  138 8 million

NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of  1 41 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 28 by 10 2  
Our View
Owing to fluctuating weather patterns  the financial results of these utilities also tend to be volatile  Xcel Energy s first quarter 2015 results failed to impress with both earnings and revenues missing expectations 
In early 2015  Xcel Energy filed a resource plan with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission proposing to reduce carbon emissions by 30  by 2020 and 40  by 2030  These aggressive targets will not only help in meeting state mandates but also assist the company in providing clean energy and reliable services to its customers
