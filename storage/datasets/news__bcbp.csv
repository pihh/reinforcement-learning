6425,227940,BCBP,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  NRG Energy  American States Water  BCB Bancorp  Customers Bancorp And First Bancorp,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 20  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NRG Energy  Inc    NYSE NRG    American States Water Company   NYSE AWR    BCB Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ BCBP    Customers Bancorp  Inc    NYSE CUBI   and First Bancorp   NASDAQ FBNC   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Fed Cuts Interest Rate Another Quarter Point  Winners   LosersThe Fed trimmed target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time in just seven weeks  a widely expected move to sustain the decade long economic expansion amid trade war concerns However  the Fed officials gave divided opinions on further rate cuts for the rest of the year  leading to a volatile trading session  Even so  U S  stocks managed to climb back with the rate sensitive utility sector gaining the most  and bank stocks finishing in the green  In contrast  gold prices dropped as U S  dollar strengthened after the Fed cut rates Investors Digest Fed Rate CutThe Fed lowered interest rates to lend support to an economy which is facing trade tensions with China and other heightened geopolitical issues such as the attacks on Saudi Arabia s oil production facilities The Fed trimmed rates to a range of 1 75  to 2   Decline in business investments as well as exports coupled with persistently low level of inflation were cited as the primary reasons behind the rate cuts  If the trade war escalates and hurts growth  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank may lower rates further  Powell did say that  if the economy does turn down  a sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate  But  President Trump criticized the Fed statement  He tweeted that  Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again  No  guts   no sense  no vision   He expected the Fed to slash rates more aggressively  thanks to a record low unemployment level and confident consumers In fact  the Fed s policy statement showed that not all officials were in agreement over further rate cuts this year  Only seven of the 17 members are expecting additional rate cuts this year  What s more  Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren didn t want a rate cut  while St  Louis Fed President James Bullard wanted to trim rates by half a percentage point this time around U S  Stocks Wobble  Rate Sensitive Utilities GainInvestors were certainly disappointed after the Fed officials gave mixed signals about future rate cuts this year  But  stocks somehow chipped away their losses after Powell expressed confidence about the U S  economic outlook Most importantly  shares of rate sensitive utilities scaled north  with the Utilities Select Sector  XLU  increasing 0 4   the highest among all S P 500 sectors  This is because utilities are capital intensive businesses and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements  Consequently  these companies have high levels of debt  Thus  an interest rate cut will help them pay off debts and book profits However  higher rates along with an increase in the debt level  for that matter a steep debt equity ratio  impact the credit ratings of these utility operators  If the credit ratings go down  a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates  leading to a rise in cost of operations Given the buoyancy among rate sensitive stocks  investors can bet on energy company NRG Energy  Inc  and provider of water and electric services  American States Water Company NRG Energy currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved up 2 6  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 61 4  compared with the  industry s projected rally of 4 3  Meanwhile  American States Water currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has advanced 6  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 22 7  compared with the  industry s estimated rally of 0 5  Rate Cut Fuels Banks  RallyGenerally when there is a rate hike  banks are definitely the go to rate trade  Higher interest rates boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  and shorter term liabilities But  the SPDR S P Bank ETF  NYSE KBE  managed to increase nearly 0 7  after the Fed approved a quarter point rate cut  with large banks including JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  and Citigroup  NYSE C  registering a 1  and 0 9  increase  respectively And why not  As rightly pointed out by CNBC s Jim Cramer   people are buying the bank stocks because there s a chance Powell s rate cuts may put an end to the artificially inverted yield curve  and at the same time he s committed to prevent the economy from slipping into a credit ruining recession  This calls for investing in banks  And we have zeroed down to three   BCB Bancorp  Inc   Customers Bancorp  Inc  and First Bancorp  Here s why  BCB Community Bank has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has climbed 1 7  over the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17 8   more than the  industry s projected rally of 7  Customers Bancorp has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  now  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current quarter earnings has moved 1 4  north in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is 17 7  compared with the  industry s expected rally of 6 5   You can see  First Bancorp currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has increased 2 3  in the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is 8 1  compared with the Banks   Southeast industry s projected rally of 6 5  Dollar Strengthens  Gold FallsA Fed rate cut should have compelled investors to sell dollar denominated assets  eventually weakening the dollar s exchange rate  Still  the dollar firmed as Fed officials gave an uncertain outlook on further easing The ICE  NYSE ICE  U S  Dollar Index  which measures dollar s strength against a basket of major currencies  increased nearly 0 4  in the last trading session to 98 60  While the euro fell to 1 1031 dollars in late New York trading  the British pound was down to 1 2463 dollars Gold prices  in the meanwhile  dropped below  1 500 oz following the FOMC meeting  Owing to the rise in the value of U S  dollar in relation to other currencies across the world  the yellow metal became pricier in terms of other currencies  eventually leading to fewer buyers  And with demand for the commodity dropping  price of gold took a hit as well 5 Stocks Set to

featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include PVH Corp    NYSE PVH    BCB Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ BCBP    DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC    ZAGG Inc   NASDAQ ZAGG   and eGain Corporation   NASDAQ EGAN   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 of the Best Stocks to Buy on the Santa Claus RallyThe bull market that started in 2009 is expected to go strong this year  This optimism largely stems from the Santa Claus rally  which is being felt way ahead of Christmas  This year s holiday season started on a solid note as consumers have stepped up their online purchases  But  it s the Senate Republican s approval of the rewrite of the U S  tax code that is likely to drive the equity market higher Further  encouraging economic backdrop and higher consumer confidence in recent times also painted a rosy picture  Thus  it s time to invest in solid stocks that are likely to make the most of the bullish sentiments December  The Best Month for InvestorsHistorically  the month of December has been the best for the S P 500 investors  While it has been the second best for the Dow and the Nasdaq  the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks also tends to perform well starting mid December going into January In fact  all the major indices more or less have yielded an average return of at least 1 8  in the final month of the year since 1987  per CNBC analysis using Kensho  This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year  This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader s Almanac But  many market pundits have been using the term to refer to the period from the beginning of December  or even as early as Black Friday  to Christmas  And this time around  markets have gained on strong holiday sales and  there you have it  a Santa Claus rally  Consumers have also shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more  This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally Santa Claus Rally Drives Holiday SalesAbout 174 million Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend  surpassing the estimated 164 million  according to the National Retail Federation  Cyber Monday  in fact  registered the largest online shopping day in U S  history  Online sales crossed the  6 6 billion mark by the end of the day  reflecting a rise of 16 8  from the same period last year Lest we forget  around  5 03 billion was spent online on Black Friday  reflecting an uptick of 17  from last year  Small Business Saturday and Sunday  Nov 25   26  also recorded combined online sales of  5 12 billion  up 10  from the year ago levels Senate Passes Sweeping Tax Overhaul BillThe Senate voted 51 49 to approve the Republican tax bill  It s a major policy change that will create big winners and help markets maintain the decade long bull run The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35  to 20   marking the biggest one time drop in big business tax rates  Banks face a high tax burden  which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down  Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash  This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise  Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Let us also not forget  tech behemoths Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  hold 88  of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35  corporate tax rate  Thus  they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump s tax reduction plan As the Senate approved the tax bill  small cap stocks will also tend to surge  After all  such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30  for quite some time  while their large cap counterparts are paying close to 25  Gearing Up for a Solid End to 2017  5 BuysCourtesy of positive seasonal trend  solid holiday sales and Republicans  approval of the nearly  1 5 trillion tax rewrite  we are lined up for a strong year end rally  The economy had already seen the fastest growth in three years in the third quarter  which highlights its resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes Hence  it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks in the market that can make the most of this bullish sentiment  Such stocks have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of A or B  Here V stands

6434,227949,BCBP,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  BCB Bancorp  CB Financial Services  Triumph Bancorp And United Community Banks,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 16  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include BCB Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ BCBP    CB Financial Services  Inc    NASDAQ CBFV    Triumph Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ TBK   and United Community Banks  Inc    NASDAQ UCBI   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Senate Banking Bill Loosens Key Dodd Frank Norms  5 PicksOn Mar 14  the Senate passed a crucial Bill easing several of the regulations  which were put in place to guard against a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis  The proposed legislation loosens norms mandated by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act  which were put in place after the crisis led to many Americans losing their homes and jobs The major beneficiaries of the new legislation appear to be regional banks  smaller community banks  regional lending institutions and credit unions  Though larger banks also received crucial reprieves  these were minor compared to the relief received by their smaller counterparts The legislation now faces a crucial test in the House of Representatives  but given the bipartisan support it has received  smaller banks can expect easing up of regulations going forward  With rates set to rise and economic growth looking strong  investing in these banks looks like a smart option at this point Regional Banks Receive ReprieveThe Senate s banking Bill aims to raise the threshold for banks which are deemed too big to fail  This limit  currently set at  50 billion in terms of assets  will now be raised to  250 billion  This implies that only the largest U S  banks would have to abide by the most stringent regulations stipulated by the Federal Reserve This means that several midsized banks would no longer have to submit  living will  regulations which elaborately specify how banks intend to safely dispose of its assets in case of a failure   Also  they would no longer have to undergo Federal Reserve stress tests on an annual basis The beneficiaries of this clause include household names such as BB T  Fifth Third Bancorp  NASDAQ FITB   SunTrust and American Express  NYSE AXP  Major Relief for Community BanksOther major beneficiaries of the proposed law are smaller community banks and credit unions  Banks of this nature with less than  10 billion in assets will no longer have to comply with the Volcker Rule  This regulation prevents financial institutions from engaging in speculative trading  It was put in place to stop such banks from selling risky mortgages and to ensure that they could withstand difficult business conditions Smaller banks have complained for some time that they were subject to rules which were targeted primarily at bigger financial players  A more contentious reprieve intends to reduce reporting requirements for mortgage data  Additionally  smaller banks would no longer have to comply with strict mortgage underwriting norms put in place by the Dodd Frank Act This rule was intended to determine whether banks were giving loans only to these individuals who had the ability to pay back these amounts  However  smaller banks have long complained that they find it difficult to comply with such regulations  The Bill s supporters argue that the relaxation of these clauses will enable easier disbursal of mortgages and business loans  especially in rural areas Our ChoicesThe Senate s new bipartisan legislation significantly eases norms for mid sized and smaller banks  While their ease of doing business will increase substantially if the new law is implemented  compliance related costs will likely decline A stronger rate environment and an encouraging economic backdrop are already proving to be beneficial for banks  Given that regulatory restrictions are also likely to ease up in the near term  it makes sense to invest in smaller banks at this time  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics BCB Bancorp  Inc  operates as the holding company for BCB Community Bank  a state chartered commercial bank that provides banking products and services to businesses and individuals in the United States BCB Bancorp has expected earnings growth of 30

 Source  Topdown Charts  Thomson Reuters In fact  all the major indices more or less have yielded an average return of at least 1 8  in the final month of the year since 1987  per CNBC analysis using Kensho  This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year  This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader s Almanac But  many market pundits have been using the term to refer to the period from the beginning of December  or even as early as Black Friday  to Christmas  And this time around  markets have gained on strong holiday sales and  there you have it  a Santa Claus rally  Consumers have also shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more  This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally Santa Claus Rally Drives Holiday SalesAbout 174 million Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend  surpassing the estimated 164 million  according to the National Retail Federation  Cyber Monday  in fact  registered the largest online shopping day in U S  history  Online sales crossed the  6 6 billion mark by the end of the day  reflecting a rise of 16 8  from the same period last year Lest we forget  around  5 03 billion was spent online on Black Friday  reflecting an uptick of 17  from last year  Small Business Saturday and Sunday  Nov 25   26  also recorded combined online sales of  5 12 billion  up 10  from the year ago levels Senate Passes Sweeping Tax Overhaul BillThe Senate voted 51 49 to approve the Republican tax bill  It s a major policy change that will create big winners and help markets maintain the decade long bull run The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35  to 20   marking the biggest one time drop in big business tax rates  Banks face a high tax burden  which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down  Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash  This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise  Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Let us also not forget  tech behemoths Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL    Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO   and Oracle   NYSE ORCL   hold 88  of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35  corporate tax rate  Thus  they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump s tax reduction plan As the Senate approved the tax bill  small cap stocks will also tend to surge  After all  such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30  for quite some time  while their large cap counterparts are paying close to 25  Gearing Up for a Solid End to 2017  5 BuysCourtesy of positive seasonal trend  solid holiday sales and Republicans  approval of the nearly  1 5 trillion tax rewrite  we are lined up for a strong year end rally  The economy

doing this for Christmas season  just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U S  customers  Just in case they might have an impact on people  what we ve done is we ve delayed it so that they won t be relevant to the Christmas shopping season  Meanwhile  ECB President Mario Draghi is set to release an array of stimulus to shore up economic growth  Primary among them will be interest rate cut that widens the difference between borrowing cost in the Eurozone and other parts of the world  What s more  Draghi before handing over the reins of the central bank to Christine Lagarde is
