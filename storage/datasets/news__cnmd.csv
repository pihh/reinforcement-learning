The same for revenues is pegged at  79 million  indicating growth of 432 5  from the year ago reported figure Aurora Cannabis Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors to Influence Fiscal Q4Aurora Cannabis is likely to have witnessed cannabis revenue growth across all three market segments in the to be reported quarter on the back of increase in consumer market cannabis sales  Increase in production from Aurora Sky and the company s Bradford facility might have also contributed to growth Per the preliminary results released by the company  net cannabis revenues are projected to range between  90 million and  95 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019  with growth anticipated across all key business segments  in both Canadian and international  and consumer markets  read more    Further  the company is likely to exhibit growth in medical cannabis sales in the to be reported quarter driven by consistent growth with regard to patient base   One of the most important key performance indicators of Aurora Cannabis remains the quantity of kilograms produced  which in turn reflects profitability  In fact  going by the preliminary results released  production available for sale for fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 is anticipated to be at the upper end of the range between 25 000 kg and 30 000 kg  exceeding the prior guidance of 25 000 kgs  According to the commitment made by the company in January this year  focus is on disciplined execution and cost management  which in turn is likely to have a positive impact on gross margin  Consequently  we expect to see improvement in the same in the soon to be reported quarter Aurora Cannabis has been successfully executing growth and expansion strategy that has led to sustained revenue growth  In fact  in June 2019  the company announced plans for expansion of the consumer cannabis market into vapes  concentrates  and edibles  The company has plans to produce new  high quality products across Canada in a variety of product categories through a combination of new and improved facilities In July  the company received Health Canada licenses for outdoor cultivation at two Canadian sites   Quebec and British Columbia  These research sites will enable the company to develop new technology  genetics and intellectual property that will drive sustainable  high quality outdoor production  This in turn is likely to contribute to the company s overall performance in the upcoming quarterly results However  intense competition in the medical marijuana space continues to plague the company  thereby

Lately  Myriad Genetics is observing growth in EndoPredict  Vectra  Hereditary Cancer and Prolaris testing revenues  The FDA approvals and encouraging test results buoy optimism on the stock  We are upbeat about the company s expectation to witness stable pricing in Hereditary Cancer testing through fiscal 2020  Moreover  the company seems well positioned to deliver strong fiscal 2019 results on the back of solid Counsyl buyout synergies  
Fortifying its foothold internationally  the company has been receiving a satisfactory response to its BRACAnalysis CDx in Japan for addressing metastatic breast cancer  In this regard  it has secured a Japanese approval for BRACAnalysis CDx as the companion diagnostic in first line ovarian cancer with olaparib  The company is optimistic about the scope of this test in Japan considering that every year  roughly 22 000 cancer patients across the Land of the Rising Sun are eligible for companion diagnostic testing Myriad Genetics  Inc  Price

   Myriad Genetics has so far made a significant progress with its five strategic imperatives that include transition and expansion of the hereditary cancer market  diversifying revenues by commercializing its new products  ramping up the company s international contribution by investing in large countries  gaining reimbursement for the launched products  increasing international RNA kit revenues and enhancing profitability with Elevate 2020 
It is important to note here that this  Elevate 2020  program   introduced by Myriad Genetics   targets  50 million in incremental operating income by fiscal 2020 
However  in the last reported quarter  the company suffered a decline in GeneSight and Vectra testing revenues  which were affected by an adverse third quarter seasonality  This apart  escalating Research and development  R D  expenses and selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses are inducing a massive operating margin contraction 
Shares of this Salt Lake City  UT based molecular diagnostics provider have underperformed the broader  over the past three months  The stock has declined 15 3  compared with the industry s 3 1  dip 
Meanwhile  Myriad Genetics faces acute competition in the key BRACAnalysis market  The company expects the same to intensify due to the advancement of this technology  We believe  tough headwinds might reduce the prices of expensive tests provided by the company  This might in turn  impede the stock s margin improvement 
Moreover  as the company receives a considerable portion of its revenues as well as pays part of its expenses in foreign currencies  it is exposed to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations between foreign notes and the U S  dollar

28591,250106,CNMD,Here s Why You Should Hold On To ResMed  RMD  Stock For Now,opinion,ResMed Inc  s   NYSE RMD   Software as a Service  SaaS  business continues to gain from steady growth in Brightree service offerings and incremental contribution from the buyouts of MatrixCare and HEALTHCAREfirst Over the past month  the stock has outperformed its   The stock has gained 15 8  in comparison with

disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders has a market cap of  16 17 billion This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has solid prospects which makes it worth the wait for now What s Working in Favor of the Stock ResMed had identified three horizons for growth viz  focus on core sleep apnea franchise  drive growth in adjacent product and geographic markets and discover opportunities in new markets Progress in Sleep Apnea Franchise  In terms of progress in the first horizon  which focuses on ResMed s core sleep apnea franchise  the company has been providing digital health and connected care solutions using advanced technology  The company now has more than 10 million patients being monitored with the AirView software  Also  over 9 million patients are now monitored by fully cloud connected medical devices on their bedside tables  ResMed has been seeing solid uptake of the AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud based software ecosystem Growth in Adjacent Product and Geographic Markets  The second horizon deals with growth in adjacent product and geographic markets  This includes homecare ventilation for  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and other respiratory disorders in emerging markets in China  India and Brazil  For progress in this horizon  management believes that the spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products in ResMed s portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs and improving outcome Opportunities in New Markets  The third horizon refers to a portfolio of opportunities in new markets  including clinical treatments of atrial fibrillation  heart failure with preserved ejection fraction  asthma  chronic disease management  Another key area of this horizon is ResMed s work on chronic disease management algorithms  including population health models  health care analytics  care co ordination and SaaS models for home health  home nursing and hospice  In this area  the company is recording steady growth in Brightree service offerings and incremental contribution from the buyouts of MatrixCare and HEALTHCAREfirst Buyouts to Boost SaaS Business  ResMed has been continuously opting for buyouts to boost revenues from SaaS business  According to the company  this niche is booming with prospects and has a total addressable market of more than  1 5 billion in the United States alone  Leveraging on the company s leading position in multiple SaaS verticals  ResMed expects its SaaS portfolio to move from high single digit pro forma growth to low double digit pro forma growth over the medium term   This growth trajectory is expected to sustain over the long term In the last reported quarter  the company witnessed a 101  rise in revenues from the SaaS business on continued expansion of Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst along with the first full quarter contribution from the acquisition of MatrixCare Expansion in International Markets  ResMed continues to invest and expand in high growth markets like China  South Korea  India  Brazil and many Eastern Europe countries  In each of these regions  the company is implementing long term strategies to improve quality of patient life for the purpose of delivering better patient outcome and reduce overall system healthcare costs in each country Increased focus on Product Development  In order to maintain its leadership position in the Sleep Disordered Breathing  SDB  market and to expand its sales base  ResMed is focusing on product development and innovation  In this regard  the company recently expanded its AirFit mask portfolio with the introduction of its first top of head connected nasal CPAP mask  AirFit N30i  in the United States Downsides However  there are a few factors which are working against the stock as well Reimbursement Headwind  ResMed s ability to sell products largely depends on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the products are available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations Competitive Landscape  The market for SDB products is highly competitive with respect to product price  features and reliability  ResMed s primary competitors include Philips BV  DeVilbiss Healthcare  Fisher   Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited  Apex Medical Corporation  BMC Medical Co  Ltd  and regional manufacturers Challenging Macroeconomic Scenario  Pricing pressure in the United States and Europe has been an issue over the past few quarters Which Way Are Estimates Treading For the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 92 cents  indicating a year over year decline of 3 2   The same for revenues stands at  700 6 million  suggesting a 12 3  improvement

However  growth from existing customers mitigated the downside Medical segment profits decreased 22 1  to  155 million owing to performance of Cardinal Health Brand products Margin AnalysisGross profit fell 7 8  year over year to  1 76 billion As a percentage of revenues  gross margin in the quarter was 5   down 70 bps on a year over year basis Distribution  selling  general and

the latest guidance range of  5 09 beats the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 08 In ConclusionCardinal Health exited the fiscal third quarter on a mixed note  wherein adjusted earnings outpaced the consensus mark  while revenues missed the same  The Pharmaceutical segment registered solid growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers  An upbeat guidance is indicative of brighter prospects These apart  the company s extension of its agreements with CVS Health  NYSE CVS   collaboration with PANTHERx Specialty Pharmacy and buyout of mscripts raise optimism Nevertheless  sluggishness in the Medical segment is a concern  Despite growth in business  profits in the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing  Further  huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarters  Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks  Recently  the company closed the divestiture of Cardinal Health China distribution Zacks RankCurrently  Cardinal Health carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Earnings of MedTech Majors at

pharmacy operations of Aetna have been transitioned from the Health Care Benefits segment to the Pharmacy Services segment CVS Health Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Pharmacy Services revenues inched up 3 1  to  33 56 billion in the reported quarter  driven by growth in total pharmacy claims volume andthe brand name drug price inflation  This was  however  partially offset by a

adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC were nudged up by 3 3  year over year to  21 12 billion  Per the company  the result was based on increased prescription

pharmacy operations of Aetna have been transitioned from the Health Care Benefits segment to the Pharmacy Services segment CVS Health Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Pharmacy Services revenues inched up 3 1  to  33 56 billion in the reported quarter  driven by growth in total pharmacy claims volume andthe brand name drug price inflation  This was  however  partially offset by a continued client price compressionand an increased generic dispensing rate Total pharmacy claims processed increased 2 8  on a 30 day equivalent basis  attributable to net new business and the steady adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC were nudged up by 3 3  year over year to  21 12 billion  Per the company  the result was based on increased prescription volume and branded drug price inflation  partially offset by a persistent reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions  Front store revenues rose 22 7  in the reported quarter  primarily banking on improved health product sales Total prescription volume grew 5 5  on a 30 day equivalent basis  boostedby the continued uptake of patient care programs and collaborations with

manufactured products sold to other segments  third party contract manufacturing and sales to wholesale partners  During the reported quarter  GNC Holdings  revenues from the U S    Canada segment fell 4 5  year over year to  489 2 million  Notably  e commerce sales accounted for 7 4  of U S  and Canada revenues  increasing from 7 1  in the prior year quarter Company owned net store closures

an increase in the sales volume in the international franchisees  However  a decline in the sales volume in China due to the transfer of the cross border e commerce China business to the newly formed joint venture  effective Feb 13  2019  partially offset the upside Revenues in the Manufacturing  Wholesale segment registered year over year plunge 37  to  34 7 million  excluding intersegment sales

Our Take
Conmed has delivered stellar performance in the fourth quarter  beating earnings and revenue estimates  Performance by the company s business segment has been commendable  with the Orthopedic Surgery rebounding after six quarters of decline 
Solid focus on innovation continues to drive sales and gain leverage in the international market  A raised guidance and shrinking debts instill optimism 
However  higher research and development expenditures are likely to be a concern as they continue to affect operating margins  Intense competition in the niche space adds to Conmed s woes

29714,251229,CNMD,FOMC Meeting Sparks Market Volatility ,opinion,"The stock market had an interesting day on Wednesday  There was the FOMC meeting with a lot of volatility after that  but at the end of the day we closed at the highs for the day going away  It was a very good session and a lot of our stocks did well 
Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ AEGR  was up 1 28  or 4   on 1 2 million shares on Wednesday  It looks like a potential nice swing  and we did put out a swing trade on it on Wednesday  because  not only did it take out the major declining topsline  but it broke through the coil that had been forming for three or four days  and broke out across resistance  The next target is at 36 1 2  Once it gets through that  look for it to head up toward 40  and then 44  It s going to take volume and it needs a thrust  but I like the configuration of the chart   left shoulder head right shoulder    and it does resemble some inverse head and shoulder bottoming pattern  So keep an eye on this one 
Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ AVNR   which is also one of our swing trades  had a beautiful  explosive break away gap with volume on Wednesday  It was up 43 cents  or 4   on 14 7 million shares  Notice that it had a spike high day on Monday  an inside day on Tuesday  and then on Wednesday  it was back up again to test the high  If it can get through 13 00 13 10  the high being 13 09 on Wednesday  look for a quick run to 16 16 1 2 
Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ  may be the star of the solar group right now by the way it s acting  with a fantastic earnings report on big volume  It had a breakaway move that took it through the moving averages  lateral resistance  and declining topsline  then it worked its way above major resistance  formed a flag  and consolidated  On Wednesday  it was up 2 76  or 7 35   on 6 3 million shares  The next target is 45  and then 48 
YRC Worldwide Inc  NASDAQ YRCW  had a spectacular day on Wednesday  It had a big breakaway gap  and then a surge that took it right up to the target at 23 3 4  Wednesday s high was 23 99  which was a nominal new high  It also tagged the 50 day moving average  which was just pennies from there  so as a result  it backed off a little bit  It now has the potential for a declining topsline  probably Thursday or Friday  Look for a big move  It looks like it will get to 27 again  but we ll have to see if there is a follow through day

required announcements completed  I will turn the call over to Curt Hartman  CONMED s president and chief executive officer  for opening remarks  Mr  Hartman Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Jimmy  Good afternoon  and thank you for joining us for CONMED s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call  With me on the call is Todd Garner  executive vice president and chief financial officer  Today  I will provide a brief overview of the financial and operating highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year  Todd will then provide a more detailed analysis of our financial performance and discuss our 2020 financial guidance  After that  we will open the call to your questions  Turning to our results  Total sales for the fourth quarter were  264 9 million  representing a year over year increase of 9 2  as reported and an increase of 9 3  in constant currency Organic sales growth in the quarter  which excludes the impact of Buffalo Filter  was 2 6  in constant currency basis  On a pro forma basis  if we had owned Buffalo Filter in 2018  our growth for the fourth quarter of 2019 would have been 4 6   While the absolute revenue number in the quarter was in line given the disruption we projected  Buffalo Filter was especially strong  and global Orthopedics was below expectations  For the full year  sales reached  955 1 million  representing a year over year increase of 11 1  as reported and 11 7  in constant currency  still an organic sales growth of 5 9   On a pro forma basis  if we had owned Buffalo Filter in 2018  our top line growth for 2019 would have been 7 3   From an earnings perspective  during the fourth quarter  our GAAP net income totaled  14 9 million  This compares to net income of  15 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  Excluding special items that affected comparability  our adjusted net income of  26 8 million increased 26 5  year over year  and our adjusted diluted net earnings per share of  0 90 increased 23 3  year over year  For the full year  our GAAP net income totaled  28 6 million compared to net income of  40 9 million in 2018  Excluding special items that affected comparability  our adjusted net income of  77 9 million increased 24  year over year  and our adjusted diluted net earnings per share of  2 64 increased 21 1  year over year  We are very pleased with the 2019 performance  which we believe positions us for success in 2020 and over the long term  In 2019  we are proud of our efforts around the continued introduction of innovative products across many of our businesses  the successful acquisition and performance of the Buffalo Filter assets  the addition of two new directors  the acceleration of the sales force expansion and International channel evolution  and finally  strong full year revenue and adjusted earnings growth  Overall  we made the right strategic investments to build the foundation for sustainable long term growth  I m pleased with where we stand today with good momentum on the top and the bottom lines  as evidenced by our adjusted EBITDA margin reaching 20  for the first time in Q4 of 2019  As we move to 2020  we are focused on building off this momentum and delivering above market revenue and earnings growth as evidenced by our outlook  Finally  it s worth noting that in February  CONMED will celebrate the 50th year since the company s founding by Eugene Corasanti  We think Gene would be proud of this company today  and based on our guidance  this should also be the year that we exceed  1 billion in revenue  a finished    a fitting accomplishment to highlight the 50 year anniversary  With that  I ll turn the call over to Todd  who will provide a more detailed analysis of our performance and discuss our financial guidance  Todd  Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Curt  As Curt mentioned  our fourth quarter sales totaled  264 9 million  which represents an increase of 9 2  on a reported basis and 9 3  in constant currency  The demand for Buffalo Filter products continues to be very strong  and we sold  16 2 million of this exciting product line in Q4  As we previewed on our Q3 call  our Q4 organic sales results were below trend  due in part to channel changes and sales force expansions that we brought forward into 2019  Part of this increased investment in the sales force is in response to the significant attention that Buffalo Filter has required from our existing sales reps  This is obviously a high quality problem  But the strength in Buffalo Filter demand this year has actually lowered our organic growth metric from what it would have otherwise been  In Q4  as Curt said  our organic growth was 2 6   and if we had owned Buffalo Filter in the prior year  it would have been 4 6   For the full year  our sales totaled  955 1 million  which represents an increase of 11 1  as reported and 11 7  on a constant currency basis  Our organic growth was 5 9  for the year  But if we had owned Buffalo Filter in the prior year  our organic growth rate in 2019 would have been 7 3   All remaining sales growth numbers I referenced today will be given in constant currency  The reconciliation to GAAP numbers is included in our press release  For the fourth quarter of 2019  our domestic sales increased 13 8  versus the prior year period  while International sales increased 4 5   Worldwide Orthopedics revenue decreased 0 6  in the fourth quarter  Approximately 30  of our Orthopedic revenue is capital sales  And as you know  capital can be lumpy from quarter to quarter  Q4 2019 was weaker than we expected on the capital side and faced a comparable quarter in the prior year that was the strongest capital quarter in memory  Our disposable and procedural products continue to grow nicely  and we re confident our new product pipeline will allow our Orthopedic business to grow faster than the market over the long term  Worldwide General Surgery revenue grew 19 8  in the fourth quarter  driven by strong performances across the product portfolio  Turning now to full year results  Our domestic sales increased 15 2  versus 2018  while International sales increased 7 9   Worldwide Orthopedics revenue increased 4 5  year over year  and worldwide General Surgery revenue grew 19 4   As we look to 2020  we expect total company worldwide organic constant currency revenue growth to be between 7  and 7 5   with currency being a headwind of approximately 120 to 150 basis points based on current exchange rates  We estimate about  5 million of inorganic sales from Buffalo Filter in 2020  which should result in a range of reported revenue between  1 13 billion and  1 20 billion  So as Curt said  despite the currency headwind  we expect to cross the  1 billion revenue mark in the year of our 50th anniversary  and we expect the second billion will come much more quickly than the first  Now let s move to the expense side of the income statement  For comparative purposes  I will discuss the P L performance  excluding special items  which include impairments  charges related to acquisitions  restructurings  legal matters  and amortization of intangible assets net of tax  A reconciliation to GAAP numbers is included in our press release  Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 54 1   which was lower than we expected  As we ve talked about before  the timing of manufacturing variances can occasionally create lumpiness in gross margins in a given period  and that was the case this quarter  As an example  if we isolate just the timing of how manufacturing variances hit the P L  it benefited gross margins in Q4 2018 by 30 basis points but was unfavorable to gross margins by 80 basis points in Q4 2019  The good news on gross margins is that they increased 80 basis points on a full year basis over 2018  As we look forward  we expect gross margins to continue this trajectory of improvement  delivering between 80 and 100 basis points of improvement for the full year 2020  despite approximately 30 to 40 basis points of expected headwind from FX  The way you should think about this throughout the year due to accounting rules is that Q1 will show year over year improvement  but it will be well below the anticipated full year range  And as the year progresses  our gross margin improvement will strengthen and deliver between 80 and 100 basis points for the full year  Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter were 4 6  of total sales and grew approximately 17  over the prior year quarter on a dollar basis  For the full year 2019  we increased our adjusted R D expense by approximately 20  and came in at 4 8  of sales for the full year  Looking forward  we will continue to expect R D to be between 4 5  and 5  of sales in 2020  Fourth quarter SG A expenses on an adjusted basis were 35 3  of total sales  reflecting an improvement of 210 basis points compared to Q4 2018  Full year 2019 adjusted SG A was 37 8  of sales  an improvement of 130 basis points over the full year 2018  which was significantly better than we guided to at the beginning of the year  As we grow and our product offering expands  it is important to consistently match our resources to our opportunities  After Q3  we talked about some changes we are making as a result of that assessment  These changes were primarily in U S  General Surgery and certain international markets across all product lines  Today  we are announcing the next phase of changes we are making to improve the future growth of the company  which is focused on our U S  Orthopedic sales team  As you know  we have put significant investment over the past few years into an innovative product pipeline in Orthopedics  As those products become available as 2020 unfolds  we have taken a fresh look at our sales resources to make sure we are best equipped to deliver these innovative solutions to the marketplace  As a result  we are both adding sales territories and changing sales resources in select markets  These moves will increase SG A in advance of the productivity of those additional resources  especially in Q1  We believe these changes will strengthen our ability to grow above the market in the future  Despite these additional investments  we still expect SG A as a percentage of sales to improve by approximately 10 to 40 basis points for the full year in 2020  with increasing leverage as we move throughout the year  Interest expense for the full year 2019 was  30 9 million  As we look to 2020  we expect interest expense to be between  27 million and  28 million  Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 15 9  compared to 23 3  in the prior year period  This was lower than we had forecasted  principally due to the excess tax benefit from stock options which is difficult to predict  In Q4  that included the vesting of 5 year performance stock units that were granted as Curt undertook the rebuilding of CONMED five years ago  For the full year  the adjusted effective tax rate was 19  compared to 21 9  in 2018  As we talked about on the third quarter call  as we look to 2020  we can t count on that same level of benefits on the tax line that we received in 2019  Our normal statutory effective tax rate  given our mix of business  should be in the 24  to 25  range  so we will start 2020 with that guidance  Fourth quarter GAAP net income totaled  15 0 million or  0 49 per diluted share compared to reported net income of  15 7 million or  0 54 per diluted share a year ago  Excluding the impact of special items discussed earlier  our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share were  0 90 versus  0 73 in the prior year period  representing growth of 23  for the quarter  That brings the full year adjusted cash EPS to  2 64  representing growth of 21  over the prior year  which was well above our original guidance for the year of 11  to 13   We forecast full year 2020 adjusted diluted cash earnings per share in the range of  3 08 to  3 13  representing growth of approximately 17  to 19   and that s inclusive of  0 15 to  0 20 of FX headwind impacting EPS in 2020  As we look at the phasing of our financial performance throughout the year  I would expect Q1 to be the toughest quarter from a revenue and profitability growth standpoint  The investments we began making in Q4  and which continue today  will be mostly in the expense lines  but the sales productivity associated with these investments will come later  We are also watching the health situation in China closely  We will always prioritize the safety of our employees and customers over financial results  We have suspended travel in China  and our offices are currently closed  We hope the epidemic resolves quickly  but at this time  we are erring on the side of caution  I ll remind you that China represents between 2  and 3  of our global sales  So for Q1  we expect 5  to 6  organic constant currency growth despite the extra day we get from leap day  As I mentioned a few minutes ago  we expect around  5 million of inorganic contribution from Buffalo Filter prior to its anniversary date  Our FX headwinds on the revenue line are more pronounced in the beginning of the year and get a little better each quarter as the year unfolds  For Q1  we project an FX headwind on the revenue line of 170 to 200 basis points  For adjusted cash EPS in Q1  our projection would be for it to grow high single digits or low double digits and then improve as the year progresses  As we look at the phasing for the rest of the year  the only meaningful adjustment to call out at this point is that Q2 has one less day than the prior year  so we would expect constant currency revenue growth to be between 100 and 150 basis points lower than our full year guidance range in Q2  Looking at the balance sheet  Our cash balance at the end of the year was  25 9 million compared to  30 1 million as of September 30  Accounts receivable days as of December 31 were 64 days compared to 67 days a year ago  Inventory days at year end were 121 compared to 127 a year ago  Long term debt at the end of the year was  753 6 million versus  780 7 million at September 30  Our leverage ratio at December 31 was 4 4x  Cash flow from operations for the year was  95 1 million compared to  74 7 million in 2018  And capital expenditures were  20 1 million compared to  16 5 million in the prior year  In 2020  we expect operating cash flow to be between  110 million and  120 million with capital expenditures around  20 million  With that  we d like to open the call to your questions  And I ll hand it back to Jimmy  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan  Your line is now open Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thanks for taking the question  Maybe one on 4Q and one on 2020  If we start with fourth quarter  you did a good job highlighting that there d be sales force disruption in the quarter  I was wondering if you could get into a little more detail of exactly where you undertook the sales force restructuring in Surgery  the impact it had  and why you think there was the underperformance you talked about within the Orthopedics business Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Robbie  Let me start with where we undertook the sales force restructuring  On the third quarter call  we said we re going to pull forward some sales force restructure  And we did that because we were in a position to do that  We had been watching these parts of the business  specifically the General Surgery side of the business and some International markets focused on all products  whether they were selling Orthopedics or General Surgery  And so as we moved into the fourth quarter  we had notified people in those markets that this was going to happen  And we started cascading that through a part of that involved hiring new people  a lot of which we accomplished in the fourth quarter  not 100   but a lot of it was accomplished in the fourth quarter  Outside the U S   it was around channels where we looked and said  are we going direct  Are we changing distributor  Or are we doing a mix  as may be the case in some markets  And it could have been on the Orthopedic side  or it could have been on the General Surgery side  As you look at that body of activity  it s inherent that it s going to cause some disruption for existing sales reps who  number one  have a fear of losing geography that they may have been working in for an extended period of time and they re trying to understand what they re going to have left as they go into the new year  It also has the opposite effect  and I think we saw some of that as an example in Buffalo Filter  where sales force knew that was a very appealing product in the market  and they had a lot of activity going on and they wanted to capitalize it    on it while they could in the fourth quarter before they lost that geography and that sales opportunity  So that s a little bit of the sales force expansion  On Orthopedics  I think    I d take you back to what Todd said  About 30  of that business is capital  We have    if you look back over our results over the last two years  really  we ve had very good capital performance every quarter for effectively two years  And the fourth quarter of last year was a really strong capital quarter  We just didn t get the capital orders in to get us over the hill on that business  So a little bit disappointed there  Don t think it has anything to do with the macro perspective  I think the capital markets are still strong  We just didn t get the performance done  the work done that we needed to get where we wanted to get Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great color  And maybe just on 2020  the sales guidance of 7  to 7 5  came in a lot better than I had been expecting  I think most people have been expecting  Maybe just walk us through the confidence    or what gives you the confidence to start at such an elevated level here  Is it Buffalo Filter driving the majority of the upside  Or just walk us through what gives you that level of confidence  Thanks  guys Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure  Robbie  Thanks for the question  You know what  it s actually not elevated from where we ve been  Like I tried to explain in my script  that organic growth throughout the year has been a little bit misleading because Buffalo has been so strong and taken so much attention that  really  the more relevant number to focus on for our performance in 2019 is that pro forma growth  you know  What it would have been had we owned Buffalo in the prior year  and that was 7 3  for the full year  So that s really what the engine did in  19  And so to guide 7  to 7 5   that s kind of what we ve been doing  And we expect continued momentum on all parts of the business  And so we feel pretty good that that is    that s a good place to start for the year  We think that s what the engine s doing Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer And Robbie  I would just add  A lot of our confidence comes in the pipeline  And last year  and I said this in my opening comments  we introduced a lot of innovation across all of our businesses  You don t fully realize the benefit of that innovation the year that you release  And candidly  some of those introductions which occurred at trade shows didn t really get into the market fully as a system until the second half of the year  So as we go into 2020  we ve got that time under our belt  Those platforms are now out  We had a we had our biggest year ever in medical education and training last year with customers so we think all those various strategic investments that occurred in  19 just help us build as we get into 2020 Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer And I would actually just clarify a little bit of what Curt just said  We announced a bunch of products  Some of those  even sitting here today  still actually aren t clear yet  They re still going through the regulatory process  So some of them aren t even out in the market yet  right  So they re coming still  So the pipeline    as we look forward  we expect more from that pipeline in the future than what we ve had in the past Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  I appreciate the color  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc  Your line is now open Matthew Mishan    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Great  and thank you for taking the questions  I wanted to start with the gross margin guidance  You guys have like previously communicated that you expected 50    I don t want to put words in your mouth  but 50 to 100 basis points of gross margin expansion per year  And I think inherent in the guidance is some acceleration there  especially given the FX headwind  So I guess  just curious as to what some of the incremental drivers of that inherent acceleration are for 2020 Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure  Matt  Good question  And you didn t put the words in our mouth  We put those words in our mouth  You re right  We    that s what we said on kind of a long term repeatable basis  We ve said that we would expect 50 to 100 basis points of improvement in gross margin every year  You know  2020 looks like a better year based on what the team was able to accomplish in 2019  And as we ve updated our cost at the end of the year  you know  we do a cost roll on December 31 and roll it into our standard margins  And it was a strong year  So we re out of the gates  I think  a little better than we are normally  And we feel good about the volumes  We feel good about the mix of new products  New products are all accretive to our margin profile  And so as we specifically look at 2020  it looks like a strong year for gross margins  And as you said  that s despite absorbing  you know  a meaningful headwind from FX  So we re pretty pleased with the 2020 guide on margins Matthew Mishan    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst OK  excellent  And then how should we think about the balance of growth for next year between Orthopedics and General Surgery Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  it s a great question  We expect both to grow above markets  I think Orthopedics  because of the changes we re making just now  will probably be muted a little bit as the year starts and should get better as the year goes on  The investments that we talked about after the Q3 call on the General Surgery side  that also had the same kind of disruption  but we started that earlier  So hopefully  those benefits  we ll see those earlier in 2020  But in general  I would say  we expect all sides of the business to grow faster than their markets  And we feel like we did that in 2019  And we expect to do that again in 2020 Matthew Mishan    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst OK  Thanks  Todd  Thanks  Curt OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst I just wanted to circle back on the General    or the Orthopedic Surgery business and just kind of get a little bit more detail on this capital  That kind of sounds like it was a little bit of a tough quarter and whatnot  We have seen some other companies with some contracts that have been pushed out and some other softer quarters  So I understand your comments that it doesn t seem like it s more of a macro issue at this point  but it does seem like there are some other companies that are also saying it s not a macro issue  but some other quarters that have been coming in a little lighter as well  Was this a contract that has been pushed or business that was just lost that will come back in the first quarter  It sounds to me like 1Q should be also a little bit softer because of some of the sales disruptions  Any additional color that you could just add on what type of product this is  I know you have some of the visualization products that are in there that has generally been the lumpier side of Orthopedic Surgery  Just any additional color there  and then I ll probably have a follow u  too Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  I think specifically  as it relates to Orthopedics  if you think about the capital that is in that business  it is video  It is the power tool platforms  We ve had good success in the last couple of years  We had the MicroFree platform  still a very relevant platform  still doing very well  But the other parts of the capital within Ortho are a little bit aged  and we need to be a little more competitive there  And I really don t believe it is a macro perspective  Kristen  I think it s really our performance  We had some operational issues that slowed us down a little bit  We are working hard to get in front of that  And it s just a kind of combination of a bunch of small things that added up to it and not a very good quarter in capital for us  I think as Todd alluded to  we stepped into the first quarter  We expect some disruption in Ortho because of the sales changes  So we re not guiding in the first quarter for big overperformance in Ortho by any stretch  But we do think as the year goes on  our Ortho business will get better  And I think Todd commented in his script as well that on the procedural side  where a lot of the innovation has occurred  things are continuing to move at a very nice pace there with new product acceptance and uptick Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst And then just  I guess  big picture  you guys have always kind of said that you re feeling like the model has been kind of this at least mid single digit growth  double digit bottomline  And now you re kind of guiding to 7  to 7 5   I guess  on the top line  which  I guess  is technically at least mid single digits  But do you think now we re kind of setting the new kind of bar  I guess  with now thinking about Buffalo Filter being in the base and you ve got AirSeal  Those two parts of the businesses are now collectively a nice chunk and growing solidly  strong double digits  that this is kind of setting kind of a new kind of baseline for what we should think about CONMED growing at in the future  just overall from a top line perspective Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Kristen  Great question  You know  look  our    the measure of success here is to grow faster than the markets  right  And to do it sustainably  repeatedly  and that s we re focused on  You are correct that our guide of 7  to 7 5  is now technically above the mid single digit range that we ve talked about  You know  I think that kind of 6  to 8   if you think about    if we can define something between mids and highs and call it 6  to 8   I think that s actually where CONMED has been performing for the last couple of years  really  right  We ve had a quarter or two either above or below that range  but I think 6  to 8  is kind of where the engine has been  and I think we are comfortable in that range right now  And we certainly would not expect the business to slow down  But yes  I think    so maybe we can define a CONMED    current CONMED range and call it 6  to 8  Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst OK  That seems fair  Thanks very much  I ll jump back in the queue Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Kristen OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Good afternoon  Curt  Hi  Todd  Maybe just to start off back on the sales force expansion discussion  You have been very clear that you were accelerating your investment there  your initiatives  your territory splitting  And I just wanted to    if I could understand better  when do you think the process is going to be completed  largely completed  Is it largely completed in the first quarter  And is it correct to assume  if it is largely completed then  that as the year unfolds  probably more in the back half that these initiatives support that acceleration as we move toward throughout 2020  Is that the right way to think about it Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer So Rick  great question  I would break it down into the two parts  The part that we announced on the third quarter really focused on the U S  General Surgery and broadly International  agnostic of which product category we re talking about  That work  because it started as we entered the fourth quarter  is largely in place  As I said earlier  we re still in the hiring mode in some of the geographies where we re doing expansion  But by and large  most of those folks that have been hired have either been to or are in training as we wrap up the month of January and are out working in their new geography  their new territory or in the category of International  We ve made the associated go direct or channel change move and have new people up and running  Now their productivity is a whole different question  and we think that productivity ramps as the year unfolds  And because we started this now a quarter ago  we re going to get to that productivity ramp sooner  The second half  which we just announced this morning  was the U S     or this afternoon was the U S  Orthopedics business  And literally  we are just coming out of those communications in the month of January when you have your sales meetings and you talk to your team and you look at the performance and you look at the new product cadence that they ve been given and what s coming and you say  what do we need to best match up sales  commercial with product innovation that we ve provided or are providing  And so we re now just communicating and rolling those transitions through  in some cases  doing hires  In other cases  looking at the expansion geographies and really cementing that so that  that will take us into the first quarter here  We would hope to have all of that done in this quarter  And then productivity  again  will follow on the heels of that    those people and changes being in place Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Alright  That makes sense  So 1 5 questions  just to follow up  The half  I would assume  it showed what you were saying about that 2  to 3  of sales in China  Do we expect that to drop dramatically  go away temporarily  I just wasn t sure what you wanted us to believe  And maybe last  you could talk a little bit more  I don t expect you to give us specifics for competitive reasons  but you ve  you know    Todd alluded to the new products that have    that are in the pipeline that have yet to be approved  seemingly like it    relatively imminent  But maybe just talk broadly about where you re focused  And should we imagine that the acceleration in innovation and pipeline is ever more visible as we proceed through 2020  Thank you Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer OK  So first of all  on China  Rick  So it is    it s the Chinese New Year right now and so this is a week where China has essentially shut down anyway  The government has asked the people that it d be kind of only really important travel that happens between now and the 10th  They re trying to get a handle on the spread of the virus  And so they ve asked for very limited travel through February 10  And so we are following those guidelines at this point  And you know  that s all we know for now  right  So as we get updates every day  we ll know if people can get back to work after the 10th or if it extends beyond that  And so it s just something we re watching  It s not a huge impact on us  But in a given quarter  if it extends much longer than the current request  then it could have a negative impact on the guide that we ve just given this morning for Q1  And so anyway  we just wanted to call that out as something we re watching closely  On the new products and how those roll out and when you should expect more contribution  the good news and the bad news about this sector is that our customers don t change quickly or easily  We are very encouraged by the innovation that CONMED has delivered  and we believe and are seeing customers get excited by that innovation  But as we said multiple times  this will be a slow kind of gradual growth  account by account  doctor by doctor  that will add to itself over time  And so when you launch something  it doesn t have an immediate huge impact on the revenue line  But over time  several quarters later and then as you move forward on a sequential basis  you gain accounts  and it grows and becomes more impactful  And so that s how we think of it  We think you ll see more in 2020 from a revenue perspective from the 2019 launches than you did in  19  and then the same will be true for every succeeding year Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham   Company  Your line is now open Mike Matson    Needham and Company    Analyst Thanks  Thanks for taking my question  I guess just wanted to go back to the kind of gross margin or  I guess  sorry  operating margin  implied guidance and the fact that you ve got this pretty significant EPS headwind  It seems like  from my math  about 30 to 40 basis points in there  If I look at the guidance for gross margin and SG A that you re looking at underlying margin improvement of 100 to   sorry  120 to 180 basis points  if my math is right  So I guess that s a pretty significant improvement  So just how confident are you in your ability to deliver that  What s really going to be driving that in 2020 Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer OK  Good question  Mike  I would    so the ranges we gave  as I model these out  the ranges on the expense lines and on the revenue growth that I gave would    if you took the high and low of all of those ranges  you would get an operating margin range improvement of 70 to 170 basis points  So you can pick where you want to be in on that range  And that includes    and that s inclusive of 40 to 50 bps of headwind from FX  So as you just did  translating that to what it would have been without FX  you re right  It would have been a higher number without FX  And so I think your math is solid  You re on the high    you re on the higher side of the full range of available options  But yeah  I think the key takeaway is the profitability engine is strong  continues from last year  you know  maybe even accelerating  And it gives us the freedom and the ability to make some of these pretty significant changes that we talked about last quarter and that we re talking about this quarter  The strength of the profitability allows us to do those things at a bigger scale than maybe we could have otherwise done and still deliver our commitments on the bottom line Mike Matson    Needham and Company    Analyst OK  How much of that margin improvement is coming from mix  from Buffalo Filter and just higher margin products  I guess Oh  man  that s hard to break out when you start talking about the whole portfolio  When we bought Buffalo Filter  we talked about it contributing 50 basis points of increased operating margin in 2020  And obviously  it s overperformed  And so it s at least that on its contribution alone  But at this point  it s kind of melded into the business  It s in a    it s a little hard to get too precise with the different pieces  I think what we re happy about is the overall engine is working  the profitability is improving and it allows us to fund the business to keep the top line growing above market and still deliver really healthy double digit growth on the bottom  OK  That s helpful  And then just more of a housekeeping question  I apologize if you mentioned this in prepared remarks  I might have missed it  But it does look like the diluted share count was up a little bit sequentially  So could you maybe explain why that happened Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Nothing abnormal there  We did have the vesting of the performance stock units that I talked about  So    but other than that  nothing abnormal Mike Matson    Needham and Company    Analyst Alright  great  That s all I have  Thank you Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Mike OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Matt O Brien with Piper Sandler  Your line is now open Drew Stafford    Piper Sandler    Analyst Hi  guys  This is Drew  on for Matt  Thank you for taking the question  I guess I was paging through your slide deck a couple of weeks ago while you were presenting  and there s really a couple of slides that stood out to me One was the chart of new projects    or new products as a percent of your total revenue  And then  I guess  the other was the breakout of your products into negative and single and then double digit growth buckets  And then  I guess  collectively  it s showing a pretty impressive transition in the business over the last five years  I guess a piece of that was  obviously  driven by new product launches  but you also had some SKU reduction in that process  So to focus a little bit on the latter  I guess my question is  how far along are you in that SKU reduction process  I mean is that 10   20   30   50   And then two  how meaningful could that be from a profitability perspective Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer So Drew  our focus on the first part of that question on new products as a percentage of quarterly revenue  we ve been providing that chart now a couple of years  And the reason we initiated that chart was because early on  we were putting a lot of money into R D  and we needed a visual to show folks what they were getting or what we re driving with that investment in R D  And I think at last look  which we showed at JPMorgan s conference  we showed that number being north of 30  of the quarterly revenue  And we think that s in a healthy range  and we re probably going to discontinue that chart as the company is going to continue to innovate  We re going to continue to drive  That number is going to bounce around a little bit  On the other side of the question  as we looked at the portfolio  I think Todd and I have said many times  our priority for our operations group is to launch new products  Secondarily  it s what I would call the internal efficiencies and driving internal efficiencies  whether that s through manufacturing enhancements or SKU reduction  I would say  just overall  without getting into many details that the SKU reduction component of our efficiency drive has not been a major factor  It s been more about M A and new product innovation driving accretive gross margin products into the portfolio  And it s been about the sales volume  So SKU reduction  if it were to be a large contributor  still remains in front of us  but we haven t quantified that or candidly initiated that as a massive part of the effort at this point in time  I don t know  Todd  if that s a fair summary from your chair Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I think it s a great summary  Yes  I wouldn t overemphasize SKU reduction  although it s part of it  but I d say  it s a small part of it  The focus has simply been to put our resources into faster growing markets and to meet unmet needs in those markets  And so that s what we ve been doing  And we ve    and as we ve added resources there  they ve delivered and that has what    that s what has shifted the mix of the portfolio to a balance of faster growing things DrewStafford Got it  Thank you  And then on AirSeal  you ve had a couple of indication expansions over the last couple of years with thoracic and  I think  pediatric  Anything meaningful in the pipeline that we can expect there in 2020  And then I believe last you said  AirSeal is using about 30  robotic cases  Is that number still accurate today  Thank you Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer So let me take the first part of that  So we re    we remain very excited about AirSeal  It had another great year in 2019  And probably the biggest thing we can do for AirSeal was the sales force expansion that we talked about in the third quarter  putting more feet on the street in that component of our General Surgery category because that s the same team that s selling Buffalo Filter  two very innovative products  two very high in demand products  So we think the opportunity remains very large in front of us as it relates to AirSeal  driven  yes  by indication expansions into thoracic and pediatrics  But as we ve said many times  really driven by the ongoing development of clinical studies  really  around the globe  It s been really great to see global thought leaders embrace the technology  start their own body of work and get up and do podium presentations and publications  So that is as important as anything that we re doing inside on the innovative front  And I think you know  we re probably not going to talk about future pipeline as it relates to AirSeal  We like to launch things before we talk about them  But we understand the importance of that portfolio  and our work on that portfolio continues  I m going to let Todd probably update you on the Robotics Association Todd Garner    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  It is our estimate that growing about 30  of the robotic cases today  and that number seems to climb every year  So somewhere in that 30  to one third is probably where we are OperatorThank you   Operator instructions  Our next question is a follow up from Kristen Stewart with Barclays  Your line is now open Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst Hi Thanks for putting the product revenue pie chart in the slide deck  I guess    I didn t put my protractor up  but it looks like Buffalo Filter and AirSeal are approaching like  200 million in revenues  which is nice  So I guess if it s    is it correct to think about those two businesses is growing more  I guess  above that  call it  like 15  ish growth rate going forward  Is there anything that you guys see that would prevent that level of growth  And is there anything we should think about going forward  just in terms of legislative milestones or regulatory meetings for Buffalo Filter  I know that AORN meeting is probably coming up  I think that s usually like in the April ish time frame  And anything to update there Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  I ll start with the last part of that  AORN is    actually starts this Saturday after AOS  AOS is the last week in March in Orlando  and AORN is in Anaheim  California  So that will be a fun week for those in the industry on two different parts of the geography  The combination of AirSeal and Buffalo Filter and your question about 15  growth  we don t routinely throw around growth numbers  but we see both of those as double digit growers for the foreseeable future  On the Buffalo Filter side  we clearly exceeded our expectations in the first 11 months of that product  and there s nothing that we saw in the market globally that says there s a slowdown coming  Legislatively  there was not a lot of change in the fourth quarter  and we ve said this many times that it s really the healthcare worker that s driving this legislation  It s more of a lagging indicator at this point in time  The healthcare environment has really embraced the need for the smoke free workplace because of all the health hazards associated with surgical smoke  and we re doing our best to support that initiative behind the scenes  and legislation has not fundamentally changed in the last quarter  So I think I got all your questions there  Kristen  But if I didn t  please ask again Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst I think we re good  Is there anything to note at AAOS  Or will it just be kind of releasing some of the new products and just kind of showcasing them there Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer I think it s    academy as a show for us starts the year  new product cadence is typically best demonstrated there  though it is early in the year  So oftentimes  we have things that come out later in the year  But again  a good show for CONMED in our Orthopedics business Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst OK  Thanks very much OperatorThank you  I d now like to turn the call back over to Mr  Hartman for any closing remarks  Mr  Hartman Curt Hartman    President and Chief Executive Officer Alright  Thank you  Jimmy  and I want to thank everybody on the call today for your time  and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings
