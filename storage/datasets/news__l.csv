105953,327468,L,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  August 5 
1  Beijing lets yuan slide  strikes back at U S  agriculture
China retaliated against U S  President Donald Trump s threat of a fresh 10  tariff on  300 billion in Chinese goods starting on Sept  1 by allowing its currency to drop below 7 to the dollar for the first time in a decade  sparking fears of a round of competitive devaluations across the globe  
Trump has long been critical of Beijing for manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage  and additional yuan weakness could further escalate tensions with Washington 
The Chinese government also told its state owned enterprises to suspend imports of U S  agricultural products  according to people familiar with the situation cited by Bloomberg 
2  Global stocks enter risk off mode as tensions rise
Risk off sentiment intensified on Monday as the slide in the yuan  and Beijing s reported order to halt U S  agricultural imports  sparked sell offs in commodity and stock markets in Asia and Europe  
European stocks slumped nearly 2  while U S  futures pointed to a decline of more than 1  at the open 
Asian stocks fell to a six month low while the Hang Seng index led losses in the region as Hong Kong entered a ninth week of protests  including a city wide strike  its first in more than 50 years 
Trump s threat to increase tariffs on Chinese goods had sent the S P 500 to close last Friday with its worst weekly performance of the year  a slide of 3 1   The Nasdaq tumbled 3 9   also its largest weekly decline in 2019  while the Dow racked up a 2 6  drop  its second worst of the year 
  a 3 1  slide 
The U S  will likely remain focused on trade developments as the deluge of earnings slows this week with only around 62 S P 500 companies reporting  Loews  NYSE L     Tyson Foods    NYSE TSN  and Cars com  NYSE CARS  are among those firms scheduled for release on Monday 
3  Safe haven demand soars amid trade tensions
With risk off sentiment in full swing  investors flocked to safe haven assets in a flight from riskier equities 
Spot gold jumped more than 1  to its highest level since May 2013 
Fixed income demand was reflected by the yield on the U S  10 year Treasury hitting a three year low of 1 74   more than 30 basis points below where it was before Trump s tweets on Friday  Germany s 10 year Bund saw its yield plunge further into negative territory  marking an all time low of  0 54   
In forex markets  safe haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc rose against the U S  dollar  while higher yielders such as the Aussie dollar and Korean won fell 
Bitcoin  which some market participants argue should be considered a safe haven asset  jumped around  1 000  shooting past  11 000 over the weekend for the first time in two weeks 
4  U S  services sector activity on watch
In a thin day for U S  economic data  market focus will center on the Institute of Supply Management s purchasing managers  index for the services sector  America s largest  at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT  
The non manufacturing PMI for July is expected to strengthen slightly after the manufacturing gauge registered its weakest reading in nearly three years last week 
A similar survey for China released overnight showed the country s services sector expanded at the slowest pace in five months 
Surveys in Europe showed the general trend that a rapidly deteriorating manufacturing sector offset robust growth in services  according to IHS Markit  while the fact that the U K  s services sector activity hit a nine month high did little to derail the risk of stagnation at the start of the third quarter 
5  Oil prices tumble on trade worries
Concerns that the escalating U S  China trade dispute will exacerbate the global economic slowdown  denting demand for oil  sent crude prices sliding around 1  
That was despite the fact that Iran reportedly seized another oil tanker in the Persian Gulf  accusing the vessel of smuggling fuel for some Arab countries 
It is the third tanker seizure in the Strait of Hormuz  increasing worries that conflict could disrupt supply from one of the key shipping points for global oil

105956,327471,L,Special Report  When Ana ditched Andrea   The saga of Santander,news,"By Pamela Barbaglia  Rachel Armstrong and Alessandra Galloni
LONDON  Reuters    In September 2018  Santander  one of Europe s biggest banks  tweeted a video of its incoming new chief executive  an Italian investment banker named Andrea Orcel  Depicting a meeting with the bank s boss  Ana Botin  the clip showed the silver haired Italian cutting the air with a decisive gesture 
A few months later  the bank shot a new video  intended for investors and the media  at its Madrid headquarters  It shows Botin  who heads a 150 year old banking dynasty  saying she has withdrawn the offer because the new man s pay would be too high for the bank  according to two people with direct knowledge of the sequence  In the video  Orcel is shown appearing to agree with the outcome 
That clip was never released  in fact  the Italian now says he was misled  The rupture that followed the meeting has turned into one of the bitterest and highest profile employment disputes in recent European history  yielding a lawsuit that is due later this year in a Spanish civil court  This account of the Botin Orcel clash  the most comprehensive yet assembled  offers a rare glimpse inside the top level of one of the world s largest banks  a family led giant with a culture all its own  It is also a story of how  a decade after bankers were blamed for a crippling global financial crisis  the reality of austerity has been slow to fully sink in 
In May  Orcel sued Santander  demanding that the bank honor its offer or pay him 112 million euros   123 million  in damages   equivalent to equivalent to about 1  of the bank s profits in 2018 
In his suit  Orcel says a letter laying out his pay was a binding contract and that the video showing him accepting its withdrawal was shot on a false pretext  according to documents he submitted in court  In response  Santander said that under Spanish law  an offer letter is not a contract and that Orcel s behavior during negotiations led the bank to lose confidence in him 
Whatever the court decides  a rich body of evidence   texts and online messages between the pair and their family members  extracts from court documents  and interviews with eight people involved   shows a cosy relationship corroding  The messages   some reported here for the first time   suggest the hiring process for one of Europe s most important financial jobs went awry partly because old ties between powerful people led to hasty assurances and false assumptions 
Ana Botin  now 59  was a senior banker who had been named executive chairman of the group to succeed her late father  Emilio  a legendary patriarch who had built Santander into a global business through savvy acquisitions  Orcel  56  a widely respected banker who according to some media looks like  the George Clooney of investment banking   had been Botin s go to investment banker for advice on deal making and strategy 
 What is most important to me is your energy and enthusiasm  and I know that both for you personally and for your family this will be a good thing  
July 25  message from Ana Botin to Andrea Orcel
 This and other reproductions of text messages are based on original texts or submissions to court seen by Reuters  Some were originally written  in whole or part  in Spanish and have been translated  Some were redacted  and Reuters has edited two to preserve the anonymity of people with incidental roles in the story  
When the wooing began in mid 2018  Botin and Orcel s Portuguese wife  Clara Batalim Orcel  chatted about the Orcel family s plans to swap its mansion in Holland Park  London  for a nice place in Madrid  sources with knowledge of the matter said 
But for all its promise  terms of the September  2018 offer to hire Orcel  reviewed by Reuters  were not clear  Crucially  Santander promised to pay  up to  35 million euros of a 55 million euro package that Orcel was due to receive in future years from his employer at the time  Swiss bank UBS  The letter said Orcel would make his  best efforts  to cap that cost for Santander by getting the Swiss bank to contribute some of it 
UBS refused  and Orcel would not accept less than 35 million euros  By the end  the bankers and their spouses would have a frosty encounter in a coffee shop near London s Mayfair  And Santander s board had issued a statement questioning what it called Orcel s  dubious ethical and moral behavior   alleging he was secretly taping private conversations   which a source close to Orcel told Reuters he had done on legal advice 
The fallout has gripped Europe s investment banking industry  where Orcel is one of the best known dealmakers  It also raised questions about how one of Europe s most important banks   Santander has 144 million customers worldwide   could name a new CEO without first finalizing his pay 
Santander  founded by Royal Decree in 1857  has been run by the Botins for four generations  Its style has long been to move swiftly when needed  said Mauro Guillen  a management professor at Wharton School in Pennsylvania  who has written a book on Santander s development into a global bank 
 The bank is always very nimble when it comes to making bold decisions   he said  adding that in a rapidly changing environment  this made it popular with investors  But the way Orcel s appointment was handled shows Santander s speediness does not always pay off   If the bank wants to hire  not just a CEO but top executives  a lot of people may think twice  in the wake of the Orcel debacle 
Invited to comment on the details of its rupture with Orcel  the bank referred to a statement it made last year in response to Orcel s suit and media reports  saying it had followed a robust appointment process that met the highest standards of corporate governance and giving its reasons not to proceed with his appointment  Orcel declined to comment ahead of the court hearing  and UBS declined to comment 
 GLADIATOR 
Orcel knows Santander better than any other investment banker  Over nearly three decades as a dealmaker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  and UBS  he worked on dozens of transactions that helped Emilio Botin transform the bank  The biggest of these was when Santander joined a consortium and bought parts of ABN Amro  a major Dutch bank  in 2007 
Orcel is a driven and talented banker  interviews with former colleagues show  Having run investment banking at UBS since 2012  he had also made clear his desire for a CEO post  telling the Financial Times in 2015 that  of course  he wanted to run a bank some day  and if he could choose  UBS would be a good place to start 
When Emilio Botin died suddenly in September 2014  Ana  the eldest of his six children  was swiftly named to follow him  She would continue the family line in a bank whose shares are now mostly owned by institutional investors and funds  By appointing her  Santander followed a Spanish tradition of banks controlled by a single head  rather than a separate chairman and CEO  as the European Central Bank has said should be the norm 
The Botin family is part of Spain s aristocracy   the King of Spain made Botin s mother a marchioness in 2008  Ana  whose full name is Ana Patricia Botin Sanz de Sautuola O Shea  was made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Britain s queen for services to the British financial sector in 2015 
A keen golfer who describes herself as highly competitive  Botin was ranked by Forbes as one of the world s most powerful women  she told Spanish TV in January the special thing about her job is the power it gives to change lives for many people  She started her career at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   successfully turned around Santander s Spanish subsidiary Banesto  and ran its business in the UK  one of the bank s largest 
In Santander s top slot  she faced a challenge to sustain the growth rate her father had achieved 
Emilio s strategy of swallowing businesses in emerging markets had won plaudits for shielding Santander from the worst of the 2008 financial crisis  even as its home market was in deep recession  But when Emilio died  growth in Latin America was slowing and Santander s business in Britain and the United States faced strong headwinds  Like other banks  it was under pressure to bolster its capital  In September 2015  a year after Emilio s death  Santander s share price was down around 30  from when Ana had started 
Orcel the adviser was on hand  Four months after Ana Botin s elevation  he helped arrange a massive 7 5 billion euro capital increase  which took place overnight and was called  ballsy  by trade magazine Euromoney  Again  in 2017  Orcel advised when Santander picked up an ailing domestic rival  Banco Popular  for one euro  He arranged a 7 billion euro capital boost for Santander to cover Popular s bad debts 
In early 2018  with Santander s stock still lagging  Botin asked Orcel to outline a strategic plan to help lift the bank s share price  a source familiar with the matter told Reuters  That July  when the two met for dinner at the Loews  NYSE L  Regency hotel on Park Avenue in New York  she had a proposal  Join the bank as CEO and implement the plan 
One idea they discussed was that Santander could sell its underperforming U S  and British units   a task Orcel would execute  People familiar with the discussions said Orcel pledged loyalty to Botin  He compared his new role to that of the fighter Maximus  played by Russell Crowe in the 2000 movie  Gladiator   leading the troops into battle for his emperor 
For Orcel  Santander would be a radical switch  Investment bankers deal with big corporations and investment funds  while commercial ones serve small companies and individuals  He would be leaving the relationship driven world of investment banking   which he has likened to selling designer handbags such as Louis Vuitton   to a hands on role in a major commercial bank  which he has said is more  potatoes and tomatoes   comparable to Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  
 WORKING ON DETAILS   
With the offer in place  the next topic was pay  Orcel was used to big money  While working at Merrill Lynch  he had made headlines after receiving a  33 8 million bonus from the Wall Street investment bank for 2008  a year when Merrill s net loss swelled to  27 6 billion 
UBS had granted him a compensation package due to be paid out over several years  including roughly 55 million euros worth of stock to be paid in future  four sources familiar with the matter said 
Such deferred pay is one of the ways investment bankers in the European Union  where bonuses have been capped since 2014  have found to keep up their incomes  said Anna Marietta  co founder and managing partner of London based headhunting firm Vici Advisory  which specializes in investment banking 
It is meant as an incentive to lock executives into a bank  If they leave  executives in theory forfeit pay they ve accumulated 
In practice  it doesn t work like that  When investment bankers move jobs  the new employer usually  makes them whole  by paying their deferred compensation  In the investment banking world  this is seldom a point of contention  UBS had done it for Orcel when he joined from Bank of America in 2012  The Swiss bank topped up his  7 million in base salary with  26 million in deferred compensation carried over from his former employer  its annual report showed 
 It is very rare that compensation over deferred pay becomes a problem   said Marietta   In fact  none of my clients has ever experienced issues with it  
It s also very rare for a top investment banker to go directly into a top position in commercial banking  Usually they take a break between posts 
In September 2018  Ana Botin messaged Orcel to say colleagues at Santander were on board with his appointment and a staffing committee was working on financial details 
 Andrea  Nomco  nominations committee  100pc supportive and working on details    Regards  
Sept  10  message from Botin to Orcel
Orcel had told his boss at UBS about Botin s approach on the sidelines of an internal meeting in Zurich  There is no record of exactly how the CEO  Sergio Ermotti  responded  and UBS declined to comment  Orcel later messaged Botin saying his boss had said that if the Italian was moving on  it would be good to announce this before a planned investor day in October 
But there was a problem  As Spain s biggest lender  Santander needed to be mindful of the public mood   as well as the reaction of its 200 000 staff around the world  This was particularly true in the summer of 2018  The country was still recovering from a devastating recession  A Socialist government had just taken power  and some people thought it would impose a new bank tax  Santander was negotiating a large round of job cuts   trade unions said it cut 1 100 staff in Spain in 2018  a figure Santander did not dispute 
Botin saw room to maneuver  thanks to Santander s relationship with UBS 
Her father s dealings with Orcel had turned Santander into a big client for the Swiss bank  In each year the Spanish bank did a major deal  it brought UBS more than 50 million euros in fees  according to people familiar with their relationship  The banks declined to comment 
Botin saw a chance that UBS Chairman Axel Weber would want to keep that business going  the messages show  UBS itself might stump up some of the deferred compensation that Orcel stood to lose  If Weber decided not to  Botin told Orcel in a message  Santander would threaten to pull their business 
 There is a line I had reserved for Axel  if they decide not to pay you anything because we are their competitors  then it is good to know this  that they will not act as our strategic advisors   this is irrefutable and an  elegant  way of not beating around the bush

A few days later  Botin approached UBS to pave the way for discussions with its chairman  Axel Weber 
The Swiss bank s executives were all meeting in Singapore  where Orcel spoke to its CEO  Sergio Ermotti  and another UBS board member   They are helping us   he messaged to Botin 
 I have the green light from Sergio  Can you send me Axel s mobile for me to call him  Sergio has already given me the green light  I ll call you later and tell you about it  Un abrazo  Ana 
Sept  17  message from Botin to Orcel
But when Santander s boss got to speak to UBS chairman Weber  she found out he was not on board  He wanted Orcel to stay 
Weber wrote an email to Orcel s wife  Clara   whom Orcel consults closely on major career moves   saying the Swiss bank wanted to offer her husband a more senior role at UBS  that could pave the way to him succeeding Ermotti 
 Dear Clara  we have tried to offer him a way to stay at UBS with the same job perspective as outside UBS  The board is unanimous on this and committed to facilitating an orderly transition  It is now his choice and his decision  I appreciate it is a difficult choice  I have also talked to Ana and I was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions  I am aware that this will have consequences down the road but everything we do or don t do has  But as long as what we do is the right thing in our mind we will have to be happy to live with these consequences  
Sept  19  email from UBS Chairman Axel Weber to Clara Batalim Orcel
Weber said in the message that he had spoken to Botin   and I was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions  
Orcel messaged Botin later about UBS s offer 
 Board made a counter offer    Sergio promised he ll talk to board today and ask them to put me in a fair position  
Sept  20  2018   Message from Orcel to Botin
On Sunday  Sept  23  Orcel decided not to take up the counter offer  and to quit UBS  Meanwhile  Botin was still trying to persuade UBS s Weber to stump up some of Orcel s deferred pay  Without success 
 No se mueve  he is not budging   Says none of it at all  
Sept  23  message from Botin to Orcel
 THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP 
Despite this lack of movement from UBS  on Sept  24 Santander s board went ahead with an offer letter for Orcel 
Orcel s wife  Clara  was keen  She messaged Botin the same day to express support for what she called an agreement   it was not clear exactly what she meant   saying Orcel had told her that Botin s word was  worth more than a thousand contracts  
 Cara Ana  I am super happy that you have finally reached an agreement for Andrea to join     He has told me that your word is worth more than a thousand contracts  and I know that Andrea will give his best to deliver what you need  You know I am backing him up 150  in this change    thanks for your trust  Regards  Clara  
Sept  24  message from Clara Batalim Orcel to Ana Botin
Santander s offer was signed by Santander s General Secretary Jaime Renovales  It would make Orcel the highest paid bank CEO in the euro zone   and put his annual pay on par with Botin  who was paid almost 10 6 million euros in 2017  Her pension pot is worth about 46 million euros  according to Santander s annual report 
Santander promised Orcel a sign on bonus of 17 million euros  annual salary including bonus of 10 million euros  and deferred compensation in the form of shares  But the details on that were vague 
  Banco Santander   MC SAN  expects that you will do your best efforts to ensure that your current employer will continue to pay the long term incentive plans of which you are a beneficiary under the same conditions as if you were employed  Should your current employer pay only partially your long term incentives or an amount lower than the one you would have received remaining in the company  we will pay a buyout of a maximum of 35 million gross euros  
Sept  24  letter from Santander to Orcel
The next day  Orcel was appointed CEO  with the paperwork still to be finalised  He was invited to join discussions with Santander executives and a month later  made a member of an internal WhatsApp group called Promontorio  court documents show  Santander released the first video  where he was pictured gesticulating in a meeting with Botin and the man he was due to replace  Jose Antonio Alvarez 
Behind the scenes  negotiations on Orcel s pay were intense  Rather than letting the Italian go quickly  his Swiss employer insisted Orcel take a full six month  gardening leave   the gap top financiers usually take between jobs with a competing institution  This meant he would not be able to join Santander until April 2019 
Financially for Santander this could be good news   it meant part of Orcel s deferred pay would fall due while he was still on UBS s payroll 
Santander figured  therefore  that its costs would be reduced  Its board calculated the reduction at around 13 7 million euros  it said in a later statement 
But Orcel saw it differently  He did not think Santander should deduct pay from his deferred package while he was still a UBS employee  Some of it was a straight bonus for the previous year  And in his view  taking into account that his deferred package at UBS was worth about 55 million euros  he had already agreed to an effective pay cut of roughly 20 million euros  said sources familiar with his thinking 
His last day at UBS was Sept  30  But by October  things with Santander were going nowhere 
Orcel apologized to Botin  reminding her that UBS had stumped up people s deferred pay in the past  and hinting at a possible legal response 
 I am very sorry to have to put you in this position  It seems like we are begging when it s something that they have done before  If he doesn t move we ll have to take legal steps  
Oct  19  2018   Message from Orcel to Botin
Botin asked a Santander board member to speak to a counterpart in UBS  who refused to discuss the matter  saying UBS s board was united behind Weber s position  she told Orcel 
 I understand then you must stay until the end gardening period which includes the vesting period for February  Let s talk next week  let s not keep going around on this  Un abrazo  
Oct  20  message from Botin to Orcel
The next month  Orcel s figures changed  He told Santander that his original pay calculations had missed a few million euros that were due to him in dividends  This  according to a statement from the bank last July  would add more than 3 million euros to Santander s bill 
 It seems that we have missed a piece  
Dec  10  Message from Orcel to a Santander HR executive
 For numbers     they have gone up  
Dec  15  message from Orcel a Santander HR executive
 THE NECESSARY EMPOWERMENT 
On Dec  17  Santander s remuneration committee met 
It noted  a degree of discomfort  at the revised claim from Orcel  It noted as well the fact that UBS was not paying up as much as it said Orcel had predicted  and the  reputational risk  of failing to cap his buyout 
Board Secretary Renovales called Orcel   who by then was on a family holiday in Machu Pichu  Peru 
But Orcel said he would only discuss the matter with Ana Botin  He typed her a long message on Dec  20 
He said any buyout of less than 35 million euros would no longer make sense for him  insisting he had already suffered a significant pay cut from his UBS package  He also asserted his need to  subordinate  other executives in the bank  using the image of a cascade system  in which he would be their boss  as chairman  she would have the opportunity to redirect him  as well as the final word 
 I realize that we must motivate and empower the execs and country heads but also subordinate them to the group objectives  to a discipline of execution of our decisions and to the necessary empowerment that I need to have so we can achieve the objectives of the group and my mandate  
Dec  20  message from Orcel to Botin from Peru
In the Spanish banking world to date  the executive chairman has been the one with all the power   all the other executives defer to them  Orcel s call for  the necessary empowerment  received a curt response 
 We need to stop and see where we are at   Botin said  suggesting a meeting in Madrid 
 Andrea  We need to stop and see where we are at  To do this  we need to meet up and have a quiet and down to earth conversation  in person  Tuesday  8th January  in Madrid     
Dec  20 message from Botin to Orcel
Santander s board was uncomfortable with the money  and with UBS not budging  Ana Botin was no longer sure her new right hand man was putting enough pressure on Weber 
    On the issue of compensation  Axel is not budging  Basically 0  It is important that you continue to put pressure on your side  Regards  Ana  
Dec  20 message from Botin to Orcel
The pair met a day earlier than she first suggested  on Jan  7  in Santander s headquarters  Botin told Orcel she was withdrawing her offer  The Spanish political climate meant they couldn t meet his pay demands 
He was shocked  believing everything was still under negotiation  documents he submitted in court show  But she said there was no scope for further negotiation  because all the relevant authorities had been informed 
At this point  a source close to him said  he started recording their conversations  a practice which is legal in Spain 
On Jan  15  Santander issued a statement saying Orcel would not be joining the bank  and its CEO Alvarez would remain in post 
Orcel wrote to Renovales withdrawing his permission for Santander to use the second video  in which he had been filmed accepting Botin s decision  He said he had agreed to film the video on the understanding that he and Santander could resolve the issue in a friendly way  but as this was not possible  he considered it to have been made on a false premise and so withdrew his permission for the bank to use it   If you proceed  you do so without any agreement with all the possible consequences of the case   he wrote 
 You have destroyed my career  my reputation and have inflicted huge economic loss  
Jan  15  Orcel to Renovales
Ana Botin tried to smooth things over  She made various suggestions to Orcel  including possible financial backing to set up his own advisory boutique firm or private equity fund  or a top job in a Santander subsidiary  according to court documents 
 I promise you that there are many ways of doing this  obviously  I will presume that UBS has said no to everything  and I want to know that  but I have companies in Spain where I could appoint you CEO or President tomorrow  listed real estate companies  I mean this cannot be part of        in other words  I have many options to compensate you  in areas that you are also qualified for        
Jan  15  message from Botin to Orcel
But no agreement could be found  The bankers  last meeting was in early February  in a coffee shop in Belgravia  one of London s most affluent areas  with Orcel s wife Clara  They discussed other possible roles that Orcel could take  but he did not accept any  according to two people familiar with the events  Botin s husband  Guillermo Moren s  dropped in on them while he was jogging past 
In May  Orcel sued Santander for the job  The case is due to start being heard in April and could run well beyond a year unless the parties settle 
For its most recent corporate deal  Santander turned to UBS s arch rival   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   Santander s shares are around half the price when Botin started

105994,327509,L,World stocks on longest slide since November as Fed caution hits,news,"By Marc Jones LONDON  Reuters    Share markets were stuck on their worst run since November on Monday  as caution gripped traders in a week in which the Federal Reserve is likely to raise U S  interest rates and perhaps signal as many as three more lie in store this year  A 0 6 1 2 percent drop for Europe s main bourses  0  INDEXE  amid a flurry of gloomy company news  EU  and weaker Wall Street futures  ESc1  meant MSCI s main 47 country world stocks index  MIWD00000PUS  was down for a fifth day  The caution also came against the backdrop of global trade war worries which are set to dominated a two day G20 meeting starting later in Argentina and there were plenty of idiosyncratic factors in play too   London s FTSE  FTSE  was down almost double the rest Europe as a savage profit warning wiped more than half the value off one of its big tech firms and weak international commodity markets hit oil and gas firms and miners   L  The pound  though  was having its best day in almost two months against the euro  EURGBP   as Britain s Brexit negotiators appeared to be nearing a  transition  deal with soon to be former EU colleagues in Brussels  The euro also fell against the dollar as bond markets sent the gap between 10 year German and U S  government yields  referred to as the  transatlantic spread   out to its widest since December 2016   DE10YT RR   US10YT RR   Many analysts had been expecting that spread to be narrowing as the ECB nears the end of its stimulus program  but it hasn t proved the case  The shorter dated 2 year borrowing cost gap is near its widest level in over 20 years   DE2YT RR   US2YT RR   There has been the narrative of supposed policy convergence between the ECB and the Fed  but that is just not the reality   said Saxo Bank s head of FX strategy John Hardy  With as many as four hikes seen this year  expectations were  chomping at the max  he added   I think the euro  longs  have good reason to be nervous   he said referring to those betting on a higher euro  Weakness in equity markets was almost worldwide  Japan s Nikkei  N225  had ended down almost 1 percent as its exporters were hit by more strength in the yen which was up for a third session in the last four   The rest of Asia had struggled too  MIAPJ0000PUS   though China  CSI300  did manage to eke out some gains as Beijing announced a new economic team  It included a surprise new central bank chief but for the most part was largely as anticipated and is expected to keep the focus on halting riskier types of lending in the giant economy  FED AHEAD Wall Street look set to lose more ground when New York reopens having seen the Dow  DJI  lose 1 57 percent last week  the S P  SPX  drop 1 04 percent and the Nasdaq  IXIC  1 27 percent  Shares in social media site Facebook  O FB  were down 3 7 percent in premarket trading after reports that data of 50 million of its users were misused by a political consultancy firm ahead of the 2016 U S  elections and Brexit vote  Twitter  N TWTR  dropped 1 6 percent  while Snapchat owner Snap  N SNAP  was off 0 7 percent  For the year so far  the BAML figures last week showed  9 8 billion has gone into tech stocks  while  41 billion has flowed into emerging markets and  31 billion into Japan  Whether the cash continues to flow could depend on what the Fed decides on Wednesday  All 104 analysts polled by Reuters expected the Fed would raise rates to between 1 5 percent and 1 75 percent on Wednesday  They were less certain on whether the  dot plot  forecasts of committee members will stay at three hikes this year or shift higher  It will also be the first press conference for new Fed Chair Jerome Powell   Expected is a confident Fed Chair  both with respect to the economy s strength and the Fed s approach to policy   said analysts at Westpac in a note   Gradual and timely are the operative words for policy   Analysts at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   however  see a risk the Fed might not only add one more rate rise for this year but for 2019 as well   The worst case is the  18 and  19 dots both move up   the Fed is currently guiding to five hikes in  18 and  19 combined but under this scenario that would shift to seven hikes   they warned in a note to clients   Stocks would probably tolerate one net dot increase over  18 and  19 but a bump in both years could create problems   DOLLAR DIVIDED Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U S  dollar  yet the currency has shown scant overall correlation to interest rates in recent months   Reasons cited by dealers include concerns about the U S  budget and current account deficits  political chaos at the White House  better growth in competing countries  particularly Europe  and the risk of a U S  led trade war  Trade will be top of the agenda at a two day G20 meeting starting later on Monday in Buenos Aires and any signs of escalating stress between the U S  and China could make investors in Asia nervous  As U S  trading began  the dollar had recovered to 106 23 yen  having been as low as 105 69 overnight though it had begun to wilt against the euro which left it around 0 3 percent weaker against a basket of currencies at just below 90   DXY  The prospect of higher U S  interest rates was been a burden for non

105997,327512,L,FBI raids offices  home of Trump s personal lawyer  sources,news,"By Warren Strobel and John Walcott WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday raided the offices and home of U S  President Donald Trump s personal lawyer Michael Cohen  law enforcement sources said  in a dramatic new development in a series of probes involving close Trump associates  Cohen s lawyer  Stephen M  Ryan  said that U S  prosecutors conducted a search that was partly a referral by the Office of Special Counsel  Robert Mueller  Mueller is investigating whether members of Trump s 2016 campaign colluded with Russia during the U S  presidential election  Trump has called the probe a  witch hunt  and denied any collusion  The raid could increase legal pressure on the president  because it involves the records of his longtime attorney and indicates a second center of investigations in Manhattan  alongside Mueller s Washington based probe  Cohen has been at the center of a controversy over a  130 000 payment he has admitted making shortly before the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels  who has said that she had sex once with Trump in 2006 and was paid to keep quiet about it  Trump reacted with unusually harsh language to news of the raid   It s a disgraceful situation  It s a total witch hunt  I ve been saying it for a long time   Trump said at the opening of a meeting with military and national security advisers to discuss Syria  Asked whether he would fire Mueller  Trump said   Well  I think it s a disgrace what s going on  We ll see what happens   Trump cannot fire Mueller directly  but he could order Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  who oversees the special counsel s probe  to end it  or Trump could fire Rosenstein if he refuses  In a Tweet  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Trump against interfering   If  realDonaldTrump is thinking of using the FBI raid to fire Special Counsel Mueller or otherwise interfere with the chain of command in the Russia probe  we Democrats have one simple message for him  don t   Schumer said  Under federal regulations  if Mueller comes across information that is not directly related to his Russia focused investigation  he must confer with Rosenstein  Rosenstein could direct Mueller to either investigate the issue himself or refer it to another law enforcement authority  The raids were first reported by The New York Times  POSSIBLE BANK  TAX FRAUD   Today  the U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client  Michael Cohen  and his clients   Ryan said in a statement   I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is  in part  a referral by the Office of Special Counsel  Robert Mueller   Ryan said  Federal prosecutors are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud  and for possible campaign law violation in connection with the Stormy Daniels payment  and perhaps other matters having to do with foreign support to Trump s 2016 campaign  a second source familiar with the investigation said  The New York Times reported on Monday evening that Mueller is investigating a  150 000 payment made in September 2015 by a Ukrainian billionaire  Viktor Pinchuk  to Trump s charitable foundation in exchange for a 20 minute video appearance by Trump at a conference in Kiev  Cohen solicited the Pinchuk donation  the Times reported  citing three sources it said were briefed on the matter  although it was not immediately clear if Monday s raids sought information on that issue  Trump had declared his candidacy for president in June 2015  Cohen did not immediately respond to Reuters for a request for comment on the raids  A spokesman for Mueller had no comment  Cohen has said that he paid the  130 000 settlement money to Stormy Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  from his own pocket through a personal home equity loan  Trump  in comments to reporters on Air Force One last week  said that he did not know about the payment  According to a person familiar with the matter  FBI agents executed a search warrant at the New York offices of the law firm Squire Patton Boggs on the 23rd floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza  where Cohen has an office   The agents went there about 9 00 or 9 30 a m  and worked for several hours  the person said  A source familiar with the investigation said the raid was conducted without prior warning   Federal agents also raided a room at the Loews  NYSE L  Regency Hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where Cohen has been staying while his apartment is being renovated  The New York Times reported  citing an unnamed person   The FBI and U S  Attorney s office on Monday also sought any emails between former White House communications director Hope Hicks and Cohen about a false and misleading account that Trump helped prepare of a June 9  2016  meeting between Trump s son Donald Trump  Jr  and son in law Jared Kushner and a group of Russians who had promised  dirt  on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  the first source familiar with the investigation said  Such emails would not be covered by attorney client privilege  this source said  because Cohen did not represent Hicks  Ryan  in his statement  called the search warrants executed by the U S  Attorney s office in Manhattan  completely inappropriate and unnecessary    It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients   he said  Attorney client privilege is intended to encourage open communications between lawyers and their clients  so that lawyers can provide sound legal advice  But the privilege is not absolute  and there is an exception for communications made to further a crime   The crime fraud exception means the privilege does not apply to communications between the client and the attorney  if they are evidence of an ongoing crime or fraud  not just a past crime or fraud   said Christopher Slobogin  a professor at Vanderbilt Law School specializing in criminal procedure and evidence  A spokesman for Squire Patton Boggs said in a statement that its arrangement with Cohen is ending   The firm s arrangement with Mr  Cohen reached its conclusion  mutually and in accordance with the terms of the agreement   the statement said   We have been in contact with Federal authorities regarding their execution of a warrant relating to Mr  Cohen  These activities do not relate to the firm and we are in full cooperation   
Ryan said that Cohen has cooperated with authorities and turned over thousands of documents to congressional investigators for their own probes into Moscow s alleged efforts to influence the U S  election ",2018-04-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/fbi-raids-offices-home-of-trumps-personal-lawyer-source-1386112,1386112

the Zacks Integrated Oil industry year to date   13 2  vs   7 9    The Zacks analyst thinks Chevron is poised for further capital appreciation  riding on its healthy earnings growth prospects  America s No  2 energy company s financial results have greatly improved over the past few quarters  primarily aided by surging production and free cash flow turnaround  In fact  Chevron s free cash flow and upstream production for 2018 hit a record  The company s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting a CAGR of 3 4  through 2023 thanks to the planned expansion in the Permian Basin  Moreover  growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to deliver stable and rising dividends in the foreseeable future  Consequently  Chevron is viewed as a preferred supermajor to own now Shares of Outperform rated Merck have increased  9 7  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s gain of  2  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Merck s new products like Keytruda  Lynparza and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to the top line  Keytruda sales are gaining momentum with approval for additional indications  especially in the first line lung cancer setting  Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  recent approvals for new indications and potential additional approvals worldwide  Animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck  However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  remain concerns Walgreens Boots

their respective expectations  The Zacks analyst thinks the Retail Pharmacy USA division is witnessing comparable prescription growth and benefitting from a strong retail prescription market  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division too continues to register strong growth  On the flip side  Walgreens Boots believes that pharmacy trends  which are hurting the overall market  are likely to continue to do so over the coming months  Walgreens Boots reported poor margins in the third quarter largely due to turbulence in the UK consumer markets  low generic deflation  brand inflation and increased

106034,327549,L,Multiline Insurance Industry Near Term Prospects Bright ,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that provide a single insurance coverage bundling automobile  homeowner  long term care  life and health insurance to individuals and businesses  The insured pays just one premium and is covered for many things through a single contract These companies cover commercial and personal properties  automobiles  marine  livestock  aviation  personal accident  life  including permanent and term insurance  supplemental accident and health insurance  workers  compensation  annuity products  private mortgage insurance  among others  They also provide risk management services Multiline insurers stand to gain from disseminating the risk among different coverages Here are the three major industry themes These insurers are one of the major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment as higher rates allow them to invest the premiums at a higher rate and generate better investment income  However  the central bank may not raise rates in 2019 and even consider slashing rates against its earlier expectation of two raises due to slowing economic growth and sluggish inflation  Since higher interest rates help the industry  absence of a rate hike could weigh on investment income and reinvestment rate  Multiline insurers  profits are vulnerable to catastrophes because of the presence of property coverage in their bundle  Nonetheless  increase in premium pricing should drive revenue improvement   In the first quarter of 2019  in personal lines insurance  homeowners  automobile and personal articles saw rate increase of 2   2 5  and 1   respectively  In Commercial  most of the lines saw premium rate increase of 2   while Commercial Auto saw a 7  rate increase  In the rest of 2019  most of the commercial insurance lines should witness rate increase   However  pricing for workers compensation and international liability continue to remain weak  Increasing adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence  robotic process automation  cognitive intelligence or blockchain and cloud computing should help insurers control costs  A solid capital level continues to support growth strategies  mergers and acquisitions  and capital deployment  Also  low unemployment level  improving wages and growing GDP bode well for the industry Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright prospects in the near term  The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry  which is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  12  which places it in the top 5  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is the result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  In a year s time  the industry s EPS estimates for the current year have gone up 2 5   Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has outperformed its own sector but underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year  The stocks in this industry have collectively declined 3 4  in the past year while the Finance sector declined 4 9   The Zacks S P 500 composite has lost 1  in the said time frame One Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month price to book  P B   which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks  the industry is currently trading at 1 4X compared with the S P 500 s 3 79X and the sector s 2 47X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 1 82X  as low as 1 33X and at the median of 1 63X Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM Price to Book  P B  Ratio  TTM Bottom LineAdoption of technology  product development  prudent underwriting practices  competitive pricing and a compelling product portfolio should keep supporting business growth for multiline insurers  Also  a sturdy capital level should support effective

106045,327560,L,Airbnb may put lid on hotel rates during U S  political conventions,news,"By Laila Kearney NEW YORK  Reuters    This year s U S  Republican and Democratic conventions may prove what hotels have long feared  They could lose a consistent windfall to Airbnb and other home sharing services   Normally  hotels would be cashing in on the combined 100 000 people expected to flood Cleveland for the Republican presidential nominating convention next week and Philadelphia for the Democratic gathering July 25 28  But because of what hoteliers call  shadow inventory  from home sharing brokers  they may not be able to get the convention week markups they collected in the past  and that could foreshadow a rate shaving trend as peer to peer rentals grow   Airbnb  which expects 5 400 rentals for the two political conventions  is also helping people find lodging in Brazil in August for the Summer Olympics  the next big event to watch  Jeremy Adkison  a 28 year old delegate to the Democratic convention  said he decided to try Airbnb because he thought a hotel would cost too much  The Emporia  Kansas  resident paid  442 for a five night stay at a townhouse near the convention site   Hotel rooms are still available in Philadelphia  albeit at those higher rates Adkison sought to avoid  The Marriott Courtyard Philadelphia  for example  is advertising rooms for  989 a night  triple its normal rate   This is not out of the question for what the trade calls a  compression  period  These times of peak demand  typically associated with a nearby event  contribute 25 percent to 30 percent to hotels  annual profits  Marriott International Inc  O MAR  representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment   Airbnb is hurting the ability of  hotel  companies to collect on high priced nights   said C  Patrick Scholes  managing director of lodging and leisure equity research at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc  The impact is difficult to quantify  however  he added   Research firm TravelClick found hotel rates in Cleveland and Philadelphia had risen 20 7 percent for the 2016 convention months from a year earlier   That is solid  but well below the 34 75 percent increase in Tampa  Florida  and Charlotte  North Carolina  during the 2012 convention months  according to CBRE Hotels  another research firm   Furthermore  the convention bump had been intensifying until this year  In 2008  hotel rates rose by a combined 23 25 percent in host cities St  Paul  Minnesota  and Denver in 2008 and by 15 75 percent in lodging rich New York City and Boston in 2004  CBRE said  To be sure  hotel companies are reporting brisk convention business for 2016  The Loews  NYSE L  Philadelphia Hotel is 100 percent booked  spokeswoman Jaimi Blackburn said  adding that most others in the city and immediate area are as well   Philadelphia and Ohio industry associations said both political parties negotiated rates early for many of their delegates  so the hotels were not getting maximum prices for those rooms  COMPRESSION SQUEEZE  Airbnb has always been linked to big events  The company s founders came up with the home sharing idea after a 2007 design conference in San Francisco led to full occupancy of all hotels there  and Airbnb introduced its platform in 2008 for the Democratic National Convention in Denver  The sector  which also includes smaller companies HomeAway and FlipKey  has been growing rapidly  Roughly 10 percent of business travelers will use one of those services in 2016  up from 8 percent in 2015  consultancy Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco estimated   Last summer alone  Airbnb housed 17 million guests worldwide  up from 47 000 five years earlier   In the past  though  these services have not meaningfully affected compression periods  when hotels can charge premiums averaging 26 percent  according to  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  researchers   That may have changed   with the number of nights qualifying as compression down 24 percent in the first five months of 2016 from a year earlier  the analysts said   UBS Group AG said the decline in compression nights  in part due to Airbnb  could reduce hotels  revenue growth rates by almost a third in 2016   Of course factors besides the Airbnb impact are at play  New hotels are being built  and a slower global economy is likely to hit the companies  ability to profit from compression periods  said Jan Freitag  senior vice president at industry data provider STR Global  Analysts soon will be looking beyond the U S  political conventions to the next big test of hotels  ability to capitalize on a big event  the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  where Airbnb is an official accommodation provider  Airbnb said 30 000 people had used its service to find places to stay during the Games  while there are fewer than 60 000 hotel rooms in Rio  Fear of the Zika virus or global economic weakness could keep travelers away from the Olympics  but the Airbnb effect is  a valid potential overhang  for hotels  said S P Global Market Intelligence analyst Tuna Amobi    There is a lot more supply of alternative accommodation   Amobi said   which arguably wasn t the case in the last Summer Olympics

106145,327660,L,Opening Bell  Stock Selloff Eases  Falling USD Pushes Oil Above  60,opinion,"Worst weekly equity decline in 2 years
Triggered by wages indicating inflation will rise
Bond selloff ensues
Selloff pushes yields higher  causing a stock selloff
Bond stock selloff creates volatility  low vol  funds liquidate exacerbating selloff
Equity selloff eases as trading week closes
Declining dollar supports commodities and oil
Key Events
Last week  heightened concerns over a faster pace of policy tightening from the Fed gave US equity bulls their worst week in two years  with all major stock indices taking a beating 
The S P 500 fell 5 16 percent  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 8 3 percent  The NASDAQ Composite underperformed  falling the hardest  down 8 4 percent  The Russell 2000   which has been proving to be a contrarian index  positively and negatively   outperformed  falling the least  4 6 percent 
The selloff was triggered by a single component of the the January employment report  released February 2  which showed average hourly earnings to have increased 2 9 percent  the fastest jump since 2009  Wage growth is a leading indicator for inflation growth  as companies raise the cost of their goods and services to cover their own rising costs for employee wages 
The realization that inflation was about to rise had bond investors spurning the current  2 65 percent yield  since higher interest rates would naturally push yields ups  Furthermore  the very outlook for higher rates already pushed yields almost 25 basis points from 2 65 percent to 2 9 percent  ironically  the same as the wage growth   earlier  in a little over two weeks 
As a rule  higher yields spur capital diversion from stocks to bonds  When stocks are at nose bleed  record high levels  investors are all too happy to find a less risky alternative that would let them sleep more soundly at night  That s why this particular yield jump follows a period of unprecedented low yields based on near zero interest rates  for which traditional bond investors were forced to seek a meaningful yield elsewhere 

Luckily  over the past few years the stock market provided an unprecedented low volatility environment  allowing traditional yield seeking investors to buy into dividend stocks  Since these investors are long term asset holders  the record high stock levels didn t scare them  They d wait out any crash 
They were just interested in the dividends  The fact that the S P 500 rose nearly 37 percent since 10 year Treasury yields reached their 1 4 percent record low in early July 2016 till the SPX s 2 8782 87 record  both high and close  with bears nowhere to be seen  only highlighting the complete shock of the reversal  on January 26  before the selloff  was the fat cherry on top 

The sudden jump in yield provided an upside breakout of the 2 6 percent level  Here is an example of intermarket support resistance principles  The bond oversupply pushed yield through a resistance  while  a resistance is normally supply  in the bond price yield inverse relationship  a resistance is a demand for the bond  which lowers the yield   The broken resistance reversed momentum from bullish to bearish on bonds  since the outlook for higher interest rates renders current yields relatively lower   which rotated funds out of stocks and into shorter maturity bonds  so that they d be able to buy the higher yielding bonds sooner 

The bond oversupply pushed yields through a resistance of demand  for bonds  within the bond price yield inverse relationship   rerouting all the traditional bond investors who may have never quite grown comfortable investing in stocks  The volatility of the sudden fund outflow from equities riled institutions invested in low volatility funds  forcing a rapid liquidation 
The race to unwind positions based on a low volatility environment created more supply than demand  forcing institutions to sell at lower prices  The rapid price plunge   especially from record levels   naturally scared retail investors into dumping their stocks  pushing prices that much lower 
Global Financial Affairs

This morning  investors in Asian and European markets enjoyed a reprieve from the worst weekly selloff since 2011  Chinese shares listed on the mainland s Shanghai Composite  having fallen 9 5 percent during the past week  along with shares listed on the Shenzhen Composite  which lost 8 4 percent last week  together with shares listed on Hong Kong s Hang Seng  which declined 9 5 percent during last week s selloff  today all provided buyers with the deepest dips  However  while mainland shares enjoy a rebound  Hong Kong shares extend their decline  testing last week s lows

This morning  s rally in Asia took place amid attempts to thaw the tensions on the Korean Peninsula  Vice President Mike Pence  the Washington Post the U S  is ready to engage in talks about North Korea s nuclear program  signaling a shift in policy  The comments came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his sister as an emissary to invite South Korea s president for talks in Pyongyang  as the Winter Olympic Games got underway  The won outperformed Asian currencies 

The Dollar Index met with resistance at the 90 50 level  where there was a congestion in mid to late January  as well as by a downtrend line since December 18 

The dollar s decline supported commodities  with metals higher and crude oil halting a six day slide  Note  while the November December congestion resistance turned to support  the price fell below its uptrend line since September  opening the potential for a further fall toward the downtrend line since June 

While Bitcoin is said to have   it s still very much within a downtrend  Nevertheless  it s surprising that specifically during a time of market turmoil  the most volatile asset has become a  bastion of stability   Currently  the rebound from  6 000 is struggling over its current February 10   9 074 3 resistance  compounded by a downtrend line since January 6  A successful breakthrough would test the  10 000 round psychological number  whose resistance is reinforced by the January 16 31 supported  now presumed resistance

106179,327694,L,Should Value Investors Consider Loews Corporation  L  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Loews Corporation   NYSE L   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Loews Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Loews Corporation s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 16 9  over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Also  we should point out that Loews Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 1  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future     P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Loews Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Loews Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes L a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 8  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 11 5  Clearly  L is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Loews Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives L a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has climbed 25   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Loews Corporation Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Loews Corporation is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineLoews Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 38  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first   When it does  this stock could be a compelling value pick Wall Street s Next

106180,327695,L,MTG Or RDN  Which Stock Is Stronger For Mortgage Insurance ,opinion,An improving US economy is helping all the industries to gradually return to growth trajectory  Notable decline in unemployment  easing of the U S  dollar  momentum in oil prices  increase in spending and an improving GDP buoy optimism among investors Fed officials expect unemployment to decline to 3 9  in 2018  GDP is predicted to grow at 2 5   reflecting an increase from 2 1   projected earlier  Inflation rate is estimated at 1 9  in 2018  Also  President Donald Trump s tax reform policy  an overhaul to tax code after 31 years  lowers the corporate tax burden Good news is that the mortgage insurance  which also was hit hard by the financial crisis in 2008 like others  is gradually getting into shape  A steady improvement in the housing market fundamentals and an improving employment scenario are poised for long term growth Per the Mortgage Bankers Association  mortgage applications inched up 0 7  in the last week of December compared with the 4 9  decline in the third week  Also  refinance improved 1 4   though applications to purchase slipped only 0 1  The mortgage insurers have been witnessing lower new delinquencies and declining claims payments  On the other hand  new insurance written have been increasing steadily  With strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured  we expect the companies to see fewer claims than before  The mortgage insurers have also been following stringent underwriting standards to ensure profitability However  the mortgage insurance market is highly competitive with a few players capturing a large market share  Along with private players  the company also faces stiff competition from Federal Housing Administration  which slashed its annual premium to make loans more affordable Mortgage insurers are part of the  industry  ranked at  102  lies in the upper half of the  for 265 plus industries   In fact it climbed the ladder from Rank  183  which falls in the lower half of the Zacks Industry Rank  a week earlier   The Multiline Insurance industry gained 8 5  in a year Here we focus on two mortgage insurers  Radian Group Inc    NYSE RDN   and MGIC Investment Corporation   NYSE MTG    Radian Group is a credit enhancement company  supporting homebuyers  mortgage lenders  loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk management products and services  While MGIC Investment provides primary insurance to cushion lenders against non payment of individual loans and expands home ownership opportunities by enabling people to purchase homes with slimmer down payments  Also  Radian Group has a market capitalization of  4 5 billion while MGIC Investment has  5 3 billion of the same It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals  Some better ranked stocks from the industry are Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   and Loews Corporation  NYSE L    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Zacks RankBoth MGIC Investment and Radian Group sport a Zacks Rank  1  Thus both fare equally Price PerformanceBoth MGIC Investment and Radian Group have outperformed the industry in a year  While shares of Radian Group have rallied 14 6   that of MGIC Investment has surged 36 3   Here  MGIC Investment performs better than Radian Group ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing mortgage insurers  Compared with the industry s P B ratio of 1 44  both Radian Group and MGIC Investment are overpriced  Yet with a trailing 12 month P B multiple of 1 50  Radian Group is relatively cheaper than MGIC Investment s trailing 12 month P B multiple of 1 69  This round clearly goes to Radian Group VGM ScoreWhile Radian Group carries a  of B  MGIC Investment has a VGM Score of C  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors  This round undoubtedly goes to Radian Group again Debt to EquityBoth MGIC Investment and Radian Group have lower debt to equity ratio compared with the industry average of 45 9  MGIC Investment with a leverage ratio of 26 5 has an edge over Radian Group with the same of 34 4 Return on EquityReturn on equity for MGIC Investment is 16 4  and Radian Group is 13   both outperforming the industry average of 7   Comparatively  MGIC Investment has an edge over Radian Group here Risk to Capital RatioMGIC Investment s risk to capital ratio was 10 1 1 as of Sep 30  2017 while that of Radian Group was 13 4 1  MGIC Investment wins this round hands down Earnings Surprise HistoryPer the companies  surprise history  MGIC Investment has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 27 11   Whereas  Radian Group has delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average four quarter beat of 4 52  Hence  MGIC Investment scores over Radian Group in this context Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsMGIC Investment s 2018 estimates have been raised 5 9  in the last 60 days   While Radian Group stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved 5 2  north over the same time frame For MGIC Investment  the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at  1 26 for 2018  representing year over year growth of 3 9   The stock has long term expected earnings per share growth of 8 5  For Radian Group  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at  2 03 for 2018  reflecting a year over year increase of 15 4   The stock has long term expected earnings per share growth of 5  This round therefore goes to MGIC Investment right away  To ConcludeMGIC Investment holds an edge over Radian Group on the basis of rank  growth projections  surprise history  return on equity  risk to capital ratio and leverage  Considering parameters of valuation and VGM Score  Radian Group seems better poised than MGIC Investment  However  based on our comparative analysis  MGIC Investment presently has an advantage over Radian Group Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock

106207,327722,L,Insurance Stocks Q2 Earnings Slated For Jul 31  CNA  L   MCY,opinion,The second quarter earnings season is well underway with 34 2  members of the elite S P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far  Per the latest   the performance of 171 index members  accounting for 44 1  of the index s total market capitalization   having already reported their financial numbers this quarter  indicates that total earnings have increased 8 8  on 3 4  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 78 9  companies surpassing the bottom line expectations and 70 8   outperforming on the top line front The Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has delivered a strong performance so far  About 43 2  of the S P 500 index members  that have reported quarterly results  shows 7 7  earnings growth on 5 2  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The beat ratio of 82 9  for the bottom line and 70 7  for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S P 500   The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses  which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers  Per Aon Benfield  the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc   NYSE AON    the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is  53 billion in the first half of 2017  Few insurers are expected to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter  stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events  occurred during April and May in the U S Nonetheless  prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion  built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment  Net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  has witnessed improvement  albeit far lower than the historical highs  The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates  reflecting their confidence in the developing economic conditions  The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters  A better rate environment not only increased Net investment income but has also improved investment yields Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates  Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates  However  life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest sensitive product lines Notably  an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment  This in turn might have supported more policy writings  thus driving the premiums higher to contribute a lion s share in an insurers  top line  This apart  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have possibly benefited the insurers On the flip side  we do not expect pricings to have been strong  To write new business and retain renewals  insurers have been easing out pricing pressure  Commercial property  workers  compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing Let s evaluate the performance of the following three insurers ahead of their release of quarterly numbers on Jul 31 CNA Financial Corporation   NYSE CNA   offers commercial P C insurance products  mainly across the United States  Last quarter  CNA Financial substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 13   The company s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an of  4 00  make us confident of an earnings beat this time  The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 78 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 75 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3 for an earnings beat  You can see  CNA Financial is likely to report bottom line growth in the second quarter on the back of better performance across its Specialty  International as well as Life   Group Non Core segments  Rising interest rate environment likely have favored higher net investment income  Disciplined approach toward the market is expected to have resulted in an improvement in new business  However  higher expenses might have hurt the company s overall profitability    Read    With respect to the surprise trend  CNA Financial beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 12 45  CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Loews Corporation   NYSE L   provides commercial property and casualty insurance in the United States  Canada  the United Kingdom  Continental Europe and Singapore  Last reported quarter  Loews significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 31 82   The company with a Zacks Rank  4 and an Earnings ESP of  5 26  make surprise prediction difficult  The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 72 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 76 cents per share We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5   going into an earnings announcement Ongoing challenging conditions in the offshore drilling market might have induced lower revenues at its Diamond Offshore   NYSE DO    Due to challenging market conditions  thereby resulting in lower rates and a decreased insured exposure likely have hurt underwriting results  Loews Corp  has likely witnessed a solid performance at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners   NYSE BWP   and Loews Hotels units in the second quarter  Additionally  the company s subsidiary  CNA Financial s improved results have in turn likely boosted its overall second quarter performance     Read   With respect to the surprise trend  Loews surpassed expectations in

106261,327776,L,Insurers In Q3 Suffer Less Damages  6 Stocks Set To Beat,opinion,"The third quarter earnings releases are being churned out at full throttle  with 198 members of the elite S P 500 Index having reported already as per our latest  article  Let s see how the quarter is turning up for the life and non life or property and casualty  P C  insurance space 
Peek Into Q3  Drivers   Dampeners

The P C insurance industry s profitability declined in the first half of 2016 from the prior year period due to higher incurred loss from a number of catastrophes that ravaged the industry 
The situation was much better in the third quarter when hurricane Mathew was the only significant catastrophe causing loss of life and property  We therefore expect to see a decline in incurred loss in the third quarter which will help the bottom line 

Also  the players in the industry stand strong with respect to their capital position  According to a report issued by ISO and Property Casualty Insurers  PCI  Association of America es  despite paying out  14 5 billion in natural disaster caused claims in the first half of 2016  cumulative policyholders  surplus for the U S  P C insurance industry was  680 6 billion  a record high  as of Jun 30  2016  The capital strength was intact in the third quarter  given that there was no meaningful claims payment on account of catastrophes 

Players have thus been utilizing the excess capital to buy back shares  Significant share buyback will in turn drive up the bottom line 

Another recent activity witnessed in the industry was a rise in the frequency and severity of auto claims  According to Insurance Information Institute  over the past two years  U S  auto insurance companies saw private passenger loss costs rise sharply as insurers received more and costlier claims  There has been an alarming increase in crashes and claims reported  This  combined with the cost of the claims themselves  has led to a dramatic rise in the overall loss cost  Though the affected players will seek an increase in auto insurance rates as a remedial action to restore profitability in this line of business  it will take time for the loss to reverse to profitability 

Another factor affecting the industry s profitability is the interest rate environment which is still low  The Federal Reserve refrained from raising the rate till it gains further confidence in economic strength  The rate was last hiked in the Dec 2015 meeting to only 0 25 0 50   Since then  the rates have been left untouched 

Therefore  investment income  which forms a major component of insurers  revenues  remains under pressure  But a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes bring some respite 
Nevertheless  even this little increase was a silver lining for life insurers who suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to sustained low rate  To cope with this low rate era  life insurers have lowered their interest sensitive product lines 

However  a low rate is not all bad news for insurers  These players generally hold a considerable amount in bonds  which would see a decline in value if rates rise  
All in all  the industry presents a strong investment opportunity  Let s take a look at the following stocks that are poised to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming reports  
Way to Pick the Right Insurance Stocks

Revenues from parking and lending   PAL   services and from firm transportation contracts also increased  But overall revenue growth was minimal due to the offsetting effects of lower natural gas prices on fuel retained in kind  as payment for transportation services  and of lower interruptible transportation service revenues due to a decrease in basis spreads between locations on the pipelines  See  for a brief description of what are firm and interruptible transportation services  and of PAL  Despite  21 4 million of expenses incurred by HP Storage and asset impairment charges  operating expenses in the TTM ended 9 30 12 were lower than the prior year period  The primary drivers of the decrease were lower fuel costs  due to lower natural gas prices  and lower administrative and general costs  In addition  the favorable comparison to the prior year is significantly aided by larger than normal expenses in 2011  due  for example  to materials   supply impairment charges and charges related to a fire at a compressor station   BWP s definition of Distributable Cash Flow   DCF   and a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships   MLPs   are described in a   Using that definition  DCF for the TTM period ending 9 30 12 was  483 million   2 62 per unit   up from  387 million in the comparable prior year period   2 26 per unit   As always  I first attempt to assess how these DCF figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review TTM numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to BWP results through 3Q 2012 generates the comparison outlined in Table 2 below  Table 2  Figures in   Millions Under BWP s definition  reported DCF always excludes working capital changes  whether positive or negative  In contrast  as detailed in my prior articles  I generally do not include working capital generated in the definition of sustainable DCF but I do deduct working capital invested  this accounts for  19 million and  50 million of the variance between reported and sustainable DCF in the TTM ended 9 30 12 and 9 30 11  respectively   Despite appearing to be inconsistent  this makes sense because in order to meet my definition of sustainability the master limited partnerships should  on the one hand  generate enough capital to cover normal working capital needs  On the other hand  cash generated from working capital is not a sustainable source and I therefore ignore it  Over reasonably lengthy measurement periods  working capital generated tends to be offset by needs to invest in working capital  I therefore do not add working capital consumed to net cash provided by operating activities in deriving sustainable DCF  Similarly  I also do not add back into DCF items I do not regard as sustainable  such as proceeds from asset sales  The principal components of  other   which I exclude from the sustainable category  are non cash interest expense and proceeds from an insurance settlement  Coverage ratios for 3Q 2012 are indicated in Table3 below   Even though distributions are not growing  coverage ratios are thin  Making them more robust will be challenging given that over 32 million units have been issued in three separate equity offerings so far in 2012 and that the number of units outstanding now exceeds 207 million  up  12  from  185 million at the beginning of the year  The simplified cash flow statement in Table 4 below nets certain items  e g   debt incurred vs  repaid   separates cash generation from cash consumption  and gives a clear picture of how distributions have been funded in the last two years   Net cash from operations less maintenance capital expenditures did not cover distributions in both TTM periods  the shortfall decreased to  14 million in the TTM ending 9 30 12 from  55 million in the prior year period   Table 3 therefore shows that distributions in both TTM periods were partially financed by issuing equity  Note that    282 million of the  838 million of equity issuance in the TTM ended 9 30 12 is an adjustment to partners  capital  In February 2012  The Boardwalk HP Storage Company drop down acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control  Therefore  the assets and liabilities of Boardwalk HP Storage were recognized at their carrying amounts at the date of transfer and  281 8 million  the carrying amount of the net assets acquired  was treated as an adjustment to partners  capital  In February 2012  BWP issued 9 2 million units at  27 55 per unit  receiving net cash proceeds of   250 2 million  In an  dated 6 4 12  I said I would not be surprised to see additional partnership units being issued later this year  Indeed  in August BWP issued 11 6 million units at  27 80 per unit generating net proceeds of   318 million  and in October 2012 it issued 11 2 million units at  26 99 per unit generating net proceeds of   298 million  The most recent equity issuance was in connection with a major transaction that occurred subsequent to the end of the third quarter  In October 2012  BWP took a major step in implementing its strategy to diversify from its core business  natural gas pipelines and storage  into the midstream energy businesses by acquiring PL Midstream LLC  now renamed Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream  from PL Logistics LLC for  625 million in cash  Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream provides  53 5 million barrels of salt dome storage capacity  240 miles of pipeline transportation  fractionation and brine supply services for producers and consumers of petrochemicals  natural gas liquids and natural gas  BWP intends to spend an additional  75 million on expansion projects related to this acquisition  BWP s major organic growth project is the Southeast Market Expansion  This   300 million project involves constructing an interconnection between BWP s Gulf South Pipeline Company  LP  Gulf South  and Boardwalk HP Storage  adding additional compression facilities and constructing approximately 70 miles of 24  and 30  pipeline in southeastern Mississippi  It is expected to be placed in service in 4Q 2014 and is fully contracted with a weighted average contract life of  10 years  BWP is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of no more than 5 1  Excluding the  100 million of affiliated debt  BWP s total long term debt stood at  3 2 billion as of 9 30 12  a multiple of 4 52x EBITDA for the TTM ending 9 30 12  This is an improvement over the 5x ratio in 2Q12 and  5 5x in 1Q12  There is room for additional debt to finance the remaining   116 million of growth capital expenditures planned for 2012    84 million has been spent through 9 30 12   BWP s current yield compares favorably with many of the other MLPs I follow  as seen in Table 5 below  However  there has been minimal distribution growth over the TTM ending 9 30 12  Given uncertainty regarding customer contract renewals and its assessment of current market conditions  management decided it would not be prudent to increase distributions  I believe this is a sound decision  But even at their current level  distributions are being funded  in part  by issuing equity  Adding the thin coverage ratio and relatively high leverage to this concern  I still conclude that investors willing to add to their positions should consider other MLPs ,2012-12-05,Ron Hiram,https://www.investing.com/analysis/boardwalk-pipeline-partners’-distributable-cash-flow-146312,146312
106334,327849,L,Are You Part Of The Dumb Money ,opinion,Are you part of the  dumb money   Here is a   Amateur vs  smart money What the experts are seeing is that retail investors are slamming money into mutual funds  which then buy stocks  of course  but then there are signs that the smarties   institutional investors   are getting more cautious and looking to increase cash holdings  That said  the outflows to cash are not all that big right now but it has to be said this dumb  or amateur money  in versus smart money out trend happened last year ahead of a stock sell off in April  And those bad times for stocks lasted until October  CNBC says corporate insiders are also heading out of shares  Jeff Cox pointed out that    They ve dumped  4 2 billion in stock this month  about double January s level and   here s that warning sign again   the most since   last year s rally fizzled  according to TrimTabs   And here is more from Jeff Cox of CNBC via the online transcript with errors included  You can figure it out  And check the link for Bob Pisani s rebuttal   video      L ook at the money coming into the market now  it s late money  the big selling point for this real has been this fun flows metric  i did szott some tracing back  i went back to 2007  in fact  2008 was the only year  the only january that we have not seen a big in flow into funds so you can t tell a whole lot about that  you look at what the insiders are doing  that s what i m doing right now  the corporations have stopped buying  the unsiders are selling  so this is telling you that this rally is getting very tired  and i do believe this dash for trash that i call it  the big stocks  the big metrix doing well  stocks with a lot of short interest and zero dividend payers  they have led the rally  sorry to use the word dumb money but it doesn t look smart to me right now  a dumb idea to put money to work in this market  the corporate insiders  they are sellers  The two statements from Cox are quite similar  The only change is that the second does not refer to institutional investors but to corporations  That would be easy to miss  Now think about this   The market changes  but the Jeff Cox story does not  He seems to be a designated hitter for a bearish viewpoint  The first statement was from February of 2012  one year and almost eleven percent ago  Cox s story has changed in one respect  The new statement does not cite the big money investors  because their attitude is much more bullish  He is not calling them  dumb money   CNBC s own Davos series and the Barron s roundtable have highlighted that many big name  high profile investors see great upside for stocks  One example  also from CNBC  is  who provides the logic for Dow 30K  In a further explanation of his investment philosophy  Baron said   Over the long term  I think the stock market is going to grow 7 percent a year   about the same rate as the overall economy  not adjusting for inflation  He said that this has been the norm for generations and he doesn t see that changing   So people are saying     Dow  14 000  is it too late   It s not too late  14 000  I m thinking in 10 years  it s going to be 30 000  In 20 years  it s going to be 50 000 or 60 000   It makes the OldProf feel like a piker  Back in May of 2010  when the Dow was at 10 000 and there were predictions of 5000  I   Someone needs to say this  Dow 20K  The fear mongers abound in the financial media  TV and online ratings seem to go to those helping to peddle fear and sell gold or structured annuities  with high commissions attached   Every individual investor I meet is scared silly  They do not realize what is at stake  For the mainstream media  it is all about ratings  They have all learned that fear sells  Attacking Obama  attacking Bernanke  attacking European leaders  explaining government policy as if it were the family budget     it all works  The big time media have garnered page views and sold papers  Even when they attempt to show  balance  they have someone warning about and the  bull  saying that stocks will go up 8  this year  Is it any surprise that watchers are scared witless  Investors need to understand that they are missing more than an 8  move  Stocks will double  When will they get on board  Do they have a plan  I hope that everyone has noticed how the words from nearly three years ago still resound today  The same peddlers of fear and gold  The same Obama Bernanke family budget stuff  Those who stayed on the sidelines have missed the first 40   Some assert that the market is now  giddy  and stocks are  toppy   Just think about that reasoning  A rising market makes new highs  If you are going to define every new high as  toppy  you will never buy stocks  As I asked three years ago   What is the plan   Objective Analysis  The best way to invest is through data driven  objective measures  When I analyze a stock  I look at the future expected earnings and cash flow  adjusted for business circumstances and risk  I look at the business cycle  I do the same thing for the overall market   as a background for specific investments  Since everyone is citing the prior Dow 14 000 as the key point  I don t agree about the significance  but let us join the discussion  let us compare the 2007 decline from that point to the current rally  data from Friday  Sources  Thomson Reuters  St  Louis Fed  ECRI Analysis by NewArc Investments  Inc  Even a cursory examination of the data shows that the market is much  much more attractive than it was in 2007   even though that story had but one flaw  Earnings expectations are much better  You are invited to look at my  of this type  where I explain why this method is better than the alternatives  The interest rate alternative investment is pretty lame  Those whose methods ignore the asset allocation alternatives as a method are now screaming that it is all unfair  The financial risk is very low  the objective indicator for Europe  Any investor following this indicator would have known to ignore the headline risk about Europe  And most importantly   the recession odds  This was the key problem in 2007  Bob Dieli s indicator had all of his clients on warning   I wish I had been one of them   The current story is much different  Investment Conclusion  Individual investors are fearful at the bottom  slow to spot new trends  and called stupid whenever they climb aboard  There is no objective plan for market timing  and they have all been told that  buy and hold  is wrong  This is why I recommend the following  Use data to adjust your viewpoint   not just absolute price Actively manage your portfolio  looking for the best stocks and themes Revise price targets regularly Ignore those who have been completely wrong  and who now call successful investors  dumb money  ,2013-02-06,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-part-of-the-dumb-money-154068,154068
106338,327853,L,Re Introducing Comstock Mining,opinion,"Comstock Mining  NYSE LODE  has accumulated an unprecedented  ten square mile land position  consolidating an historic  world class gold and silver district  We rezoned the property  identified millions of NI 43 101 compliant ounces of gold and silver  permitted and built facilities with substantial capacity  and placed our first low cost mine into production  We are drilling in our Lucerne and Dayton Resource Areas with the objective of developing two new mines in Nevada and generating strong cash flow growth in one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world 
News of the Company s rejuvenated capital structure was a hit  sending the stock up 58  on 15x average daily trading volume  Why is this transaction so important 
This is truly a watershed moment  opening the new Comstock Mining to a greater universe of investors  Our new capital structure eliminated all preferred stock  making it much cleaner and simpler  We now have common shares  cash and a modest amount of debt  We continue to enjoy a very high quality institutional shareholder base and have strengthened our Board s independence 
Notwithstanding the above  Comstock Mining is perceived to be as a Company ALWAYS spending money  rarely cash flow positive  even when gold prices were higher  Can you please comment 
I appreciate that that perception is out there  The reality is that we consolidated a massive land position  100  owned or controlled   with little to no future royalties  rezoned it  successfully traversed significant environmental  social and operational obstacles  and sustainably re positioned potentially one of the most prolific mining districts in the world back into operation  This was accomplished with a relatively small amount of capital considering the land we purchased  and the considerable logistical issues addressed  Now  we are positioned to commence development of two new mines  We hope to demonstrate solid growth in cash flow in one of the largest  high grade properties in Nevada 
With less required explaining of the prior capital structure  and diminished funding concerns  what will you do with all of your free time 
We remain highly focused on drilling high grade targets in Lucerne  We have positioned the mine to drill two high grade targets and develop a drift and tunnel  We believe these two targets present the most immediate opportunity for stakeholders  We commenced an 800 foot drift development  We are targeting high grade gold and silver structures with grades averaging 8x 10x that of what we ve been mining  All of our painstaking work readies us to drill these targets with the objective of establishing a long lived  profitable mining enterprise  The first phase of tunnel development began on September 5  2015  and will continue for the next three months 
We are also drilling our Dayton area  a second deposit that we hope to be able to commence permitting on in 2016  Dayton is roughly a mile south of Lucerne 
Please comment on cost containment  Has there been a meaningful move in any parts of you cost profile 
These days  containing costs is synonymous with survival  We have dramatically streamlined and reduced mining  support and administrative costs  We have recently developed new partnerships with American Mining and Tunneling Inc  and American Drilling  moving a larger component of our cost structure from fixed to variable  This added flexibility should allow Comstock to continue delivering lower costs from existing infrastructure 
Can you comment on Mr  Winfield s willingness to enter into this broad restructuring  Why now  Who are your pro forma largest shareholders 
Mr  Winfield remains our largest  and most supportive shareholder  These changes are a tremendous vote of confidence by him  and other shareholders  in our operating model and goals moving forward  The timing was right from every perspective  We ve built the right team  grown our land position and proven the operating model and key economic variables  such as grade  metallurgy  strip ratios and costs   We are proud to include Century Asset Management  U S  Global Investors  Sun Valley Master Gold Funds  Gabelli Asset Management  Loews Corporation  NYSE L   Solus Asset Management  and of course  the Winfield Group  in our top ten list of shareholders  They all supported the restructuring 
Do you believe that existing and new institutional shareholders will take another look at Comstock Mining after the revision of the capital structure 
Great question  It s already happening and I m confident that will prove to be one of the most significant results of cleaning up our capital structure  It s important to reiterate that we didn t just eliminate the preferred stock and dividends  but permanently dispensed with tens of millions of dollars of future obligations and royalties  We have already spoken with dozens of funds that are more interested in investing  calling us for meetings  I m dedicated to responding and proudly explaining the new Comstock Mining in coming months 
In speaking with contacts and analysts  some believe that Comstock s growth profile is limited  perhaps due to city boundaries 
The perception that we are limited is a dated one  Our contiguous land position is massive and last October we received unanimous approval from local regulators to expand our permit boundaries by almost tenfold  Our progress is only constrained by the rate at which we can develop these higher grade targets  I should add we have drilled on less than 1 mile of our 6 mile strike  and if one considers depth  we ve probably drilled on less than 2  3  
Presumably  you believe that being in production is a world apart from   in production soon   Please comment on possible lessons learned 
Production is MORE than a world apart from a stage of   advanced development  or  in production soon   Lead times for obtaining permits  funding and building infrastructure are measured in years not months  There s also a huge difference between commencing production and working out the slew of unexpected issues resulting in a ramp up period much longer than management and investors expect  We have three years of continuously improving production  We continue to improve but with the majority of our growing pains behind us  We are pouring gold and silver every week  while maintaining a low cost profile  despite operating at a small percentage of our capacity 
More importantly  our Lucerne resource area is fully permitted  This achievement is invaluable as we transition to drilling multiple  higher grade targets with the objective over time of developing long lived mines  Our flexibility and experience should allow for faster exploration and permitting  possibly culminating in a faster development cycle  This knowledge will be incredibly useful as we start planning activities in the Dayton and Spring Valley drill targets 
Lessons learned  It is critically important to focus on one development at a time  prudently dedicating resources through completion of each objective  For example  ensuring the lowest possible operating costs at Lucerne and maintaining a strong balance sheet  As we see other Nevada mines failing  it appears that they have taken shortcuts  under appreciated ongoing risks and contingencies  while working with inflexible project schedules  No surprise  but attacking low grade opportunities with higher costs  bloated overhead  excessive debt or multi tasking projects doesn t work well with gold at  1 100 oz 
Is Comstock a Takeout Candidate 
We believe we have built a platform for Nevada based growth  We have the management  district and network to lead that growth  both organically and through Nevada based acquisitions  We are attractive to investors and I m sure once they understand what has been built  land owned  obstacles cleared  absence of royalties and most importantly  the extent of the known geology  As suitors better understand our known and blue sky potential  we expect they will certainly take notice  Some already have 
Why invest in Comstock now instead off waiting for a higher price of gold and silver 
There are a small number of junior  mid tier and major producers demonstrating low cash costs  critical in a downturn   Low capital and all in sustaining costs  critical longer term  and clean balance sheets  These will be the winners  representing companies that investors should consider investing in  Waiting means possibly paying more as many risks have been mitigated  For those of us emerging safely through this downturn  there will be far fewer names to choose from  Comstock Mining will certainly be one of them  
I believe our position among surviving Nevada based companies will continue to improve as we execute on our underground portal in the Lucerne mine and develop Dayton  our 2nd target  We will be drilling and hopefully developing even higher grade targets  The winners are those of us that have continued advancing  slashed costs and increased operating flexibility 
Some believe that Comstock has too much corporate overhead  perhaps too many senior people  Please comment 
Yes  we ve been asked about that  Our system was designed to handle complexities beyond the norm  With hindsight  our challenges have become one of our strongest assets  We streamlined core competencies in areas where we ve achieved reliability  Our corporate costs have come down in line with peer Nevada based miners  better enabling us to while achieve our growth goals 
What are 3 key takeaways that you believe make an investment in the new Comstock Mining a good bet 
Nevada based  massive consolidated land holdings  permitted for gold and silver and continuous exploration and development 
Existing infrastructure delivering a low and flexible operating cost  enabling success even in low gold and silver price scenarios and positioned to thrive at higher prices 
Vast exploration potential on six miles of contiguous  mineralized strike in one of the historically highest grade  world class mining districts

106370,327885,L,Comparison Of Prudential Financial  Loews  And MetLife ,opinion,In our previous post we compared share price models for two financial companies from the S P 500 list  Franklin Resources  NYSE  BEN  and Apartment Investment and Management Company  NYSE AIV  There was a sound reason behind this direct comparison   both companies has similar models  i e  are defined by the same consumer price indices  Here we extend our analysis by a triplet  Prudential Financial  NYSE  PRU   Loews corporation  NYSE  L  and MetLife  NYSE  MET   All three companies are driven by the change in the index of food and beverages  F  and the index of transportation services  TS  Several days ago we presented a model for Prudential on the Seeking Alfa  Therefore  this post is mainly devoted to L and MET  Why do we rely on consumer price indices in our modeling  Many SA readers have reasonable doubts that some consumer price  which is not directly related to goods and services produced by a given company  may affect its price We allow the economy to be a more complex system than described by a number of simple linear relations between share prices and goods  The connection between a firm and its products may be better expressed by goods and services which the company does not produce or provide  The demand supply balance is fragile and may evolve along many nonlinear paths  It would be too simplistic to directly define a company price by its products  So  the intuition behind our pricing model is more insightful   we link a given share to some goods and services  and thus their consumer price indices   which we have to find among various CPIs  In order to provide a dynamic reference we also introduce in the model some relative and independent level of prices  also expressed by CPIs   Hence  one needs two different CPIs to define a share price model  These CPIs we select from a predetermined set of 92 CPIs by minimizing the residual model error  All in all  we assume that any share price can be represented as a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  not seasonally adjusted in our model  which may be leading the share price by several months  Our model also includes a linear time trend and an intercept in order to remove mean and trend components from all involved time series  The current Loews  model is driven by the consumer price index of food and beverages  F  leading the price by seven months and the index transportation services  TS  which leads by five months  L t     2 02F t 7    2 00TS t 5    27 50 t 2000    703 00  February 2012where t is calendar time The standard error between July 2003 and February 2012 is  2 41 The MetLife s model is driven by the same consumer price indices leading by six and four months  respectively MET t     2 83F t 6    2 71TS t 4    34 81 t 2000    981 01  February 2012 The standard error between July 2003 and February 2012 is  3 25  It is worth noting that all coeffcinets and time leads are close and have the same signs  i e  their influence of the corresponsing prices are similar For PRU  the model is as follows PRU t     5 15F t 5    3 80TS t 4    56 20 t 2000    1005 63  February 2012 with the standard error between July 2003 and February 2012 of  5 58 Figure 1 displays the evolution of all three prices since 2003  Their shapes are mainly similar but the amplitudes are quite different  Figure 2 depicts the same curves but normalized to their respective peak values between 2003 and 2012  The overall similarity and the presence of a sharp fall in October November 2008 are obvious  This might be the reason behind the same defining CPIs and close time delays of the share prices behind the CPIs  Apparently  any information about a probable fall in a share price obtained five months in advance could be of importance That s why we have been reporting on the prediction of our models for selected S P 500 companies since 2009 Figure 1  The evolution of PRU  L and MET share prices  Figure 2  The evolution of PRU  L and MET share prices  all normalized to their peak values beteen 2003 and 2012  We have already presented the newly estimated PRU model in our standard way  Figure 3 illustrates the evolution of both defining indices between 2002 and 2012  Figure 4 depicts the observed and predicted monthly closing prices for L and MET since 2003 and also provides an estimate of the models  natural uncertainty as related to the high low monthly prices  The real time prediction for L  red curve  leads the observed price by 5 month  As for PRU  all major turns in the prices were well foreseen by the models  including those in November 2007  March 2009  and April 2011  These dates are different from the pivot times for BEN and AIV  The respective residual errors are shown in Figure 5 Figures 4 suggests that L and MET prices will likely slightly rise in Q2 2012  Figure 3  The evolution of defining CPIs Figure 4  Observed and predicted L and MET

106373,327888,L,A Closer Look at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners  Distributable Cash Flow,opinion,On July 30  2012  Boardwalk Pipeline Partners  LP  BWP  reported results of operations for 2Q 2012  Revenues  operating income  net income and earnings before interest  depreciation   amortization and income tax expenses  EBITDA  were as follows  On the revenue side  the period to period improvements in Table 1 primarily reflects the acquisition of HP Storage  referred to below   On the expense side  the improvements primarily reflect larger than normal expenses in 2011  due  for example  to materials   supply impairment charges and charges related to a fire at a compressor station   EBITDA came in above consensus estimates at  0 92 per unit vs   1 08 in 1Q 2012 and  0 65 in 2Q 2011  Second quarter distributions were held flat at  0 5325 per unit   2 13 per annum   BWP s definition of Distributable Cash Flow   DCF   and a comparison to definitions used by other master limited partnerships   MLPs   are described in a   Using that definition  DCF for the trailing 12 months   TTM   period ending 6 30 12 was  449 million   2 50 per unit   up from  413 million in the comparable prior year period   2 43 per unit   As always  I first attempt to assess how these DCF figures compare with what I call sustainable DCF for these periods and whether distributions were funded by additional debt or issuing additional units  Given quarterly fluctuations in revenues  working capital needs and other items  it makes sense to review TTM numbers rather than quarterly numbers for the purpose of analyzing changes in reported and sustainable distributable cash flows  The generic reasons why DCF as reported by the MLP may differ from sustainable DCF are reviewed in an article titled   Applying the method described there to BWP results through 2Q 2012 generates the comparison outlined in the table below  The principal differences between reported and sustainable DCF in Table 2 is attributable to working capital used  I generally do not include working capital generated in the definition of sustainable DCF but I do deduct working capital used  Despite appearing to be inconsistent  this makes sense because in order to meet my definition of sustainability the MLP should generate enough capital to cover normal working capital needs  On the other hand  cash generated by the MLP through the liquidation or reduction of working capital is not a sustainable source and I therefore ignore it  Over reasonably lengthy measurement periods  working capital generated tends to be offset by needs to invest in working capital  I therefore do not add working capital used to net cash provided by operating activities in deriving sustainable DCF  The principal components of  other   which I exclude from the sustainable category  are non cash interest expense and proceeds from an insurance settlement received in 2Q 2012 relating to a fire that occurred in 1Q 2011 at one of the Partnership s compressor stations near Carthage  Texas Coverage ratios for 2Q 2012 are indicated in the table below Coverage ratios are thin  However  on August 8  2012  BWP s distribution yield was  8 04   significantly higher than yields offered as of the same date by some of the other MLPs I have covered  For example  4 80  for Magellan Midstream Partners  MMP   4 79  for Enterprise Products Partners  EPD   4 97  for Plains All American Pipeline  PAA   6 23  for Williams Partners  WPZ   6 40  for El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPB   and 6 60  for Targa Resources Partners  NGLS  The simplified cash flow statement in Table 4 below nets certain items  e g   debt incurred vs  repaid   separates cash generation from cash consumption  and gives a clear picture of how distributions have been funded in the last two years Simplified Sources and Uses of Funds Net cash from operations less maintenance capital expenditures did not cover distributions in both TTM periods  the shortfall decreased to  30 million in the TTM ending 6 30 12 from  46 million in the prior year period   Table 3 therefore shows that distributions in both TTM periods were partially financed by issuing equity and  to a lesser extent  debt  Note that    282 million of the  527 million of equity issuance in the TTM ended 6 30 12 is an adjustment to partners  capital  In February 2012  BWP acquired from Loews Corporation  L   the parent of BWP s general partner  the remaining 80  equity interest in Boardwalk HP Storage Company  LLC for  285 million  This drop down acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control  Therefore  the assets and liabilities of HP Storage were recognized at their carrying amounts at the date of transfer and  281 8 million  the carrying amount of the net assets acquired  was treated as an adjustment to partners  capital  Also  BWP includes HP Storage s results for the 6 months period ended 6 30 12  as if the acquisition had occurred on 1 1 2012  Boardwalk HP Storage operates seven high deliverability salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Forrest County  Mississippi  having approximately 29 billion cubic feet   Bcf   of total storage capacity  of which approximately 19 Bcf is working gas capacity  It also owns undeveloped land suitable for up to six additional storage caverns  In an   I said I would not be surprised to see additional partnership units being issued later this year  Indeed  on 8 2 12 BWP priced at  27 80 per unit an offering of 10 5 million units which  together with another 1 575 million units likely to be sold pursuant to the underwriters  overallotment option  will generate proceeds of   333 million  A portion of that will be used to fund the 2Q 2012 distribution estimated to total   105 million  BWP is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of no more than 5 1  Excluding the  100 million of affiliated debt  BWP s total long term debt stood at  3 4 billion as of 6 30 12  This equates to a multiple of 5 04x EBITDA for the TTM ending 6 30 12  Granted  EBITDA may be defined somewhat differently in the credit agreement  otherwise I do not see how management could have explicitly stated that BWP was in full compliance as of 6 30 12   but at this level  putting aside the  785 million availability via the revolving credit facility   it is probably not possible for BWP to use long term debt to finance the remaining 2012 capital expenditures  The recent equity financing will  among other things  be used for that purpose  There has been minimal distribution growth over the TTM ending 6 30 12  0 5  to be precise   Given uncertainty regarding customer contract renewals  although renewal prices so far this year have not dropped  and its assessment of current market conditions  management decided it would not be prudent to increase distributions  I believe this is a sound decision  But even at their current level  distributions are being funded  in part  by issuing equity  Adding the thin coverage ratio and high leverage to this concern  I conclude that investors willing to add to their positions should consider other MLPs ,2012-08-13,Ron Hiram,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-closer-look-at-boardwalk-pipeline-partners’-distributable-cash-flow-132744,132744
106374,327889,L,Cutting Edge Frackers,opinion,Fracking in the U S  is here to stay  affirms Keith Schaefer  editor of the Oil   Gas Investments Bulletin  North American business is dependent on cheap energy  and even energy utilities are switching from coal to natural gas  Although environmental concerns remain  the industry has incentive to do the right thing  says Schaefer  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  Schaefer profiles service companies that are using cutting edge technology to make fracking safer  greener and cheaper    The Energy Report  Keith  considering that natural gas prices are still near all time lows  can you still argue that fracking has improved North American energy markets  Keith Schaefer  In just a few short years  fracking grew the supply of natural gas way ahead of demand  The price of natural gas fell from  8 9 thousand cubic feet  Mcf  to  2 Mcf  Natural gas is the low hanging fruit for the energy sector and for consumers  Cheapened feedstock provides a huge boom for American business  TER  Have fracked oil prices kept pace with falling natural gas prices  KS  It has not declined by the same degree  but it has lowered the cost of North American oil  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  used to be the major benchmark for oil around the world  Now  WTI is only a benchmark for a small area of the United States and Canada  In addition  the flood of supply coming out of new shale oil wells in North Dakota and Texas is overwhelming the refinery complex in the Gulf Coast  which is about 50  of North America s refinery capacity  TER  Is there a glut of gasoline  Prices for consumers are certainly high  KS  That s a great question  The short answer is no  But the long term answer is yes  People are saying  OK  how come gas prices at the pump are so high when we ve got all this oil  What s going on  Here is how the game works  the refineries are moving their production flows to produce the least amount of driving gasoline possible  and the most amount of other refined products  like home heating oil fuel  diesel  kerosene and jet fuel  These are products they can export  in which case they get to use the Brent prices  which are 15  higher than WTI prices  These refineries generally operate on skinny to average margins  so 15 points is huge for them  That is why the price of retail gasoline for driving is 50  higher than it was in 2008 Let me give you an example  I m in Vancouver  We sell gas by the liter  not the gallon  Back in 2008  we had an uncanny relationship where if oil was  100 a barrel  bbl   gasoline was  1 a liter  L  at the pump  If it was  110 bbl  it was  1 10 L  If it was  1 35 L in Vancouver  oil was  135 bbl  Now  gasoline is  1 35 L  but oil is only  96 bbl  Why  Because the refineries are producing the least amount of gasoline  and the most amount of other refined products  TER  Does fracking lower oil production costs  KS  As a rule of thumb  the cost of production for most shale plays in North America is  40 45 bbl  which is not that much different from costs using conventional methods  It is above ground logistics that cause lower prices for fracked oil  We don t have enough pipelines to efficiently transport the fracked oil to the refineries  Consequently  supply backs up at the hubs  creating big discounts  For example  in late June  Canadian oil and Bakken oil were at huge discounts  almost  20 bbl to WTI  Because of pipeline disruptions and refinery downtime  Canadian producers were receiving under  70 bbl for their oil  But only 2  months later  the logistics are running smoothly and Bakken oil is now selling at only a  3 bbl discount to WTI  TER  Why do we see regional price differentials at the pump  KS  Logistics  Here is an example  Recently  BP Plc s  BP NYSE  BP LSE  Cherry Point refinery  which is just south of the Canadian border  went down  The next day  gas prices jumped  0 30 per gallon from Seattle to San Diego  It s not like we have no new refining capacity  Even though no new refineries have been built since  76 in the U S   refineries have been expanding   and Saudi Aramco have spent  10 billion during the last few years  doubling the size of their Motiva refinery in Texas from 300 000 bbl per day  bblpd  to 600 000 bblpd  It immediately ran at full capacity  But  then  an industrial accident took the new expansion offline for nearly a year  which boosted the retail price  TER  Why is fracking politically controversial  KS  Scientific studies have shown that fracking is not an environmental issue  It does not contaminate the ground water  There is usually more than a mile of granite between where the fracking takes place and the water table  On the other hand  the government of British Columbia has released a study finding that fracking causes earthquakes  And there is seismic activity associated with fracking and saltwater disposal wells  but that takes place in the formation where the fracking is occurring  The quakes are no different than any of the millions of micro seismic events that happen around the world every day  Of course  there is an impact  Blasting for mining creates seismic events  Building a dam creates seismic events  Filling a large manmade lake creates seismic events  because water is heavy  Fracking is no different  It is the fierceness of emotion that is the big issue here  People get nervous about the safety of their water supplies and say   Hey  prove to me that fracking is really safe   Industry has responded by saying   Look  here s the science  We ve been doing this for 50 years  No need to worry  it s all good   But that s not what people need to hear  People need to hear   Hey  we hear that you re really concerned about this  that it s a big issue for you  Let us come together at a community hall and talk about it   That would be more effective than just taking out ads that say   a  we bring so many jobs to the area  why are you bugging us  and  b  we ve done this for decades  why are you bugging us  That kind of attitude is not going to win any arguments  TER  Are drought conditions in the Southwest and Midwest affecting the availability of water for fracking  KS  Due to drought  the price of water for oil and gas companies has more than doubled in the Midwest and Texas  Some of the oil and gas companies are not drilling as much as they said they would this year because they need to figure out where to get the water and how much they want to pay for it  Even though the amount of water used by the industry isn t huge compared to irrigation  there are areas where the oil industry is bidding for water rights against farmers  The industry needs to be very careful about public relations  Otherwise it becomes a case of the big guy against the little guy  TER  Are there any technological fixes to that issue  KS  Yes  Firms involved in the fracking supply chain are figuring out how to source  treat  recycle and dispose of water efficiently  One company that comes to mind is   It has a proprietary water recycling technology  EOG Resources Inc   NYSE  EOG  is a Ridgeline client  as is Pure Energy Services Ltd   TSX PSV   These companies are starting to recycle their fracking water  which is great  Other companies doing water management include   That s Mark Evans  deal from Magnum Hunter  MHR  NYSE A   This company is determined to use saltwater disposal wells as its entr e into the water management sector  Another company is   It has a water storage product and is branching out into more vertically integrated work in the water sector  There are lots of companies experimenting with this  and for good reason there are very big margins  50 85  gross margin  That s fantastic  It beats the pants off any other service in the oil patch  Investors should be taking a strong look at fluid and water service companies  TER  Aside from the Bakken shale  what are the most exciting international sources of shale oil and gas  KS  The only other notable proven deposit of size is the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina  There are a few Canadian juniors down there  but the Argentine government has started to nationalize part of YPF SA  NYSE  YPF   Plus  some permits were pulled from juniors by provincial regulators  That put a huge chill in the market for these stocks  They are well funded and cashed up  but the market s just not going to care about them until there s real production growth  European shales have been fairly slow to take off  Poland s been on the hot list for a while  but nothing s happened  During the next two to three quarters  we could see a few wells get plunked down in New Zealand  That looks like a fairly thick formation  If it gets going  it could be a big win for investors next year  TER  What about the oil and gas shale near Paris  France  KS  Fracking is still banned in France   dropped its French play and is now focused on the Eagle Ford shale and the Eaglebine in Texas  TER  Could fracking be banned in the U S   either in certain areas or in its entirety  KS  Fracking will never be banned in the U S  But if it did happen  businesses would go bankrupt left  right and center  Many companies are hooked on cheap gas  There would be widespread bankruptcies and unemployment  Power companies are using cheap gas instead of coal  The U S  reduced its greenhouse gas emissions more than any other country in the world over the last two to three years because of shale gas  TER  What technological changes will keep fracking profitable  while reducing its environmental footprint  KS  A company called  has been trying to get the industry to start using liquid petroleum gas  LPG  for fracking  instead of injecting water into the ground  LPG is propane  which is a naturally occurring substance in the formation  so it doesn t damage the formation  as water can  Unfortunately  the company is not having very much success  But the industry is doing a lot of research into food grade fracking fluid  The idea is to make fracking fluid as green and environmentally friendly as possible  That s a couple of years away  but it s only a matter of time  TER  Any other names on the cutting edge of fracking technology  KS   has a big play in the Viking formation in Saskatchewan that is very profitable  Its water flood technique is returning incredibly cheap oil  It got the first half million barrels of oil out at about  30 35 bbl  and the last half million barrels at  5 10 bbl  It is at the forefront of recovery technology  Normally  a firm is lucky if fracking returns 10 15  oil  But with the water floods  the recovery factor can go way up  That is great news for Raging River stockholders   is also working in the Viking formation  and it has two other upcoming plays worth watching  One is the Slave Point play in Red Earth  which is north of Edmonton  Pinecrest Energy Inc   PRY TSX V  has been involved  Renegade will drill the first well later this year  If it can prove up one or two wells  it has a big enough land package to allow a lot of new locations to open up  Renegade also has a really interesting conventional play in southern Saskatchewan called Souris Valley  It s turning out to be a lot more profitable than the company had originally thought it would be  TER  What is your bottom line message on the future of fracking  KS  Mainstream public attention on water management isn t a bad thing  It makes the industry do things that should get done  Fracking water should be food grade  The market rewards stocks for doing the right thing  There s nothing that the market hates more than uncertainty  If the industry starts to lose what I call its  social license  in the United States  that loss will have a very big impact on valuations  Companies are incentivized to do the right thing  to do it well and to do it fast  That s why we will soon see a resolution to the fracking issue  TER  Thank you for chatting with us today  KS  A pleasure as always
