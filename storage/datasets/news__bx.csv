187438,408954,BX,Ups and downs  the battle to buy Thyssenkrupp s elevator unit,news,"FRANKFURT DUESSELDORF  Reuters    Finland s Kone  HE KNEBV  and private equity firms are battling to buy ThyssenKrupp s  DE TKAG  prized elevator division worth more than 15 billion euros   16 6 billion   a deal which would be Europe s biggest private equity deal in 13 years 
Thyssenkrupp says it will either list the business  sell either a stake or the business in its entirety as the company aims to cut 12 4 billion euros   13 7 billion  in debt and pension liabilities 
The deadline for binding bids for the whole business is mid February 
SUITORS LINE UP
Suitors are 
  Kone has submitted a 17 billion euro non binding bid  including a roughly 3 billion break fee  beating three private equity consortia whose offers were between 15 16 billion 
Union sources say that may not be enough to compensate for antitrust risks 
Analysts at Jefferies said that a price tag of 15 6 billion euros after tax would be enough  to negate net debt and pension liabilities  saving about 1 1 billion in outflows per year  
The rival private equity consortia are 
  Blackstone  N BX   Carlyle  O CG  and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
  A group comprising Advent  Cinven  CINV UL   the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany s RAG foundation
  Canada s Brookfield  TO BAMa  and Singapore s Temasek  TEM UL 
A buyout group victory would be Europe s biggest private equity deal since KKR s  N KKR   21 4 billion acquisition of Britain s Alliance Boots Plc in 2007  according to Refinitiv data 
KONE VS PRIVATE EQUITY
While being the safest option in terms of execution  a flotation is seen as unlikely at this stage as it wouldn t bring in enough cash 
That s why a sale to private equity looks like the easiest option as it would face little or no antitrust scrutiny and could be completed in months 
A sale to Kone runs the risk of a lengthy regulatory review  even when taking into account a plan to sell Thyssenkrupp s elevator assets in Europe  where overlap is biggest  to CVC  CVC UL  to try to resolve antitrust risks 
Danske Bank reckons that the combined market share of Thyssen and Kone stands at 43  in North America  which is also expected to lead to a deepened probe 
It took Linde  DE LINI  and Praxair  NYSE PX  nearly 17 months to get U S  antitrust approval for a merger  and only following far reaching remedy sales to CVC and Messer 
Still reeling from Brussels  veto of a planned steel tie up with India s  Tata Steel   NS TISC   Thyssenkrupp s appetite for that is considered to be limited 
JOB SECURITY
Bidders are courting representatives of IG Metall  Germany s most powerful union which can make or break any deal and will fight to protect jobs and secure sites 
The elevator business employs more than 53 000  a third of Thyssenkrupp s total staff 
Labour representatives also control half of Thyssenkrupp s 20 member supervisory board  which will have to approve an agreement 
Workers fear that a sale to Kone carries a higher risk of job cuts than a sale to private equity  While cost savings are a key for all bidders  Kone needs synergies to justify its higher price tag 
Labour leaders also remain sceptical about Kone s plan to sell Thyssenkrupp s European assets to CVC  as it is uncertain what would happen to workers at the 2 1 billion euro business ",2020-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ups-and-downs-the-battle-to-buy-thyssenkrupps-elevator-unit-2075637,2075637
187439,408955,BX,Coronavirus paralyses short term oil  gas sales into China,news,"By Jessica Jaganathan and Chen Aizhu
SINGAPORE  Reuters    Short term sales of crude oil and liquefied natural gas into China almost ground to a halt this week as a coronavirus outbreak slowed economic activity and hurt demand  and buyers pondered legal action to avoid having to honor purchase agreements  trade sources said 
Typically  trade would have revived after the Lunar New Year holiday at the end of January  but China has extended the break into February to try to contain the fast spreading virus  which has claimed nearly 500 lives 
As a result  commodity supply chains have been disrupted  with shipments canceled or delayed and stocks piling up  especially as mild weather had already slowed heating fuel demand 
China is the world s largest importer of crude oil  having imported a record 506 million tonnes in 2019  or about 10 million barrels per day  according to Chinese government figures  and recently became the world s largest importer of liquefied natural gas  LNG  
Spot crude trade into Shandong  home to independent refiners that account for a fifth of China s imports  is at a halt  three traders said  speaking on condition of anonymity 
 We managed to sell some cargoes even for April arrival  before the Lunar New Year  but this week everything stopped   a Singapore based trader said 
Sellers were reluctant to offer cargoes for sale because of concern the buyer might declare force majeure on previous deals  traders said 
Companies invoke force majeure when they cannot meet their contractual obligations because of circumstances beyond their control 
In the liquefied natural gas  LNG  market  some Chinese buyers said they were considering invoking the force majeure clause on imports  although some producers said they had not received any such notices 
Fears of the virus are hampering  Energy Transfer  LP s  N ET  efforts to lock in contracts with Chinese customers to deliver LNG from the U S  Gulf  the company s chief executive said at a conference on Wednesday 
 I can t in good conscience let our people go over there at this time   said Kelcy Warren  CEO of Energy Transfer  He said the company s Beijing office is essentially empty 
One supplier of LNG to China National Offshore Oil Corporation  CNOOC   told Reuters his firm received a potential notice of force majeure last week 
The source also said his legal department found that  to be legally effective  the notice would need the backing of third party official documents from local governments declaring a full shutdown situation in receiving terminals 
CNOOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Sources in Sinopec and PetroChina told Reuters they had not issued a force majeure notice 
 We ve heard similar concerns raised in the market about force majeure into Asia  But to date  we haven t had any force majeure declarations   Bill Bullock  ConocoPhillips   N COP  head of Asia Pacific   Middle East  said on Tuesday 
Deliveries from the North West Shelf LNG project  Australia s biggest  are running to plan  a spokeswoman for Woodside Petroleum  AX WPL   operator of North West Shelf LNG  said 
In addition to the demand slump  several large oil and gas companies said they had restricted travel to China  including Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa   Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and U S  refiner Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  
FORCE MAJEURE 
Last week  a Chinese international trade promotion agency said it would offer force majeure certificates to companies struggling to cope with the impact of coronavirus 
But the scope or impact of this on contracts that are typically governed by English law remains unclear  sources said 
Force majeure clauses are worded differently in various contracts  They can include provisions for epidemics and  acts of government or national laws   law firm Blackstone  NYSE BX    Gold said in a briefing note seen by Reuters  which also said the party affected had responsibilities 
 The party affected by a force majeure event needs to take reasonable steps to mitigate its position  such as sourcing alternative suppliers   the note said 
A crude oil seller said the force majeure certificates were meant to protect China exporters  not importers 
 It needs to be proven that due to the virus  the logistics of the cargo have been delayed or canceled   he said  adding that this could be harder for commodity importers to prove 
Chinese firms may also hesitate to declare force majeure for fear of damaging relationships with sellers for the future  traders said  meaning buyers would prefer to try to divert or resell cargoes for now 
At least one tanker bound for China has been diverted  while a major LNG supplier to China said buyers in China were citing  tank top  or brimming inventory as a reason to postpone their cargo imports ",2020-02-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/coronavirus-paralyses-shortterm-oil-gas-sales-into-china-2077059,2077059

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  both Affiliated Managers Group and Blackstone Group are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
AMG currently has a forward P E ratio of 6 14  while BX has a forward P E of 24 52  We also note that AMG has a PEG ratio of 0 61  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 47 
Another notable valuation metric for AMG is its P B ratio of 1 15  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BX has a P B of 2 55 
These metrics  and several others  help AMG earn a Value grade of A  while BX has been given a Value grade of D 
Both AMG and BX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that AMG is the superior value option right now ",2019-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amg-or-bx-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200495817,200495817

187444,408960,BX,Spain s poor suffer as economy recovers from crisis  U N  poverty expert,news,"By Clara Laeila Laudette
MADRID  Reuters    Spain is depriving its poor of basic rights  even as its businesses recover from the economic crisis  a U N  poverty expert said on Friday 
The country is facing housing problems of  stunning proportions  that are hitting people already struggling without jobs and sufficient benefits  said the U N  Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights  Philip Alston in a report 
Spain s Ministry of Social Rights and the Secretary of State for Communication did not immediately respond to requests for a response  Its Ministry for Transport  Mobility  and Urban Planning directed calls to its housing department which did not answer 
His preliminary findings  from a two week tour of Spain came out as Madrid s new Socialist led leftist coalition government completed its first month in office 
It has vowed to improve social spending and has raised the minimum wage by 5 5    but Alston warned of  a deep mismatch between the needs and the policy responses being considered   especially on housing 
In 2008 2014  Spain suffered one of the longest and most painful economic crises in Europe  sending unemployment shooting up to 27  and prompting large public spending cuts 
Its solid economic recovery since then has heavily favored corporations and the wealthy  but never restored social protections  Alston said 
 The post recession recovery that has been so good for some has left many people behind  and that all too little has been done for most members of that large group   his report said 
It denounced   Deep widespread poverty and high unemployment  a housing crisis of stunning proportions  a completely inadequate social protection system that leaves large numbers of people in poverty by design 
 Despite the clear need  low cost rental housing is almost nonexistent in Spain   he said citing data from the Housing Europe network of housing providers that show just 2 5  of Spain s occupied stock is social  compared with nearly 17  in France and 30  in the Netherlands

Unizo said it had received offers from four overseas investment funds and one Japanese fund as well as one domestic company  without naming the bidders 
Unizo said none of the offers would meet its demands 
The multiple offers may further complicate the takeover saga surrounding the hotel operator  which is already in talks with two top global investment groups   Blackstone and Fortress Investment Group 
Unizo in July became a target for a hostile bid by a Japanese travel agent H I S  Co  T 9603   Unizo at one stage turned to SoftBank Group owned  T 9984  Fortress to fend off the bid  But later it withdrew its support for Fortress  white knight offer

Unizo said on Sunday it was positively engaged in talks with Blackstone  Blackstone on Friday extended the deadline for Unizo to respond to its offer  
Fortress is currently running a public tender offer to buy Unizo at 4 100 yen per share  valuing the company at  1 3 billion  Unizo said on Sunday it was asking Fortress to raise its bid price to 5 000 yen per share  Unizo said it wanted any bidder to make an offer at 5 000 yen per share or more  Some of the new bidders are still considering the offer price  Unizo said ",2019-11-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japanese-hotel-group-unizo-gets-six-new-buyout-offers-2026913,2026913
187519,409035,BX,Blackstone to invest  400 million in gene therapy venture with Ferring,news,"By Rebecca Spalding
 Reuters    Blackstone Group Inc  N BX  said on Monday it will invest  400 million in a joint venture with Swiss drug company Ferring that is working on an experimental gene therapy for bladder cancer  the private equity giant s largest ever bet on drug development 
Investing in yet to be approved medicines is a lucrative but also risky proposition for buyout firms  and only few have had the stomach to place such bets  Blackstone made its foray in the sector last year  acquiring Clarus  an investment firm specializing in life sciences 
For its part  Ferring will invest  170 million in the joint venture with Blackstone  dubbed FerGene  bringing its total funding to  570 million  the companies said in a statement 
FerGene is developing a gene therapy for bladder cancer patients with an aggressive form of the disease whose current options include having their bladder removed  The treatment works by entering the walls of the bladder where it releases a gene to trigger the patient s own body to make a protein to fight off cancer     
 We believe  and Ferring also believes  that this can change the standard of care in bladder cancer  a terrible disease   Nicholas Galakatos  senior managing director of Blackstone Life Sciences  said in an interview 
 Oncology is a new area for Ferring  but it is one that we as Blackstone Life Sciences have a lot of experience in 
The team assembled by Blackstone has worked at several of the world s largest cancer drugmakers  including Roche unit Genentech   Merck   Co  Inc  N MRK   and Millennium Pharmaceuticals  now a part of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd  T 4502  
To minimize its risk  Blackstone invests in the late stages of drug development  when a medicine has already gone through important milestones  Late stage drug development can also be expensive because of the clinical trials involved  something that Blackstone is seeking to capitalize on by partnering with pharmaceutical firms looking to share the cost burden 
FerGene s therapy  named nadofaragene firadenovec  is currently in the final stage of clinical research  results from which will be presented on Dec  5 at the Society of Urologic Oncology s annual meeting 
Since it launched its life sciences unit  Blackstone has also formed a new company with  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  to study a type of heart drug  Blackstone invested  250 million in that venture ",2019-11-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackstone-to-invest-400-million-in-gene-therapy-venture-with-ferring-2027349,2027349
187520,409036,BX,Warburg Pincus to raise up to  1 5 billion for first India focused fund  sources,news,"By Kane Wu and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG  Reuters    Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC is looking to raise up to  1 5 billion for its first fund targeting deals in India  two people familiar with the matter told Reuters  betting on a surge in investment opportunities in Asia s third largest economy 
Warburg plans finish fundraising on its India focused fund  which will target industrial sectors such as financial  manufacturing and consumer  by the first half of next year  said one of the people 
Launches of India focused private equity funds are rare  and big global buyout firms such as KKR   Co Inc  N KKR   Bain Capital and Blackstone Group Inc  N BX  typically invest in a country mainly from their regional funds 
Warburg declined to comment  The sources did not want to be identified as the firm s plans are not public yet 
Private equity investments are expected to pick up in India as some companies look to sell shares to fund growth  while some family owned firms explore selling controlling stakes to pay off debt  bankers said 
Lower valuations  a rapidly growing middle class and reforms such as bankruptcy resolution rules are also enticing global private equity firms to invest in India 
Private equity backed deals in India have risen to a record  16 8 billion so far this year  rising up from the previous high of  12 4 billion last year  according to data compiled by Refinitiv 
The news of Warburg s India fundraising plan comes as rival KKR is looking to raise a record  15 billion in 2020 for its latest Asia focused buyout fund  which will include India investments 
Warburg has not finalised the size or launch timing of the fund  which depend on market conditions  said one of the people 
Warburg has a 21 person investment team in Mumbai  according to its website  It was Indian telecom company Bharti Airtel s  NS BRTI  first marquee investor in the early 1990s and has recently invested in its digital TV and African arms 
The private equity firm also holds stakes in local insurer IndiaFirst  retail real estate platform Virgo Retail Ventures  and education financing provider Avanse Financial Services  according to its website 
In June  the U S  based firm closed a  4 25 billion private equity fund focusing on Chinese and Southeast Asian investments after launching the exercise in January with a target to raise  3 5 billion 
That fund  China Southeast Asia II  will focus on investing across consumer and services  healthcare  real estate  financial services  and technology  media and telecommunications  Warburg had said in June ",2019-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/warburg-pincus-to-raise-up-to-15-billion-for-first-indiafocused-fund-sources-2029934,2029934
187524,409040,BX,Factbox  Failure to launch   The biggest IPO pull outs of 2019,news," Reuters    Private companies seeking to launch on stock markets have abandoned a series of initial public offerings  IPO  this year after a string of high profile startups   most notably WeWork   failed to draw the expected interest from investors 
The cancellations in part are seen as a reflection of a weakening global economy  but have cast doubt on the solidity of some disruptive businesses  while Asian deals have also suffered from the political protests in Hong Kong 
Following is a list of some of the most notable companies across the world to have pulled the plug on IPOs in 2019 
   The We Company  owner of office sharing startup WeWork  scrapped its IPO in September  as concerns around the sustainability of its business model led to a lackluster response from investors 
   Endeavor Group Holdings  the U S  entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel  abandoned its IPO in September following weak stock market investor demand 
   Waste management company GFL Environmental said in November that it would cancel its initial public offering  with no immediate plans to revisit the markets  after institutional investors pressed the Canadian firm to price its shares below the marketed range 
   Canadian mine financing company Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp  this month withdrew a planned initial public offering  citing difficult market conditions 
   Home Credit  controlled by the Czech Republic s richest businessman Petr Kellner  dropped plans last month for a Hong Kong listing seen valued at around  1 billion after the consumer lender struggled to achieve its hoped for valuation 
   Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti decided to pull its initial stock offering in mid October  as it was not satisfied with the price offered by investors  The yachtmaker s chief executive officer later said it plans to bring on board a European private investor 
   Private equity giant KKR   Co  N KKR  and its partners in October pulled a planned A 1 billion   678 60 million  offering for lender Latitude Financial  which had been set to be Australia s biggest listing of the year 
   KKR and TPG Capital also canceled the IPO of Southeast Asia online realty company PropertyGuru  which had expected to raise up to A 380 2 million 
   Bitmain Technologies  the world s largest designer of products for mining cryptocurrencies  let its application for a Hong Kong IPO of at least  3 billion lapse in March  amid fears of price volatility as well as high profile hacks and infrastructure failures 
   Household appliances maker JS Global Lifestyle has pulled its initial public offering of up to HK 3 62 billion   462 63 million   two sources told Reuters in October

187525,409041,BX,Refinitiv created filter to block Reuters stories amid Hong Kong protests,news,"By Steve Stecklow LONDON  Reuters    As anti government demonstrations engulfed Hong Kong in August  Reuters broke a sensitive story  Beijing had rejected a secret proposal by city leader Carrie Lam to meet several of the protesters  demands in a bid to defuse the unrest  The story buttressed a main claim of the protesters  that Beijing is intervening deeply in the affairs of the semi autonomous city  A state run newspaper denounced the story as  fake  and  shameful   The article soon became unavailable in mainland China  It wasn t the Chinese government that blocked the story  The article was removed by Refinitiv  the financial information provider that distributes Reuters news to investors around the world on Eikon  a trading and analytics platform  The article was one of a growing number of stories that Refinitiv   which until last year was owned by Reuters  parent company  Thomson Reuters Corp   has censored in mainland China under pressure from the central government  Since August  Refinitiv has blocked more than 200 stories about the Hong Kong protests plus numerous other Reuters articles that could cast Beijing in an unfavorable light  Internal Refinitiv documents show that over the summer  the company installed an automated filtering system to facilitate the censoring  The system included the creation of a new code to attach to some China stories  called  Restricted News   As a result  Refinitiv s customers in China have been denied access to coverage of one of the biggest news events of the year  including two Reuters reports on downgrades of Hong Kong by credit rating agencies  Nearly 100 other news providers available on Eikon in China have also been affected by the filtering  Censorship in China has been intensifying in recent years under President Xi Jinping  and Western businesses have come under rising pressure to block news  speech and products that Beijing sees as politically dangerous  Refinitiv generates tens of millions of dollars of annual revenue in China  As Reuters reported in June  citing three people familiar with the matter  Refinitiv began the censorship effort earlier this year after a regulator threatened to suspend its Chinese operation  Refinitiv has joined a lengthening list of companies complying with Chinese demands  They include hotel giant Marriott International Inc  which last year temporarily shut down its Chinese websites and apologized for  among other things  listing Taiwan as a separate country in a customer questionnaire  Several U S  airlines also stopped describing Taiwan as non Chinese territory on their websites  Beijing considers the self governed island part of China  The companies have defended their actions  The censorship has angered the top news and business executives of Reuters and the directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co Ltd  an independent body tasked with preserving the news agency s independence  Speaking to Reuters journalists on a visit to the Singapore newsroom in October  Kim Williams  NYSE WMB   the Australian media executive who chairs the body  lashed out at Refinitiv  calling its actions  reprehensible  and a capitulation to  naked political aggression  from Beijing  Editor in Chief Stephen J  Adler told Reuters journalists in London in November that the censorship was  damaging  the brand   I don t approve of it   he said  Refinitiv chief executive David Craig and Thomson Reuters CEO Jim Smith have held multiple talks  as recently as this week  in an effort to resolve the issue  said people familiar with the matter  Smith  was very concerned  upon learning about Craig s decision to impose the filtering  said a senior Thomson Reuters official  It is not clear how close the two are to reaching a solution both sides find agreeable  one of the people said   We recognize that the processes that were put in place earlier this year need to be improved and are actively working on enhancements   Refinitiv spokesman Patrick Meyer said of the filtering system in a statement   As a global business  Refinitiv must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate  This is a challenge that not just Refinitiv faces  but also other companies and distributors of financial market information   Refinitiv was formed last year when a consortium led by private equity giant Blackstone  NYSE BX  purchased a 55  stake in Thomson Reuters  Financial   Risk business  which included the Eikon terminal business  for about  20 billion and rebranded it  Refinitiv and Thomson Reuters remain close  Reuters sells news to Eikon  and Thomson Reuters retains a 45  stake in Refinitiv  Refinitiv is by far Reuters  largest client  providing nearly half its revenue  As part of the spin off deal  Refinitiv agreed to make inflation adjusted annual payments of  325 million to Reuters over 30 years for news   a reliable income stream that is rare in the media business  The Founders Share directors are particularly incensed  They have complained to Thomson Reuters CEO Smith that by suppressing stories  Refinitiv is violating the terms of the deal  They also say they fear that Refinitiv  having given in to China s demands  might start blocking stories in other countries  Prior to the Blackstone deal  when Thomson Reuters controlled the Eikon business  Reuters stories were not blocked in China on Eikon  The Chinese government itself has been blocking access in China to the Reuters website for general readers  Reuters com  for years  as well as the sites of many other foreign news organizations   Let the Chinese decide if they ban something   said Pascal Lamy  a Founders Share director and former head of the World Trade Organization   But this is not Refinitiv s or Reuters  decision   Lamy said the directors believe the terms of the deal require Refinitiv to adhere to Reuters ethical rules on editorial integrity and independence  known as the Trust Principles  which  prevent you from accepting self censorship   In response  Refinitiv said it is  complying with our obligations with respect to the Trust Principles   It argues that in filtering out political stories for its own customers in China  it is following local laws and regulations as required by its operating license  Smith  who sits on the boards of both Thomson Reuters and Refinitiv  did not respond to requests for comment   The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy Refinitiv for  27 billion in a deal that s expected to close in the second half of next year  It declined to comment  TIANANMEN TABOO Reuters reported in June that Refinitiv had blocked several Reuters stories under government pressure  The articles were about the 30th anniversary of the bloody suppression of pro democracy demonstrations in Beijing s Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ   According to the people with knowledge of the matter  Refinitiv acted after the Cyberspace Administration of China  or CAC  which controls online speech  threatened to suspend the company s service in China if it didn t comply  The CAC did not respond to questions about this article  China s Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment  On June 3  Reuters editor Adler and Michael Friedenberg  president of Reuters  emailed the staff saying they d expressed concern to Refinitiv  Refinitiv promised it would alert the newsroom when it came under pressure from Chinese regulators about Reuters coverage  The news agency  as it does when it receives any complaint from individuals and institutions it covers  then would determine if there was any reason to correct a published story   In late July  Refinitiv asked Reuters to review an article that detailed how a Chinese government representative in Hong Kong had urged local residents to drive off protesters  just a week before a violent clash broke out between pro  and anti government crowds in the area  That story  too  was touchy because it showed Beijing intervening in the internal affairs of Hong Kong  Despite assurances from Reuters that the story was accurate  Refinitiv removed the headline of the story from Eikon in China  making the item difficult for users to find and view  On Aug  2  Reuters published a story about the blocking of this article as well   STRATEGIC CHINA FILTER  Refinitiv began ramping up its efforts to purge offending China coverage  Internal Refinitiv documents and emails describe how the company over the summer created an automated filtering system   referred to as the  Strategic China filter    to block certain stories to Eikon users in mainland China  In July  Refinitiv s news platform architecture director requested that a new code be created  called  Restricted News   that could be added to articles  He asked that it  should be hidden for all users  internal and external    according to notes of a conference call on July 17 where the code was discussed  One reason was that Refinitiv didn t want to give its mainland China customers the ability to disable the filtering  In an email to colleagues  the platform director explained the code   The flag is to highlight news that requires additional processing  due to Chinese govt restrictions  prior to consumption in China   The filtering system is designed to block stories for readers in mainland China but allow them to be accessed in other markets  It looks for restricted keywords in headlines  such as  Hong Kong  and  protest   according to a person familiar with the matter  Refinitiv employees also discussed by email whether the  Restricted News  code should be China specific or  generic   so it could be used to block stories in other countries in the future  The email exchange indicates they opted for a generic code  Reuters found no evidence that Refinitiv has deployed the filtering system in other nations  Refinitiv didn t comment on whether it plans to use the restriction code elsewhere  Eikon users outside mainland China can retrieve stories about the Hong Kong protests by clicking on headlines  or by searching for keywords or codes  For users inside China  however  articles that are blocked bring up this message   You do not have access to this story   Refinitiv s blocking of protest stories intensified after Aug  30  when Reuters reported that Beijing had rejected a bid by Hong Kong leader Lam to compromise with the protesters  Before that date  all but five of 246 Reuters articles that had run in 2019 containing the words  Hong Kong  and  protest  in the headline were accessible on the mainland  By contrast  between Aug  30 and Nov  20  Refinitiv blocked nearly four out of five such articles that Reuters filed   196 out of 251  The censorship was especially severe between Sept  4 and Oct  7  when all 104 Reuters articles containing those words in the headline were blocked  At the time  demonstrators were rampaging across the city and police were responding with water cannons and rubber bullets  Refinitiv also censored potentially market moving stories that would have been of interest to Refinitiv s core clientele of financial professionals  These included a Sept  6 report that Fitch Ratings had downgraded Hong Kong s long term foreign currency issuer default rating  Also blocked were stories on the effect of the protests on stock prices and initial public offerings  Refinitiv eventually began having employees get involved in the filtering process to prevent the blocking of financial stories  according to a person familiar with the matter  Yet the filtering remains inconsistent  It lets through some stories that China might consider politically taboo  including some articles about the Chinese government s mass incarceration of Uighurs  a Muslim ethnic minority in western China  Many other articles on the Uighurs have been blocked  Besides Reuters articles  the filtering has also blocked one or more stories from 97 other news providers that are available inside China on the Eikon system   including Xinhua  China s official state run news agency   On Dec  3  Refinitiv blocked a Xinhua story about a small demonstration in Hong Kong by pro Beijing residents  They were quoted heatedly denouncing Washington over a new U S  law that supports Hong Kong s pro democracy protesters  
And news relevant to investors is still being censored  Eikon users in mainland China couldn t read this story shortly after it was published  It was blocked   Reported by Steve Stecklow in London and New York  Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia in London and Alexandra Harney in Shanghai  Edited by Michael Williams and Peter Hirschberg  ",2019-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/refinitiv-created-filter-to-block-reuters-stories-amid-hong-kong-protests-2040310,2040310
187530,409046,BX,U S  presidential candidate Buttigieg releases list of major fundraisers,news," Reuters    U S  Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg released the names of his major fundraisers on Friday  bowing to growing pressure from rival Elizabeth Warren and U S  journalists to be more transparent in his campaign 
The list of 113 people includes everyone who has raised at least  25 000 for his campaign as bundlers  a common fundraising practice in which typically wealthy supporters arrange for groups of individuals to all make large donations at once  often at a reception for the candidate 
Wall Street executives and prominent Democratic fundraisers are among those named  including the hedge fund manager Orin Kramer  Hamilton James  executive vice chairman of the private equity firm Blackstone  NYSE BX   and Adam Bart  a partner at McKinsey   Company  the consulting firm where Buttigieg worked in his 20s 
Individuals can donate up to  2 800 to a campaign under current federal limits  Fundraisers who bundle many such contributions together can provide a major source of revenue for campaigns  often gaining access to the candidate in exchange 
Earlier this week in New York  Buttigieg began opening his fundraisers to press coverage for the first time 
As he has risen from his relatively obscure position as the mayor of the small city of South Bend  Indiana  Buttigieg has faced criticism from Warren  a U S  senator from Massachusetts  to disclose more about his financial backers

187538,409054,BX,Earnings Preview  Blackstone Mortgage Trust  BXMT  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This real estate finance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16  
Revenues are expected to be  105 48 million  up 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Blackstone Mortgage 
For Blackstone Mortgage  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Blackstone Mortgage will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Blackstone Mortgage would post earnings of  0 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 68  delivering a surprise of  3 03  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Blackstone Mortgage doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-blackstone-mortgage-trust-bxmt-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200474065,200474065
187542,409058,BX,KKR earnings slide 23  as weaker deal activity hits revenue,news,"By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK  Reuters    Private equity firm KKR   Co  N KKR  reported a 23  year on year drop in its quarterly after tax distributable profit on Tuesday  as fee revenue slid amid a broader slowdown in asset sales by buyout firms 
KKR said after tax distributable earnings  the cash available for paying dividends  fell to  388 8 million in the third quarter  from  496 7 million a year earlier 
Still  KKR s after tax distributable earnings per share of 46 cents surpassed the average analyst estimate of 42 cents per share  according to Refinitiv 
Many private equity firms  including KKR  have sold fewer companies this year  even though the U S  stock market is hovering near all time highs  as potential acquirers balk at their valuation expectations  This has weighed on the income they generate from the lucrative fees accompanying such transactions 
Blackstone Group Inc  N BX   the world s largest private equity firm  last week also reported a decline in its distributable earnings  of 8  
During the third quarter  KKR backed U S  entertainment and talent agency Endeavor Group Holdings  N EDR  postponed a plan to raise  400 million in an initial public offering because of weak market demand for the money losing firm   a move that hit KKR s capital markets business  which had underwritten the IPO 
KKR said total assets under management climbed to  208 billion  up 7  from a year ago 
New York based KKR said it plans to begin fundraising across its three largest flagship funds   Asia private equity  Americas private equity and global infrastructure   in addition to 20 other funds  as part of a plan to increase management fee revenue by 50  over three years 
 So given what s coming to market plus our ongoing distribution efforts  if the fundraising environment cooperates and we continue to perform  we believe we can grow our management fees by at least 50  again over the next three years   KKR Co president Scott Nuttall said during a call with analysts on Tuesday 
Ongoing U S China trade tensions has heightened concerns that investments by U S  investors in Chinese companies could be affected in a tit for tat retaliation as the world s two biggest economies hold talks in an attempt to reach a trade deal 
KKR has been one of the biggest U S  private equity investors in China and other Asian countries  bolstered by about  19 billion the buyout firm has raised in its three funds focused on the region  The firm s investments in China include ByteDance  the owner of short form video app TikTok  and Gambol Pet Group  a pet food manufacturer 
But KKR said it expects a minimal impact to the overall performance of its Chinese investments since they are focused on domestic consumption 
 I think the overall impact on the portfolio was one that is one that s pretty small  and the same point of time  we re trying to find ways to pursue opportunities if there are companies that have decided to exit the region   KKR s head of investor relations  Craig Larson  said during the earnings call ",2019-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kkr-earnings-slide-23-as-weaker-deal-activity-hits-revenue-2006890,2006890

 Reuters    U S  buyout firm  Carlyle Group  LP  O CG  reported a 25  year on year drop in its third quarter earnings on Thursday  driven by lower proceeds from asset sales in its private equity portfolio 
The Washington  D C  based firm said a slower pace of exit activity in some of its large buyout funds weighed on the revenue it generated from performance fees  It gets paid such fees when a minimum return for its investors  typically 8   is generated by its portfolio companies paying dividends or being divested 
Carlyle said its after tax distributable earnings   the cash available for paying dividends   totaled  146 1 million  down from  194 7 million a year earlier 
However  Carlyle s after tax distributable earnings per share of 41 cents came in slightly higher than the average analyst forecast of 40 cents per share  according to Refinitiv 
 While the investment environment remains challenging  our global platform and industry sector driven driven approach positions us well to drive performance   Carlyle Co CEOs Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement 
Carlyle s third quarter results are in line with its peers  Blackstone Group Inc  N BX  and KKR   Co Inc  N KKR  both reported declines in their distributable earnings  owing to fewer sales of assets from their private equity funds 
Carlyle s private equity funds appreciated by 1  in the quarter  while its real estate funds appreciated by 3   By comparison  Blackstone s private equity and opportunistic real estate funds appreciated by 2 6  and 3 8   respectively 
Carlyle s total assets under management stood at  222 billion as of the end of June  down slightly from the  223 billion reported in the previous quarter  Its third quarter management fees came in at  385 million  up 8  year on year 
In July  Carlyle became the first U S  private equity firm to announce that it will hold shareholder votes and adopt a single class share structure  as it coverts from a partnership to a corporation effective Jan  1

187547,409063,BX,Blackstone CEO is optimistic U S   China will agree trade deal,news,"By Chibuike Oguh
 Reuters    Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc  N BX  Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said on Wednesday he was optimistic that the United States and China would resolve their 16 month long trade war  helping to ease tensions between two of the world s biggest economies 
 It looks like things have lined up to go forward and I think there s good faith at this point to start things   Schwarzman said in an interview at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York 
American and Chinese officials have been racing to finalize a  phase one  interim trade agreement before new U S  tariffs on Chinese imports  including electronics  toys  and laptops  take effect from Dec  15 
That agreement is expected to be concluded later this month and signed by U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping  resulting a truce in the trade war 
 If agreement number one is done  which I would expect would happen  then it will lead to the second agreement  which will have more things in it  so I think there s reason for optimism in terms of what s going on   Schwarzman said 
U S  economic growth has slowed this year  reaching 1 9  in the third quarter  according to the Commerce Department  due to a decline in business investment triggered by trade tensions 
This slowdown has heightened concerns of an impending economic recession amid other warning indicators  including the inversion of the U S  yield curve during the summer  An inverted yield curve has preceded every U S  recession since 1955 
But Schwarzman said he does not expect a recession to happen anytime soon since personal consumption  which accounts for 70  of the economy  remains strong 
 The consumers are doing quite well and it s the first time in many years that in part of our economic scale people are out earning inflation   Schwarzman said 
 When that happens  people spend money  I expect there to be a continued wage pressure because we re starting to run out of workers and this will continue as a sort of economic cycle for a while  
Schwarzman has had close links with China dating back more than a decade  when the country s sovereign wealth fund  China Investment Corporation  paid  3 billion for up to 12 5  of New York based Blackstone  CIC has since sold down that stake

187589,409105,BX,U S  private equity fundraising swells as mega funds get bigger,news,"By Chibuike Oguh
 Reuters    U S  private equity firms raised  191 billion in the first nine months of 2019  nearly as much as in all of 2018  as investors flocked to well known managers raising large capital pools  according to a report by research firm Pitchbook 
Some of the private equity industry s biggest players completed their fundraising in the third quarter of this year  including Blackstone Group Inc  N BX  with a  26 billion buyout fund  and Vista Equity Partners Management LLC with a  16 billion fund 
This increased the amount raised by private equity funds by 38  year on year  even as the number of funds that raised capital fell 18  to 131  according to the report released on Thursday 
The strong fundraising showed investors believe concerns about an economic downturn fueled by a trade war between the United States and China will help create bargains that will allow private equity firms to put money to work  Pitchbook said in the report 
The results also showed that investors are being more selective in the managers they allocate capital to in a more precarious environment 
 While a recession would hurt the value of current portfolio companies  it would also create buying opportunities for funds with sufficient cash reserves   Pitchbook analysts said 
U S  private equity firms embarked on dealmaking this year at a feverish clip  In the first nine months  3 883 deals valued at  501 2 billion were completed  according to Pitchbook  maintaining the high level of dealmaking recorded in 2018 
However  U S  private equity firms sold fewer companies from their portfolios  as potential acquirers balked amid the market jitters  Buyout firms exited 726 companies valued at  220 billion  down 19 5  year on year 
 Trade war tensions  as well as domestic and international economic disputes  may explain the overall slump in exit activity that we have seen through the third quarter   Pitchbook said ",2019-10-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-private-equity-fundraising-swells-as-mega-funds-get-bigger-1994371,1994371

187595,409111,BX,Blackstone Group  BX  Is Up 2 04  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Blackstone Group  NYSE BX   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Blackstone Group currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if BX is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this investment manager holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For BX  shares are up 2 04  over the past week while the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry is up 0 93  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 13 17  compares favorably with the industry s 2 54  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Blackstone Group have increased 27 94  over the past quarter  and have gained 40 08  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 4 9  and 10 34   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to BX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  BX is currently averaging 5 954 510 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with BX 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost BX s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 35 to  2 36 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that BX is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Blackstone Group on your short list ",2019-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/blackstone-group-bx-is-up-204-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200436084,200436084
187596,409112,BX,These 7  Dividends Crushed The Market ,opinion,"Today I m going to give you everything you need to sail through the next crash  crush the S P 500 by this time next year and grab safe dividends up to 8 4  
We ll pull off this  dividend hat trick  through a set of  pullback proof  investments with dividends up to 5 times bigger than what your typical S P 500 stock pays 
In a moment  I ll reveal three funds yielding up to 8 4  that are more than worthy of your attention now  They come from a corner of the market that will surprise you 
First  though  you might be wondering how I found these big  steady payouts 
The answer is that these three funds have a lot in common with the seven  best buys  I released one year ago  in the June 2018 issue of my members only Contrarian Income Report service 
And how did those seven do 
Just fine  They yielded an outsized 7 2   on average  with the biggest yielder of the bunch paying 8 2    when I pounded the table on them a year back 
There s more  though 
Because these  magnificent seven  went on to do something income plays simply aren t supposed to do  crush the S P 500 
Since I recommended these seven stocks to CIR members a year ago  they ve returned 14   on average  including dividends  clobbering the index s 11   And these stocks  big payouts mean CIR members got a big slice of that return in cash 
And remember  that 14  was just the average  Check out some of the amazing performances the top names put up 
Highest Yielders Dominate
To be clear  these three stocks Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT   in blue  Medical Properties Trust  MPW   in red  and Ladder Capital  LADR   in orange  led the way  while boasting the highest yields of our seven picks  at 7 9   7 6   and 8 2   respectively 
So much for the so called  wisdom  that you can have income or gains but not both  And these seven picks  outperformance isn t even the best part 
This is  when the market fell off a cliff last September and stayed on its back till the end of the year  not a single one of these seven stocks fell as far as the S P 500  One  Medical Properties Trust  even knocked out a double digit return 
A Classic  Pullback Proof  Play in Action
In other words  all our CIR members had to do was sit back  pocket their 7 2  average dividends and wait for the 2019 rebound 
Where I m Investing Now for Safe Payouts Up to 8 4 
But enough with history 
Let s look to the future and one corner of the market where we ll find the next big dividends  and upside  heading into the back half of 2019  I ll also give you those three high yield funds  with payouts up to 8 4   I mentioned earlier 
Then  at the end of this article  I ll give you a chance to get the latest issue of Contrarian Income Report  just released last Friday  with my next seven portfolio  best buys   They come from across the investing universe foreign stocks and bonds  US REITs and undervalued infrastructure plays  to name a few 
I fully expect these fresh seven picks to crush the market and protect your nest egg in the next 12 months just like our previous septet did in the last 12 
America  A Dividend Desert
Before we get to that  though  we need to face facts  with the S P 500 up 20  in the first six months of 2019  many of the big dividends have dried up here in America 
As I write  the typical S P 500 stock yields 1 8   Ten year Treasuries are little better  paying less than 2   and falling   
Rate Cut Talk Tanks Treasury Yields
And now the Fed is set to throw gas on the fire  with the market pricing in three to four rate cuts in the next nine months  starting with the Fed s July 31 meeting 

As I wrote last week  in the rare instances when the Fed cuts rates in a rising market  like today   the result is usually higher stock prices 
So where the heck are we supposed to find bargain high yielders now 
We ll dive into one area most income players have left untouched  emerging markets  But we re not going to buy overseas stocks we re going to turn to safe  underappreciated EM bonds instead 
The CEF Advantage
No  I have no interest in hopping on a plane to scout out issues from Brazil  Indonesia or other foreign locales  Why would you when  with a click of a mouse  you can hire a top notch fixed income manager who will handpick an emerging market bond portfolio for you 
That s one advantage of tapping EM bonds through high yielding closed end funds  CEFs   Here s another  unlike ETFs  CEFs can t issue shares to new investors after their IPOs  But like ETFs  CEFs trade on the open market  like stocks 
The upshot  Occasionally a fund will fall out of favor and trade at a discount to the value of its underlying portfolio  known as the net asset value  or NAV 
Our job  buy when these markdowns get absurdly wide  then  ride them up  as they revert back to normal  yanking the share price higher as they do 
With that  here are three emerging market CEFs I like now  Their yields all trounce the payouts on the S P 500 and the 10 year  and their portfolios have all returned at least 7  annualized since inception 
Best of all  they set us up for further upside and downside protection thanks to their outsized discounts to NAV 
3  Globetrotting  CEF Bargains Paying Up to 8 4 
In case you re wondering how these three funds can sustain dividends up to 8 4   let me clear that up  because it comes back to the discount to NAV I just mentioned 
The yields shown above are based on the CEF s market price  But that doesn t matter to management  they only care about the  yield on NAV   or the yearly payout as a percentage of the per share value of the fund s portfolio   That s what dictates how much they need to earn from their bond holdings to cover the fund s dividend 
And when you calculate the yield on NAV  you see that these payouts are safe  with TEI s yield on NAV coming in at 7 3   vs  8 5  on market price   EMD at 7 4   vs  8 4   and EHI at 6 9   vs  7 6   
For pros like the ones running these rock solid income plays  fetching annualized returns like those is a snap  They ve already proven it with their 7   annualized returns on NAV

187597,409113,BX,Analysts Estimate Blackstone Mortgage Trust  BXMT  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This real estate finance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 5  
Revenues are expected to be  101 24 million  down 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Blackstone Mortgage 
For Blackstone Mortgage  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 89  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Blackstone Mortgage will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Blackstone Mortgage would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 71  delivering a surprise of  10 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Blackstone Mortgage doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-blackstone-mortgage-trust-bxmt-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200440212,200440212
187599,409115,BX,Ripe for a fall  private equity debt rush stokes bond market fears,news,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON  Reuters    A growing number of private equity firms are taking advantage of Europe s buoyant bond market to extract money from companies they hold by loading them with debt  prompting some investors to warn the fixed income rally is nearing its peak 
Several private equity backed companies have issued bonds backing  dividend recapitalizations  in recent weeks    a term that refers to the contentious practice of a companies issuing debt to pay dividends to the owner 
Britain s Pinewood Studios  owned by Aermont Capital  and Spanish gaming company Cirsa  owned by Blackstone  NYSE BX   both issued debt to undertake dividend recaps in September  raising 500 million pounds   625 4 million  and 375 million euros   413 1 million  respectively 
Elsewhere  Switzerland s Salt and Greece s Wind Hellas issued debt which included language allowing for the proceeds to be used for dividend payments 
There has been 3 33 billion euros of dividend recap related issuance this year so far  according to data provider 9fin  over three times the 2018 figure 
 GRAPHIC    Dividend recapitalisation  issuance builds up again   
The deal structure has courted controversy in the past  with critics accusing private equity firms of piling debt onto their subsidiaries for personal gain and making them more vulnerable in the future 
The 2014 collapse of British high street retail firm Phones4U was blamed partly on the company issuing 200 million pounds of debt to pay a dividend to owner BC Partners just a year earlier 
Private equity executives say that as a structure it is no different to any company paying a dividend rather than investing in the business 
But portfolio managers who cover this market said the return of these deals has left them uneasy  with one high yield bond fund manager saying he has been switching out of bonds in recent weeks 
 It is a controversial structure that usually means the bond market has peaked   he said 
The jump in debt funded dividend recapitalizations offer warnings that the fixed income cycle might be about to turn 
Firstly  investors are turning to such risky instruments because yield is so hard to find elsewhere  However  the fact that yields have been squeezed so much    in some cases into negative territory    is a sign that the next move may be downward for fixed income prices  which move inversely with yields 
Such a warning light flashed in the run up to the financial crisis  In 2007 dividend recaps were booming   with more than 20 billion euros worth in Europe that year  mainly issued through loans  according to S P Global Intelligence 
A year later the crisis exploded and the structure lost traction  slowing re emerging only in 2011 
There are also more recent examples of a rise in dividend recaps in European bond markets followed by a sell off 
In late 2017  there was 4 69 billion euros of dividend recap issuance in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017 alone  according to 9fin 
This proved to be the top of that particular run in European junk bonds  with the average yield on Markit s iBoxx euro denominated high yield bond index rising over 70 basis points in the last six weeks of 2017  and continuing to climb all the way through 2018 
 GRAPHIC   European junk bond yields   
Charles Diebel  head of fixed income strategy at Mediolanum Asset Management  agreed an uptick in deals such as dividend recaps is usually a sign of a bond market peak 
 Whether it s right to call a widening of spreads now  I m not sure  but we are clearly entering a period where the risk of idiosyncratic factors triggering a negative turn in markets is high   he said 
HIGH PRICES  LOW SENTIMENT
The bond market has rallied across the board and yields have dropped to unprecedented levels in 2019  as the U S  Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ramp up stimulus in the face of a potential economic slowdown 
With over a third of the European corporate bond market now in negative yielding territory  according to Tradeweb  dividend recap deals have stepped up 
However  those central bank actions to shore up the economy highlight another factor that is pushing interest in dividend recaps    that despite soaring fixed income valuations  underlying market sentiment is still very shaky 
 There is clearly a continued major concern for stressed and distressed credits and lack of willingness  from banks  to underwrite there   said Fraser Lundie  head of credit at Hermes 
 In this type of environment if you re coming across a repeat issuer where you ve done the work  you already know the management  the decision to invest is an easy one   he said 
A credit analyst who works for a firm that bought Cirsa s bond said knowledge of the company helped in their decision  but acknowledged that it didn t mean she wasn t worried about the structure in general 
 People are worried at the moment  so it s not  oh  everything will be great   but these sillinesses happen because they can t find yield   she said 
A Blackstone spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters 
Private equity firms also show interest in dividend recapitalizations in anticipation of future fundraising pitches to their own investors  says Tanneguy De Carne  head of financial sponsor coverage UK  Nordics   Benelux at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  
 They need to demonstrate they can monetise investments  For them a recapitalization is a demonstration that their investment thesis is correct  they can take money off the table without damaging value   he said ",2019-10-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ripe-for-a-fall-private-equity-debt-rush-stokes-bond-market-fears-1996594,1996594

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Blackstone Mortgage  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry  posted revenues of  106 48 million for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 18   This compares to year ago revenues of  103 75 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Blackstone Mortgage shares have added about 12 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 1  
What s Next for Blackstone Mortgage 
While Blackstone Mortgage has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Blackstone Mortgage was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

187608,409124,BX,BEN Vs  BX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Financial   Investment Management stocks have likely encountered both Franklin Resources  NYSE BEN  and Blackstone Group  NYSE BX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Franklin Resources has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Blackstone Group has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BEN has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
BEN currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 61  while BX has a forward P E of 17 07  We also note that BEN has a PEG ratio of 1 94  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  BX currently has a PEG ratio of 4 28 
Another notable valuation metric for BEN is its P B ratio of 1 68  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BX has a P B of 1 95 
Based on these metrics and many more  BEN holds a Value grade of A  while BX has a Value grade of D 
BEN sticks out from BX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that BEN is the better option right now ",2019-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ben-vs-bx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200417276,200417276

Against this backdrop  below we highlight a few fixed income ETFs that emerged as top performers in the past month  The one month returns are as per xtf com  as of May 1  2019  
Barclays  LON BARC  Inverse US Treasury Composite ETN    Up 4 21 
U S  treasury yield curve has steepened in the month  The benchmark 10 year U S  treasury yield rose to 2 51  on Apr 26 from 2 49  at the start of the month  hitting a high of 2 60  in mid month  On the other hand  short term  two year U S  treasury yield dropped to 2 28  at month end from 2 33  noticed at the start  This steepening of the yield curve works in favor of the fund 
The underlying  Barclays Inverse US Treasury Futures Composite Index employs a strategy that tracks the sum of the returns of periodically rebalanced short positions in equal face values of each of the 2 year  5 year  10 year  long bond and ultra long U S  Treasury futures contracts  The fund charges 43 bps in fees 
ProShares Inflation Expectations ETF   BO RINF     Up 3 
The US annual inflation rate picked up in March and rose to 1 9  at month end from a two and a half year low of 1 5  in the previous month  slightly above the market consensus of 1 8   Food prices increased at a faster clip while energy deflation eased  Such a slight uptick in inflation may have favored the fund

AdvisorShares Pacific Asset Enhanced Floating Rate ETF    Up 1 7 
Floating rate notes are investment grade bonds that do not pay a fixed rate to investors but have variable coupon rates that are often tied to an underlying index  such as LIBOR  plus a variable spread depending on the credit risk of the issuers  Since the coupons of these bonds are adjusted periodically  they are less sensitive to an increase in rates compared to traditional bonds  read

187617,409133,BX,Thyssenkrupp proceeds with elevator sale after CEO switch  sources,news,"By Arno Schuetze  Christoph Steitz and Tom K ckenhoff
FRANKFURT DUESSELDORF  Germany  Reuters    Thyssenkrupp  DE TKAG  will weed out some potential suitors for its elevator unit within the next two weeks  two people familiar with the matter said  as the closely watched auction gathers pace regardless of the planned ousting of CEO Guido Kerkhoff 
Bidders invited to the next round will likely include private equity groups KKR  N KKR   Blackstone  N BX   CVC  CVC UL  and Clayton Dubilier   Rice as well as strategic firms Kone  HE KNEBV  and Hitachi  T 6501   one of the sources said 
A consortium consisting of private equity firms Advent and Cinven  CINV UL  and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority  the world s third biggest sovereign wealth fund  is also expected to be included  the people said 
They are among the groups to receive so called information memorandums  which include a more detailed profile of Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology  ET   the group s most profitable division  the people said 
 It will be a larger group of bidders who will get the information packages   one of the people said  Tentative bids are due at the end of October before bidders can advance to the final round  the people said 
All parties declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment 
Thyssenkrupp shares were up 2 2  at 1258 GMT 
Kone s CEO Henrik Ehrnrooth has previously said he s keen on a deal  saying ET and Kone would be a perfect match 
The sale of ET  which analysts have valued at up to 17 billion euros   18 6 billion   will be the most pressing job for Martina Merz  who will drop her chairwoman role in favor of the CEO job to speed up the process 
Options range from a full or partial sale of the division to a combination with a peer  most likely Finland s Kone  with Thyssenkrupp ending up owning a minority in the combined entity  people familiar with the matter have said 
A full sale of ET would likely draw opposition from labor representatives  according to people familiar with the matter  a substantial hurdle as they control half of Thyssenkrupp s supervisory board 
Merz s move to become CEO  announced late on Tuesday  shows the ongoing challenges Thyssenkrupp faces in attracting external candidates for the job after the steel to submarines group suffered a drastic loss of confidence among investors 
Since activist fund Elliott announced it had taken a stake in the group in May 2018  a move which was followed by a chain of events that included the resignation of top management  Thyssenkrupp shares have fallen by 45  
It leaves Merz  who enjoys the confidence of Thyssenkrupp s two largest shareholders  Cevian and the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation  taking on one of the most challenging jobs in corporate Europe 
Her appointment  which would make her Thyssenkrupp s first female CEO  must be approved by the supervisory board at an extraordinary meeting which sources said could take place as soon as this weekend  not ruling out a delay into next week ",2019-09-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/thyssenkrupp-proceeds-with-elevator-sale-after-ceo-switch-sources-1986879,1986879

187635,409151,BX,Elliott calls for break up and bigger buyback at Germany s Scout24,news,"By Alexander H bner
FRANKFURT  Reuters    U S  activist investor Elliott  ECAL UL  has urged German classifieds group Scout24  DE G24n  to sell its car listings business and ramp up a share buyback program to boost returns to investors 
Elliott  opening a new front in its broader push to shake up corporate Germany  accused Scout24 Chief Executive Tobias Hartmann of showing a lack of ambition and urged his management team to take immediate remedial action 
The  34 billion fund  founded by Paul Singer  has invested in and called for restructuring at firms ranging from software house SAP  DE SAPG  to conglomerate Thyssenkrupp  DE TKAG   It has amassed a stake of more than 7  in Scout24 
 Should you take the decisive action needed to remove the impediments holding back Scout24  we believe the share price could rise to in excess of 65 euros per share   Elliott said in a letter published on Monday and dated July 26 
 Unfortunately  recent events have us wondering if the Scout management team shares our optimism for these high quality businesses  
Responding  Scout24 said it took note of Elliott s letter and would maintain a dialogue with all shareholders  Scout24 had announced steps to strengthen its core businesses and optimize its capital structure  it added in a statement 
The company s shares ended last week at 50 25 euros  giving it a market capitalization of 5 4 billion euros   6 billion   They traded 0 6  firmer on Monday in a weaker overall market 
ImmobilienScout24 is the real estate classifieds market leader in Germany  offering a popular smartphone app for rentals and sales  AutoScout24   present in Germany  Italy  the Netherlands  Belgium and Austria   bills itself as the largest automotive digital marketplace in the European Union 
Group revenue was up 12 5  at 532 million euros last year  while its core profit margin increased to 54 8  from 53 5  
 LACK OF AMBITION 
A source familiar with the matter said Elliott believed that autos arm AutoScout24 could fetch a sale price of up to 2 5 billion euros while ImmobilienScout24 could command a standalone valuation of 5 billion euros 
In targeting Scout24  where it is one of the largest shareholders  Elliott is focusing on a company that has faced uncertainty since a takeover bid by Blackstone  N BX  and Hellman   Friedman collapsed this year 
The public tender offer by the two private equity houses  at 46 euros a share  failed to win the support of a majority of shareholders in spite of the company s management recommending acceptance 
In its letter  Elliott accused Hartmann of  a lack of ambition that  for a listed company of Scout24 s quality and prospects  is extremely worrying   It was published a little more than a week before Scout24 publishes second quarter results on Aug  13 
Elliott also said that a 300 million euro share buyback program announced by Scout24 last month was insufficient and the company could support a far larger return of capital to investors with the use of higher debt 
STRATEGIC INTEREST
Elliott also said that two strategic investors and several sponsors had shown interest in AutoScout24  without naming them 
The source said that German publisher  Axel Springer   DE SPRGn  and used car platform AUTO1 Group  which is backed by Japan s Softbank  T 9984   had shown interest in AutoScout24 
Separately  Axel Springer said that a friendly offer by U S  private equity house KKR  N KKR  to buy out its minority shareholders had reached the necessary minimum 20  threshold to succeed 
Springer s main shareholders  Friede Springer and CEO Mathias Doepfner  are acting in concert with KKR in a move to take the publisher private and pursue growth investments away from the gaze of public equity markets 
A Springer spokeswoman said it was premature to comment on possible acquisitions  AUTO1 also declined to comment

Blackstone is offering  19 50 for all outstanding Class A shares  a 36  premium to Tuesday s close  Tallgrass said in a statement  The take private proposal is valued at about  3 billion  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Blackstone s offer is the latest example of financial players trying to privatize the slumping energy companies they control    Brookfield Business Partners LP    NYSE BBU  in May made a take private offer for   Teekay Offshore Partners LP    NYSE TOO   and ArcLight Capital Partners LLC in March agreed to acquire the portion of   American Midstream Partners LP    NYSE AMID  it didn t already own  The offers for these firms  structured as master limited partnerships  have come after the bidders took control of the general partner 
It s a good sign for other U S  pipeline companies  said Hinds Howard  a portfolio manager at CBRE Clarion Securities LLC   Valuations look a bit out of whack for some of these names the market has given up on  
Earlier this year  Blackstone and its affiliates entered into agreements to acquire Tallgrass s general partner and a 44  economic interest in the company for  3 3 billion  Tallgrass shares have fallen 40  since that announcement was made Jan  31  Blackstone declined to comment 
While an eventual take out was generally expected  the timing of the deal likely surprised investors who expected Blackstone to wait until Tallgrass got new or returning shippers to sign up for space on two of its key pipelines  Tudor Pickering Holt   Co  analysts said in a note to clients 
The shares rose 36  to  19 52 at 9 34 a m  in New York  Tallgrass s 5 5  bonds due January 2028 were among top high yield decliners Wednesday  sinking 2 875 cents on the dollar to 95 cents  according to Trace data  The debt yields 6 3

MUNICH  Reuters    Activist investors calling for strategic change at Scout24  DE G24n  have won a vote to place a representative on the German classifieds group s non executive supervisory board  ramping up pressure on management 
Christoph Brand  an executive at Swiss publisher Tamedia  S TAMN   won a board seat at the group s annual shareholder meeting in Munich  beating out rival candidate Mathias Hedlund  who had been proposed by Scout24 s management 
Brand had been nominated by London based Pelham Capital  which has built a 7 7  position in the group 
A takeover bid for the classifieds group by Hellman   Friedman and Blackstone  NYSE BX  failed earlier this year  despite management s recommendation that shareholders accept the offer

187653,409169,BX,Fannie  Freddie Soar as Hedge Funds Score Wins on Two Fronts,news," Bloomberg     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac soared the most in almost three years Monday as hedge funds that have long hoped to make a windfall on their investments in the mortgage giants got a double dose of good news 
First  shareholders won an important legal victory after markets closed Sept  6 that gave them renewed optimism of getting their hands on billions of dollars in company profits that now go to the government 
Then  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said early Monday that he will soon reach a deal that allows Fannie and Freddie to hold on to some of their earnings  so they can start rebuilding their capital buffers 
The step is considered crucial in eventually freeing the companies from federal control  which has been their status since the 2008 financial crisis  That s because Fannie and Freddie are currently restricted from holding more than  3 billion in capital apiece  far short of what they would need to weather another housing crash as private companies 
Fannie jumped 43  to  3 88 in New York trading  the biggest one day gain since November 2016  Freddie surged 43  to  3 67  also its biggest rise in almost three years 
Among investors benefiting from the gains are some of the biggest names in finance  including John Paulson  Bill Ackman s Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management and Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group Inc 
Read More  Fannie Freddie Soar as Wall Street Hails Court Win  Mnuchin Plan
Treasury is  in the process of negotiating  a plan for Fannie and Freddie to retain earnings with the Federal Finance Housing Agency  Fannie and Freddie s regulator  Mnuchin said Monday in an interview with Fox Business   We expect a near term agreement to retain their earnings   he said 
Revamping Sweep
For Fannie and Freddie to hold on to their earnings  Treasury and FHFA would have to halt or revamp a controversial policy implemented in 2012 during the Obama administration  known as the net worth sweep  that requires the companies to send virtually all their profits to the Treasury 
Hedge funds and other investors that own Fannie and Freddie shares have long fought to end the sweep through litigation  claiming it was illegal  The shareholders won a big victory Sept  6 when a panel of federal appeals court judges overturned a lower ruling that had backed the government s right to take all of the mortgage giants  profits 
Read More  Fannie Freddie Investors Fighting Profit Sweep Get Key Win
The Fifth Circuit appeals court judges  based in New Orleans  also concluded last week that the structure of the FHFA is unconstitutional  Investors still face many hurdles  as the decision just kicks the case back to the lower court  Many other federal courts have ruled against the shareholders  making it more likely that an appeal could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court if the case isn t settled before then 
Litigating Shareholders
Fannie and Freddie don t lend money to home buyers  Instead  they purchase mortgages from banks and other lenders and package them into bonds  Those securities have guarantees that protect investors from the risk of borrowers defaulting  Fannie and Freddie backstop nearly half of the U S  s  10 trillion of home loans  a process that keeps the mortgage market harming and borrowing rates low 
Fannie and Freddie were put into federal conservatorship in 2008 as the housing market cratered and were sustained by taxpayer aid  They have since started making money again and paid  115 billion more in dividends to the Treasury  through the net profit sweep  than they received in bailout funds 
Assuming that Fannie and Freddie would eventually released  hedge funds started buying their shares for pennies in the years after the crisis  Paulson   Co   Pershing Square and Blackstone Group s GSO Capital were among those who got in on the trade 
Until now  shareholders have mostly suffered setbacks in their attempts to overturn the profits sweep  Their Sept  6 win follows what also might be a watershed moment in Fannie and Freddie getting out of the government s grip  the release of a Treasury report a day earlier that outlines the Trump administration s plan to end the conservatorships 
Treasury Report
The Treasury document laid out dozens of suggested reforms to protect Fannie and Freddie from another housing crash  shrink their dominant market shares and create new competitors to the companies  Yet  it is only an initial step in what still would be a long and arduous road to freeing the companies from the government s grip 
The Treasury Department s proposal left much to be ironed out  signaling many of the suggested changes may not come until after the 2020 presidential election  And if a Democrat beats President Donald Trump next year  the overhaul would likely be scrapped all together 
Mnuchin said Monday that while he hopes to work with Congress to implement changes to Fannie and Freddie over the next three to six months  he is  perfectly comfortable  making administrative fixes if necessary  Only Congress can create competitors to Fannie and Freddie  But there is much the Trump administration can do on its own with FHFA  including ending the profit sweep 
If Fannie and Freddie start retaining earnings  it would still take them years to build up adequate capital to offset big losses  That s why most officials believe the companies will also have to raise money through other means  such as share sales  In conservatorship  the companies lack of capital hasn t been much of an issue because they have access to about  250 billion in Treasury funds 
Senate Hearing
The Treasury secretary will testify tomorrow on the administration s plan before the Senate Banking Committee  Joining Mnuchin will be FHFA Director Mark Calabria and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson 
The officials are expected to face aggressive push back for Democratic lawmakers  who are concerned that the administration s proposals will do more to help hedge funds than assist consumers in getting loans  particularly lower income buyers

187667,409183,BX,Stellar Market Performance As Macro Backdrop Signals Concern,opinion,"Do You Really Want To Be Out 
That was a comment made several times last week with respect to the markets stellar first quarter performance 

 The S P 500 is on track for its best quarter in a decade  up roughly 12 percent  And if history is any indication  the index could be set for more gains for the rest of the year 
In nine of the 10 previous times since 1950 that the S P returned more than 10 percent in the first quarter  it went on to post double digit gains for the year  according to LPL Financial s Ryan Detrick  The one exception was 1987  when the market crashed on Black Monday     CNBC


As we noted in this past weekend s newsletter 

 Friday wrapped up the first quarter of 2019  and it was the best quarterly performance since 2009  As shown in the chart below  if you bought the bottom  you are  killing it   



 Most likely  you didn t  
Despite all of the media  hoopla  about the rally  the reality is that for most  they are simply getting back to even over the last year  



 That is  assuming you didn t  sell the bottom  in December  which by looking at allocation changes  certainly appears to be the case for many  


So  back to our question  why would you want to be out of the market 
Here is the problem with the Detrick s analysis above 

1986   Reagan passes massive tax reform which boost stocks into 1987 
1987   The market crashes 
1991   The market rallies sharply coming out of recession 
1998   After Long Term Capital Management is bailed out  and the  Asian Contagion  is resolved stocks rally as the  Dot com  bubble inflates  2 year later  investors were wishing they hadn t bought in 
2012   QE from the Fed boost stocks early in the year and Operation Twist supports asset prices through the end of the year  Balance sheet continues to expand with interest rates at ZERO 
2013   In the wake of the  Fiscal Cliff  the Fed launches QE 3 to offset the risk of a government contraction in spending which turns out not to be a problem  Stocks soar on a flood of liquidity 

As I have notated on the chart below  it is important to compare the context behind historical market actions rather than just making a blanket assumption 

Case in point was the huge January rally in 2018  Headlines rang out that the January  boom  pointed to bigger gains through the rest of the year  After all   so goes January  so goes the year  
The year finished lower by over 4  
So  basing investment decisions solely on previous price action without the relevant context and can lead to poor outcomes 
While it is certainly hopeful that a strong first quarter will lead to further gains for the rest of the year  the current macro backdrop is not nearly as supportive as it was previously 

Rates are no longer zero 
Liquidity is still being extracted through September and will stabilize  not increase 
Economic growth is no longer strengthening 
Confidence has peaked
Geopolitical tensions are rising
Earnings growth has peaked 
Valuations are no longer reasonable and rising  but excessively valued 
Inflation and interest rates are no longer falling 

Well  you get the idea 
Furthermore  leading economic indicators are also signaling some concern  The chart below shows the 3 month average percentage change relative to GDP  

Yes  this current test of the  recession  warning line could turn out to be another 2012 or 2015 16 event  but as noted above  the Fed is no longer directly engaged in supplying liquidity and the Fed Funds rate is no longer zero 
Of course  assuming there is  no recession in sight  is historically what has preceded previous recessions  Coincidently  it is also the subject of a recent Bloomberg article 

 In 1966  four years before securing the Nobel Prize for economics  Paul Samuelson quipped that declines in U S  stock prices had correctly predicted nine of the last five American recessions  His profession would kill for such accuracy     Simon Kennedy   Peter Coy  Bloomberg

While there are many suggesting that based on current economic data there is  no recession  in sight  therein lies the risk as noted previously 

 The problem with making an assessment about the state of the economy today  based on current data points  is that these numbers are  best guesses  about the economy currently  However  economic data is subject to substantive negative revisions in the future as actual data is collected and adjusted over the next 12 months and 3 years  Consider for a minute that in January 2008 Chairman Bernanke stated 
 The Federal Reserve is not currently forecasting a recession  
In hindsight  the NBER called an official recession that began in December of 2007  

For investors  while the first quarter of the year was a massively strong reflex rally from the lows  the risk of expecting asset prices to continue to rise unabated may prove disappointing  This is particularly the case as the factors which drove that first quarter performance are unlikely to repeat in the months ahead 
In December there was 

Deeply negative sentiment of the markets
Asset prices were stretched to the downside
The Fed surprised the markets with a very dovish reversal
The White House surprised the markets with statements a  Trade Deal  was near 
Oil prices had declined to lows  were oversold  and prime for a rally 

Today 

The markets are no longer fearful as shown our RIA PRO Technical Index
Asset prices are now stretched back to the upside
Economic data has bounced but remains weak
The Fed has more room to disappoint than not with future announcements  While many are expecting a rate ease later this year  such is unlikely to happen before data materially worsens 
There has been no  trade deal  completion
Oil prices are overbought and extended to the upside 


This was also the subject of a WSJ article by Ira Iosebashvili on Monday 

 Investors hoping for stocks  rally to keep up the first quarter s pace may be headed for a disappointment  Big climbs in the S P 500 have tended to slow or even reverse in the three months following a first quarter rally of 10  or more  according to Dow Jones Market Data  



 Often  the gains pause as investors grow wary that prices have risen too high  or concerned that the expectations driving the rally won t pan out  Some investors tend to lock in profits after a particularly good quarter  pushing markets lower 
 Earnings are another factor that could pressure stocks  Some investors are worried that a slowing U S  economy is already weighing on corporate bottom lines and clouding the case for share prices to keep rising  S P 500 companies are expected to report a nearly 4  drop in first quarter earnings from a year earlier  according to FactSet  

 But if I did get out now  I might miss some of the upside  
Such is really a personal choice  but as I stated earlier this year  there is a very high probability the bulk of the gains for this year have already been made 
However  the emotions of  greed  and  fear  are extremely powerful forces which consistently lead to poor outcomes over longer term periods  As Michael Lebowitz and I discussed in our VideoCast last week  there is a time to be a contrarian and Howard Marks  the head of Oaktree Capital Management  just recently sold his entire firm  Howard is the ultimate contrarian investor and the message should not be readily dismissed 
This was the same message Sam Zell sent when he sold EQ Office to Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group in 2006 for  36 billion in the largest leveraged buyout in history at the time  Or  just as timely was when Bobby Shackouls  the CEO of Burlington Resources  sold to Conoco Phillips  Both occurred just prior to the  Financial Crisis  and the crash in oil prices 
Were they just lucky  or did they see something the rest of us didn t  
There was  no recession in sight  at the time  The economy was growing  stock market prices were rising  and it was a  Goldilocks economy   
But to this point was David Rosenberg s missive yesterday which stated quite elegantly 

 I have to say  that from a contrarian perspective  when an article like  Investors Rush To Buy Up Stocks  appears on the very front page of the Wall Street Journal  you know a whole lot of good news is in the price  It conjures up the image of two of Bob Farrell s famous Ten Market Rules to Remember   5   the public buys the most at the top and the least at the bottom  and  9   when all the experts agree something else is going to happen  

While hindsight is pretty clear about what happens given the current environment of weak economic and profit growth  combined with high valuations  and deteriorating technical underpinnings  the ultimate outcome could take months to develop 
And because a warning doesn t immediately translate into a negative consequence  it is quickly dismissed  It is akin to constantly running red lights and never getting into an accident  We begin to think we are skilled at running red lights  rather than just being lucky  Eventually  the luck will run out 
So do you want to be out  Most will say  no   
Just for the record  we aren t  out  either 
But if you are waiting for someone to tell you the recession has officially started  it really won t matter much anyway ",2019-04-02,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/technically-speaking-do-you-really-want-to-be-out-200402992,200402992

187669,409185,BX,Can Tradeweb Sustain Its Success ,opinion,"After going public last Wednesday  Tradeweb Markets  NASDAQ TW  has been on a roll  Bloomberg reported one week ago that Tradeweb had managed to raise  1 1 billion by selling 40 million shares at  27 apiece  Tradeweb then quickly jumped to over  34 on Thursday  and a week later closed trading this Wednesday at  40 26 
There are plenty of reasons why investors are so excited about Tradeweb  from its strong financial numbers to investor interest in electronic trading  But while Tradeweb is undisputedly a buy at  27  what about at  40  Here are some of the most important facts about this company and why investors are so heavily considering it 
Power Of Trading
Tradeweb is an electronic trading platform for financial markets which was founded in 1996  Its clients include hedge funds  insurance companies  and other large financial institutions Tradeweb helps facilitate trading across four asset classes  rates  credit  money markets  and equities  According to its SEC report  its 2018 trading volume was  over  549 billion across more than 40 products  
Controlling a financial trading platform is highly profitable  and Tradeweb is the rare IPO which can report both solid revenue growth and profitability  Net revenue in 2018 was  657 million  up from  504 million in 2017 and a growth of 30   Furthermore  Tradeweb recorded a net income of  159 million in 2018 compared to  83 million in 2017  Tradeweb also reports positive cash flow as well as  1 3 billion in total assets up against  283 million in total liabilities 
Tradeweb is thus already in a strong position  and it has plenty of opportunities for further growth  Financial institutions are more interested in electronic trading which allows for faster  transparent trades  and Tradeweb s long history and current success places it in a position to keep innovating  Tradeweb will likely be looking at targets for future M A  such as its 2016 acquisition of CodeStreet 
Potential Challenges
Tradeweb is a successful company with good financial numbers and growth prospects  and at its IPO price was a definite buy  But at this elevated price  investors have to start asking additional questions and acknowledge some of this company s downsides 
The first concern is the structure of this IPO  Unfortunately  Tradeweb is going with the multiple class share model which is all too common with many IPOs these days  In fact  Tradeweb has four classes of shares  with Classes B and D having 10 votes while Classes A and C have one  Tradeweb s IPO consisted of Class A shares  Tradeweb s owner Refinitiv and its owner Blackstone  NYSE BX  will thus retain total control of the company  Some investors may appreciate that Refinitiv will be staying to deliver a guiding hand  but this multiple class share model is not good for ordinary investors in general 
Furthermore  is Tradeweb overvalued at its current price  With a market cap of 8 9 billion at its new share price  Tradeweb is trading at about 38 times 2019 earnings estimates  Some analysts like Jim Cramer argue that would be a bargain  and compare Tradeweb to fellow electronic trading platform MarketAxess Holdings  NASDAQ MKTX   which has a P E ratio of 56  It should be pointed out that MarketAxess offers better margins  but it does show that Tradeweb does have further room to keep growing 
There are other risk factors as well  such as concerns about a U S  economic slowdown on the horizon  competition from other electronic platforms like MarketAxess  and the threat of hacking or other technological issues  Still  these are relatively minor compared to other IPOs  and Tradeweb does not appear to be significantly overvalued even at its higher price 
Wait For Now
Buying Tradeweb right now is not a bad move  as there is reason to believe that the company can continue to grow over the long term  But it is not uncommon to see large IPOs perform well out of the gate  only to later fade once the hype wears off 
Investors will be better off avoiding Tradeweb for a few months or until the lock up period expires as there is a solid choice that the company s stock will fall then  Once the price becomes more reasonable  then I would strongly recommend picking this stock up for the long term  Whatever the concerns about Tradeweb s valuation and initial instability with IPOs  this is a company with significant potential ",2019-04-15,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-tradeweb-sustain-its-success-200406902,200406902
187670,409186,BX,Blackstone Mortgage Trust  BXMT  Reports Next Week  What Awaits ,opinion,"Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This real estate finance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  100 20 million  up 17 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Blackstone Mortgage 
For Blackstone Mortgage  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Blackstone Mortgage will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Blackstone Mortgage would post earnings of  0 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 69  delivering a surprise of  4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Blackstone Mortgage doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/blackstone-mortgage-trust-bxmt-reports-next-week-what-awaits-200407316,200407316

187679,409195,BX,Carlyle to give shareholders a vote in switch to corporation,news,"By Chibuike Oguh
 Reuters     Carlyle Group  LP  O CG  emulated its peers on Wednesday with plans to convert from a publicly traded partnership into a corporation  and went one step further by announcing it will become the first U S  private equity firm to hold shareholder votes 
The corporate governance changes will have limited impact on how the Washington  D C  based firm runs its affairs  given that it will continue to be controlled by its founders and employees for the foreseeable future  Insiders own 66  of Carlyle  and the vast majority of them have committed to voting their shares as a block for up to five years  the firm said 
Nonetheless  holding annual meetings for shareholders to cast votes represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the secretive  tightly knit private equity industry 
The move could end up boosting Carlyle s valuation  because it will allow its inclusion in indices that exclude publicly traded partnerships  Carlyle may also be included in more indices than its peers  such as the Russell and the S P  because it will be the first publicly traded private equity firm to abolish its dual class shares 
Earlier this month  Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said his firm does not plan to convert its dual class share structure into one common class stock 
 We are going to stick with our governance strategy and work hopefully to convince these indices it makes sense to include us   Gray told analysts on a conference call on July 18 
Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors  but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees 
Under the so called C Corp structure  Carlyle will pay corporate taxes on all its revenue  in exchange for enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock 
The additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U S  corporate tax rate was lowered effective last year to 21  from 35   Carlyle s peers Blackstone Group Inc  N BX   KKR   Co Inc  N KKR  and Apollo Global Management LLC  N APO  have already opted to switch to a C Corp 
  The change  improves our trading liquidity  makes us more attractive to new investors  provides a fixed dividend that enables improved capital allocation and offers an attractive yield  and enhances shareholder alignment under a new one share one vote governance model   Carlyle Co CEOs Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement 
Carlyle said its effective cash tax rate on its distributable earnings was expected to be in the single digit percentage range in 2020  and then increase to the mid to high teens before reaching the low 20s in five years 
Under the new structure  Carlyle s founders  David Rubenstein  Bill Conway and Dan D Aniello  will each have the right to nominate a subset of the firm s directors  subject to approval by a full shareholder vote 
EARNINGS BEAT ESTIMATES
Carlyle also said its second quarter pretax distributable earnings   the cash available for paying dividends   totaled  213 4 million  up from  114 5 million a year earlier 
The buyout firm said post tax distributable earnings per share rose to 57 cents  from 29 cents posted a year earlier  beating the average analyst forecast of 37 cents  according to data compiled by Refinitiv 
Part of the gains were driven by the reversal of a legal setback  In February 2018  the Paris administrative court of appeals overturned a lower court ruling that forced a Carlyle subsidiary into paying  130 million in taxes on the 2007 sale of the  Imprimerie Nationale   the official headquarters of the French printing works  back to the French state for  466 million  375 million euros  
Carlyle said on Wednesday it received a  72 million gain because of the  final resolution  of the tax dispute 
Carlyle said its private equity funds appreciated 1  in the quarter  compared with a 0 7  appreciation for Blackstone s private equity portfolio and 6 4  appreciation for KKR s private equity portfolio 
Under generally accepted accounting principles  Carlyle reported net income per share on a diluted basis of  1 23 for the quarter  up 120  from a year earlier  That outperformed Blackstone and KKR  which recorded a 59  and 25  drop respectively 
Carlyle declared a quarterly dividend of 43 cents per share  It said it would introduce a fixed annual dividend of  1 per share  paid quarterly ",2019-07-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/carlyle-to-give-shareholders-a-vote-in-switch-to-corporation-1941104,1941104
187680,409196,BX,Thomson Reuters raises outlook  grows fastest since financial crisis,news,"By Georgina Prodhan and Matt Scuffham
LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    Thomson Reuters Corp raised its sales and core profit outlook for 2019 and 2020 on Thursday after reporting 4  organic revenue growth in the second quarter  which it said was its best since 2008 and ahead of its expectations 
Growth was driven by recurring revenues at all three of its biggest units since the news and information provider sold a majority in its Financial and Risk business  now known as Refinitiv  to Blackstone  NYSE BX  last year   Legal  Corporates and Tax   Accounting 
The company said that it and Blackstone had agreed to sell Refinitiv  which provides data and news to financial customers  to London Stock Exchange in a  27 billion all share deal 
Thomson Reuters will hold a 15 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange on completion of the deal  which is expected in the second half of 2020  the companies said  A Thomson Reuters representative will also sit on the LSE board 
Under the agreement  Thomson Reuters cannot sell its LSE stake for two years following completion of the deal  It can sell a third of its shares in each of the third and fourth years after completion  and the rest thereafter 
Chief Executive Officer Jim Smith told Reuters the company will decide whether to sell its shares as the lock up expires 
 Over the course of time  we would likely see that investment shifted behind our core businesses   he said 
Smith said the deal would  create a great deal of value  for Thomson Reuters shareholders 
A  10 billion share buyback and the launch of new products following the Blackstone deal have propelled Thomson Reuters stock 85 percent higher since May last year  and the shares hit an all time high of C 90 04 this week 
The company said it expects 2019 and 2020 revenue growth and adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  to each be at the upper end of the guidance ranges previously provided 
Smith said the launch of legal research product Westlaw Edge last year had been a key driver of growth in the company s legal division  its biggest business 
 It s been a very  very solid performer for us and continues to gain a lot of traction   he said 
The parent of Reuters News had forecast 2019 revenue growth of 7  to 8 5  before the effect of currency  and growth of about half that pace in 2020 
For EBITDA  earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization   Thomson Reuters had forecast  1 4  1 5 billion for 2019  up from  1 4 billion in 2018  and an EBITDA margin of 30 31 percent for 2020 
Thomson Reuters set aside  2 billion of the  17 billion proceeds from last year s Blackstone deal for acquisitions  The company has made three acquisitions so far and has about half of the funds left for more deals  Smith said in an interview 
 We see a lot of opportunity there and we re looking at a lot of things   Smith said   We re considering a number of further options but one can never predict the timing of M A  
In the second quarter  revenue rose to  1 42 billion from  1 31 billion a year ago as Thomson Reuters gained from payments it received from Refinitiv for its news service  Adjusted earnings per share of 29 cents were ahead of analyst estimates of 18 cents  according to IBES from Refinitiv ",2019-08-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/thomson-reuters-sales-rise-9-raises-outlook-1941912,1941912

187695,409211,BX,Blackstone Mortgage Trust  BXMT  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This real estate finance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 5  
Revenues are expected to be  97 41 million  up 21 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Blackstone Mortgage 
For Blackstone Mortgage  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 26  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Blackstone Mortgage will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Blackstone Mortgage would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  11 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Blackstone Mortgage doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/blackstone-mortgage-trust-bxmt-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200383793,200383793
187696,409212,BX,Energy Report  Headlines Driving Oil Markets,opinion,"Oil prices were already under a bit of pressure on news that a Libyan General seized Libya s largest oil field and weak economic projections out of Europe but fell out of bed after an interview with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on Varney and Company on the Fox Business Network  Stuart Varney asked Kudlow whether he had any news on a potential meeting between China s Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump  the answer sent stocks falling and oil along with it  Kudlow told Varney that looking down the road that a meeting could take place and that the President was optimistic about a deal  But we ve got a pretty sizable distance to go here   Kudlow went on  To quote a colleague of mine    we have miles to go before we sleep    He shook up the market by saying they had pretty sizable distance before reaching an agreement  Kudlow also confirmed that U S  beef was far superior to Chinese beef 
Stuart Varney trying to find out how close they were to a deal asked whether  they re putting it down on paper   Kudlow said U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s next trip to Beijing still may not result in some of the agreement even being drafted   When those two gentlemen  they are very experienced folks  when they get there  we ll see  At the moment we have not had the papering of any of these discussions  So  as I say  they re going to be probing and continuing conversations  and that the talks had a good vibe to them  
So  the trade freaked out thinking that the optimism about a trade deal might be all for naught  There were also reports that President Trump said he did not plan to meet President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline for a deal when additional U S  tariffs on Chinese imports are scheduled to be imposed on March 2  Yet if you really have followed this up and down story on U S  China trade  this is par for the course  President Trump and Larry Kudlow are putting on the full court press to keep the pressure on the Chinese  so they come to some kind of deal  And it is not just the Trump Administration that is putting the pressure on but business leaders as well 
The Wall Street Journal reports that  From Stephen Schwarzman to Hank Paulson  top business figures are worried about the consequences of failure in talks before a March deadline   The Journal writes in a must read that  Among those pushing for a deal is Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman  who has been phoning Mr  Trump and his senior advisers to warn that the failure to strike a deal will undermine the economy and oil markets  which are anticipating an end to U S  China economic hostilities  Uncertainty about China is weighing on business investment and consumer confidence  Mr  Schwarzman and others are arguing  people familiar with the conversations say  At the same time  Mr  Schwarzman and other business leaders  including former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson  are urging senior Chinese officials to make enough concessions to U S  negotiators to allow Mr  Trump to claim a victory  That includes agreeing to a way the U S  can enforce the deal should China fall short of its commitments  
Rig count and the reverse head and shoulders is the other things to talk about in this market  Oil looks to be testing the bottom end of the right shoulder  and for all of you Elliot Wave fans out there  this may be the bottom of the wave that you all have been waiting for  Yet really  in oil  we are being driven by headlines that seem to have more sway before we begin the long journey into seasonal maintenance  Concerns about demand and rising U S  production are bearish factors 
Bullish factors for oil are OPEC cuts as well as the ongoing problems in Venezuela  Oil Price reports that  France s oil and gas major Total has pulled out all its personnel from Venezuela following the U S  sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA  which also blocked Total s accounts in the Latin American country   CEO Patrick Pouyann  said on Thursday  Total s accounts have been blocked due to U S  decisions  AFP quoted Pouyann  as saying at the presentation of the group s 2018 financials   The other practical problem is that  given the sanctions  we should no longer manage Venezuela from the United States    but from Europe   the manager said  noting that Total  of course  will be complying with the U S  sanctions and has put its Venezuelan operations in a  hibernation mode   As of 2017  Total had around 50 employees in Venezuela  according to the group s website  The French group first began exploration in Venezuela back in 1980 and has been active in the exploration and production of extra heavy crude oil and natural gas in the Latin American country 
I guess it was not cold enough to get a bullish natural gas number because of record U S  production  Maybe if we hit 100 below  The Energy Information Administration reported that working gas in storage fell 237 Bcf from the previous week  Stocks were 135 Bcf less than last year currently and 415 Bcf below the five year average of 2 375 Bcf  At 1 960 Bcf  the total working gas is within the five year historical range ",2019-02-10,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-200386023,200386023

187701,409217,BX,Exclusive  Sweden s EQT targets Asia Pacific as IPO decision looms,news,"By Esha Vaish and Pamela Barbaglia
STOCKHOLM LONDON  Reuters    High above Stockholm s skyline  Sweden s EQT Partners is plotting the next chapter in its rapid rise from a Nordic focused investor to the world s seventh biggest buyout firm  with a focus on growth in the Asia Pacific region 
With 40 billion euros   45 billion  under management  EQT has quietly transformed itself since its launch in 1994 from an investment arm for Sweden s influential Wallenberg family into Europe s second largest private equity  PE  fund behind Britain s CVC 
EQT raised a record 9 billion euros in March for its fourth infrastructure fund and in May paid  8 2 billion for U S  fiber network firm Zayo  N ZAYO  and  10 billion for Nestle s  S NESN  skincare unit  its largest deal to date 
While much of EQT s growth outside of the Nordics has come from buying and selling companies in Germany and Switzerland  its management is now turning east for expansion 
 Asia offers a great opportunity for growth and we intend to increase our presence there   Chief Executive Christian Sinding told Reuters at EQT s new headquarters 
The 46 year old Norwegian  dressed in shirt and jeans rather than formal business attire  stressed that the fund wanted to grow in areas where it was still small rather than expanding in new asset classes 
Sinding said EQT may pursue an initial public offering  IPO  as part of a strategic review which was announced last year  A decision on whether to proceed would be made after the summer 
 In order to future proof EQT and continue our growth  we are considering taking this a step further by building EQT s own balance sheet   Sinding told Reuters 
And while economic uncertainty means tougher times might lie ahead  Sinding   who has worked at EQT for 21 years and has led its equity investment advisory team since 2011   sees bigger deals and larger funds as a natural evolution 
 We think a lot about the recession  EQT pays high multiples for assets  but we re okay with that because it s about buying really good companies and making them better   he added 
Sources familiar with the Nestle deal said EQT paid close to 20 times EBITDA due to fierce competition from other investors  A report by Bain   Co says the average multiple for European and U S  buyout deals is around 11 times across all sectors 
Asia Pacific represents around 16  of EQT s portfolio and former CEO Thomas von Koch  now its deputy managing partner  is set to move to Hong Kong to back the growth strategy for the region  which includes setting up an office in Australia 
The Nordic region dominates EQT s holdings with 33  of its invested capital at the end of 2018  with the rest of Europe accounting for 25   the Americas 20  and the rest of the world the remainder 
Sinding also wants to invest in disruptive but not yet profitable start ups in Europe  in a quest to find the next Spotify  N SPOT  or Klarna  as well as in profitable private firms in need of capital such as Banking Circle 
 We have a ventures fund and great buy out funds but there is an interesting pocket in between   he said

 MOST REPUTABLE 
While U S  giants Blackstone  N BX   KKR and Carlyle  O CG  have gone public and become self styled alternative asset managers  only a handful of PE funds are listed in Europe 
Sinding ruled out any interest in diversifying EQT away from its core business of companies  infrastructure and credit 
 We stick to investments that can add real value  Our aim is not to be the biggest private equity fund but rather the most reputable   he said 
Unlike its biggest American and European competitors  EQT has flat organizational and fee structures  both staples of Nordic consensus building business models  as well as an industrial approach where target firms are chosen because of their business model 
Pressure to change EQT s set up and become a publicly traded company is partly driven by  Investor  AB  ST INVEb   the Wallenberg investment vehicle  looking to cut its exposure to EQT  bankers close to the IPO have said 
Investor AB  which has 21 5 billion Swedish crowns invested in EQT through a 23  stake in EQT AB and investments in most of its funds  has annually made a 30  return and cash flows of 1 billion crowns 1 5 billion from the investments over 25 years 
Sources said a dual listing in Stockholm and Zurich  which is home to EQT s second headquarters  is a possibility as the firm seeks to model itself after Zurich listed  Partners Group   S PGHN   which trades at 23 8 times earnings and has outperformed U S  rivals in the last five years 
 It is the only IPO in Sweden for which local investors are getting out of bed   a Stockholm based banker said ",2019-07-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-swedens-eqt-targets-asia-pacific-as-ipo-decision-looms-1914789,1914789
187702,409218,BX,Exclusive  North Sea oil producer Siccar Point eyes sale   sources,news,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON  Reuters    Private equity backed oil and gas producer Siccar Point is testing the waters for its potential sale later this year  hoping to attract interest for its mostly untapped North Sea resources  industry and banking sources said 
Siccar Point has in recent days invited over a dozen companies to review data on its Corona Ridge area in the west of Shetlands area with the aim of selling down part of its 70  stake in the Cambo field  according to sources close to the process 
The company however hopes that the interest in Cambo will draw offers for its entire portfolio  which includes stakes in a number of major North Sea projects at various stages of development  the sources said 
The projects include stakes in the Mariner field which is operated by Norway s Equinor  OL EQNR  and is expected to start production later this year as well as Rosebank  a large project also operated by Equinor 
Siccar Point  headed by Jonathan Roger  a former  Centrica   LON CNA  executive  and backed by private equity firm Blue Water Energy and Blackstone  N BX   is valued at over  2 billion  according to consultancy WoodMackenzie and one of the sources 
Any decision on a sale of Cambo or Siccar Point as a whole will take place later this year  one of the sources said 
 A Cambo farm down might result in a broader transaction for the company   one of the sources said 
Investment bank Rothschild and Lambert Energy Advisory are running the process for Siccar Point  according to the sources 
Siccar Point did not respond to a request for comment  A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment  Blue Water  Lambert and Rothschild were not immediately available 
Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  last year acquired a 30  stake in the Cambo field which Siccar Point aims to develop after successful well tests in August 2018 
The field holds around 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas available for development  according to the company s 2018 financial statement 
Siccar Point is one of several new private equity back oil companies in the North Sea  It emerged as a major player following the  1 billion acquisition of Austrian oil and gas company OMV s  VI OMVV  UK business in November 2016 
Many of the companies  such as private equity backed Chrysaor and Neptune  are aiming for future stock market floatations  but uncertainty over the oil price outlook has dampened investor appetite 
Siccar Point had near 479 million barrels of oil equivalent in discovered reserves by the end of 2018  the financial statement said  Its output last year averaged 11 152 barrels of oil equivalent per day and group profit was  161 million 
Last year it sought buyers for its 20  stake in Rosebank  but the sale process was put on hold after the field s operator  Chevron   NYSE CVX  sold its stake to Equinor

187704,409220,BX,Blackstone reports better than expected second quarter distributable earnings,news,"By Chibuike Oguh
 Reuters    Blackstone Group Inc  N BX   the world s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate  said on Thursday its distributable earnings in the second quarter rose 1  year on year  more than most analysts expected 
Higher earnings from the sale of assets in Blackstone s private equity  credit and fund of hedge funds divisions was almost offset by a plunge in proceeds from divestments in its real estate unit 
However  Blackstone s distributable earnings of 57 cents per share was higher than the 49 cents that analysts forecast on average  according to data compiled by Refinitiv 
The New York based firm reported net income per share on a diluted basis of 45 cents  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   down 59  from a year ago 
Investors chose to focus on the better than expected distributable earnings  which show the cash available for paying dividends  Blackstone shares jumped 2 5  to 46 39 in premarket trading in New York 
 We view this earnings release as very positive  Blackstone reported  sales of assets  of  10 6 billion  which was above our estimate of  8 9 billion and higher quarter over quarter   Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research note 
Blackstone said its assets under management rose to a record  545 5 billion in the three months through June  from  511 8 billion in the prior quarter  A key driver of fundraising was the  8 billion initial amount raised for Blackstone s sixth real estate European opportunistic fund  and another  7 billion raised for infrastructure investments 
The firm said it would pay a second quarter distribution of 48 cents per share 
Blackstone said the value of its private equity portfolio appreciated by 0 7   compared to a 3 8  rise in the benchmark S P 500 stock index  SXP   Opportunistic funds and core real estate funds appreciated 4 4  and 0 8  in the quarter  respectively 
Stock market swings impact private equity firms because they often have large public market holdings in investments that they are in the process of exiting  Public markets are also used as a measuring stick when valuing private investments 
 These results reflect the enormous confidence our firm has earned with global investors through decades of delivering strong performance and innovation   Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Schwarzman said in a statement 
This was Blackstone s first earnings report since officially converting from a partnership to a corporation on July 1  a move designed to boost its share price 




Since making the announcement in April  Blackstone s stock has jumped by around 25   outperforming the broader market ",2019-07-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackstone-reports-betterthanexpected-secondquarter-distributable-earnings-1927615,1927615

187714,409230,BX,4 Cyclical Funds To Benefit From A Stock Market Rebound,opinion,The volatility in the U S  stock market might have been a result of misguided and negative investor sentiment  asset management firm Blackstone  NYSE BX  noted earlier this week  per a CNBC report U S  equities gained on the Jan 7 trading session  keeping up with Friday s surge  as the three major indexes fared well  Higher than expected December job additions induced positivity in equity markets  The optimistic investor sentiment was also a result of expectations of an affirmative U S  China trade deal this week and a possible oil price surge Given the optimism  it might be a good idea to invest in a few cyclical funds at present to benefit from a probable stock market rebound Blackstone Expects S P 500 to Step Up in 2019Blackstone s investment strategist Joseph Zidle is hopeful of stocks rebounding in 2019  noting that it just isn t a recessionary environment  Blackstone is anticipating a 15  rise in S P 500 in 2019  The three major Wall Street indexes have gained since the beginning of this year Therefore  Zidle is advising investors to invest in cyclical sectors such as technology  materials  energy and industrials since a cyclical equity s price performance is affected by the trends in financial markets  These stocks tend to do well during a booming economy and cut back during a downturn Favorable Trade Pact Could Ease Wall Street The need for the United States and China to find middle ground has intensified  given the distressing effect of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy and American companies alike  Apple s price performance last week gives an insight into the operations of American giants being affected by China s economic slowdown Washington Beijing talks that began on Jan 7 have witnessed willingness on both sides for a resolution to the ongoing trade dispute  U S  put about  250 billion worth of Chinese goods under the tariff umbrella as Beijing retaliated with its own  The trade war is going to get resolved  We think we see a deal in the first quarter  China and the U S  have an incentive to get a deal done   Zidle said  An affirmative solution to the trade war could easily boost the equity market Impressive December Job AdditionsThe surge in nonfarm payrolls for December 2018 ended on a positive note  as the United States added 312 000 new jobs against consensus estimate of 183 000 new jobs  Although unemployment rate rose to 3 9   wages increased 3 2  on an annualized basis and 0 4  from November 2018 The uptick in the number of new jobs  by the way  made a mockery of recession concerns  which was echoed in the stock market rally There Might be an Oil Rally AheadOPEC s decision to slash oil production by 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  from January could easily rally oil prices  Saudi Arabia has cut its production to 10 2 million barrels a day this month with an aim to lift crude oil price In addition  Saudi Arabia also initiated supply cuts to the United States marked by 60  fall in volume bound for U S  between November and December to a little over 350 000 bpd  a Bloomberg report cited  The impact of the declined supply could be felt in U S  by mid February  when Saudi oil exports to U S  might fall to its lowest in 3 decades  per the data by Department of Energy  I think oil prices find a bottom  and I don t think the conditions are nearly as dire as people are making them out to be   Zidle said  A probable rise in crude oil prices  thus  will help energy shares gain traction   4 Mutual Funds to BuyGiven the

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for BX  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook

187730,409246,BX,StockBeat  Activists Chalk up Another Win With Merlin Buyout,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Another day  another victory for activist U S  investors in Europe 
Merlin Entertainments  LON MERL   the U K  based theme park operator famous for its Legoland parks and various London tourist attractions  has agreed to sell itself to a consortium including Blackstone Group  NYSE BX  and the owners of Danish toymaker Lego for some 4 77 billion pounds   6 06 billion   or 5 9 billion pounds including debt 
That s a smart turnaround for the ValueAct hedge fund  which built a 9 3  stake earlier in the year and pressured Merlin to find a private buyer  saying that the shares were worth 30  more than the market thought  As it is  the purchase price is 36 8  above where it was just over a month ago  the day before ValueAct made its splash 
The move comes a day after Elliott Management triggered a sharp rally in German chemicals group Bayer  DE BAYGN  by taking a  1 1 billion stake in it 
Merlin s shares have languished over the last 18 months  as it has plowed almost all of its cash into expansion  notably through the construction of Peppa Pig theme parks in the U S  and  latterly  China  Weak consumer sentiment in the U K  and a high profile accident at one of its theme parks haven t helped either 
Merlin was by far the top performer in London after early trading Friday  rising 14  to a 21 month high while the FTSE 100 index rose 0 2   Other indexes were broadly higher after a raft of price data from across the euro zone gave no clear picture of a rise in inflation  strengthening the case for stimulus from the European Central Bank 
The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 0 75 points  or 0 2  to 382 96  although it was still on course to end the week 0 5  lower  Switzerland s SMI stood out as the lone loser on the day  after the EU decided to restrict EU based investors  access to the Swiss exchange in a broader dispute over access to each other s markets 
Elsewhere  Adidas  DE ADSGN  shares haven t been dismayed by a rare earnings miss from rival  Nike   NYSE NKE   which the U S  company reported after the bell on Thursday  Adidas shares were up 2 3  
And Traton  DE 8TRA   Volkswagen s truck unit  made an underwhelming start to life as a public company  Its shares slipped over 1  after VW priced the IPO at 27 euros a share  As previously noted  the proceeds of the sale are less important to VW than the need to give its various units more independence and freedom to respond to the differing challenges that they face  Having initially eyed selling a stake of as much as 25   the German group ended up scaling the placement down to a mere 11 5  
 Correction  the original version of this article incorrectly stated that a 2015 crash at one of Merlin s parks had involved fatalities  ",2019-06-28,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-activists-chalk-up-another-win-with-merlin-buyout-1910388,1910388

187737,409253,BX,Wall Street  Pros  Finally Seeing Upcoming Global Earnings Recession,opinion,"At the beginning of October   I wrote the piece  I Now See an 85  Chance of a Global Earnings Recession by Late 2019  
In it   I described using a Bayesian formula to hypothesize that there s a very high  chance value  for a worldwide earnings recession by late Summer next year 
I ve been adding information to my formula ever since May 2018  And the last time I checked   there s an 85  chance of an earnings recession happening 
Please read the linked article above to get caught up  It s brief and extremely worthwhile   giving significant pretext for what I m about to write     
Yesterday  a Yahoo Finance headline article read the following     
Wall Street Pros Warn We May Be Experiencing  Peak Earnings    you can read it here  
The article argues that the recent global stock market bloodbath is happening because corporations hit  peak earnings  growth  It goes on listing big Wall Street bankers and strategists expecting corporate earnings to further weaken 
And soon  equity prices down with it     
 The market is pricing in the  earnings growth  slowdown now   Blackstone  NYSE BX  vice chairman Byron Wien tells Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance  
So   it looks like the mainstream s finally catching on to the idea of an upcoming global earnings recession 
We ve already seen how over 75   or three fourths  of S P 500 companies have projected negative earnings going forward     

And even before corporations issued these estimates   there were other troubling signals 
Such as     
Bank of America Merrill Lynch highlighted the correlation between world trade and corporate earnings 
Since the year 2000  they ve closely mirrored each other  And as world trade sharply dropped   earnings will follow 

I also wrote back in July that according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch   much of the  smart  institutional money saw global profits dropping 


Because of all this  plus other indicators I ve highlighted   we saw a very high  chance value  that a global earnings recession was only a year away 
But none of this should come as a surprise     
After 2008   the Federal Reserve s ZIRP  zero interest rate policy  made corporate earnings look better than they really were 
How  Well there s a few reasons     
First   by lowering the cost of interest  companies could keep more of their earnings  since they pay less towards interest  
Second   we ve also seen on the valuation side how lower rates affect Wall Street s favorite tool   the Discounted Cash Flow  DCF  model  Lower interest rates make the  discount rate  smaller   which artificially inflate future cash flow estimates 
Third   and most importantly   corporations have gorged on cheap debt to buy their own shares back  Making earnings per share look higher 

But now that rates are rising   it will negatively affect corporate earnings 
Not to mention there are some serious issues facing corporations in 2019     
 Real  interest rates are rising  Trade tariffs  especially between the U S  and China  continue taking effect  And Trump s Tax Cuts are wearing off 
There s also a host of other serious problems going on in the global economy   such as declining world trade volumes     
Because of these reasons   the market s now starting to doubt the growth in global earnings 
As many readers know   I ve been bearish on the global earnings outlook for many months now  Starting in early May 
And I expect the mainstream to continue catching on about declining corporate profits 
As for my current hypothesis  I still see an 85  chance of a global earnings recession by late Summer 2019 
Even if you don t agree with my chance value   you have to admit   things aren t looking good ",2018-10-24,Adem Tumerkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wall-street-pros-finally-seeing-the-upcoming-global-earnings-recession-200350163,200350163

187741,409257,BX,Here s Why Blackstone Mortgage Trust  BXMT  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Blackstone Mortgage Trust currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if BXMT is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this real estate finance company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For BXMT  shares are up 2 78  over the past week while the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry is up 1 11  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 32  compares favorably with the industry s 0 37  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Blackstone Mortgage Trust have risen 3 21   and are up 9 39  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  3 07  and 7 33   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to BXMT s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  BXMT is currently averaging 1 510 947 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with BXMT 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost BXMT s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 82 to  2 87 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that BXMT is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Blackstone Mortgage Trust on your short list ",2018-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-blackstone-mortgage-trust-bxmt-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200359207,200359207

187754,409270,BX,WeWork Europe Expansion Faces Growing Competition Before IPO,news," Bloomberg      WeWork   NYSE WEWK  gets a lot of headlines for its breakneck expansion into new markets  and that s only likely to increase now that it plans to go public  Yet the nine year old company faces stiff competition in Europe from established work space providers like IWG Plc and local startups 
The number of serviced and co working offices across Europe has ballooned by more than 200 percent in the last five years  according to a report by real estate broker Colliers International Group Inc  WeWork has helped to drive this growth  it has nearly 50 locations in London and has added sites from Manchester to Moscow 
 The IPO is a great milestone in the evolution of the flexible work space scene   said Tom Sleigh  head of consultancy on the industry at Colliers   It s a signal to other operators that they re able to expand  
While WeWork initially rose with the advent of the gig economy and an explosion of startups  big companies are increasingly seeking more flexible offices  too  Corporate clients now make up about a third of WeWork s customers  IWG  which owns the Regus brand  has traditionally catered to corporate customers 
WeWork and IWG account for about 78 percent of the European market for flexible work space  Colliers data show  WeWork had about 600 000 square meters  6 5 million square feet  of office space in Europe at the end of 2018  That put it ahead of IWG  whose Spaces brand is more closely comparable to WeWork venues than the traditional serviced offices operated by its Regus unit  IWG is considering selling Spaces 
A growing list of local operators are now battling WeWork and IWG for market share  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s The Office Group and Germany s Design Offices are at the front of the chasing pack  Each of the firms has about 80 000 square meters of flexible office space  according to Colliers  In many major European markets  including London and Paris  smaller local players collectively account for a majority of the flexible office space market  according to the Colliers report 
WeWork s IPO  and the financial information it discloses in the process  could prove useful to its rivals  Sleigh said  These companies will be eager to learn how much WeWork spends to open new locations as well as its long term occupancy rates and the rate at which tenants renew their leases  he said 
The lion s share of flexible office space in Europe is concentrated in a few cities  particularly Amsterdam and London  which is the world s biggest city for co working  Now other cities such as Berlin  Paris and Rome are seeing rapid expansion 
 Other cities are playing catch up in some respects because the industry is less developed   Sleigh said   We expect a lot more of that as landlords become much more prepared to offer more and more services to occupiers as a response to WeWork spaces  
Changes in the workforce underpin the spread of flexible offices  Across Europe  nearly half of workers are self employed  on temporary contracts or part time    perfect conditions that have fueled the flexible work space boom  Sleigh said

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Woori Bank and Blackstone Group are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that WF likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than BX has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
WF currently has a forward P E ratio of 6 34  while BX has a forward P E of 11 47  We also note that WF has a PEG ratio of 1 06  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 17 
Another notable valuation metric for WF is its P B ratio of 0 57  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BX has a P B of 1 64

to pipelines that arrive from miles around to this corner of former farmland near Midland  Texas  the heart of the largest oil patch in the United States   His company is one of dozens opening sites like this one that handles  not the lucrative oil  but the shale industry s dirty secret  wastewater  While U S  oil production has reached record levels on account of the shale revolution of the last decade  much of the supporting infrastructure has failed to keep up  including how to transport the large quantities of water used in the hydraulic fracturing process and the water that is produced from wells alongside oil and gas  Once managed individually by energy producers  the job of supplying  collecting and disposing of water is a rising cost  and has spawned a  34 billion a year business in the U S  that has lured investors including TPG Capital  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Energy Partners LP and Ares Management Corp to back these firms   Oil production in the Permian basin that spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico is expected to rise to rise 35 percent to 5 4 million barrels of per day  bpd  by 2023  requiring even more water supply and disposal  said analysts  In two New Mexico counties  firms produced 505 million barrels of oil from 2016 2018  and five times that in water  a Reuters analysis of state production data showed    You can t bring production online until you have a solution for the water   said James Lee of Riveron Consulting  There are 5 500 Permian wells to be drilled  requiring 2 75 billion barrels  or 115 billion gallons to complete  a  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  report estimated  While much of the water in the Permian is transported for high fees by trucks  which also exacerbate traffic congestion around production sites  midstream companies build and use pipelines which energy producers pay to utilize  Christensen s company  On Point Oilfield Holdings  owns a water disposal network that this year will take up to 375 000 bpd of wastewater  Some of that water will be recycled  but millions of gallons will eventually be sunk deep underground in West Texas   Water was always an afterthought for producers   said Christensen  who stretches him arm and draws a 360 degree arc to show the locations of lines carrying oilfield bilge to the site   Now it s a business plan in itself   Raising cash at a time when the industry is under pressure to restrain spending and improve returns has also fueled the trend  prompting some producers to cash in on their water projects   In December   Hess Corp   NYSE HES  got  225 million for some of its water handling assets from a joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners  while Halcon Resources received  200 million in cash and up to another  125 million over five years from WaterBridge Resources LLC for its water infrastructure assets    When capital discipline is higher on the priority list  it s very attractive to monetize  water management assets  said Benjamin Shattuck  an analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie   14 BILLION WATER BILL AND RISING The average frack job now consumes 13 million gallons  49 million liters   up 40 percent in two years  according to a Reuters analysis of Permian producers  data reported to FracFocus org   That translates to water bills in the Permian Basin soaring 17 percent this year to  14 billion  according to consultancy IHS Markit  more than three times what North American producers spent last year on sand to frack their wells  That lure is attracting investors who once viewed oil and gas as the prize   TPG last week agreed to pay  930 million for a majority stake in Goodnight Midstream s water pipeline network  which consists of more than 420 miles  670 km  in three U S  shale basins   Other private equity firms  including ARM Energy Holdings and Ares Management  have committed  4 billion to buy or start water management firms over the last four years  according researcher Global Water Intelligence   nFWN1UM0IP  Water management at this scale is in its infancy compared with the business of moving oil and gas by pipeline  but more private equity firms are looking for investments  said Jim Summers  chief executive of Houston based water company H20 Midstream   A FRACTION OF THE COST Acquiring and disposing of water costs between 50 cents and  4 per barrel  depending on whether it moves by pipelines or more expensive trucks  and can be a steep cost for producers when oil dips as low as  40 a barrel in the Permian  as it did late last year  The cost has inspired some companies to shift gears   ARM Energy formed a company  Salt Creek Midstream  to gather oil and gas and was quickly pulled into offering water management  said CEO Zach Lee  By hiring Salt Creek  shale producer Lilis Energy expects its water disposal costs to fall to 48 5 cents per barrel from  2  Not all producers  however  want to let go of their water management   Diamondback Energy Inc is considering selling shares in a subsidiary that manages its water  oil and gas transport  but would retain control of the subsidiary   If I have to wait on somebody to get a pipeline built or a saltwater disposal system put in place  that is going to be a bad day  I need to be in control of that  not the other way around   said Diamondback s CEO Travis Stice  Parsley Energy Inc spent  150 million to develop a water system that can handle up to 1 million bpd  which helped cut its wastewater costs by two thirds  to 50 cents per barrel  CEO Matt Gallagher said

187818,409334,BX,Auto Giant Gates Industrial Flouts Criticisms With Impressive IPO,opinion,"Executives at Gates Industrial Corp  have flouted many early criticisms of the Denver based auto parts maker  filing for an impressive IPO that could bring in more than  100 million  The company  which focuses on producing top of the line power transmission belts as well as fluid power products  filed on Wednesday with the SEC for an IPO with a low estimate of  100 million  but many of Gates  backers see the company potentially bringing in hundreds of millions more 
High aspirations for the auto maker 
Many analysts and investors are looking to Gates Industrial with some seriously high ambitions  with some reckoning that the company s IPO could bring in a mammoth  500 million under the best circumstances  Even many of its early skeptics have come to admit that Gates is beating expectations  as the company had an impressive  2 75 billion in sales last year alone  and could be shaping up for an even more explosive 2018 
New initially  back in August that the private equity firm Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP  which acquired the auto parts maker for more than  5 billion a few years ago  was mulling over whether to take Gates public  and those ambitions seem to have materialized  Gates intends to be listed under the NYSE under the ticker  GTES   though little other information  such as how many shares would be issued  is currently known  According to  made by Gates  it intends to use much of the profits it gleams from its forthcoming IPO to pay off some  276 million in debt  which could pave the way towards eventual independence for the company 
After a few relatively lackluster years under Blackstone  which initiated serious cost cutting measures to reduce waste and help urge further growth  Gates  forthcoming IPO could be the first sign of a serious turnaround for the company  with some onlookers  that the company could be so successful as to raise  1 billion 
The company is well over 100 years old  and has long been a golden boy of Colorado s economy  with its headquarters in Denver particularly popular and appreciated among residents of the centennial state  Whether Gates sees success over the coming decades could depend on how successfully the company branches out to the rest of the US and the world abroad  however  as many analysts believe that the future of the automotive industry will be driven by furthered globalization and cross border trade 
Full speed ahead towards 2018
A successful IPO for Gates that nears the highest current estimates of some  500 million to  1 billion would make it one of the largest IPOs of the new year  and would certainly draw in appreciative headlines and serious confidence amongst early financial backers  With Citi  UBS Investment Bank   Barclays  Morgan Stanley  Credit Suisse   RBC Capital Markets  and Goldman Sachs operating as joint bookkeepers for the deal  precious few onlookers are expecting a dull IPO 
Affiliates of Blackstone Group will retain a majority of voting power regardless of how many shares are eventually offered  according to Reuters  which likely means paying off the company s rather high debt   which is just shy of  4 billion   will be a priority immediately after the IPO 
Having generated a net income of more than  84 million last year  with hundreds of customers in over 120 countries  most early financial backers of Gates expect it to see equally healthy financial results in 2018  The company s focus on power transmission products and fluid power products has enabled it to seriously diversify the myriad industries that it serves  with Gates catering to the needs of industries as varied as agriculture  energy  and manufacturing 
If Gates follows the lead of many others in the auto part manufacturing industry  shifting operations overseas to cut cost  it would likely have to toe a fine line between angering domestic consumers unhappy to see jobs go while benefiting from seriously cut cost due to operating overseas  The company has already announced plans to relocate its headquarters  though it intends to make the move a local one  remaining in Denver  Ultimately  Gates  IPO could end up being one of the blockbusters of 2018  and early backers of the auto parts maker aren t likely to find themselves disappointed in the future  As long as it keeps paying down its debt and generating impressive profits  Gates  future is looking rosier by the day ",2018-01-01,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/auto-giant-gates-industrial-flouts-criticisms-with-impressive-ipo-200276816,200276816
187819,409335,BX,COT Blue  Nobody Buys A Dead Horse,opinion,"FRBNY s December 2017 Primary Dealer survey results aren t yet published  so we will have to wait a few days for the collection of those banks  economists to tell us what they think their own traders likely won t do  It s a mess in that situation  but one as old as the crisis  Nevertheless  Economists for some reason still occupy prime slots in mainstream commentary opining about a great many things often year after year  after year  
One such is Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s Byron Wien  Mr  Wien is well known throughout Wall Street and not just as the firm s current Vice Chairman  He has a long and storied career in high NYC finance  having served two decades as Morgan Stanley s often seen Chief Investment Strategist once looming as a constant presence over the dot com era with widely followed  and market moving  weekly essays 
Among his publications most people still follow is his annual  surprise  list  It s a catalog of ten items  each one where Wien believes the larger public sees a slim one in three chance of happening which he thinks is actually better than 50   His list this year  

With higher inflation  interest rates begin to rise  The Federal Reserve increases short term rates four times in 2018 and the 10 year U S  Treasury yield moves toward 4   but the Fed shrinks its balance sheet only modestly because of the potential impact on the financial markets  High yield spreads widen  causing concern in the equity market 

It follows  as it would  his  surprise  that GDP growth and US wages accelerate this year  2018   following closely the narrative set out by Janet Yellen  in her   and many  many others  It may count as a surprise only in that very few might be inclined to believe it outside of the class of professional economic forecasters 
This far broader skepticism isn t exactly unwarranted  of course  We need only look back to Mr  Wien s list of 2017 surprises  

Increased economic growth  inflation moving toward 3   and renewed demand for capital push interest rates higher across the board  The 10 year U S  Treasury yield approaches 4  

Interest rates have nowhere to go but up  except that they don t  The reason is as simple as it has been since August 9  2007  when the gaping distinction between dollar and  dollar  suddenly became all that mattered 

Last year was supposed to be the one of  globally synchronized growth   where for the first time since 2007 all cylinders  meaning regions  of the world economy would be firing simultaneously  leading to so much momentum that nothing would stand in the way of actual growth this time  In reality   globally synchronized growth  was only ever 2017 s updated buzzword du jour  the next iteration of 2014 s  global growth  or 2011 s  recovery   It proved to be yet again all sizzle and no steak 
Even nominally bond bears were all but certain that 2017 would close out with the long end of the UST curve pushed up   if by no other reason than the  presumed  power of monetary policy in the US  In March 2017  for instance   bond king  Jeffrey Gundlach described the UST 10s as trading in a  zone of death   one that would see their yields first decline  they did  before making around 3  by last week  they didn t get even halfway  
What it demonstrates is what I wrote early last year  in that inflation had become everything as it was representative of a great deal more than consumer prices  In other words  the bond market is very closely linked to the real economy through effective rather than imagined  QE  monetary conditions  That s what everyone keeps understating if not ignoring outright   dollars  not dollar 

None of this is strictly devoted to just inflation expectations or even inflation itself  Consumer prices are the monetary junction between money and economy  The shedding of the so called inflation anchor  which can be observed in financial curves  too  is as much a commentary on economy and therefore the reversal of the Greenspan aura  It is a conclusion that the people seem to have arrived at several years in advance of policymakers 
It s a truly amazing tale  which is one reason why very few choose to consider it even a possibility  especially by those in the media  who have been duped more than any others   For decades  the man so celebrated by all  at least most  the  experts  had no idea what he was doing  That US monetary policy had for all this time included little or no understanding and appreciation of money  It is almost too hard to believe  almost  It has taken some time  but with one lost decade already in the books  the Great  Moderation  starts to seem a very different thing  and the man who supposedly made it looks more and more to be the only one who was ever lucky 

The people who still view monetary policy of the nineties and aughts most favorably are the same who can t figure out why these things never happen  growth accelerates  wages with it  inflation rises  and therefore interest rates too and not just the long end but the whole UST curve 


The market  by contrast  just doesn t buy it  literally   and why would it  Going back to 2013  hell  even 2010 and 2011  these people have been talking about growth  inflation  acceleration  wages  recovery  etc   constantly  Now all of a sudden they get it right  Not only that  there s no evidence right now  still  that they might be  a point even they have to concede 
No  we are to believe that all these things absent in the current data will just start showing up in 2018  Only they said the same thing  as noted above  about 2017  That s the real message from 2017  all the  should be s  that never were  Last year wasn t strictly as bad as 2015 16 and that downturn  of course  but in many ways it was worse  Last year confirmed a lot about where things stand  meaning that in the grand scheme of things nothing has changed  Last year was supposed to be the year everything did 
Steadfastly refuting that narrative is where the long end of the yield curve remains  not to mention iShares TIPS Bond  NYSE TIP    exactly where it has been apart from brief  reflations  scattered here and there across the last decade  Until something substantial and meaningful alters this lamentable global  monetary  economic course  the only surprises are why Economists and analysts keep kicking this dead horse  at least it would be a yearly surprise if Economics was instead anything like a scientific rather than ideological endeavor ",2018-01-03,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/cot-blue-nobody-buys-a-dead-horse-200277169,200277169

187850,409366,BX,Private equity firms win over Scout24 with improved  6 4 billion bid,news,"By Arno Schuetze and Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT  Reuters    Hellman   Friedman and Blackstone  NYSE BX  have won over Scout24 after raising their offer for the online classifieds group to 5 7 billion euros   6 4 billion  including debt  setting up the biggest takeover of a listed German company by private equity 
The investors said in a statement on Friday that Scout24 s management and supervisory board supported the sweetened bid of 46 euros a share  Last month  the German company rejected an offer of 43 50 euros per share 
Scout24 shared jumped 11 8 percent in Frankfurt to 46 38 euros  above the offer price and suggesting some shareholders reckon a better alternative offer may yet emerge 
 We think this bid values Scout24 at too low a multiple and raises the possibility that industry peers may look to buy some or all of the assets   analysts at Liberum said in a note 
They speculated a rival media house  such as Germany s Axel Springer  Norway s Schibsted or South Africa s Naspers might be willing to pay a higher price for Scout24 than the private equity 
Springer  which has its own German real estate classifieds business  might have to dispose of that part of Scout24 s operations if it does do a deal to avert any possible antitrust concerns  they added 
Schibsted  which is spinning off its own digital classifieds business  would probably have to ditch Scout24 s Spanish auto classifieds business for the same reason 
The Scout24 deal comes amid a broader shakeup in the European media landscape  as companies seek to realize value by carving out or merging their digital classifieds businesses that are faster growing and more profitable than their media titles 
Scout24 has the attraction of being a classifieds pure play  enabling it to command a valuation of 17 times estimated 2019 earnings before interest  taxation  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  
Still  that is shy of the estimated 20 times EBITDA Silver Lake paid in its  3 billion takeover of ZPG  owner of UK property sites Zoopla and PrimeLocation  last May 
Hellman   Friedman and Blackstone said their offer was subject to a minimum acceptance threshold of 50 percent plus one share 
PRIVATE EQUITY RETURNS
Scout24  best known for its ImmobilienScout24 home listings in Germany and AutoScout24 car listings across Europe  was previously owned by Hellman   Friedman  which acquired a controlling stake from Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  in 2013 before listing the business in 2015 
The company s rise has coincided with a boom in the German real estate market driven by ultra low interest rates  urbanization and the attraction to economic migrants exerted by Europe s largest economy 
Other groups have also vied to buy all or parts of Scout24 
After receiving an approach last year  Scout24 hired investment bank  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  to explore its options 
Among other proposals  German used car dealing platform Auto1 suggested a deal for Scout24 s car listings business  sources close to the matter had said last month 
Despite having well stocked war chests  private equity funds have found it difficult to invest without overpaying due to rich equity market valuations 
In Germany  the private equity takeover of generics maker Stada  which became significantly more expensive after arbitrage funds like Elliott came in and demanded a cut  has also deterred public to private deals

A recent stock market correction  though has encouraged buyout groups to seek such deals  Separately  Bain and Carlyle are currently weighing an offer for lighting group Osram

187866,409382,BX,Regulators criticize loans as concerns grow about falling recoveries,news,By Kristen Haunss NEW YORK  LPC    Recent volatility in the U S  leveraged loan market has increased concerns about diminished recoveries as regulators ratchet up criticism of the asset class  Recoveries for first lien loans are forecast to be about 61 percent  down from the average historical recovery of 77 percent  according to Moody s Investors Service  Recoveries for second lien loans are forecast to be just 14 percent  down from the average historical rate of 43 percent  The pessimistic forecasts come as regulators express concern about underwriting quality as market volatility increases  A benchmark of 100 of the most widely held loans fell 292bp since the start of November to 95 43 on Wednesday  the lowest level since February 2016 when both the equity and credit markets were pressured by the economy and lower oil prices   When you think about the next downturn  leveraged loan recovery values are a concern   said Andrea DiCenso  a co portfolio manager for the alpha strategies team at Loomis Sayles   It has me questioning  are the recovery values we used to assign to them kind of moot at this point    SENTIMENT SHIFT The  1 1 trillion US leveraged loan market is a hedge to rising interest rates because the debt pays investors a coupon plus the London interbank offered rate  As rates rise  so do the distributions lenders receive  This is an attractive investment as the Federal Reserve  Fed  continues to raise rates  hiking them on Wednesday for the ninth time in the last three years  The U S  central bank has indicated that pace will slow in 2019  The U S  loan market has almost doubled in size since 2008  buttressed by the  582 billion U S  Collateralized Loan Obligation  CLO  market  the largest buyers of the debt  which set a new issuance record in 2018 with more than  126 billion arranged  The uptick in CLO volume as well as investments in loan mutual funds and separately managed accounts allowed companies to cut borrowing costs and loosen document terms  including removing lender protections  More than  585 billion of U S  institutional loans were arranged in the first three quarters of the year after a record  923 8 billion was issued in all of 2017  according to LPC data  About 73 percent of the leveraged loan market is covenant lite  Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen  Senator Elizabeth Warren and the Bank of England have all expressed concerns about the loose underwriting as market sentiment has deteriorated  Loans have a negative 2 6 percent performance since the start of November  and banks have had to widen pricing and tighten document terms to entice investors  JP Morgan deepened the discount on a loan for aviation company XO Management to 93 cents on the dollar this month  the lowest original issue discount since the fourth quarter of 2016  according to LPC data  Some companies have chosen to pull or postpone their deals all together  including Ulterra Drilling Technologies  which delayed syndication of a loan backing its buyout by Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group  and information technology services provider ConvergeOne  which postponed to January syndication of a facility to back its buyout by CVC Capital Partners  Business Development Companies  BDCs   investors in the middle market  have not escaped the volatility  The average share price to net asset value across the public BDC universe has plummeted to 0 796 times as of Tuesday s close  the lowest level since early 2016  according to LPC analysis  While CLO issuance has remained steady  even as tranche spreads widened  retail investors have pulled more than  6 6 billion from mutual funds and exchange traded funds since mid November  including  2 5 billion in the week ending December 12  the largest one week outflow since Lipper started tracking in 2003  Loans are notorious for their slow settlement times and Fed Governor Lael Brainard raised concerns this month about mutual funds being able to meet redemption requests  a refrain the Securities and Exchange Commission has previously expressed  Loans settled in an average 20 3 days in 2017  according to IHS Markit  Open end funds need to meet redemption requests in seven days   LOAN MARKET FOCUS Despite recent volatility  defaults have remained low  supported by covenant lite issuance  which removes many potential triggers  The U S  speculative grade corporate default rate was 2 7 percent in September 2018 and Standard   Poor s forecasts it will fall to 2 5 percent by September 2019  Fitch Ratings says the institutional leveraged loan default rate will finish 2018 at 1 8 percent  But danger looms as the number of companies rated B3 with a negative outlook or lower sits at 182  according to Moody s  with about 44 percent of first time issuers in 2018 holding a B3 corporate family rating   the lowest rating you can get and still access the market   according to Christina Padgett  a senior vice president at the ratings firm   We have more low rated credits today than we did at the peak of the financial crisis   she said  If there is a significant wave of company downgrades to a Caa rating  CLOs  which typically have a cap on the percentage of assets they hold with that ranking or lower  often around 7 5 percent  can be impacted  forcing them to divert payments from the most junior fund investors  according to Algis Remeza  associate managing director at Moody s  The focus on the asset class comes as U S  government agencies say they will not take enforcement action based on supervisory guidance  The move is a blow to leveraged lending guidance  updated by regulators in 2013 and treated as a rule by banks  which many attribute with keeping some terms measured   The consequence of not taking action may be private equity buyouts that are even bigger and more highly leveraged  some market participants have warned  Despite the recent upheaval  forecasts for 2019 are strong   Barclays   LON BARC  is calling for  400 billion  420 billion of loan issuance next year  dominated by merger  acquisition and buyout financing  the bank said in a November report  CLO issuance is also expected to be strong with JP Morgan calling for what would be a new record of  135 billion of issuance

replacements   said David Mooney  founder of Casement Capital   There has been a near  extinction event  in commodities hedge funds    We had about 16 large hedge funds trading natural gas in Houston a few years ago   he said   That number is now reduced to a small number of managers   Some funds saw investors pull out because they increasingly view energy as an unsafe spot for their money  Casement suspended operations after difficulties raising investor interest  two industry sources said   The firm was supported by Lighthouse Partners  according to a regulatory filing  Lighthouse declined to comment  and Mooney would not elaborate on the reasons for Casement s decision to close   All hedge funds  including commodities  that are being scrutinized for near term performance are coming under pressure   said Jonathan Goldberg  founder of one of the best known energy focused hedge funds  BBL Commodities  Closures of energy focused hedge funds have outpaced launches in the last three years  according to data from Eurekahedge    It becomes self reinforcing   Goldberg said in an interview   If people lose money and are seeing negative feedback for it  they cut risk and it becomes harder and harder to manage the business   Macro hedge funds   those with strategies based on broad global macroeconomic trends  such as a bet that oil prices will rise   were among the hardest hit  falling 3 6 percent in 2018  That s the weakest annual performance since 2011  when such funds fell 4 2 percent  according to the Hedge Fund Research  HFRI  Macro index   a key industry index  Through mid December  commodity trading advisors  CTAs  were down by 7 1 percent  according to a late December estimate by  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   In December  Goldberg said he would wind down BBL Commodities  flagship fund and focus instead on longer term trading opportunities  Goldberg s BBL Commodities Value Fund lost 14 2 percent in July  Reuters reported  Goldberg said in December that returns had been  limited  recently  BAD BETS ON OIL  GAS Funds took heavy losses this past year when oil prices took an unexpected dive beginning in October amid growing worries about oversupply and weakening demand  U S  oilfields hit an all time production record last year at more than 11 5 million barrels a day  A sharp rise in natural gas prices in late 2018  on concerns of tight supplies and cold weather  also added to the pain because many funds had paired bets on lower natural gas and higher crude  Fluctuations in prices typically create opportunities for fund managers to book a profit  but the moves of oil and gas prices followed a prolonged period of subdued volatility in energy markets and caught fund managers off guard  Oil prices had rallied through most of the year  and hedge funds built increasingly large bets on the rally continuing  Money managers began the year with a record number of bullish open positions in U S  crude  3067651MNET  and largely maintained them near those levels until mid year   That changed late last year  when the U S  granted waivers to big purchasers of Iran s oil after reinstating sanctions on the nation  and as the United States  Russia and Saudi Arabia all produced at record levels  feeding worries about a supply glut  The market sunk in a series of volatile trading days as funds rushed to unload positions  INVESTOR PRESSURE  Hedge fund investors said they do not see the situation for niche funds improving  Among those that have been having the most difficulty are natural gas funds  said one recruiter who works with several funds and banks in the commodities industry  In November  U S  natural gas futures experienced their most volatile streak in nine years  Velite Capital  which emerged earlier this decade as one of the most profitable natural gas hedge funds  founded by star trader David Coolidge  began winding down in August  Madava Asset Management  meanwhile  shut after investor Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group requested to pull funds  according to a Wall Street Journal report  Timoneer Energy  a hedge fund specializing in natural gas futures and options  also wound down last year  sources said  The firm was set up in 2015 by a portfolio manager and three analysts from Velite  Several former members of the fund did not respond to a request for comment  Two years ago  energy executives John James and Sachin Goel planned to launch natural gas focused hedge fund Mercasa Energy  backed by an initial commitment of  10 million from investor Titan Advisors  which has some  4 5 billion in assets under management  But the fund was not able to secure additional investments  and by early 2018  Mercasa had shut   Titan Advisors declined to comment   Ernest Scalamandre  founder of AC Investment Management  an investment firm focused on commodities  said he expects funds dedicated to oil and natural gas to remain challenged

Earlier this month  a separate source told Reuters that Elior was seeking bids by the end of January for its Areas catering business 
The source added that around 10 private equity funds   including KKR  Lone Star and Blackstone  NYSE BX    were considering making a bid 
On the other hand  Italian food producer and distributor Cremonini and French group Lagardere have both said they did not plan to table offers to buy Elior s assets 
Analysts value Areas   which has core earnings of about 200 million euros   at 7 5 to 10 times earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  compared to 8 to 11 times for Autogrill or Britain s SSP Group Plc  L SSPG  
This means the deal could have a value of between 1 5 and 2 billion euros 
With 2017 18 revenue of 6 69 billion euros   7 60 billion   Elior is well behind Britain s Compass  L CPG  and French Sodexo  PA EXHO  which each have revenues that are more than three times this 
Shares in Elior have more than halved from mid 2017 highs following several profit warnings and the firm s market capitalization has fallen to below 2 5 billion euros

 SPACs are having their day right now  for sure  Could the shutdown increase it  I think it is contingent on the government remaining shut and interesting deals coming   said Howard Fischer  CEO and founding managing partner of Basso Capital  a SPAC focused hedge fund ",2019-01-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blankcheck-company-ipos-moving-ahead-despite-government-shutdown-1754552,1754552

187884,409400,BX,Trump s Business Councils Implodes After CEO s Response To Violence  ,opinion,"Forget what happened after the S P 500 futures opened at 8 30 CT  because it s not where the trade has been  It s all being done at night  For the last few weeks  Globex has been where all the trade is going  A little early down tick  and then a 6 to 10 handle rally  This has had a bug effect on the S P 500 futures  ESU17 CME  on the actual 8 30 futures open  The Globex session has seen the ES higher 6 out of the last 10 sessions  and up 3 in a row  In my view  it s all about  thrust   and when so much movement takes place at night  it takes a sharp rally or drop to rebuild the thrust to get things going again 
Yesterday  at 9 30am CT  the ES had basically been stuck in a 3 handle range for the first hour of trade  It s an odd thing  Over the years  many traders moved over to the S P 500 futures because they moved so much  so fast  You could get in and get out  and most trades didn t take long to develop  but it seems like that s not how it works anymore 
Trump s Approval Rating Sinks To Lowest Point Yet
At 11 45 CT yesterday  the high in the ES was 2474 25  but that s not where the action was  It was in the Nasdaq 100 futures that rallied all the way up to 5949 50  For the most part  it was another quiet day  until after 1 00 when Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group Chief Executive Stephen A  Schwarzman  who was head of the Strategic and Policy Forum  called the president to inform him the group was being disbanded  After the call  the president took to twitter saying that it was his decision to disband that council  and that he also was disbanding the manufacturing advisory council 
It was another big blow for the president and his pro business agenda  The ES and NQ stutter stepped below their vwap s  quickly sold off down to 2462 50 and 5902 00  then bounced a little as the news hit the wires 
In the end  it was another slow day  with the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQU17 CME  leading the way  and a great example of maybe one of the largest missteps of Trumps presidency  I started Tweeting about Trump s controversial response to the violence in Charlottesville Tuesday night  but Wednesday s blow up and loss of some of the largest backers and firms in the nation truly cast doubt about both his direction  and ability to run the nation 
Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  Andrew Liveris said in a statement Wednesday   Every member of the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative condemns racism and bigotry  and there cannot be moral ambiguity around the driving forces of the events in Charlottesville  J P  Morgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was quoted as saying   It is a leader s role  in business or in government  to bring people together  not tear them apart  
After the sell off the S P 500 futures  ESU17 CME  settled at 2467 50  up  3 75 handles  or  0 15   the Dow Jones futures  YMU17 CBT  settled at 22011  up  34 points  or  0 15   and the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQU17 CME  settled at 5923 50  up  11 50 points  or  0 19

Our View
Wow  President Trump really messed up on this one  Losing all the backing from some of the largest companies in the U S  is NOT a good thing  One has to wonder if he has bitten off more than he can chew  I am a backer for change  but not stepping up to the plate  and losing so much big support is very hard to understand 
That said  the markets will move on  but his inactions won t  Trump is losing support from all angles  Our view is that there are sell stops building under 2472 50  and go down to 2466 00  I think they may go for them  Sell the early rallies and buy weakness

187918,409434,BX,Khashoggi crisis may test Saudi PIF s expansion ambitions,news,By Andrew Torchia  Saeed Azhar and Tom Arnold RIYADH DUBAI  Reuters    A year ago the Saudi sovereign investor Public Investment Fund  PIF  was a rising star among state backed funds   It poured billions of dollars into the SoftBank technology fund of Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and the infrastructure vehicle of U S  private equity firm Blackstone  NYSE BX   and was building a war chest for overseas deals  PIF  chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  emerged as the most viable partner for foreign investors after an anti corruption purge last year tainted many members of the Saudi business elite       But the outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month has made some Western firms reluctant to deal with PIF  threatening to slow some of its grandiose projects and global investments   Firms in sectors with a stronger CSR  corporate social responsibility  profile  including U S  based tech  will have a harder time accepting PIF money   said Steffen Hertog  a scholar on Saudi Arabia at the London School of Economics   Larger and lumpier equity injections  potentially of the type giving the PIF a board seat  will be particularly difficult   Some firms are already distancing themselves  but sums involved are relatively small compared with the  250 billion PIF has invested  British billionaire Richard Branson said earlier this month his Virgin Group would suspend its discussions with PIF over a planned  1 billion investment in the group s space ventures  A Virgin Group spokesman told Reuters his statement still stands  Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday the firm was awaiting the full facts on the murder before deciding whether this would affect the PIF s  3 5 billion investment in the ride hailing service  PIF officials did not respond to requests for comment  TOO BIG TO IGNORE PIF has shown no signs of changing its strategy  Managing Director Yasir al Rumayyan told an investment forum this week that PIF holds almost 10 percent of its assets internationally and aims to raise that to 50 percent by 2030   It has invested in 50 or 60 firms via SoftBank Group s Vision Fund and will bring most of those firms to the kingdom  he said  Softbank walked a fine line at the Future Investment Initiative  FII  event in Riyadh which was boycotted by dozens of Western officials  bank chiefs and company executives   Chief executive Son  whose  93 billion Vision Fund drew nearly half its money from Saudi Arabia  canceled a speaking engagement but other Softbank executives joined panels  Son came to Riyadh to meet high ranking Saudi officials  including Prince Mohammed  to explain in person why he could not attend the forum and express concern over Khashoggi s death  one source familiar with the matter said  Dozens of tech firms and private equity or investment companies interested in technology attended  including some U S  firms  Privately  some said they expected outrage over Khashoggi to fade and business to return largely to normal in a few months   Luca Verre  co founder and chief executive of Prophesee  a young Paris based company working on advanced machine vision systems  said he came to meet potential investors      Verre said he understood the position of tech firms that opted to stay away and that Riyadh needed to do more to clarify responsibility for Khashoggi s killing  But he said PIF remained important for companies like his       You need investors like PIF that look for long

187930,409446,BX,How Foreign Investments Impact China s Global Growth,opinion,"from the World bank  China has been investing heavily internationally  having invested over  2 27 trillion  investors should note this data excludes Hong Kong and Macao  which are special administrative regions  in nations abroad between 2005 and 2015  Last year  China s foreign direct investments  40  to  189 billion 
This data also shows that China made its first foreign investment  a humble  430 million  back in 1982  Since then  things have clearly changed  Rapid growth within China has led to a massive increase in demand for resources  which the country has sought to help satiate through foreign investments 
Africa
Due to China s recent sluggish economic growth  its total foreign investments have decreased since 2013  during which it totaled  290 billion  Some of the country s newest partnerships are with burgeoning African nations  though China s slowdown has made African leaders express concern about its continued involvement  or possible lack thereof  in the region 
In December 2015  at the Forum on China Africa Cooperation  President Xi responded to those concerns by  to African states that would come in loans and export credits  only  5 billion would arrive as grants and interest free loans  Hosted in Johannesburg  the summit brought together delegates from 50 African countries  the African Union  and China  and Mr  Xi told leaders that the funds would be invested in 10 projects over the course of the next three years at the time 
The Middle East
China is also notably involved throughout the Middle East  The bulk of the country s investment in the region is in the energy sector  and this makes sense  as the Middle East is home to oil and gas rich nations like Iraq  Oman  Qatar  and Saudi Arabia  Last January  Mr  Xi offered  55 billion worth of loans and investments to the region that  
China has invested in other real estate and utility ventures in the region  The country also  a joint  10 billion investment fund in late 2015 with the United Arab Emirates as part of Beijing s efforts to create closer commercial and political with the Middle East  the two countries hope to build new trade routes between the East and West 
One can t leave out China s growing tourism interests in the region  too  In 2015  the number of Chinese tourists visiting Egypt  for instance   from 60 000 in 2014 to 135 000  It helps that there are direct flights between China and Egypt  but with relationships deepening between the two regions  investing in tourism seems a logical next step 
Latin America
China has doubled down on its efforts in Latin America  where it   65 billion in government loans in 2015  in addition to funding for infrastructure projects  For example  the country plans on constructing a railroad stretching 3 300 miles from Brazil s Atlantic coast to Peru s Pacific coast 
China plans on investing  250 million into the region over the next decade  Latin America provides the nation with much needed raw materials like iron  oil  soy  as well as many other foods  also read    
The United States
Although the two have their tensions  China has a significant investment presence in the United States   from Mergermarket  Chinese companies invested over  51 billion into the U S  last year through 65 deals  representing a 360  increase from 2015  Apparently  Chinese investments made up 12  of all inbound mergers and acquisitions in the U S   and huge step up from the 2  of foreign investments in 2015 
Some of the biggest deals of last year included Dalian Wanda s  3 5 billion acquisition of Legendary Entertainment  a Hollywood production company  this deal gave Wanda the rights to blockbusters like The Dark Knight and Jurassic World  Another huge transaction involved Chinese conglomerate HNA  HNA agreed to pay Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group  6 49 billion for a 25  stake in Hilton Worldwide   NYSE HLT    a deal that will help both HNA and Hilton take a bite out of China s fast growing tourism market 
But the biggest Chinese investment was when Anbang Insurance Group completed most of its  6 5 billion acquisition of Strategic Hotels   Resorts  a deal that included 15 properties like the JW Marriot Essex House in New York and the Four Seasons in Washington 
from the Rhodium Group and the National Committee on U S  China Relations shows that Chinese firms established 1 583 facilities in the United States by the end of 2014  and spent roughly  46 billion on new establishments and acquisitions between 2000 and 2014  China affiliated companies now directly employ more than 80 000 Americans  and have invested in such cities as the Raleigh Durham Triangle  Chicago  and New York City  amongst numerous others 
Looking Ahead
China s global involvement is not solely limited to foreign investments  Its growth would not have been possible without massive swaths of resources that it has received through trade with other economies  also read    
We could see a further rise in China s outward investments in the services and other consumer centric sectors  This would be accompanied by an increase in China s  soft power   a  Harvard professor Joseph S  Nye  Soft power refers to the use of economic and cultural influence to gain global standing  The same way U S  mannerisms and fashion trends have spread across the world  Chinese influence may  too  become more prevalent moving forward

Tribune Media shares were up  2 61 to  42 90 in morning trading  while Sinclair shares gained  1 28 to  38 23 
Sinclair will pay roughly  43 50 per share for Tribune Media and assume about  2 7 billion in net debt from the deal  Sinclair  which currently owns 173 channels  reaches more than 38  of the nation  Tribune Media operates 42 stations and reaches more than 43  of the nation 
 The Tribune stations are highly complementary to Sinclair s existing footprint and will create a leading nationwide media platform that includes our country s largest markets   said Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley 
Technically  the Federal Communications Commission mandates that a media company can only own multiple TV stations if its nationwide market share does not exceed 39   Tribune Media reached the 43  mark after receiving an exemption to buy 19 stations from Local TV LLC in 2013 
The FCC recently eased these regulations  reversing a rule about how market reach of UHF channels is calculated last month  According to Bloomberg Intelligence  Sinclair and Tribune Media should be able to keep their combined market share low enough with a few divestitures

187951,409467,BX,Pimco Revs Up Private Fund Playbook to Profit in Next Recession,news," Bloomberg     Pacific Investment Management Co  is prepping for the next downturn  betting high fee private funds can turbocharge its growth 
The firm  widely known for its publicly traded bond funds  is floating a private variation of Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn s  113 billion Pimco Income Fund  according to people with knowledge of the proposal  The vehicle would restrict redemptions  unlike Pimco s largest mutual fund  while carrying lower risk than most of its other private funds  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the information isn t public 
The potential new offering would add to a modest but growing part of Pimco s products for larger and more sophisticated investors  The Newport Beach  California based asset manager is taking steps in its push to issue more private funds such as hiring managers experienced in distressed debt  emerging markets and other opportunistic assets  Manny Roman  who became chief executive officer two years ago  expects the move will help the firm cash in when the next economic downturn comes 
 If we have a deep recession  which won t be good for the world  there ll be a lot of opportunity   Roman  55  said during an interview   There will be a lot of capital to deploy  
He and Ivascyn declined to discuss the firm s specific private funds  citing regulatory restrictions on marketing 
Economic Outlook
The chances of a recession are  quite likely  in the next three to five years  Pimco said last month in its economic outlook    and it could happen sooner 
 Our models  like many others  see an increased risk in 2020   Ivascyn  49  said 
As part of its expansion in private funds  Pimco is raising a  1 5 billion commercial real estate debt fund  according to a presentation for the Pennsylvania Public School Employees  Retirement System  which invested  200 million in July  It s also amassing the Pimco CLO Opportunities Strategy Fund  which buys debt and equity slices of collateralized loan obligations 
Private funds are sold to so called accredited investors who agree to the steeper costs and longer lockups in exchange for potentially lofty returns  The strategy distinguishes Pimco  which oversees about  1 72 trillion  from rivals such as Fidelity Investments that have been competing for assets by slashing fees  But Pimco faces a flush field of private credit specialists like Ares Management LP  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP and Oaktree Capital Group LLC 
The private fund strategy relies more on skills than scale and carries growing risks as more asset managers rush to put money to work  according to Devin Ryan  an analyst with JMP Securities in New York 
 We ll probably look back in hindsight and see plenty of folks made bad decisions   Ryan said in an interview   But that may be somebody else s opportunity later on  
Over the past decade  Pimco has raised more than  25 billion for a dozen private funds  Customers can buy stakes in some for as little as  100 000 through Artivest Holdings  an online platform that pools qualified investor accounts into private equity and hedge funds 
Higher Fees
Pimco began exploring the alternative debt market in 2007 under initiatives Ivascyn helped start as a mortgage portfolio manager  The private structure provides more control of loan covenant packages and investor protections compared with the public securities that comprise most of Pimco s assets  Ivascyn said 
BRAVO III  which invests in real estate and other debt opportunities  is among the biggest of Pimco s private funds  at  4 6 billion  It charges a hedge fund like 1 5 percent management fee plus 20 percent of returns while targeting a 14 percent to 16 percent return rate and requiring a seven year commitment  By contrast  the Pimco Income Fund charges institutional clients 0 5 percent of assets while averaging 5 5 percent annualized returns over the past five years and offering daily liquidity 
In anticipation of launching more private funds  Pimco is beefing up its ranks of investing professionals  with an emphasis on specialists in credit and high tech quantitative investing  according to Roman  Recent hires include John Studzinski  a former managing director at Blackstone  to manage relations with large clients such as sovereign wealth funds  Geoffrey Jones and Gabriel Goldstein  formerly with Tennenbaum Capital Partners  to focus on private and opportunistic credit  and Erin Browne from UBS Group AG in asset allocation 
Many of the recruits will also manage publicly traded funds 
 They re not distinct or separate from the members of the team focusing on more traditional mandates   Ivascyn said   They re highly complementary

187971,409487,BX,Exclusive  Mitek rebuffs Elliott backed ASG s takeover approach   sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker
 Reuters    Mitek Systems Inc  a U S  provider of financial technology to banks  has rejected a takeover approach from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp s software company ASG Technologies  people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday 
ASG Technologies  bid comes at a time of uncertainty for Mitek  which said in August that both Chief Executive Officer Jim DeBello and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Davison were stepping down to either retire or pursue other roles 
ASG first approached Mitek over the summer  the sources said  After ASG submitted an offer in writing valuing Mitek at what it considered a significant premium  Mitek rejected the offer and told ASG it preferred to remain independent  according to the sources 
Last week  ASG wrote a letter to Mitek s board urging it again to engage in merger discussions  the sources added  Mitek is not pursuing a sale  they said 
The exact price of ASG s offer could not be learned  The sources asked not to be named because the matter is confidential  Elliott  ASG and Mitek declined to comment 
Mitek shares ended trading on Wednesday up 17 percent at  7 74 on the news  giving the company a market capitalization of close to  300 million 
Based in San Diego  Mitek has agreements with large banks such as JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  to handle mobile check deposits  It forecast annual revenue of between  62 million and  63 million this year 
The company in July lowered its forecast for annual profit margins to a range of 15 percent to 16 percent from 19 percent to 20 percent  The company s core business could be challenged as the circulation of physical checks is on the decline  according to analysts 
ASG  based in Naples  Florida  received an investment last year from Evergreen Coast Capital  the private equity arm of activist hedge fund Elliott Management  A unit of KKR   Co became an investor in ASG last year when it acquired FS Investments from Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s credit arm  GSO 
ASG is looking to expand its software products to banks through an acquisition of Mitek and increase the development of Mitek s technology that helps verify identities  the sources said  ASG s software platform  Mobius  already helps banks store data for certain amounts of time to comply with regulations 
The company has about  250 million in revenue annually  the sources familiar with the matter said  It acquired a startup called Mowbly for an undisclosed sum earlier this year 
Elliott has been using its private equity arm  Evergreen  to acquire both public and private companies and sometimes involves ASG when it pushes companies to explore a sale ",2018-10-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-mitek-rebuffs-elliottbacked-asgs-takeover-approach-sources-say-1639057,1639057
187972,409488,BX,Trump Says U S  Attendance Uncertain at Saudi Investment Meeting,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump said he s uncertain whether his administration will participate in a Saudi investment conference as CNN said the kingdom is preparing a report saying Jamal Khashoggi died as the result of an interrogation that went wrong 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who was scheduled to attend the Riyadh conference  will decide by Friday whether to participate  Trump told reporters on Monday 
As recently as Friday  Mnuchin said he still planned to attend  despite an exodus of sponsors and participants  Executives including JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Uber Technologies Inc  s Dara Khosrowshahi have dropped out of the conference  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also have canceled plans to attend  said people with knowledge of the matter 
 We haven t made a decision about going yet   Trump said  He added that Mnuchin is  going to make that decision some time prior to Friday  
Trump earlier in the day announced that he dispatched Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Salman bin Abdulaziz and suggested that  rogue killers  might be behind Khashoggi s disappearance in Turkey 
The decision to dispatch Pompeo and the public signal the U S  may withdraw from a marquee Saudi event underscores how much the crisis is threatening to damage U S  Saudi relations  Khashoggi was a Saudi citizen and U S  resident who wrote critically of the kingdom s leaders 
 Flat Denial 
Turkish officials say Khashoggi was murdered in the kingdom s Istanbul consulate after he arrived Oct  2 to retrieve a document for his upcoming wedding  Saudi officials say Khashoggi left the building unharmed  but have provided no evidence for the claim 
Trump said Monday morning that the king  in a 20 minute phone call  offered him a  flat denial  that the Saudi government was behind Khashoggi s disappearance and possible murder  A Saudi official said the kingdom has begun an investigation ordered by the king and could hold people accountable if evidence warrants it  The probe is separate from a joint investigation being undertaken with Turkish officials 
 His denial to me could not have been stronger   Trump told reporters  referring to the king   I don t want to get into his mind  but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers  Who knows  We re going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon  
Trump said King Salman added that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also  had no knowledge  about Khashoggi s fate  The crown prince said in an interview with Bloomberg News a day after Khashoggi s disappearance that he believed the journalist had left Saudi Arabia s consulate in Istanbul alive after entering on Oct  2 
CNN Report
CNN  citing two people it didn t identify  said the Saudis are now preparing a report that will say that Khashoggi died as the result of an interrogation that went wrong  The interrogation was intended to lead to the journalist s abduction from Turkey  according to the report 
Trump said he was aware of the CNN report but that it wasn t clear if the network relied on official sources 
Khashoggi s family issued a statement on Monday urging an  independent and impartial international commission  to look into his disappearance  the Washington Post reported   Our family is traumatized  and yearns to be together during this painful time   the report cited the statement as saying 
Trump has built his Middle East policy around his close alliance with Saudi Arabia  the first foreign country he visited after taking office in 2017  Crown Prince Mohammed has twice visited the president in the Oval Office  most recently in March to kick off a glitzy investment tour of the U S  that included stops on Wall Street and Hollywood  The prince has developed a rapport with Jared Kushner  the president s son in law and senior adviser 
Despite increasing pressure from Congress  Trump said he s reluctant to cancel multibillion dollar arms sales to the kingdom out of concern the U S  ally will turn to Russia or China instead 
 Determining what happened to Jamal Khashoggi is something of great importance to the president   State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Monday as Pompeo prepared to depart Washington  He was joined on the plane by David Hale  the under secretary for political affairs  and Tim Lenderking  a deputy assistant secretary for Arabian Gulf affairs  among others 
Untenable Denial
The U S  administration regards Saudi Arabia s denial of any involvement of Khashoggi s disappearance as untenable  and Trump and his aides are increasingly convinced that the Washington Post columnist died after entering the Saudi consulate to pick up a document for his wedding  said three U S  officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter 
 All I can do is report what he told me   Trump told reporters on Monday  adding that he warned the Saudi king that  the world is watching  
Saudi Arabia  the world s biggest oil exporter  said on Sunday it would retaliate against any punitive measures with even  stronger ones   according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency  In a reference to the kingdom s oil wealth  the statement noted how the Saudi economy  has an influential and vital role in the global economy  
The Saudi ambassador left Washington last week to return to Riyadh  and one U S  official said he was instructed by Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton to return to the U S  with answers about Khashoggi s disappearance 
Trump is under mounting pressure from Congress  Several Republicans have said arms sales should be curtailed  and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee  the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee  said last week that he had warned the Saudis that their relationship with the U S  risked collapsing

187973,409489,BX,Buyout Firms Grab a Bigger Slice of Australia s Mortgage Market,news," Bloomberg     U S  private equity giants are muscling in on Australia s lucrative home loan business  shrugging off the risks of a falling market to seize an opportunity created by the retreat of the big domestic lenders 
KKR   Co   Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP have all snapped up small Australian mortgage lenders in the past 14 months  providing the heavyweight backing that has made non bank lenders the fastest growing source of new home loans this year 
With the non banks unable to take deposits  much of their foray into home lending is being funded via the capital markets  While total issuance of residential mortgage backed securities has fallen this year  the smaller lenders have been responsible for well over half of the market 
 The non bank sector is changing   said Andrew Papageorgiou  investment manager at the Melbourne based fund manager Realm Investment House  adding that the backing of KKR and others would enhance access to the deeper European  U K  and U S  funding markets   Having a private equity backer of significance changes the nature of the conversation with your senior bank funder and probably opens up a great number of options   Papageorgiou said 
After KKR agreed to buy non bank lender Pepper Group Ltd  in August 2017  Blackstone snapped up an 80 percent stake in La Trobe Financial Services Pty  at the end of the year  and Cerberus Capital Management LP agreed to purchase Bluestone in February 
Under pressure from regulators  the large banks which dominate the Australian home loans market have pulled in their horns  Westpac Banking Corp  and its peers have curbed interest only and investment lending  stopped loans to foreign buyers and introduced stricter verification of income and expenditure  The tighter standards have allowed non banks to pick up a slice of the near prime market  said Taosha Wang  a credit analyst at Pacific Investment Management Co  in Hong Kong 
A Moody s Investors Service analysis of the mortgages contained within the debt issued by non bank lenders shows the proportion of loans issued to investment buyers rising to about 35 percent at the end of 2017  from around 15 percent in 2014  While riskier than traditional owner occupier loans   such mortgages are less risky than the non conforming or alternative documentation loans that most non bank lenders have traditionally focused on    Moody s said in a June report 
The shift has helped cushion some of the effects of reduced bank credit on the Australian property market  where prices have fallen for 12 straight months   The rate of decline in Australian house prices would certainly be more without non bank mortgages    said Jonathan Reeves  a lecturer in financial economics at the University of New South Wales Business School 
However  the effect is at the margins because the growth in non bank lending is happening from a very low base  That explains why Australian regulators remain relaxed about the trend   Lending by non prudentially regulated lenders has picked up  but they must still comply with responsible lending laws and are too small to fully offset the tightening from other lenders   the Reserve Bank of Australia said in its latest financial stability report 
Despite the end of Australia s long housing boom  which saw Sydney prices rise 74 percent between 2012 and the middle of last year  there s little sign of stress in the RMBS market  The proportion of non bank loans included in RMBS that are subject to arrears has ticked up in recent months  but remains low in absolute terms 
As long as the arrears don t escalate  the non bank lenders and their private equity backers can continue to nibble away at what has traditionally been a lucrative market for Australia s big banks  which have about 60 percent of their loan books in residential lending  For the banks  it s a simple dynamic    their profits have been sustained by the comfortable spread between the average mortgage rate and the rate on money they can borrow in the wholesale market ",2018-10-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/buyout-firms-grab-a-bigger-slice-of-australias-mortgage-market-1648648,1648648

187990,409506,BX,A Bearish Signal From Housing Stocks,opinion,"The yield on the 10 yr Treasury has blown out 109 basis points since July 3rd   70 basis points since October 30th  30yr fixed rate mortgage rates for 20  down payment buyers with a credit score of at least 720 are up 90 basis points since October 1st 
Interestingly  the Dow Jones Home Construction has diverged from the S P 500  While the DJUSHB index is up since election night  it has been lagging the S P 500 since the beginning of the year 


The graph above is a 1yr daily which compares the ROR on the SPX with that of the DJ Home Construction Index  I use the DJUSHB because it has the heaviest weighting in homebuilders of any of the real estate indices  As you can see  the DJUSHB has been in a downtrend since late August  almost as if stock investors were anticipating the big spike in interest rates that started about 6 weeks later  You can see that  while the volume in the DJUSHB spiked on December 5th  it s been declining steadily since then  The SPX volume spiked up on December 5th and has maintained roughly the same daily level since then  Note  volume often precedes price direction 
Here s another interesting graphic sourced from the Mortgage Bankers Association 


The data is through December 2nd  as mortgage application data lags by a week  As you can see  mortgage application volume   both refinance and purchase   has been negative to highly negative in 9 of the last 12 weeks 
A report by Corelogic was released today that asserted that foreclosures had fallen to  bubble era  lows  This is not unexpected  Historically low rates have enabled a lot mortgagees who were in trouble to defer their problems by refinancing  Unfortunately  the Marketwatch author of the article did not do thorough research   also not unexpected 
As it turns out  mortgage delinquency rates are quickly rising 
Black Knight Financial Services  which provides data and analytics to the mortgage industry  released its Mortgage Monitor report for October  It reported that the 30  day delinquency rate had risen  unexpectedly  by nearly 2   The overall national delinquency rate is now up to 4 35   It also reported a quarterly decline in purchase mortgage lending  The highest degree of slowing is among borrowers with 740  credit scores  The 740  segment has accounted for 2 3 s of all of the purchase volume 
Even more interesting  it was reported by RealtyTrac last week that home foreclosures in the U S  increased 27  in October from September  It was the largest month to month percentage increase in foreclosures since August 2007  Foreclosures in Colorado soared 64   which partially explains the rising inventory I m seeing  with my own eyes   Foreclosure starts were up 25  from September  the biggest monthly increase since December 2008 
Finally  again just like the mid 2000 s housing bubble  NYC is showing definitive signs that its housing market is crumbling very quickly  Landlord rent concessions soared 24  in October  more than double the 10 4  concession rate in October 2015  Typical concessions include one free month or payment of broker fees at lease signing  Days to lease an apartment on average increased 15  over 2015 in October to 46 days  And inventory listings are up 23  year over year  Note  in the big housing bubble  NYC was one of the first markets to pop 
Finally  I saw an idiotic article in some rag called  The Sovereign Daily Investor  that was promoting the notion that another big boom in housing was about to occur because of a surge in buying by millennials  Unfortunately  the dope who wrote this article forgot to find data that would verify proof of concept  On the other hand  here s actual data that applies heavily to the millennial demographic 
The Fed reported on Wednesday that household debt had hit a near record  12 35 trillion led by new all time highs in student loan debt   1 28 trillion  and a new all time high in auto loans   1 14 trillion   11  of aggregate student loan debt was 90  days delinquent or in default at the end of Q3 2016  Fitch has projected that it expects the subprime auto loan default rate to hit 10  by the end of the year  At the time of the report  it was at 9  
The point here is that the millennial demographic is overburdened with student loan  auto loan and personal loan debt  In addition  it s becoming increasingly hard to find post college full time employment that pays enough to support the cost of home ownership  especially with the mortgage payments associated with a 3  down payment mortgage  This is the dynamic that has fueled the rental market boom  and soon the rental housing bust  
Speaking of which  Blackstone  NYSE BX   the largest player in the buy to rent game  quietly filed an IPO of its housing rental portfolio about a week ago  If Blackstone thought there was more value to be squeezed out of its portfolio   i e  that housing prices and rents had more upside   it would have waited longer to file  I m sure that Blackstone would love to get this IPO priced and its equity stake in this business unloaded on to the public before the market cracks 
The housing market data tends to be lagged and extremely massaged by the most widely followed housing data reporters   National Association of Realtors and the Government s Census Bureau  existing and new home sales reports   The reports from these two sources are highly unstable  subject to big revisions that go unnoticed and entirely unreliable  But the fundamental statistics cited above will soon be filtering through the earnings reports of the companies in the DJ Home Construction Index  I would suggest that the market has already sniffed this out  which explains why the DJUSHB is diverging from the S P 500 negatively in both direction and volume ",2016-12-14,David I.

187991,409507,BX,Five Things To Watch Today ,opinion,"It s a bad day for European banks  Blackstone  NYSE BX  ends its  endless  fund  and oil s rising again  Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today 
Euro banks hit
Struggles continue in the Italian banking sector  where at least 52 billion euros   54 billion  is needed to clean up balance sheets  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  This is far above the scale of the rescue package proposed this week by the government  and comes amid concerns that Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  MI BMPS  will fail in its efforts to attract 5 billion euros of private sector funds 
Shares in the embattled lender lost 18 2 percent in trading this morning  Spanish lenders  shares were also hit   falling as much as 10 percent   after Europe s top court ruled against the institutions on a mortgage interest payments case that means customers may be entitled to billions of euros in compensation

187992,409508,BX,China says U S  putting  knife to its neck   hard to proceed on trade,news,"By Yawen Chen and Ben Blanchard BEIJING  Reuters    A senior Chinese official said on Tuesday it is difficult to proceed with trade talks with the United States while Washington is putting  a knife to China s neck   a day after both sides heaped fresh tariffs on each other s goods   When the talks can restart would depend on the  will  of the United States  Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said at a news conference in Beijing  U S  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on  60 billion worth of U S  products including liquefied natural gas  LNG  kicked in on Monday  unnerving global financial markets   Now that the United States has adopted such a huge trade restriction measure     how can the negotiations proceed  It s not an equal negotiation   Wang said  stressing the United States has abandoned its mutual understanding with China  The Chinese government s top diplomat also told business people at a meeting in New York that talks could not take place against the backdrop of  threats and pressure   the Foreign Ministry said  Certain forces in the United States have been making groundless criticisms against China about trade and security issues  which has poisoned the atmosphere for Sino U S  ties and is highly irresponsible  State Councillor Wang Yi was quoted as saying  without naming anyone   If this continues  it will destroy in an instant the gains of the last four decades of China U S  relations   Wang told members of the U S  China Business Council and National Committee on United States China Relations  U S  representatives there included Blackstone Group LP  N BX  co founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman and Mastercard Inc  N MA  Chief Executive Ajay Banga  the National Committee on United States China Relations said on its website   China also accused the United States of engaging in  trade bullyism   and said Washington was intimidating other countries to submit to its will  according to a white paper on the dispute published by China s State Council  or cabinet  on Monday   Several rounds of Sino U S  talks in recent months have appeared to produce no breakthroughs  and fresh mid level negotiations which had been expected in coming weeks have been shelved after Beijing reportedly decided late last week not to send a delegation to Washington  While Vice Commerce Minister Wang said he still hopes  there is a way out  if both sides treat each other with sincerity  analysts say neither side looks to be in the mood to compromise in the increasingly bitter dispute  raising the risk of a lengthy battle that could chill the global economy by discouraging business investment and disrupting trade    The sharp criticism  from Beijing on Monday  suggests that China might prefer to wait out the current U S  administration  rather than embarking on potentially futile negotiations   Mizuho Bank said in a note to clients   Given these developments  it is increasingly likely that both sides will not resume negotiations for some time  at least until there is a noticeable shift in the political mood on either side   DISRUPTING GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS U S  exporters including LNG suppliers would  certainly  be hurt  but Beijing s retaliation would provide opportunities to other LNG exporting countries  Vice Commerce Minister Wang said  adding that Australia is an important source of the fuel for China   China is a big and powerful nation  so whether it is a confrontation with China economically or militarily  it would come at a huge price   the state backed Global Times said in an editorial on Tuesday    As such  it is an attractive prospect for other countries including the United States to coexist with China peacefully   said the newspaper  which is published by the ruling Communist Party s People s Daily   China does not know why the United States changed its mind after reaching an agreement with China on trade earlier  Wang said  He was apparently referring to talks in May  when it appeared that the two sides had sorted out a framework before the White House backed away   Luo Wen  a vice minister at the Ministry of Industry and Information  told a news conference that the government is aware that some foreign companies are considering relocating out of China as the trade row threatens to heighten their risks and costs  But he said the government is working to accommodate their needs and reduce their tax burdens  However  the trade war risks disrupting global supply chains and throwing them into chaos  Luo said  Senior officials also once again rejected Washington s accusations that China forces foreign companies to share their technology with Chinese joint venture partners  adding that Beijing has passed a rule forbidding government entities from such illegal behavior   The government has not forced this  and a lot of JVs are actually performing very well in China   Wang said  giving an example of American car giant Ford  N F    Ford produces more cars and makes more profits in China through its JV than it does in the United States   he said

188011,409527,BX,The Junk Bond Market Looks Like a Runaway Train,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Bond investors often say that  No one wants to be a forced seller   And that makes perfect sense  If you need to sell during a rout  no matter the price  you re going to take a big hit  But it should be equally as scary to be a forced buyer 
Increasingly  that s what happening in the U S  high yield corporate bond market  With ample cash and little new supply to purchase  investors have pushed the average spread on junk debt down to just 3 15 percentage points  close to the narrowest since 2007  according to Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  index data  As recently as 2016  that gap was more than twice as wide 
A handful of companies have benefited from this trend in recent days  Diamondback Energy Inc  received more than  2 billion of orders for a  500 million offering  allowing it to boost the size to  750 million  International Game Technology Plc and Clearway Energy Inc  were also bombarded with money  leaving investors accepting smaller yields  And a deal that funded Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP s acquisition of Thomson Reuters Corp  s financial and risk business saw more than  10 billion come pouring in for the  2 8 billion dollar denominated portion 
It s no secret why high yield securities are hot  Moody s Investors Service expects the default rate on speculative grade debt will fall to 2 6 percent by the year end from 3 4 percent now  Meanwhile  U S  Treasury yields are climbing toward the highest levels in years  making bonds less vulnerable to higher interest rates more attractive  Combine that with the cash flowing in from coupon and principal payments  plus a 25 percent decline in issuance relative to last year  and it s no surprise these deals are being gobbled up 
Investors aren t complaining  The Bloomberg Barclays U S  Corporate High Yield Bond Index has returned 2 4 percent in 2018  more than just about any other fixed income market  And the lower the rating  the better the performance  Securities seven to nine steps below investment grade  CCC  or Caa  have gained 5 5 percent  while the most distressed debt has soared about 31 percent 
Still  it s hard to shake the feeling that the junk bond market is missing its brakes  This momentum chasing happens in credit markets from time to time  of course  and high points in the economic cycle naturally encourage risk taking  But some cooling off may be warranted  
This week s AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals deal illustrates the risk of hopping aboard the runaway high yield debt train  Investors placed more than  2 5 billion of orders for a  605 million offering to fund the company s buyout by  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  LP  On Thursday  the yield was set at 8 percent  down from an initial whisper number of 9 percent 
But  as analysts at credit research firm Covenant Review point out  the sale is  replete with very aggressive terms  that favor the company s private equity owner  Yet few investors will push back  They simply can t  given the prevailing market trends 
Even more alarming is that analysts see this relentless demand as a reason why things won t end badly in credit markets this time around  Bloomberg News s Katherine Doherty wrote up an analysis from Brian Reynolds  asset class strategist at Canaccord Genuity  He says distressed funds are likely to  put their money to work aggressively  in the event of another panic   keeping it brief  and avoiding the disaster of 10 years ago  Investors are far more willing to buy troubled companies  debt than a decade ago  an example  of how credit investors are taking shadow banking to new heights   and creating what Reynolds calls  new and innovative ways of financial engineering  
I m not convinced this is how things would go in bad times  It s easy to love distressed companies now  Profits are huge  and have been for years   the high yield index has only posted an annual loss once since the end of the recession  But that glosses over the painful 26 percent drop in 2008 
For now  it seems investors are happy to delay any reckoning  A recent Bloomberg News story chronicled how some of the biggest distressed companies have largely succeeded this year in asking investors for more time to pay off debt  Whether that works out remains to be seen  And this may not be the top for high yield bonds  Earnings are strong  the economy is roaring  and spreads are still about 80 basis points from their all time narrowest levels  Barring an unforeseen surge in supply or dramatic reversal in risk appetite  the rally could very well keep chugging along 
But now more than ever  investors should get picky  You hate to be a forced buyer  You hate to be a forced seller  But the absolute worst thing  Being both ",2018-09-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/the-junk-bond-market-looks-like-a-runaway-train-1618906,1618906
188012,409528,BX,Leveraged Loans Are Flying Off the Shelves,news," Bloomberg     Money managers  eager for assets whose yields rise as the Federal Reserve hikes rates  snatched up some of the year s biggest leveraged loan offerings this week  Some caution that investors may be buying at the wrong time 
Usually after the Fed tightens the money supply  economic growth slows  which results in more defaults on corporate debt and lower returns for the whole loan market  said Gershon Distenfeld  co head of fixed income at AllianceBernstein LP 
A good proxy for the potential risk is to look at returns when loan prices rise too high  Distenfeld said  When the average outstanding loan is around current levels of 98 5 cents on the dollar or above  annual returns are about 2 8 percent for the next two years  trailing five year Treasuries and high yield bonds  according to his analysis of market prices between January 1992 and May 2018  Distenfeld has long been skeptical of bank loans 
Sub par returns are bad enough  but this time loans could perform worse than they usually do  said Guy LeBas  chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC  Lender protections are worse than usual  and there are fewer other creditors to absorb losses 
 It s not a good time to be buying bank loans   LeBas said 
Whether or not that s so  a lot of money managers are buying them  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP this week borrowed  9 25 billion in the U S  and European loan market to fund its buyout of a stake in  Thomson Reuters   NYSE TRI  Corp  s financial terminal business  and received orders far in excess of supply  in one of the biggest leveraged loan financings of the year   Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  LP cut rates twice on  6 4 billion of U S  and European loans for its acquisition of AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals amid strong demand  New U S  leveraged loans are on track for a record setting year  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  and the U S  market tops  1 trillion outstanding 
Retail investors have poured cash into funds that buy loans  with  282 million of inflows into mutual funds and exchange traded funds in the week ended Sept  12  the 10th straight week of money coming in  according to Lipper data  Pension funds have also been big buyers of credit products broadly  according to a report by Canaccord Genuity  And some  84 billion of collateralized loan obligations have been sold this year  a record pace  which fuel demand for loans by buying them and repackaging them into securities 
Investors are looking to buy instruments that pay floating rates  meaning their prices don t fall as the Fed tightens monetary policy  The U S  central bank is widely expected to hike rates when it meets next week  and futures markets also project increases in December and at least one more time next year  Loans are also attractive because they are first to be repaid if a company goes under  making them less risky than corporate bonds that are usually behind loans in the pecking order 
Inflection Point 
There are reasons to be sanguine about the market  Goldman Sachs Group s Amanda Lynam wrote in a report this week that money managers are pushing back on deals that are too aggressively priced  profits are improving at many companies  and borrowers have cut debt levels  meaning the market isn t overheating 
 The risks in the leveraged loan market  broadly  are manageable and not close to an inflection point   Lynam wrote 
Even if an inflection point is far away  the risks are building up  Moody s Investors Service in August highlighted how borrowers are eliminating investor protections on loans known as covenants  That could lead to lower recoveries in the next downturn  the ratings company said  predicting average U S  first lien term loan recoveries would fall to 61 percent  versus their 77 percent long term historical average  For the second lien  recoveries could be 14 percent  compared with a 43 percent historical average 
In addition to weaker covenants  companies have taken on a lot more loan debt during this cycle  than they ve had historically  and have comparatively fewer bonds  Those factors mean recoveries for first lien loans could be closer to 50 cents on the dollar  said Tom Mansley  investment director at GAM Investments 
 There s a tremendous supply in the marketplace and at the same time  we ve definitely seen deteriorating fundamentals   Mansley said   That s going to lead to low recovery rates going forward

188058,409574,BX,Leveraged loan repricings resurface despite strong new issuance,news,By Yun Li and Jonathan Schwarzberg NEW YORK LPC    At least three US companies including warehouse retail store BJ s Wholesale Club are seeking to cut borrowing costs on existing term loans after a surge in new money issuance this year put a brake on opportunistic repricing and refinancing transactions in July   July saw 139 US companies turning to the leveraged loan market to back buyouts and raise new debt  according to Thomson Reuters LPC  However  not a single issuer attempted to cut pricing on existing loans  the data shows   Opportunistic deals dried up as a wave of new money deals during the second quarter tipped the market in favor of lenders that were able to push back on deals and bargain for better pricing  In all  US 245bn of new paper was placed during the second quarter  the highest volume since the second quarter of 2007 hit a record US 261bn   Repricing activity has returned though for strong credit as new deals have slowed down   Loan repricings are driven by both volume and tone in the market   said a senior banker   You re dependent on soft call protection rolling off and the general tone in the marketplace  The market didn t feel all that great in July and there were a lot of new deals getting done  Investors had their choice of deals to pick from  so they didn t have to simply let deals reprice   The room for more opportunistic deals might also be limited as the earlier refinancing waves have pushed the maturity wall further to 2023 and 2024  according to Eric Rosenthal  senior director of leveraged finance at Fitch Ratings   There s very little coming due in 2018  2019  and even 2020   Rosenthal said   We have only US 88bn in institutional term loans due over the next two and a half years  which is striking  You are seeing some deals get done at 175bp over Libor with some Double B names  It can t go much lower than that   HARD TIME Repricings may be back in the market only as an option for companies with specific credit events as opposed to the broad repricing trend that allowed companies to reprice their loans almost at will every six months earlier this year and last year   For example  in June BJ s raised net proceeds of US 637 5m in its IPO  which the company will use to completely repay its US 625m second lien term loan  The company is also paying down a portion of its first lien debt  Moody s upgraded BJ s corporate family rating to B1 from B3 following the successful IPO  citing its pro forma leverage ratio reducing to around 5 4 times earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization from 6 2 times  BJ s is using this event to ask lenders to cut pricing on its soon to be US 1 5bn term loan due in 2024  The company on Wednesday lowered the rate to 300bp over Libor with a 25bp stepdown when net first lien leverage drops to 3 times  BJ s lined up the loan at a size of US 1 925bn to back a dividend recapitalization in January 2017 at a price of 375bp over Libor   I think we ve repriced so much of the market  the opportunities are now limited   said the banker   Unless there has been a structural change to the credit such as a deleveraging event  you re going to have a hard time   Also looking to cut pricing is chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor  which on Tuesday launched a repricing of its US 503 8m term loan B with guidance circulating in the 175bp 200bp over Libor range with a 0  floor  Cypress in March priced the then US 505m term loan  due July 21 2021  at 225bp over Libor  Moody s upgraded Cypress s corporate family rating to Ba3 from B1 in February on continued improvement in operating performance  Natural gas electricity producer Compass Power Generation on Wednesday started shopping a price cut for its US 744m term loan with guidance in the 325bp 350bp over Libor range  The company arranged the loan at a size of US 750m in December 2017 to back a dividend recapitalization  issuing the debt at 375bp over Libor with a 1  floor   I m guessing  these repricings  are going to get done   said a portfolio manager   These are very good quality companies  There s not a lot of high quality paper out in the new pipeline  It will be an interesting test to see if the demand is still there  I don t think Single B credits could get repricings done though in this environment    Looking ahead  M A activities will be the biggest driver of the loan market  which is expected to continue to give investors the ability to put their money to work with new deals instead of holding onto existing loans at lower prices  Rosenthal said  Several jumbo US buyout loans are expected to launch after Labor Day  including a US 13 5bn loan and bond financing backing Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s purchase of Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk  F R  unit and a US 8 05bn financing for KKR s buyout of physician services provider Envision Healthcare  Blackstone

188060,409576,BX,U S  middle market direct lending strategies still raking in capital,news,By Leela Parker Deo  Reuters    Investors continue to inject capital into US middle market direct lending strategies at a pace that could result in 2018 fundraising surpassing the record tallies seen in 2016 and 2017  So far in 2018  US 35bn has been raised for middle market strategies  including direct lending funds  private debt funds  middle market Collateralized Loan Obligation funds and Business Development Company  BDC  equity raises  according to Thomson Reuters LPC data  Another US 29bn has been announced  but not yet closed  This comes on the heels of US 69bn for all of 2017 and a total of US 61bn for 2016  Top tier asset managers and veteran middle market lenders continue to amass significant amounts of capital in response to unprecedented investor demand for the asset class for the third year in a row  Lending conditions  as a result  remain highly competitive  favoring managers with size  scale and track record  Global alternative asset manager Ares Management said on the firm s August 2 second quarter earnings call that it raised US 1 4bn in a first close of a new US senior direct lending fund and that it anticipates a final close in excess of US 3 5bn by year end  including additional equity commitments and expected leverage  Ares  US direct lending business is managed through Ares Capital Corp  ARCC   a specialty finance company and the largest BDC by market capitalization and total assets  Late last month  Ares also announced the final close of its fourth European direct lending fund  Ares Capital Europe IV  at a hard cap of  6 5bn  exceeding the fund s initial  4 5bn target within six months of its launch   Our recent fundraising momentum is not surprising given the significant investor demand for alternative credit and our long standing market leadership and successful track records in both the US and European illiquid credit markets   said Ares Chief Executive Officer Michael Arougheti in the earnings transcript   Investors are gravitating toward defensive asset classes with high current yields  low volatility and  that  benefit from rising interest rates   Twin Brook Capital Partners  the middle market direct lending subsidiary of Angelo Gordon   Co  is raising its third direct lending fund in as many years  The firm  which lends to lower middle market companies with between US 3m and US 50m in Ebitda  attracted over US 2bn in a first close for the AG Direct Lending Fund III  according to a source  Twin Brook pulled in US 2 3bn in 2017 and US 850m in 2016  respectively  for its two previous direct lending funds  Twin Brook declined to comment  GSO Capital Partners  the credit platform of global investment firm Blackstone  NYSE BX   is poised to make a significant new play in the direct lending space after GSO concluded its investment sub advisory relationship with asset manager FS Investments in April  Blackstone announced in December 2017 that it planned to launch a new  internal direct lending business  To that end  the firm is aiming to raise US 10bn in equity and debt capital this year and into next  sources familiar with the matter said  A spokeswoman for the investment firm declined to comment  Blackstone  separately  is buying a 55  majority stake in Thomson Reuters  F R unit  which includes LPC  UNDER PRESSURE Having accumulated deep pools of capital  lenders are under tremendous pressure to put money to work for their investors  even as investor protections in loan documents have eroded and deal structures have become increasingly aggressive   Lenders are forced to put money to work  Sitting on cash means nothing   said one middle market lender  The unitranche product  a loan structured to combine senior and junior debt into a single tranche at a blended cost of capital  has benefited from the tremendous level of demand coming from direct lending platforms  With so much capital available to private equity sponsors and borrowers  unitranche volume has soared and spreads have tightened considerably  Issuance rocketed to US 8 67bn in the second quarter of 2018  up 178  from the first quarter  Sponsor and borrower demand for the product has pushed the cost of unitranche loans down  which typically come at a premium for borrowers  The average spread on unitranche facilities fell to only 605bp over Libor in the second quarter of this year  down from 633bp in the prior period and 661bp in 2017  While lenders compete on structures and pricing  hold sizes represent another battlefield  Lenders can and must take down sizeable pieces of a given deal in order to win assets  Previously  before the explosion in alternative capital and private credit strategies  the larger more established middle market lenders took US 75m tickets in a given deal  widely considered a significant hold  Today some of those same participants can commit US 200m  300m hold sizes   The ability to commit such large amounts of capital to one deal has transformed the competitive landscape  giving substantial advantage to credit managers with size and scale

188068,409584,BX,Guess Who s Buying Energy Debt ,opinion,"Oil prices rebounded after some of the biggest names in the hedge fund world and private equity lost billions betting on a rebound in energy prices and distressed energy debt  What s more  many of them are staying with it 
The Wall Street Journal is reporting on an issue that many who follow the energy sector already know  The double dip sell off in energy not only caught energy industry veterans by surprise but also hedge funds and private equity  The Journal called it   The trade that was supposed to carry the year is ruining it instead   They reported that hedge fund and private equity managers over the past year began piling into debt issued by troubled energy companies  hoping to profit off a reversal of oil s slide  They raised billions of dollars for the effort  in many cases telling backers it was a once in a generation chance to pounce  But crude has continued to fall  slamming the companies and many large investors who thought they had bought in near the bottom  
The Journal mentions names like David Einhorn s Greenlight Capital Inc   Carlyle co founder David Rubenstein and firms like Blackstone  N BX  and Magnetar Capital LLC 
The Wall Street Journal says that hedge funds that primarily invest in distressed assets are down 4  on average this year  while hedge funds that focus on fixed income investments are flat overall  according to researcher HFR  Both have lost money in each of the past four months  The Barclays  L BARC  Capital Government Credit Bond Index is up 1  this year 
They also say that It has been a particularly harsh stretch for a handful of managers who specialize in complicated debt trades and tout their ability to be ballasts for investors in a variety of macro economic environments  The largest fund  a junk bond focused Phoenix Investment Adviser LLC  declined 24  through the end of August  according to investor documents  The  1 2 billion firm has posted losses in 11 of the past 12 months  the documents show  The firm told investors some of its biggest losses have come from the bonds of oil and gas producer Goodrich Petroleum Corporation  N GDP    The whole market was totally flooded   Phoenix founder Jeffrey Peskind said in an interview 
Even King Street  one of the steadiest performers in the hedge fund world  has lost money for five consecutive months  according to people familiar with the matter  King Street has been weighed down by one of its largest holdings  bankrupt Texas utility Energy Future Holdings Corp 
Despite the losses  many investors aren t changing course  Mr  Peskind said he views the sustained pullback as an  unbelievable potential buying opportunity  given the overall strength of the U S  economy  The Journal goes on to say that in March  Carlyle co founder David Rubenstein said at a conference that he was looking to  buy now  on the theory that prices would rebound 
Such wagers haven t panned out  at least not so far  Crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange has dropped 45  in the past year and is off 14  in 2015  as questions about China s economic growth have weighed on commodity prices  Meanwhile  the market for junk rated energy debt has dried up  In the third quarter  the volume of such bonds in the U S  issued by energy companies fell to the lowest level since 2011 
Still many are saying to stay with the trade  In the meantime oil prices are shaking off weak Chinese data and Iranian oil production boasts and will try to recover ahead of the American Petroleum Institute report

188070,409586,BX,The Week Ahead  Can Markets Finally Celebrate Good News ,opinion,"The data calendar continues in something of an alternating mode  This week we have a concentration of the important economic releases  We also have daily appearances by Fed members  This provides a daily opportunity for pundits to interpret the news 
Can markets finally celebrate good news  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted special attention to housing sector issues in a week without much other data  Instead  the Brussels attacks quickly dominated the news  When there was not much additional information  the stories featured the reactions of one and all  Doug Short notes the S P 500 s three day losing streak in his excellent weekly chart   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  


Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his full post for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
The economic calendar includes all of the most important reports  Fed participants will be out in force  There will be plenty of fresh news to ponder 
In theory  the avalanche of news could lead to a dramatic market move  In practice  it usually works differently  The economic data are mixed  The Fed speakers disagree  Pundits are free to interpret the evidence through the prism of their predispositions  The difference in these viewpoints leads me to conclude that many will be asking 
Will good news be good for stocks 
And of course  the corollary   will bad economic news get a cushion from expectations of slower Fed tightening 
Viewpoints
The basic themes are familiar 
Good news about the economy is good for stocks 
The Fed will react to offset economic news either way   keeping the trading range  or
Nothing matters except oil prices 
Challenge
Your conclusion about how stocks will react is a function of what you believe is driving current market action  We do not get paid for knowing yesterday s news  but it is important to understand the sources of market reaction 
Suppose at the start of last week  people could go  back to the future  and know about the Brussels attacks  What do you suppose would have been their market forecast  In actuality  when everyone knew the answer  we heard many explanations that events like this were now accepted as normal risks  I do not like the very idea that such events are  normal   I understand the theoretical concept that the market significance is small  With that in mind  my point is how much easier it is to make statements like this after the fact 
Let s try next week instead  Suppose the market has a significant rally  Many will say that it was end of quarter window dressing  But we all know the quarter is ending  If you expect a window dressing rally  say it now   not as some know it all explanation next weekend  If the market declines  I suppose it will be called  profit taking  
As always  I have my own opinion in the conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was some good news in a light week for data 
Q4 GDP was up 1 4  up from the 1 0  in the last report  Consumers were the big reason     Doug Short s  illustrates this point 

Market liquidity is much better than people think    at BI  
Initial jobless claims of 265K remained very low    

Sentiment is still not bullish  despite the recent rally  This is a positive on a contrarian basis   has the story 

Trucking tonnage is strong  Dr  Ed reviews the rebound in several recent economic indicators  including trucking 

New home sales increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512K  This was slightly better than expectations  and has more economic significance than existing sales  Calculated Risk once again notes the  distressing gap  between existing and new sales  The two series tracked closely until the housing bubble and bust   that the gap is narrowing and expects the trend to continue 

The Bad
Some of the news was negative 
Durable goods orders declined by 2 8  
Existing home sales declined 7 1  month over month with a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 08 million   low inventory and stress in oil patch regions as contributing factors  The  shows the changes in months of supply 


Truth or Fake 
We know that truth can be stranger than fiction  Many probably know the real answers to these questions  but please play along

The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  Often the winner has done a single refutation of a specific post  Sometimes that is not enough to make the point  No single statement has enough substance to disprove  To appreciate  you really need to read the entire article  The subject is Harry Dent  who provides the chart below   and a product to save you from the result 

Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  Beginning last week I made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the 10 Year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of Brian Gilmartin  whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am now using our new model   Holmes   Holmes is a friendly watchdog in the same tradition as Oscar and Felix  but with a stronger emphasis on asset protection  We have found that the overall market indication is very helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
The new approach improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  It is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short

The Week Ahead
We have a huge week for economic data  While I highlight the most important items  you can get an excellent comprehensive listing at Investing com  You can filter for country  type of report  and other factors 
The  A List  includes the following 
Employment report  F   Despite wide error band and revisions  still most important 
ISM index  F   Good for overall economy as well   some leading quality 
Consumer confidence  T   Conference Board version good for employment and spending 
Michigan sentiment  F   Same as Conference Board  but uses the  panel  approach 
Auto sales  F   One of the most important elements of the recovery   private data 
ADP private employment  W   Strong independent measure of employment 
Personal income and spending  M   One of the most important indicators 
Initial Claims  Th   The best concurrent news on employment trends 
The  B List  includes the following 
PCE price  M   The Fed s favorite inflation indicator deserves attention 
Construction spending  F   Volatile February data  but important 
Pending home sales  M   Less important than new construction  but worth watching 
Chicago PMI  Th   One of two regional measures worth watching 
Crude oil inventories  W   Attracting a lot more attention these days 
There is an abundance of FedSpeak  And just when so many think that so much transparency and multiple voices are a problem  Personally  I find it helpful to look at individual positions  just as we would with other democratic institutions that vote  but many seem to prefer less information 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates

To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
WTWA often suggests a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames

Insight for Investors

Other Advice
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read  it would be this thoughtfully researched piece from   He begins with this quotation and comment 

The US economy is stuck in one of the most sluggish recoveries in history  Growth is just 2  and it will remain slow as consumers and companies work off vast amounts of debt  The country has gotten off track and neither political party has any answers

Final Thoughts
There is continuing tension among the various market viewpoints  It is both too simple and also unhelpful to turn it all into a game of labels 
Investors must have a fundamental method and stick with it  I track the economy  and especially recession potential  because economic growth drives stronger earnings and higher stock prices  Much of the daily news flow is simply noise  distorted further by the simple mental models used by most participants  The three biggest current mistakes are the following 
Making it all about oil  This viewpoint is sufficiently prevalent that it has created excessive skepticism about economic growth and recession potential 
Making it all about the Fed  It is fun for most to criticize Fed policy  but not very useful  Most of the actual predictions  hyperinflation  market collapse after the end of QE  have not occurred 
Making it all about valuation  The most popular methods of market valuation help to keep the average investor scared witless  TM OldProf Euphemism

188084,409600,BX,Verint merger talks with Israel s NSO Group terminated  source,news,"TEL AVIV  Reuters    Talks for U S  software company Verint Systems to merge its security division with Israeli cyber surveillance firm NSO Group for about  1 billion have ended without a deal being reached  a source close to the negotiations said on Monday 
The source  who spoke on condition of anonymity  did not disclose why the talks fell apart 
NSO declined to comment and Reuters was unable to contact Verint outside U S  business hours  The talks were first reported in May 
NSO is best known as a supplier of mobile surveillance tools to governments and law enforcement agencies  The company  founded in 2009 by Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie  was in the spotlight last year amid allegations that the Mexican government used the company s Pegasus mobile spyware to target private citizens 
Hulio and Lavie opposed the proposed Verint deal  while Francisco Partners  which owns 60 percent of NSO  was in favor  Israeli financial news website Calcalist said 
The website reported that the founders were interested in NSO remaining an independent subsidiary  which Verint opposed 
Hulio and Lavie also argued that thusde deal  which included a  600 million payment in Verint shares that could not be sold during the first year  was not worthwhile because it depended on the future success of the merged company  Calcalist said 
Israeli media reported last year that Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group was in talks to buy part of NSO  but sources told Reuters that the U S  private equity firm pulled out of those discussions a month later

188089,409605,BX,Top Trade Ideas For Week July 27  2015  Blackstone,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Stephen Schwarzman and Peter Peterson founded Blackstone  NYSE BX   in 1985  The founders named their firm Blackstone  which was a cryptogram derived from the names of the two founders  Schwarz is German for black  Peter  or Petra in Greek  means stone or rock with  400 000 in seed capital  Now it is a premier private equity and investment banking company  owning properties like Seaworld  the Weather Channel and Hilton managing over  300 billion in assets from offices around the globe 
The stock has grown over this time as well  The most recent activity shows the run higher from the October 2014 low to a peak in mid May  The pullback since then has retraced 38 2  of the move higher  a healthy spot for a reversal for a strong stock 
But as it arrives there the RSI is falling and in the bearish zone with a MACD crossing and running lower  These support more downside  And the Bollinger Bands  are opening lower as well  Perhaps it will stop soon at the 200 day SMA just below 
There is support lower from prior price history at 37 25 and 35 80 followed by 34 60 and 32 90  just below the 61 8  retracement  Resistance to the upside may happen at 38 50 and 39 25 followed by 40 70 and 42 10 before the 44 43 high  Short interest is low at under 2  and the company is not expected to report earnings again until October 15th 
The options market shows weekly options for the stock  This week sees very large open interest at the 38 5 Put Strike and then at higher Strikes on both the Put and Call side  a bit of an upward bias  August Monthly options also show an upward bias with big open interest at the 42 Put Strike and the 42 and 43 Call Strikes  And the September options shows the biggest open interest with large size at the 39 and 30 Put Strikes and the 45 Call Strike 
Blackstone  Ticker  BX
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 38 90 with a stop at 37 25 A straight long stock idea 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the July 31 Expiry 38 38 5 Bull Risk Reversal  offered at 6 cents late Friday  A short term trade looking for upside and the large open interest at 38 50 on the Put side as protection 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the September 39 August 40 Call Diagonal  77 cents  buy September and sell August  and sell the August 36 5 Put  46 cent credit  A longer term trade with protection below the big open interest on the Put side in August 
Trade Idea 4  Sell the stock short on a move under 37 25 with a stop at 38 15 A straight downside trade 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the August 38 Puts   1 04  A defined risk method for trading the downside move 
Trade Idea 6  Buy the August 38 September 34 Put Diagonal  71 cents  buy August and sell September  A downside trade idea looking for the 61 8  retracement area to act as support 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last week of July sees the equity markets a bit weaker but mixed with the tech names the strongest 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower along with crude oil  The US Dollar Index may move sideways or continue higher while US Treasuries are biased to the upside  The Shanghai Composite is looking stronger and has almost dispelled all possibility of a Dead Cat Bounce while and Emerging Markets are confirming the resumption of the move lower 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts are a bit mixed  with all better on the longer timeframe  The QQQ is the leader on the weekly timeframe with the IWM next and then the SPY  On the shorter timeframe the QQQ s are also looking the strongest with the SPY and IWM worse  but all biased lower short term  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

188090,409606,BX,Private Equity Isn t Just For the 1 ,opinion,"Last week  I addressed   Hopefully I piqued your interest  But perhaps you shied away in the belief that your net worth would prohibit you from investing 
If the latter is the case  don t fret  There is a way in 
The key is publicly traded private equity  You don t need to be affluent to invest  And you don t have to be a qualified purchaser 
You might be thinking that publicly traded private equity sounds like an oxymoron  But PE is no longer considered an exclusive domain of the uber wealthy  These days  it can be an investment vehicle of choice for all investors 
Getting in the Game
There are approximately 200 public companies around the world that invest in private equity  There s also a growing number of U S  mutual funds and exchange traded funds  ETFs  that do  too 
For the retail sector  you can choose between listed private equity ETFs and private equity mutual funds 
For ETFs  check out PowerShares Global Listed Private Equity  NYSE PSP  and ProShares Global Listed Private Equity  NYSE PEX   These ETFs are typically indexed to track the performance of an underlying fund 
Some examples of mutual funds are the ALPS Red Rocks Listed Private Equity    and Vista Listed Private Equity Plus    
What to Look For
So how should you compare and contrast these investment vehicles beyond just their returns 
First  look to see if the fund is a pure play PE fund  Under normal circumstances  some  such as Vista  put at least 80  of their total assets in private equity 
You really don t need to have a fund devoted 100  to the sector  as this gives the manager flexibility in the event that there s a lack of opportunity in the PE space at any given time 
Next is the expense ratio  which is the annual fee that all funds or ETFs charge their shareholders  PSP  for example  shows a net 2 05  ratio 
Then look at the total number of holdings  LPX currently has 30   as well as the top 10 holdings  which will provide a window to the portfolio s diversification  From there  look at the breakdown by sectors and industry  LPEFX  for example  is heavily weighted in financials 
The portfolio can be further diversified by geography  developed and emerging markets  as well as the stage of investment and capital structure  PEX currently has 47  of its investments outside the United States 
Diversification is typically a good thing  as long as the portfolio managers have the in house expertise to invest in these market segments 
And if you re looking for income  focus on the dividend yield  which is typically defined as the SEC 30 day yield  PSP currently yields 3 06  
Investors should also look at the amount of holdings in business development companies  BDCs   BDCs aren t private equity per se  but they invest in the debt of private companies and pay shareholders the income generated 
ALPS  for example  largely avoids BDCs  while Vista s fund has been known to carry a greater weighting in them 
Other characteristics investors should pay attention to include 
Whether funds are closed end funds  which means they aren t typically redeemable upon request  have a higher minimum requirement  and have a set number of shares for purchase 
The amount of leverage in the fund  In a low interest rate environment  leverage can be a positive  Conversely  rising interest rates can create greater risk and volatility 
The level of risk in the portfolio  using such metrics as alpha  beta  standard deviation  and Sharpe ratio over time  These are translated into the excess return over the market  the correlation to the overall market  the volatility of the portfolio  and a measure for calculating the risk adjusted return  Generally speaking  the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio  the more attractive the risk adjusted return 
Some managers invest in other PE managers  Vista lists its top two positions as Blackstone  NYSE BX  and KKR   Co LP  NYSE KKR   which adds a layer of complexity to the portfolio  as you ll then need to assess those managers as well 
Fund managers holding positions in other manager generally don t pass on those added fees to their investors  and will list a fee waiver or reimbursement in their fee structures  These fees aren t direct costs paid by shareholders  nor are they used to calculate net asset value 
Beyond Indices
Managers investing in other managers leads to my next point  You don t even need to invest in ETFs or mutual funds to get access to the big PE firms 
You can now invest in some of the PE partnerships that trade publicly  such as KKR or Apollo Globl Man  NYSE APO  and Blackstone Group 
Not only did these firms decide to go public  but they ve been rethinking their business models by launching their own mutual funds  such as the Blackstone Alternative Multi Manager Fund  BXMMX  
Private equity can offer many advantages over publicly listed stocks  And the nice part is that many PE investments are less subject to market noise and correlated to large macro moves  After all  not every investment has exposure to China 
Still  be advised that even publicly listed PE has its risks 
Even with daily liquidity  a fund s money can be locked up for several years  Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash  with limited partners having no right to demand that sales be made 
As an example  the private equity giant KKR was forced to close its two mutual funds last year after launching them less than two years prior largely due to a liquidity mismatch 
Liquidity can have its disadvantages  too  Because they re publicly traded  shares of a private equity company sometimes perform differently from those in the underlying portfolio of private businesses 
Overall  adding a bit of PE to your portfolio can add diversification and good potential returns if you have the patience to wait it out

188091,409607,BX,Circling The Toilet  Or Light At The End Of Tunnel ,opinion,"Most of you  dear friends and family  do not comment about my economic views when we chat  but I feel compelled to speak out because most of us have funds invested somewhere  I know you care  at some level  This essay may ruin my reputation with many of you  I would prefer to be wrong  and I ll eat crow if I am  but the evidence points to economic downturn in our future  It began last Friday  Why not pour a cup of coffee and read on  In the rest of this essay I ll explain what has happened with our economy and make suggestions for what you can do about it 
There is light at the end of the tunnel we have entered  And no  it s not named Sanders or Trump  Read on  Get educated  But don t read part of this essay without at least skipping to the end where I discuss the light at the end of the tunnel  What follows was not written by your old friend relative named Jerry  but by my alter personality that many of you do not know  Dr J   a well educated professor who understands something of the world financial system and the history of economics  I know what the f    I am talking about  
Search your heart  All is not well  Our economic system was irreparably broken by greed and mismanagement in 2008  Our economy has entered a slow slide into 3rd world status 
From there to here 
Prior to 2008  We had capitalist economic system where people worked hard  saved money  and invested that money to earn a return sometimes in a savings account  other times in mutual funds  Few of us traded stocks directly and even fewer understood how the financial markets really worked  But we do understand interest  I put  100 in the bank in a 4  passbook account and at the end of one year  the bank pays me 4  on the 100 a whopping  4  Now I have  104 But hey  don t get cynical  Next year I get 4  on 104  and I am also able to put far more than  100 in savings if I am frugal  It adds up  fast  Enter mutual funds  My fund made 17  for several years in the 1990s  Now we are getting somewhere  It all makes sense  Save more and invest it and one day you can retire 
The other investment most of us have entered is home ownership  In this investment we are using a thing called  leverage   Just like you can move a heavy object with a lever and fulcrum  you can make money with your home  Home values had been rising  due to inflation  about 4 5  per year sometimes faster  But banks decided that you could buy that home with a paltry 10  down payment  So with 10K down  I could buy a 100K home that rose in value by 5  per year  So my 10K down payment was enriching me by 5K per year  hey  that  s 50  per year  Wow  But wait  there is more  About 2005 banks got creative on us to lower that down payment more leverage  They also invented adjustable interest rates  By 2006 you could buy a home with 3  down  Now your 3K down payment could make you 5K in a year  a 167  gain  Sweetening the deal  the banks gave you an introductory rate of 3  interest  instead of the usual 6    You could afford a bigger house with your 3K now  This was called subprime lending a bad idea if there ever was one  Their argument was based on the assumption that home values never decline  Thus  in three years when your introductory rate adjusted up to 6   your home would be 15  more valuable  You would have options  sell at a profit or refinance into a traditional loan with your equity  Suddenly  you could afford a 200K home  We all could  I bought a place for 165K  And home prices soared   until 2008 when all those subprime loans began to reset their interest rates and county governments had doubled taxes to reflect the new values  and your house payment went from 1275 per month to 1702 per month   Professional investors saw it coming and started selling out  Home appreciation flattened out and started declining  ever faster  All of a sudden your 200K home that had risen to 230K in value  now dropped to 190K  You were underwater and the water was pouring in fast  The result  a higher foreclosure rate across the country 
All this  we understood  What we did not understand was the real problem  The banks lending us money to buy these homes had also leveraged up  borrowing the money to lend to us  They could handle the normal 3 4  foreclosure rate without upsetting the system  But with a 6  foreclosure rate  they didn t have the income to pay their own loans  Soon the rate rose to 10  Lehman Brothers was a Wall street bank that loaned tons of money to firms like Countrywide mortgage  When Countrywide could not make their payments to Lehman  it started a domino chain of foreclosures  Lehman was sacrificed and the US government stepped in with the TARP program  bailing out the other  too big to fail  banks  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae collapsed  They had been purchasing these bad loans from banks  AIG  who had guaranteed these loans  also collapsed  As the dust settled people like me were wandering in circles trying to figure out what happened 
The New Economy
The world had changed  The Banking system had collapsed  Our economy began to follow  Our central bank the Federal reserve  which is NOT actually part of the government   stepped in to help   Get to work  Mr Chairman  was ordered by Senator Schumer  D NY  as Congress recognized they were impotent to fix the economy  And Ben Bernanke did get to work  The world had changed  No longer was Congress in control  the Central Banks were in control perhaps already had been for a long time  it s just that now we knew it 
As our government debt rose  shoveling money to the unemployed  bailing out other industries  and financing foreign wars  the Central bank cut interest rates to stimulate the economy  That made borrowing cheaper for Congress and they borrowed even more funds to bail out a number of industries to save jobs  But soon  interest rates were approaching zero and the economy was not fixed  It simply did not respond the way it had in the past  But nobody would admit that things were broken 
So the Central bank began what they called QE Quantitative Easing   a term nobody understood at the time except Wall Street banks  Essentially  the Federal Reserve created digital money and loaned it free to Wall Street so they could invest it in the stock markets or whatever  And voila  stocks magically began to rise in 2009  Home values were in the toilet  but stocks were going back up  Your retirement account was saved  Can you imagine the rioting in this nation if stocks had stayed low and all of us realized that we could never retire  Fires had to be put out one at a time  1st save Wall Street  2nd  save retirement accounts  3rd was to save the housing market 
By 2010  over 10  of homes in this nation were in foreclosure and the market flooded with under priced homes for sale  Wall street had an answer   Let us buy all the foreclosed homes   First  the banks stopped listing homes for sale  Then big wall street investment companies like Blackstone  NYSE BX  began buying the foreclosures for pennies on the dollar in large lots in cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas  They became the nation s landlord  They bought these homes with money borrowed at zero   from the QE programs  They could get big money  Folks like us could not  Soon the foreclosures had worked through the court system into Wall Street hands  Then banks began making it easier for people like us to borrow for home buying again  The housing market sort of recovered 
But who was taking on most of this debt to save banks  stocks and housing  Well  the US government debt rose from 8 trillion to 18 trillion  To be fair  Wall street paid back the TARP funds 800 billion or so  But a lot of people were out of jobs and our government had wars to fight  So the US government increased war funding and made it easier to obtain and keep food and housing benefits if you were unemployed  Much of this money ended up paying rent to Blackstone and keeping the economy afloat  Government subsidies and zero  interest rates saved the auto industry  But is this situation healthy  Rising government debt and nearly 50  of our citizens receiving aid  Is that an economic recovery  Part time jobs counted in the employment statistics  30  of young adults  under 30  living with their parents  Interest rates set at zero so that retirees investing in US T bills  used to pay 5   now just receive about 2    less than the actual inflation rate  Thus retirees continue to work and hold down jobs everywhere  No wonder my kids have trouble finding good enough employment to get their own apartments  Is this a recovery 
No  we have not recovered  Our financial system is broken  with Wall street criminals still leeching out our blood  The US economy has been staggering  The coach and trainers have jumped in the ring loaded with sponges full of QE to keep Mr  Economy from totally collapsing  but this boxer is not ready to go back out and punch in a competitive world  We have merely propped up a nearly dead boxer and continued to promote him as the world champion 
That is where my expertise comes in  I have a PhD in Rhetoric the art of propaganda  spin  bullshitting  argumentation  logic  I was mentored by one of the top professors in our field  at two fine programs  and have been taught in classes and seminars by other top profs in that same field  My education is second to none 
Being naturally shy  I don t argue in person well  but give me a  hour to analyze something someone says or writes and I can sniff out the BS like a bloodhound trailing a rabbit  I was also a professor of Mass Communication for 11 years and I thoroughly understand our media and journalism sectors  I tell you the truth  and I lie not  the mainstream media  at their best  presents only part of the news  At worst  which is often  the news media will overemphasize preferred stories  and even worser er  they will promote outright lies published monthly by various government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics  The mainstream news media has served our banks and government by persuading most of us that the economy is recovering  even while in our gut  we know something is still wrong  Claims that everyone who wants to work is back to work and that we have only 1 7  inflation simply do not resonate with our daily lives 
So what is true about the future of our economy  That is a hard question  But several facts support a dismal outlook  Interest rates are at zero  Savers cannot retire  So money looks for a return the stock market where there is risk  Capitalism is built on solid savings and entrepreneurs borrowing this saved money for new ventures  That system is broken and will not return until the Central Bank raises interest rates back to normal say 5   But interest rates cannot rise  When you are 18 trillion in debt  like the US government  a rise of 1  in interest rates will cost US taxpayers another 180 billion on top of an already insolvent budget  Not gonna happen  5  will cost us a trillion more per year  Interest rates will not rise beyond a paltry quarter of a point  just for show and bragging rights  Three doses of quantitative easing kept the boxer standing  but he s still in no shape to go out and fight  The Federal Reserve has admitted QE was ineffective  But our economy is still being propped up with cheap credit  The job situation is deteriorating  A single job opening that will support a family is swamped with a hundred applicants jobs that were easy to land in 1990 
Now we get to the point of this essay 
The economic system is greatly damaged and the financial system is broken  We have pumped up the housing bubble  But  Blackstone is selling out at the top  Home prices are now declining  Auto dealers have their lots crammed full of unsold cars  Jobs are hard to find  The stock markets have been stalled for 7 months now they are falling  This is a signal 
Increasingly  serious economic analysts are agreeing that our economy will begin to deteriorate further beginning in September  Only the mainstream pundits on CNBC  the NYT  or WSJ are saying  all is well   They are paid actors in front of a camera  paid journalists who do not trade securities  not genuine analysts  The Alternative news analysts increasingly agree that a  collapse  is eminent  They don t write about  if  it will fail  but rather  when and how bad  Most are pointing to this September as the start  Wall Street has a deep correction or collapse every seven years  This is the year  It has already begun  Each seven years  the corrections and collapses have worsened 
My well educated colleagues at work are asking my opinion on this  They know I study markets  but have never asked before  I sense nervousness about the future from many people 
So  I ll stick my neck out here and make some predictions 

As September progresses  we enter a deep stock correction  You can stay in the ocean if you want  but I am sitting this one out until the lifeguards give the  all clear  at a lower level  Take your IRA profits now  move to cash and sit tight until the sharks are out of the water and the blood dissipates  It may take until Spring  as it did in 08 
During the correction period  next 6 months   our central banks of the world will make an announcement  yes  this will be a world event   Something with the financial system will be changed in an effort to fix it  But if this fix works  it will take time  and in the meantime  the economy will continue to suffer over the next year  We will all be affected 
The dollar will lose its place as the world trading currency  This may take a few years to fully manifest  China  Russia and about 20 other nations are steadily working for this to happen  This will cause the price of gasoline to match the levels we see in Europe  China announced that it has begun selling all its US treasuries over 100 billion worth last month  This is bad for the dollar  folks 
There may be a new war announced  The US government has a long history of creating a war to provide cover for poor economic health or simply to have someone else to blame our problems on  We have been pushing for war in Syria  now Ukraine  So far  cooler heads are prevailing 
We will enter a worldwide depression over the rest of 2015 and into 2016  Things are going to get rough 
There will be a movement to increase the role of the International Monetary Fund  IMF  to stabilize world economies and replace the dollar as the world trading currency  Governments around the world will begin falling apart 
The US will continue its move away from capitalism and toward socialism  But socialism only works when everyone has good jobs and can afford the higher taxes AND is satisfied with a lower standard of living  Increasing government debt to pay for socialist programs will not work for long  especially when the US is starting in an  18 trillion hole  just like Greece did 

What can you do 

Do not panic  be reasonable  but take action  get ready 
If you have money in the bank or securities that you can sell  cash out  Pay off your home if you can  Why have a house payment anyway  For the tax deduction  Ha  Do the math  You are better off not paying all that interest to banks and paying a couple thousand extra in tax  I d love to have that extra  900 in my budget each month instead of  1600 back on the tax 
Buy gold  Historically  30  of your net worth is the rule of thumb for surviving depressions  You can get one ounce coins and bars for a good price right now  Do not pay more than 4  over the published price for bars  nor over 6  for coins  But many local and online dealers are running out  We ll see if they are able to restock next month  You can t eat it  but it will preserve your money through whatever happens  Don t tell anyone you have it  A whole lot of money will fit in your hand in golden form  Hide it well  inconspicuously  A safe is actually a bad place  An old coffee can covered with nails or metal bolts on the shelf in your garage is better 
If the state goes broke  I could lose my paycheck  So  we are saving up cash  at home  enough to get by for a couple of months  Why at home  Because banks could close their doors like they did in Cyprus and Greece  Remember  our banking system is international and all Western countries have passed the same laws about bank closures and bail ins  America passed them as well by executive order in the past year  Yes  it can happen here and probably will for a short time  The US dollar is what is at risk here 

If things deteriorate towards depression after September  there are other steps to take 

How many days can you eat with what is in your pantry  We are storing up enough food for a couple of months dry and canned goods  foods we normally purchase that have a good shelf life just in case the  just in time  food delivery system in this nation is disrupted by banking failures  If so  they will get it fixed and running again  but in the meantime  I don t want to stand in a food line if I don t have to  We are buying bottled water also 
We may move temporarily to nearby small town if Baltimore style rioting begins here in the city where we live  I don t want to be stuck in a large or medium sized population area if banks and stores close for a few weeks  not with 50  of our citizens receiving government aid to survive  I don t expect this  but we have made arrangements 

The actions we are taking are simple and minor  They are sensible  I am NOT advocating doomsday prepping  embracing conspiracy theories and evacuating to the hills  Rather  take simple action  action that will not have cost you a dime after the financial system is rebuilt  Your risk in getting ready is minimal  The risk in being caught flat footed is huge  Just move your assets to a safe place and be sure you can make it through a couple of months of supply disruptions  just in case Greece comes to America 
Light at the end of the tunnel 
Yes  A broken system has come to its final days years  We will have to rebuild this country  Read a book called  The Fourth Turning  by sociologists Strauss   Howe  We have entered the fourth economic political cycle that always ushers in great changes usually emerging from war and depression  Their data goes back to the 1600s  Our youth  with the guidance of old farts like some of us  will rebuild this world  Hopefully they can sweep out the criminals and corrupt politicians and begin again with idealists and practical people to do the dirty work of rebuilding 
I am dead serious  I am not panicking or trying to fear monger  But I can imagine that many of you will be downright pissed at me if I had NOT warned of the possibilities  even if only one third of this comes to pass   Why didn t you f ing  say something  
I d rather you think me crazy if  somehow  this broken system manages to survive  According to Strauss   Howe  it would be a  first  in 400 years

188092,409608,BX,Drones  Drills And Gold,opinion,"These are still early days at Skeena Resources   TO SKE  Spectrum gold project  located in B C  s Golden Triangle  but early signs are promising  It s where Skeena chairman Ron Netolitzky is going for his third home run after his involvement with the Snip and Eskay Creek discoveries of the 1980s and  90s  Both went on to become high grade producers and are now held by Barrick  Ron believes Spectrum shows the same potential 
The well funded junior is sufficiently encouraged by early intercepts  including visible gold showings  that it has increased the size of its drill program from 10 000 metres to 16 000 metres as it defines mineralized zones and hunts for new targets  Through prospecting  rock sampling and geochemical anomalies  Skeena recently recognized 9 new targets away from Central mineralized zones  According to Ron  the soil anomalies of up to 19 5 g t Au and rock chips containing 52 5 g t Au are unlikely to have bled from the existing Central mineralized zone and are  very hard to ignore  
The latest drill results  announced on Sept  8  offer intriguing hints at what could lie underneath the surface  Hole S15 15 intersected 26 15 metres grading 8 21 g t Au  including 2m grading 74 5 g t  Other high grade hits on the property have included 14 9 m grading 8 97 g t Au  including 2 9 m grading 38 5 g t Au and 8 00 m grading 10 46 g t Au and 8 3 g t Ag  including 2 3 m of 33 33 g t Au 
 We know it s got a lot of gold  and we know from our surface results and from prospecting and from soil geochemistry   this is much stronger than anything I ve worked on in the Golden Triangle   said Netolitzky  who has worked in northwestern B C  on and off for over 35 years 
Assays have now been released from 21 of 53 drill holes completed at Spectrum this year  As many as 25 additional holes are expected to be drilled between now and when the snow comes  usually sometime in late October  Eighty percent of the holes drilled to date have yielded intervals exceeding 5 g t over 2 metres  and 25  have visible gold showings  the company says  Assays will be released as they are available throughout the fall and early winter 
 This is a large  robust system of mineralization   said Skeena CEO Walter Coles   We keep finding more high grade prospects and that should allow us more chances to discover and drill off relatively shallow high grade resources  That is how we are going to build ounces  
Skeena s objective is to identify a high grade underground gold resource that will support a significant mine life  A historic  non 43 101 compliant resource estimate on the property was pegged at 243 600 ounces of gold  based on 614 000 tonnes grading 12 g t at a 5 g t cutoff  The property was dormant for 22 years because of provincial park and right of way issues  which were recently resolved 
Netolitzky  named to the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame earlier this year  says the Spectrum mineralization reminds him of several area plays  including SnipGold Corp  TO SGG   Silback Premier and a most impressive neighbour  Pretium s  TO PVG  high grade underground Brucejack project 
Pretium s gold project has proven and probable reserves of 6 9 million ounces  13 6 million tonnes   15 7 g t Au   The gold developer took a giant leap forward Sept  15 with the announcement of a US 540 million construction financing with Orion Mine Finance and Blackstone  NYSE BX  Tactical Opportunities  The deal closed Monday 
Skeena s Spectrum is at a much earlier  more speculative stage  But it s a speculation backed by deep pocketed investors who funded a recent  8 1 million financing and directed by a mine finder who likes what he sees  so far  Skeena has strong institutional support thanks to CEO Coles  connections on Wall Street  where he worked prior to becoming involved with Skeena 
 Frankly  we re still learning   Netolitzky said of the geological puzzle   But we feel with the amount of drilling we ve done this year  once we have the assays in hand we will have a very good handle on what controls the mineralization and how to explore for it  We are very encouraged that will translate into new deposits and new zones  
With the rare ability to raise capital in a serious down market  Skeena also has the potential to add to its project portfolio if the right opportunity arises  Netolitzky has said he is particularly interested in other opportunities in the Golden Triangle  Skeena recently ended attempts to combine with Dolly Varden Silver Corp   DV v   an area play that has geological similarities with Eskay Creek

188093,409609,BX,Special Report  Spiders  sewage and fees   the other side of renting from Wall Street,news,"By Michelle Conlin ESPARTO  California  Reuters    The rental home seemed so beautiful when McKayla Ferreira first laid eyes on it  The roof had three gables  fruit trees grew in the backyard  and the front porch gleamed with a fresh coat of paint   Then Ferreira moved in   First  she noticed water leaking through the bathroom and kitchen ceilings  Then she found a furry black mold spreading across the walls and raw sewage sluicing through the crawl space  Worst  to her  were the black widow spiders swarming her kitchen cupboards and linen closets   Those spiders were so big you could hear them   Ferreira said   They sounded like fingernails scraping a table   Ferreira called her landlord   Invitation Homes Inc   N INVH   a creation of private equity giant Blackstone Group LP  N BX   The spiders were a  housekeeping issue   the company representative told her  and she should  clean the place up   Invitation Homes wasn t enthusiastic about fixing the leaks  either  Two months passed before it sent someone to cut through the ceiling and fix the pipes  Ferreira said  Then the company took seven more months to patch it all up  By the time the next tenants  Jennifer and Mike White  settled into the house on Craig Street  the spiders had been joined by colonies of roaches and ants  the couple said  After Whitney Hurst and her family moved into the property last year  Hurst said  she immediately called in a work order for a long list of complaints  including leaky pipes  vermin and a broken garage door that nearly fell on her children  She said the repairman who showed up to fix one of the leaks told her that he didn t have the right wrench for the job and to  have your husband fix it    I have given up calling them   Hurst said  sitting in a lawn chair in her driveway  while her two boys  ages 3 and 9  played hide and seek inside   I mean  there are spiders in my kids  toys   An Invitation Homes spokeswoman acknowledged that the house had some problems when Ferreira rented it  including roof and plumbing leaks and  a spider issue   The company said it compensated Ferreira  887 30 for maintenance and utility billing issues caused by the plumbing leak  plus two weeks  rent  It said its records show that other issues with subsequent tenants have been  minimal    termites and a problem with the heating and cooling system   and that they were addressed  Invitation Homes pitches itself as a singular landlord providing unprecedented ease and comfort for renters of its tens of thousands of single family homes  But in interviews with scores of the company s tenants in neighborhoods across the United States  the picture that emerges isn t as much one of exceptional service as it is one of leaky pipes  vermin  toxic mold  nonfunctioning appliances and months long waits for repairs  Tenants also complain about excessive rent increases and fees that can add up to hundreds of dollars a year  In a proposed class action lawsuit filed in May in the U S  District Court for Northern California  renters accuse the company of  fee stacking   They allege that Invitation Homes charges tenants  95 if their rent is one minute late   even if the late payment is due to the company s own nonfunctioning online payment portal   and then files an eviction notice to add more fees  penalties and legal costs if the tenant wants to stay in the home  Invitation Homes filed a motion on July 20 to dismiss the case  saying the suit did not substantiate that the company s fees were  unfair  and that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert the claims on behalf of tenants nationwide  This is far from the alluring vision of life in a rental home that Invitation Homes has promoted since Blackstone  the world s largest private equity firm  built the company on the wreckage of the foreclosure crisis  As a Blackstone vehicle  Invitation Homes led Wall Street s charge into the single family home rental business  snapping up houses at fire sale prices  After its merger last November with Starwood Waypoint Homes  another private equity backed foray into the market  Invitation Homes became the largest landlord of single family homes in the United States by number of rental units  Today  Invitation Homes manages 82 000 properties  most of them entry level three  and four bedroom houses in 17 metropolitan areas concentrated in the Sun Belt  Its portfolio   though still less than one percent of the overall single family rental market   is 58 percent larger than that of its nearest competitor  American Homes 4 Rent  PROMOTING THE GOOD LIFE With its vast resources  Dallas  Texas based Invitation Homes boasts that it has revolutionized the business of managing single family rental homes and the experience of living in them  In a traditionally fusty mom and pop business  it says in marketing materials  it has created a uniquely  worry free  living environment that promises  peace of mind  with  exceptional resident services   including  24 7 emergency maintenance   Chief Operating Officer Charles Young disputed tenant allegations of slumlord like behavior  He noted that Invitation Homes serves hundreds of thousands of customers a year and that in internal company surveys  those tenants give the company 4 32 out of 5 stars   From time to time  things happen   Young said in an interview   But when there s an issue  we work hard to resolve it as quickly as we can   Affordable housing advocates  real estate professionals and other critics of Wall Street s push into the rental market say the tenant complaints suggest that rapid growth has stretched Invitation Homes  ability to manage its properties  They also assert that there s a deeper problem  Invitation Homes  like some of its Wall Street backed peers  adheres to a business model that pressures it to lean hard on tenants to satisfy investors  These companies have financed their growth by selling billions of dollars in bonds   the rental market equivalent of the mortgage backed securities that led to the financial crisis   to pension funds and other big institutions  Industry critics say that to keep payments to bond investors rolling  companies like Invitation Homes must minimize maintenance costs and maximize rents and fees   We see securitization of rental income as highly problematic   said Kevin Stein  deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition  a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing  Among other things  he said  it  pits Wall Street investors against Invitation tenants   Among those tenants is Contrell Wethersby in Atlanta  who told Reuters she had to go for more than a year without heat or a functioning refrigerator  stove  microwave or garage door   not to mention having to endure a leaky ceiling and black mold  Invitation Homes said it is committed to operating in accordance with all federal  state and local housing laws  It said its records showed that Wethersby s issues did not persist for any significant length of time and that work crews had trouble scheduling with her  The company did not provide its records for Wethersby or any other tenants  Some renters  like Willie Jean Brister in Los Angeles  have seen their rent increase by as much as 50 percent over three years  During that time  Brister has filed work orders for an exterminator and repairs on a bathtub  faucets  bathroom door  cabinet doors  fence  hot water and garbage disposal   all of them reviewed by Reuters on the company s web portal  The grandmother with five children in the house said the portal keeps saying    work completed   but the work is never completed  You get worn out  like you are paying all this rent and not getting any services   Others  like Heather Tolaro  said they and their children became ill from toxic mold in their houses  Tolaro sued Invitation Homes in federal court in Illinois  alleging that the company refused to acknowledge or fix the problem  The case was settled for undisclosed terms  Rosa D Amico said that after one heavy rain  she watched as water poured into her Chicago rental home  destroying much of her personal property  The house  stinking of sewage  was uninhabitable  Invitation Homes eventually agreed for D Amico and her family to move to a different house  but she said she had to pay the  1 800 bill for the move  Then that house flooded   It was poop water  sewer water  so I had to throw everything out   D Amico said   And they never paid me a penny   She now lives in a rental nearby  The company said it was pleased to continue to serve the Bristers  It said its records show that all the repairs Brister had requested were made  to which Brister responded   They patch things  they don t fix things   It declined to comment on Tolaro s case  citing the confidential settlement  As for D Amico  Invitation Homes confirmed that the first house  suffered water damage   It described the problem with the second house as an  odor  resulting from dry traps in the sink  floor and laundry drains  all of which were  serviced   Invitation Homes went public in February 2017  Blackstone still owns a 42 percent stake  valued at  5 1 billion  Blackstone is now in the process of buying a majority stake in the financial services division of Thomson Reuters Corp  owner of Reuters News  in a deal valued at  20 billion  The transaction is expected to close in late summer  Blackstone and its chief executive officer  Stephen Schwarzman  declined to comment for this article  NO OTHER CHOICE In the interview  Invitation Homes COO Young said that rather than putting the squeeze on renters  the company s business model gives families the  optionality and freedom  to live in the kinds of good homes in good school districts near good jobs that they may not be able to afford to buy   We are providing a housing option that didn t exist before   he said  He rejected assertions that the company skimps on repairs and maintenance to support payouts to investors   In the consumer business  we know things are not always spot on   he said   We ultimately are trying to do the right thing by our communities and for our residents to provide the service we can live up to   Young also reiterated the company s assertion that its investments in renovations and property upkeep have helped foreclosure ravaged neighborhoods recover  and that 70 percent of its tenants renew their leases  At Reuters  request  the company provided the names of five satisfied renters  Two responded  saying they were pleased with the company  One of them  Melissa Grant of Atlanta  said Invitation Homes was an  awesome company  for  among other things  making homes  available to families like me who are in the military and need to move around a lot   The other three tenants did not respond to repeated phone messages  Some tenants told Reuters they renewed not because they loved their rentals  but because they felt they had to  The company owns so much of the available housing in their neighborhoods that they had no alternatives if they wanted to keep their kids in the same school  or remain close to jobs or relatives  And moving itself is a big expense   You can t just jump up and move with children   Brister said  While Invitation Homes  portfolio represents less than one percent of single family rental homes nationwide  the figure can be much higher in markets where the company s inventory is concentrated  In some neighborhoods in California  for example  Invitation Homes owns as much as 25 percent of single family rentals  according to an analysis of Census and property data by Maya Abood  a former researcher with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Urban Planning Program who co authored a recent study titled  Wall Street Landlords Turn American Dream into American Nightmare   Invitation Homes has been raising rents by as much as an average of 10 percent a year in places like Oakland  California   nearly double the norm in that market   according to the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment  ACCE   an advocacy group  At the same time  the company has been adding to the types of fees it charges tenants   not just for late payments  but for things like rent paid on debit cards  which incurs a  30 charge  Fees have helped lift earnings by 20 to 30 percent a year  In a recent earnings call  the company attributed rising profits in part to its  system  to  track resident delinquency on a daily basis   This system allows the company to start charging fees and penalties the minute a tenant fails to pay on time  The company s stock price has risen about 11 percent since last year s initial public offering  Wall Street analysts have almost uniformly rated the stock a  buy   Analysts  optimism reflects  in part  that while scores of federal  state and local rules protect homebuyers when taking out a mortgage and renters in multi unit apartment buildings  few protections exist for tenants of single family homes  housing lawyers and affordable housing advocates said   Allowing hedge funds and private equity firms to speculate on housing with little to no public oversight or regulation puts families at greater risk of unfair rent increases and evictions  and threatens the right to housing itself   Abood said  A December 2016 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta analysis found that Wall Street landlords are far more likely to file eviction notices than mom and pop landlords  It said Colony Starwood   as Starwood Waypoint was known until shortly before the merger with Invitation Homes   filed eviction notices on more than 30 percent of tenants  while Invitation Homes filed notices on nearly 15 percent  The strongest predictor of whether a tenant would get an eviction notice was if the tenant was African American  the Atlanta Fed said  The analysis didn t specify which companies were responsible for the eviction notices disproportionately filed on African Americans  Invitation Homes said it treats all residents equally  The company spokesperson noted that an eviction notice is a  procedural step  in a landlord s effort to collect rent  and that  the vast majority of those who received eviction notices ultimately were resolved without the resident being put out of their home   In California  groups of Invitation Homes tenants  organized by ACCE  have stormed the offices of Blackstone three times to demand an end to what they say are the business s worst practices  such as forgoing repairs and hiking rents  Last October  more than three dozen renters of homes across Los Angeles burst through the front door of Blackstone s headquarters in Santa Monica  shaking noisemakers  honking sirens and chanting through megaphones   Hey  Blackstone  shame on you    Slumlord   and   You being evicted  Blackstone   Blackstone executives rushed out of the building through the emergency exits and the back door  On office desks  the tenants left letters addressed to Blackstone CEO Schwarzman  asking for a moratorium on rent increases  an end to  outrageous fees   proper maintenance on homes and a meeting with Blackstone executives  After 20 minutes  security personnel threw them out  An Invitation Homes spokesperson said the company got back to all the renters about their complaints  Lupita Gonzalez  the ACCE organizer  said   We never heard anything  We never heard back   Reuters was able to contact four of the renters who participated in the October protest  all of whom said they never heard from the company  KEEPING INVESTORS HAPPY The business of being landlord of a single family home was for years a small  local affair  But after the 2008 financial crisis  Wall Street saw an opportunity  Buy houses in bulk in  strike zones   industry parlance for high foreclosure neighborhoods with good schools  well maintained transportation systems and healthy job growth  Then the firms could rent the properties to the kinds of families that would normally buy   householders who are on average 39 years old with young children and an average income of  100 000 or more  Today  nine big Wall Street firms collectively own more than 200 000 single family homes in 13 states  Invitation Homes says it spent an average of  200 000 per house to build its portfolio  and  22 000 each on renovations and repairs  To pay for all of that  it pioneered a new asset class  so called single family rental securities  or SFRs  Since 2013  Wall Street landlords have sold more than  15 billion of the bonds  As supply has tightened and prices risen in real estate markets  Invitation Homes has slowed expansion of its portfolio  Now  it largely rolls over existing bonds  paying investors out of rent and fees from tenants  In September  the government sponsored entity Fannie Mae lent its blessing to this new market  guaranteeing the refinancing on a  1 billion Invitation Homes rental backed bond  That imprimatur prompted more than 25 groups   affordable housing advocates like the Community Home Lenders Association and rival business groups such as the National Association of Realtors   to complain to Fannie Mae s overseer  the Federal Housing Finance Authority  FHFA   that the deal strayed from Fannie Mae s stated mission of supporting home ownership  Invitation Homes  business model  they said  risked pushing up rents and reducing the inventory of affordable homes  Corinne Russell  spokesperson for the FHFA  said the agency had authorized such transactions to help Fannie Mae and its sibling agency  Freddie Mac   understand the challenges and opportunities in the single family rental market   and help FHFA assess what role  if any  the Enterprises should play in this market going forward   A spokesman for Fannie Mae said   This transaction is a great opportunity to continue to serve the growing single family rental market  Invitation Homes is a strong partner with deep experience managing a large volume of single family rental properties   Just as Fannie Mae was lending its federally backed support to one of Invitation Homes  bonds  regulators began looking into the securities  At issue are the home valuations Invitation Homes relied on for its bonds  The higher the valuation  the higher the expected rent  and thus the more investors are willing to pay for the bonds  To get a mortgage  homebuyers typically must have a licensed inspector conduct an appraisal of the house  To price its bonds  however  Invitation Homes relied on so called broker price opinions  or BPOs  These less expensive alternatives were provided mostly by outside firms using independent contractors who were not licensed appraisers  Many of these contractors relied only on exterior views of the houses   no interior inspections   according to regulatory filings  The filings also indicate that the contractors were told to assume that the interiors had been remodeled to the standards advertised on the Invitation Homes website  Congress outlawed BPOs after the foreclosure crisis  but the ban doesn t apply to institutional investors buying homes in bulk  In September  Invitation Homes disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting documents and communications related to its securitizations  In its accompanying letter to Invitation Homes  the SEC said it was looking at the valuations the company relied on to price its bonds  The SEC would not comment on the investigation  nor would Invitation Homes  In its regulatory filing  the company said   The SEC letter indicates that its investigation is a fact finding inquiry and does not mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person or security  We are cooperating with the SEC   A look inside the bond that Fannie Mae backed shows how Invitation Homes  model is working  From each of the 7 204 houses bundled into the bond  the Fannie Mae prospectus shows  the company earned in 2016 an average monthly rent of  1 538 and  985 in annual  other income   defined as fees for  among other things   pets or cleaning   At the same time  the company spent an average of  1 142 a year on repairs  maintenance and turnover costs  based on the bond data  That s less than the  3 100 a year Americans tend to spend on maintenance  repairs and improvements on houses of the same age as Invitation Homes  portfolio  according to an analysis of the U S  Census Bureau s American Housing Survey by BTIG equity analyst Ryan Gilbert  The company said the  1 142 figure is  not representative  because it doesn t include the  750 the company reserves per home for capital expenditures should the property need a  major system replacement   Five former employees said Invitation Homes routinely didn t spend enough on repairs or hire enough contractors to get the job done  One former maintenance contractor said that he oversaw 2 000 homes scattered across one metropolis and that he couldn t possibly keep up  On a recent tour the company provided for Reuters in Atlanta  executives walked through a newly renovated four bedroom house in a development called Legacy Court  where tenants have access to tennis courts  a pool  pocket parks and a community center  The executives led Reuters on what they said was their standard walk through prior to every rental  entailing inspection of 250 items   A maintenance manager checked every knob  outlet  spout  latch  doorstop  lightbulb  blind and appliance  He ran the dishwasher  filled the tub and tested the garbage disposal   We test  touch and feel everything  fixture by fixture  before renting out the house   he said  STILL RENTING Income from the house with the black widow spiders on Craig Street in Esparto  California  is in the Fannie Mae backed bond  The house had been owned by the same couple for nearly 10 years before they lost it to foreclosure in 2012  For five months  the house sat empty  Then  in September 2012  property records show  Fannie Mae sold it to Blackstone for  173 000  The following year  McKayla Ferreira moved in  Around the time she began noticing the spiders and the sewage  Blackstone was packaging the house s rental income into one of its bonds  Though the Fannie Mae bond does not break out address level data  Reuters was able to identify the Craig Street house by cross referencing the bond s data with local property records  sales documents and other information  The bond notes that Invitation Homes spent  370 in 2016 on maintenance and repairs for the Craig Street house  The company said costs associated with the house should also include lease turnover expenses   what a landlord spends to prepare a house for a new renter   which added  2 703 to 2016 expenses  Ferreira said she paid her rent on time  but Invitation Homes often claimed it never received the money and staple gunned eviction notices to her front door  It insisted she pay a 10 percent late fee  plus other penalties  on her  1 300 a month rent   or lose her lease  Ferreira would send canceled checks to the company  only to watch the same scenario unfold the following month   Invitation Homes acknowledged that when Ferreira was a tenant  the company was  in its infancy  and that some billing and receivables systems had  yet to be refined   The company also said it reversed the charges and had established additional processes  to help prevent this from occurring in the future   Two subsequent renters said some billing errors continued  Invitation Homes said its records show no such issues  All three families had hoped to save money while living on Craig Street for a down payment to buy a home  All said that fees and unexpected expenses ate into those savings

188094,409610,BX,U S  REITs Led Most Major Asset Classes Higher Last Week,opinion,"Last week delivered another positive run for most of the world s risky assets  Although the gains were relatively modest vs  the  weekly surge through Oct  9  the generally bullish bias for the five trading days through Oct  16 marks a second week of higher prices for the  based on a set of representative ETFs 
Leading the pack higher  US real estate investment trusts for the week just passed  The 1 3  total return for the Vanguard REIT  N VNQ  is the best performance  edging out the 1 0  increase for foreign corporate bonds via PowerShares International Corporate Bond  N PICB   In third place  emerging market stocks  which added another weekly gain after the previous week s hefty rise 
The big loser last week  commodities  broadly defined  The iPath Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Exp 12 June 2036  N DJP  shed 1 7  

The recent rebound in asset prices is starting to bring back positive comparisons in the year over year scorecard  Five of the major asset classes via ETF proxies are now showing modest gains for the year through Oct  16  US REITs  VNQ  are at the front of the line here as well  posting a nearly 12  total return for the trailing one year period  252 trading days  through last week s close 

What s behind the popularity of REITs these days  Two possible explanations are on the short list  One is the ongoing allure of relatively high yields at a time of unusually low interest rates  Morningstar  that VNQ s trailing 12 month yield is 4 14  double the payout rate for the benchmark 10 Year Treasury as of Friday  Oct  16  
A second source of support for REITs  an attractive landscape for mergers and acquisitions  Institutional Investor  that the recent discount in the price of REIT shares relative to the value of the underlying properties has triggered a  buying spree   including three acquisitions by the Blackstone  N BX   The II article advises 

REITs traded at an average discount of 13  as of Oct  1  according to real estate research firm Green Street Advisors  which estimates the value of the properties in a REIT s portfolio and compares that total with the company s market capitalization  The discount was even bigger a few weeks earlier  It neared 20  during the market swoon of August and September  but REIT prices have bounced back a bit since then 

What might temper or even derail the current love affair with REITs  An interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve wouldn t help  For the moment  however  tighter monetary policy is considered a low probability event for the near term future  New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley  quoted in an Italian newspaper late last week  says it s too early to consider a rate hike   The situation changed over the last few months   Dudley explained to CorrierEconomia   It s true we thought we could raise interest rates by the end of 2015  but turbulence on financial markets  modest global growth  energy prices and macro prudential imbalances are slowing this process down  
Fed funds futures at the moment tend to agree with Dudley s analysis  The probability of a rate hike this month is less than 5   according to CME Group s  For December  the probability rises to roughly 30  
When and if the crowd changes its outlook and sees a rate hike as imminent  REITs could suffer  But in the current climate  the crowd s inclined to raise allocations to publicly traded real estate securities ",2015-10-19,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-reits-led-most-major-asset-classes-higher-last-week-268538,268538

188112,409628,BX,Blackstone  Moved Higher In Stair Step Fashion,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Blackstone  NYSE BX   has moved higher in a stair step fashion since bottoming with the market in October  The steps up have been equal in length as shown by the purple arrows  They have been typically followed by a slight pullback and then a run to a new high and consolidation  Each time the 20 day SMA has played a role as both support and a launching spot 
Heading into the week the price has visited the 20 day SMA again after a slight pullback  This makes for a possible low risk entry point  It has room to move higher within the Bollinger Bands  and the RSI is in the bullish zone  The MACD has pulled back but it has been so shallow and a flat angle that a break higher could change that quite quickly  There is no resistance above the April 20th high at 42 75 and support lower may come at 40 75 and 39 30 before 37 50 
The stock has weekly options and the May 8 Expiry shows open interest clustered from 41 50 to 42 50 on the call side but lower from 39 to 41 on the put side  There is a similar view on the May monthly options but at much bigger size  Finally June open interest pushes a little further to the upside from 40 through 44 and is focused at 36 on the put side  The company is not due to report earnings next until July 15th and it pays a fat dividend of nearly 8   It has short interest of 2 3   pretty low 
The Blackstone Group LP  NYSE BX 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock with a stop at 40 25  under the 20 day SMA  A straight stock but 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the May 42 Calls  offered at 70 cents late Friday   A defined risk way to trade the stock 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the June 42 Calls   1 14   Also defined risk but with more time 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the June 38 42 bullish Risk Reversal  88 cents   Adding leverage with protection to the last consolidation area 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the June 38 42 44 Call Spread Risk Reversal  52 cents   Capping the upside in the prior trade but giving a possible 4 1 reward to risk ratio 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into May sees the equity markets continuing to look better on the longer timeframe but a bit shakier on the shorter timeframe 
Elsewhere look for Goldto consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index has pulled back to a critical level where a reversal could be expected but more downside a character change while US Treasuries continue to be biased lower  The Shanghai Composite may finally be consolidating in its uptrend while Emerging Markets are showing some downside risk due to a wider consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look a bit vulnerable in the short term despite the support and moves higher Friday  with the IWM the weakest and the SPY and QQQ in consolidation zones  The QQQ chart looks the best on the longer timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

188113,409629,BX,Blackstone Group Stock Moving Higher,opinion,"The Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group stock has had a series of moves higher since making a low with the market in October 2014  It was a Top 10 pick in the Premium service a few weeks back and delivered  But maybe you missed the chance to get in this steady stock  If so  no problem  the market is giving you a second chance  No need to chase Steve Schwarzman into the elevator 
There are two major things to note in the chart below beyond the beautiful trend higher form October  The first is that the 20 day SMA  the line in the middle of the Bollinger Bands   has acted as support many times  The second is that if the price goes below that 20 day SMA  then the lower Bollinger Band has been support  Simple right 


But which one will it be this time  A very close look reveals that when the Bollinger Bands are wide on a relative basis  like they are now  the 20 day SMA has been support  When it hits that level it has reversed higher  But when the Bollinger Bands are tight  they have been the place where price has bounced 
There are no guarantees that what has happened in the past will happen again  And that is usually the problem that most non technicians have with this type of analysis  They take it as certainty instead of possibility  This means you need to employ risk management techniques as well  like a stop loss  But understand  when the price pulls back to the 20 day SMA with broad Bollinger Bands  if you are not looking for a reversal you may miss your chance again

188114,409630,BX,Why I m Holding No Fixed Income Securities Right Now,opinion,"The CEO of Blackstone  NYSE BX   Steve Schwarzman wrote an editorial in the Wall Street Journal yesterday warning about the state of liquidity in fixed income markets  In the editorial he wrote that regulation has created significant instability for the financial system 
This marks the third major financial sector CEO to make this warning and we should all be paying attention to what they re saying  In yesterday s editorial Schwarzman wrote 

 The Volcker Rule  bans proprietary trading by banks  The prohibition  when combined with enhanced capital and liquidity requirements  has led banks to avoid some market making functions in certain key equity and debt markets  This has reduced liquidity in the trading markets  especially for debt 

This echoes sentiment expressed by Jamie Dimon  CEO of JP Morgan  in his letter to shareholders earlier this year 

 market depth is far lower than it was  and we believe that is a precursor of liquidity The likely explanation for the lower depth in almost all bond markets is that inventories of market makers  positions are dramatically lower than in the past Inventories are lower   not because of one new rule but because of the multiple new rules that affect market making  including far higher capital and liquidity requirements and the pending implementation of the Volcker Rule  

And Larry Fink  the CEO of BlackRock  has been saying the same thing since October 

 we are worried about the liquidity in the fixed income market especially in the corporate bond area importantly this is the big role that the investment bankers and Wall Street played in terms of providing balance sheet and that balance sheet has been reduced significantly  And so it does at times present liquidity issues  

The most important thing about these warnings is that these are three of the best CEOs in the financial sector  Jamie Dimon  Larry Fink and Steve Schwarzman are each second to none within their respective industries  Combined they represent almost  7 trillion in financial assets  which is roughly 10  of all financial assets in the United States  When these three are speaking it s worth listening 
Here s an explanation of what they re talking about 
Unlike equity markets that are traded on exchange  fixed income markets are traded  over the counter   This means that when you buy or sell a bond an investment bank like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs  facilitates the trade  If you are a seller of a bond  Goldman will buy that bond from you and sell it to another of its clients at a slight mark up 
Before the financial crisis  investment banks could  use their balance sheet  to purchase your bond whether or not an immediate buyer could be found  They would  make a market  and hold the bond in their own inventory 
This inventory was a primary source of leverage on bank balance sheets before the financial crisis  In fact  part of the reason that asset prices were crushed in 2008 was that banks were liquidating this inventory  Think of it like a retailer closing down a location  The entire store went 50  off 
After 2008  regulation restricted banks from rebuilding inventory to prior levels  This made the banks more stable  but now if you want to sell a bond the investment banks need to find a willing buyer on the other side of the trade  It s much harder for them to purchase it for their own inventory 
In a normal market this isn t that big of a concern because there are plenty of buyers for every seller  But in a crisis it becomes harder to find buyers  As Jamie Dimon warned  liquidity already dries up in a crisis and without liquidity  prices can fall precipitously 

 Liquidity can be even more important in a stressed time because investors need to sell quickly  and without liquidity  prices can gap  fear can grow and illiquidity can quickly spread   even in supposedly the most liquid markets  

The other highly disconcerting thing about these warnings is that they sound eerily similar to a warning made by the head of the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the crash of 1937  In the 1936 NYSE annual report  Charles Gay warned that New Deal regulation was impacting liquidity 

 I am fearful that  in an effort to cure what might be termed sporadic evils  undue restraints are being placed upon normal  proper action  thus creating abnormal market conditions  Evidence accumulates that the quality of the market has been seriously affected  With much concern I note the continuance of narrow  illiquid markets in which wide spreads between bid and asked quotations prevail and in which comparatively small volumes of buying or selling create undue fluctuations in prices  Almost daily  situations are called to my attention wherein it is impossible to buy or sell reasonable amounts of stock at reasonable prices  Orders which  a few years ago  could have been executed within a few minutes or a few hours now often require days and sometimes weeks  with resulting increased risk to the owner  

Over the next seven months the Dow fell by 47   A lack of liquidity was heavily cited as a reason for the intensity of the decline 
History doesn t repeat  but it does rhyme  Especially as fixed income markets have started to show weakness recently  these sorts of warnings should be heeded 
This is one of the many reasons that we hold no fixed income securities in our portfolios today  Fixed income markets remain one of the most dangerous places for an investor  Equity markets are relatively less exposed to these issues  but stock prices have increasingly been tied to interest rates  If there is a convulsion in fixed income markets  equity markets are unlikely to be unscathed 
If I held bonds today and could sell them in a tax efficient manner  I would take the opportunity to do so  Cash holds significantly more value because it gives the investor the ability to purchase assets at bargain levels if a liquidity panic does come to pass  Furthermore  interest rates and inflation are so low that there is little penalty for holding cash  Better values will present themselves  All it takes is a little patience

188115,409631,BX,Jumping Into Blackstone,opinion,"Blackstone  NYSE BX  is a stock that has been on my radar for over a month  You might look at the chart and say   why is that  It has been rising since the October lows in the market   And that is a true statement  It has moved higher in a series of stair step moves  It is the pullbacks that make stocks like this interesting  Will they hold and reverse  Is the pullback a good place to enter or will it just continue lower  Hint  CEO  Stephen Scwharzman is standing at the ready to welcome you back 

The chart above shows when it first re entered the radar to start the week of May 4th  2015  Then it had been pulling back after a move higher from the break of resistance at 39  It had just retouched the 20 day SMA and then reversed higher  Monday morning actually gapped over our entry trigger and we passed to reassess  That is trading 
It drifted for a week and we got distracted  Isn t that always the time a stock moves up  It ran higher until breaking the top of the Bollinger Bands  and then started back lower again  That was time to start watching for an entry again  I noted it was not a time to chase until at least touching the 20 day SMA again 
That thinking was correct  but it omitted one key point I tell other traders  don t buy a falling stock until it is done falling  Over the past year  the 20 day SMA or lower Bollinger Band had been good buy points  This time  it blew through the 20 day SMA and ran to the Lower Bollinger Band  From there  it pushed it lower and kept going until it fell below the 50 day SMA and printed a Hammer reversal candle Tuesday 
With Wednesday s confirmation higher  it was time to pounce  Now we own the stock at a good discount to a week ago against a solid stop level at the Hammer low  With the RSI bouncing higher and the MACD slowing its fall  turning sideways  there is good promise for some upside from here  Next step  we will look to sell covered calls on any stall around the prior high at 44

188116,409632,BX,Stocks Break Out On Global Uncertainties,opinion,"We all know the big news stories that have kept both corporate leaders and investors in a semi state of paralysis  They involve the future of Greece in the Eurozone  China s growth and stock market stability  and the Federal Reserve s plan for gradually normalizing the fed funds rate  I noted in my article last week that the technical picture appeared to be firming up for the bulls as the 200 day moving average kicked in with solid support and traders seemed to be doing an orderly retreat and retrench rather than panic selling  As if on cue  today brought news of a deal to keep Greece in the Eurozone  and bulls appear to have seized a new buying opportunity 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
Although today s news about a deal for Greece was met with cheer by equity investors  the truth of the matter is that the proverbial can is merely being kicked down the road a bit further  with no confidence inducing signs that anything in that country is going to change in a significant way  And although Greece has a trivial impact on EU GDP  a Grexit would leave too much uncertainty about the future of the euro  As for China  their experiment with their unique brand of authoritarian capitalism is being tested to the extremes  particularly what happens when unfettered growth runs up against some natural limits  And then of course there is the Federal Reserve  which is bound and determined to start hiking rates at some point soon  which investors seem to fear but which history shows does not tank markets if done in a measured way 
All of this has brought back the risk on risk off behavior that traders and institutional portfolio managers loathe 
S P Capital IQ reports that the Q2 earnings growth expectation for S P 500 companies is a year over year drop of  4 3   which would be the first decline since Q3 2009  However  excluding the energy sector  which is projected to show a dismal decline of  63    the balance of the sectors would be up  3 8   with Healthcare  Consumer Discretionary  and Telecom the expected leaders  The lowest growth is expected to be in Energy  Utilities  and Consumer Staples sectors  In addition  total revenues for the S P 500 are expected to fall  2 2   largely due to the strength of the dollar 
Of course  equity valuations continue to be a hotly debated topic  Looking forward  with an expected EPS for the S P 500 next year in the range of  120 130  the forward P E sits in the 16 17x range  This equates to a forward earnings yield right around 6   which still compares favorably with the current yield on the 10 year US Treasury of about 2 4   i e   a spread of  3 6  versus an historical spread of about  3   Of course  this assumes that demand for the longer dated Treasuries remains strong even after the Fed makes its initial boosts in the fed funds rate 
Moreover  much has been made of Robert Shiller s cyclically adjusted 10 year average trailing P E  aka  CAPE   which stands near 27x  3 7  trailing earnings yield  versus a long term average around 16x  6 3    But since 1987 it has averaged closer to 24x  4 2    And when the CAPE last hit current levels back in 2007  the 10 year Treasury yield was up around 5   i e   a spread versus 10 year Treasury yield of only  1   
All told  I think equity valuations are still attractive  particularly for the highest quality stocks  Also worth mentioning is that historically  equities tend to mark market bottoms during the first two weeks of March  July and October  This is where we are on the calendar right now 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last Friday at 16 83 and it closed Monday at 13 99  which is back to levels of complacency  In fact  it never did eclipse the 20 panic threshold during the recent market turmoil 
By the way  ETFGI reports that a record level of  103 billion in net new assets flowed into US listed exchange traded products during 1H 2015  which surpassed the prior record of  76 billion during 1H 2012  As a result  as of June 30  there were 1 742 exchange traded products with AUM of  2 1 trillion from 82 issuers 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed last week at 207 48  after finding solid support at the important 200 day simple moving average  And of course today  Monday  it rallied strongly with the promising news out of Greece to close at 209 75  which is right up against the convergence of its 50 day and 100 day simple moving averages  SPY appears likely to continue up to test the long standing uptrend line that offered reliable support for so long  Whether it easily recaptures it  or fails and falls again  depends upon the next chapter in the ongoing saga of Greece s debt as well as China s growth and stock market stability  Although some technicians are saying that the uptrend line could now serve as prior support turned resistance  I think bulls will be eager to retake that line if the global news allows it  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all have room to run to the upside  Minor resistance at the 208 level  prior failed support  gave way easily on Monday s Greece news  and the 100 day simple moving average is the next level to be challenged  Major support remains the critical 200 day SMA  flat around 206   followed by earlier in year support at 205  then round number support at the 200 price level 

Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ  and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Financial is back in the top spot with an Outlook score of 84  primarily due to its low  best  forward P E and relatively good scores in most factors in the model  Healthcare takes second with a score of 81 with the best sentiment among both Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates  and a solid forward long term growth rate  Utilities falls to third place with a score of 78  followed by Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  and then Technology to round out the top five  All five score above 60  and then there is a gap down to Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  at 40 
2  Energy remains in the cellar with an Outlook score of 5  while Telecom takes the second spot in the bottom two with a 16  Both sectors score poorly in most factors of the GARP model across the board 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare displays the top score of 61  followed by Financial  Energy has the lowest Bull score of 43 and is the only one below 50  The top bottom spread is 18 points  reflecting relatively low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the top score of 56  followed by Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  and Telecom  which means that stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Energy and Materials score the lowest at 40  The top bottom spread has expanded to 16 points  which reflects fairly low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Healthcare  Utilities  and Financial are bunched together at the top in their all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities is the best  followed by Healthcare  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Energy by far the worst  followed by Materials 
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look neutral  with Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  in the top four  ahead of Technology  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   Industrial  and Basic Materials  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   now reflects a neutral bias and suggests holding Financial  Healthcare  and Utilities in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below its 50 day but still above its 200 day simple moving average  
Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Financial  Healthcare  and Utilities sectors include iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF  NYSE REM   Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF  NYSE PPH  and Guggenheim Invest S P 500 Equal Weight Utilities ETF  NYSE RYU  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Financial  Healthcare  and Utilities sectors include Blackstone  NYSE BX  Mortgage Trust  BXMT   KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   Chemed  CHE   Cambrex  CBM   AGL Resources  NYSE GAS   and Level 3 Communications  LVLT   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm 
If you prefer to play a bounce and maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Technology  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

188124,409640,BX,Aramco Sabic Deal Would Funnel Billions to Saudi Sovereign Fund,news," Bloomberg     A potential deal between Saudi Arabia s state owned oil and petrochemical giants could enable the country s sovereign wealth fund to raise billions of dollars it had hoped to collect from Aramco s stalled initial public offering 
Saudi Aramco  the world s largest oil company  is considering buying a strategic stake in the Sabic petrochemical group  Aramco said on Thursday in a statement  adding that the talks were at a  very early stage   The Public Investment Fund  the country s sovereign wealth fund  controls 70 percent of Sabic  as Saudi Basic Industries Corp  is known  with the rest of the company s shares listed on the Saudi stock exchange 
If Aramco does buy a stake  the deal would let the PIF convert at least part of its shareholding into cash that it could then use to make other investments overseas  At current market prices  the PIF s stake in Sabic is worth about  70 billion  For the government  the transaction would simply involve moving money from one pocket to another  as Aramco  Sabic and the PIF are all state run entities 
The PIF  which controls about  150 billion in Saudi listed companies  had planned to raise at least  100 billion through the Aramco IPO in the second half of 2018  That listing has now been delayed until 2019 at the earliest and may be postponed indefinitely 
Uneven Benefits
The purchase of a big stake in Sabic could boost Aramco s valuation  but only to a point  Sabic s current market capitalization is slightly more than  100 billion    just a fraction of the  2 trillion valuation that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking for the oil behemoth  Aramco may also have to take on debt to pay for a large stake  reducing its appeal to investors 
Aramco  known formally as Saudi Arabian Oil Co   said it didn t plan  to acquire any publicly held share  of the petrochemical company  The PIF confirmed the talks in a separate statement 
The biggest beneficiary of such a deal would be the PIF  which could raise money for its investments  according to two people familiar with the matter  who asked not to be identified because the discussions aren t public  By comparison  Aramco  if it bought only part of Sabic  wouldn t be able to reap all the synergy benefits to be gained from a full acquisition 
SoftBank  Blackstone  NYSE BX 
Under the leadership of Yasir Othman Al Rumayyan  the sovereign wealth fund is shifting its investment focus from domestic    with stakes in the likes of Sabic and National Commercial Bank    to international  funneling billions of dollars into high profile overseas deals  The fund lies at the heart of Saudi Arabia s effort to reduce its reliance on oil revenue under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030  In addition to running the PIF  Othman Al Rumayyan is also a director at Aramco 
So far  the PIF has struck an agreement to invest  45 billion in SoftBank Group Corp  s technology fund  committed  20 billion to an infrastructure fund with Blackstone Group LP and said it plans to invest about  1 billion in Virgin Group s space companies 
It s unclear how Aramco would fund the acquisition of a stake in Sabic  The oil company has invited banks to pitch for advisory roles for a potential deal  according to a person familiar with the matter 
Aramco is investing heavily to become a major producer of chemicals  to enhance its appeal to potential investors if the IPO is revived and also to reduce its dependence on pumping raw crude  The company is already working with Sabic  one of the world s largest petrochemical makers  to turn crude directly into chemicals that are the building blocks for plastics and other commonly used consumer materials  Aramco also owns a large stake in the  20 billion Sadara petrochemicals joint venture with DowDuPont Inc 
 Our goal is to be a top tier energy and chemical company by 2030   Abdulaziz Al Judaimi  Aramco s senior vice president of downstream  said in an interview last year   We will expand organically  but we also see inorganic opportunities   he said  signaling an appetite for making deals that s rare for a company with little experience in mergers and acquisitions   Chemicals is a global business  ",2018-07-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/aramcosabic-deal-would-funnel-billions-to-saudi-sovereign-fund-1536760,1536760

188134,409650,BX,Stocks Grind Into Neutral  Market Looking For New  Catalyst,opinion,"In the ongoing bad news is good news saga  last week s surprisingly weak jobs report led to speculation that the Fed would delay hiking interest rates  which is perceived as a positive for equity investors  So  bulls are getting a boost for the moment  although those previously hard won  round number price levels for the major indexes are now serving as ominous overhead resistance that will likely require a strong new catalyst to break through  Whether stocks are destined for downside or upside from here  Q1 earnings season starts this week and will likely provide the catalyst 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
The major market indexes continue to toil below recent support turned resistance thresholds  including S P 500 2 100  Dow Jones Industrials 18 000  and NASDAQ 5 000  The holiday shortened week started out with a bang on Monday  but then drifted lower in anticipation of the jobs report on Friday and this week s start to earnings season and the Q1 reports  As it turned out  Labor Department data for March showed that U S  employers added the fewest jobs in over a year  with only 126 000 jobs versus expectations of 245 000  but the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5 5  
Heading into Q1 earnings season  the bar has been lowered considerably  According to S P Capital IQ  S P 500 companies are expected to post earnings growth of  3 0  Q1 2015  which would be the first decline since Q3 2009  Revenues are expected to fall  1 3  in Q1 2015 due to the strong dollar and weak commodity prices  Among the 101 S P 500 companies that pre announced their earnings guidance  85 offered negative outlooks while only 16 were positive  Moreover  only five of the ten U S  business sectors are expected to report positive Q1 2015 earnings growth  with Financial  Healthcare  and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  the leaders and Energy  Basic Materials  and Utilities the laggards 
As a result  the boo birds are telling us that the expected economic weakness is the start of a bigger slide  or even a reversal  in the economic recovery  But in our current slow but steady recovery which is good in that growth is not overheated and investor sentiment is not overly exuberant there is always going to be some volatility in each quarter s results rather than posting a consistent level of growth  We got a big drop in oil prices  which was good for most consumers but bad for large swaths of the nation s economy  particularly within Energy  Capital Goods  and Materials segments  We saw labor issues at West Coast ports that impacted many imports and exports  We had severe winter weather across much of the country that lasted longer and was even worse than the nasty stuff we endured last year  Now oil prices are creeping back up  port strikes have been settled  and spring weather has arrived 
The U S  10 Year Treasury yield closed last week at 1 90  and continues to generally trend lower after a brief spike higher in February  The euro is trading around  1 10 after falling 11  against the dollar during Q1  which was the worst quarter in its 15 year history as monetary policy diverged between the Federal Reserve and the ECB  During 2014  foreign investors increased their holdings in U S  Treasuries by  374 3 billion in 2014  which has put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  and that trend has continued to accelerate 
Also worth noting is ConvergEx s quarterly review of ETF money flows  which seems to be indicating that capital has been flowing out of domestic equity and into fixed income  commodities  and overseas equity markets  Domestic equity ETFs lost  12 billion  including  23 billion in redemptions from the SPDR S P 500 ETF  ARCA SPY    while fixed income ETFs gained an impressive  19 billion of inflows and commodity ETFs  particularly oil related  gained  as well 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 14 67  which is back below the 15 threshold between investor fear and complacency  It seems to be coiling around the 15 level in preparation for a larger move one way or the other 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 206 43  For the seventh time in four months  it is seeking reliable support from the lower uptrend line of the long standing bullish rising channel  The 100 day simple moving average has joined forces to help provide even stronger support  Each test of support seems to be creating a successively smaller bull flag continuation pattern  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all struggling in neutral territory and seeking a direction  It seems that there will be a strong move in one direction or the other  and my inclination is a continuation to the upside  although it is likely that May will bring about more trepidation among bulls who fear seasonal weakness  i e    Sell in May and go away    Below the 100 day SMA and the uptrend line resides the critical 200 day SMA  approaching 202  followed by round number support at the 200 price level 

Some negatives include the failure of the Dow Jones Transportation Average to confirm a new high in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  i e   Dow Theory buy signal not confirmed  and the declining tops on the MACD  Positives include the continued bullish look of the Russell 2000 small caps chart 
Also  small caps tend to be less affected by the strength of the dollar  forex   and they can benefit more from a strengthening domestic economy 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Healthcare has moved into first place with a robust Outlook score of 90  Healthcare displays the best sell side analyst sentiment  positive net revisions to earnings estimates  and above average scores in most factors in the model  including return ratios  forward long term growth rate  and insider sentiment  buying activity   Technology takes second at 84 and displays solid factor scores across the board  including the highest return ratios  Financial takes third with a score of 78  with solid analyst and insider sentiment and the lowest forward P E  Notably  the 3 tier bunching of recent rankings has become a smoother top to bottom distribution  which is more favorable 
2  At the bottom remains Energy and Telecom  Energy continues to hold the bottom spot with an Outlook score of 2 given the persistent weakness in oil prices and the ongoing downward earnings revisions from Wall Street  Energy is among the worst in all factors in the model  and in fact its forward long term growth rate is virtually zero 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Financial displays the top score of 62  followed by Industrial at 61  Energy and Telecom score the lowest at 52  Once again  all scores are above 50  The top bottom spread remains narrow at only 10 points  which reflects high sector correlations  i e   broad risk on buying   It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Energy displays the highest  i e   best  score of 50  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Telecom and Industrial share the lowest score of 41  The top bottom spread remains a narrow 9 points  which reflects high sector correlations on particularly weak market days  i e   broad risk off selling   Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  is the strongest  followed by Financial and Healthcare  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Telecom scores the worst 
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look mostly bullish to me  with five of the top six economically sensitive or all weather and showing the top Bull scores  above 60   Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   retains a neutral bias and suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Financial in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is between its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Healthcare  Technology  and Financial sectors include Market Vectors Biotech ETF  NYSE BBH   First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  NASDAQ TDIV   and PowerShares KBW High Dividend Yield Financial Portfolio  NYSE KBWD  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Healthcare  Technology  and Financial sectors include United Therapeutics  NASDAQ UTHR   Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   NICE Systems  NASDAQ NICE   DST Systems  NYSE DST   Starwood Property Trust  NYSE STWD   and The Blackstone Group  NYSE BX   All are highly ranked in the  
If you prefer to maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Financial  Healthcare  and Technology  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Healthcare  Energy  and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

Could It Happen Again

188165,409681,BX,Blackstone bets big on Australian offices with  2 3 billion Investa bid,news,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY  Reuters    U S  private equity giant Blackstone Group  N BX  is seeking to deepen its exposure to Australian commercial property with a A 3 08 billion   2 3 billion  bid for Sydney focused company Investa Office Fund  IOF   AX IOF  
IOF s directors said in a statement on Monday they would unanimously recommend the unsolicited and non binding offer  which comes two years after shareholders rejected a A 2 5 billion bid from Australian firm DEXUS  AX DXS  
Blackstone s move is a bet on the future of commercial property across Australia s east coast  where analysts expect strong demand to support yields even if interest rates rise from their current historic lows 
 They have seen an opportunity to get a decent slab of commercial assets  primarily in the Sydney market  which has been the best performing market for sometime   said Winston Sammut  managing director of Folkestone Maxim Asset Management  which invests in real estate but does not own shares in IOF 
 But they are paying a big price in an environment where interest rates are likely go up  
The offer represents a 13 2 percent premium to IOF s ex distribution closing price of A 4 55 per unit on Friday  equating to A 5 15 per unit 
IOF shares surged more than 10 percent after the announcement  and by 0430 GMT were trading at A 5 11  their highest level in almost a decade 
Less than two weeks ago  Blackstone struck a NZ 635 million   439 4 million  deal to buy an office portfolio in Auckland  New Zealand  which was co held by Goodman Property Trust  NZ GMT  and Singaporean investor GIC 
It was forced to call off the sale of its A 3 5 billion Australian shopping mall portfolio last year due to a lack of interest  amid the retail sector s shift away from bricks and mortar stores to online shopping 
While the retail property market is struggling  analysts forecast strong demand to underpin yields on office space in Sydney  where 21 of Investa s 36 properties are located 
Building of new office space in Sydney has slowed in recent years as developers turned to constructing high rise apartment blocks amid record house prices

188167,409683,BX,BHP Is Said to Get Shale Bids Valuing Unit Up to  9 Billion,news," Bloomberg     BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd  has received first round bids for its U S  shale portfolio from oil majors including  BP   LON BP  Plc and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX   valuing the unit at  7 billion to  9 billion  people familiar with the matter said 
Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc  partnering with private equity firm Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP  also submitted a bid for the entire unit late in May  said the people  asking not to be identified because the information is private  Chevron has teamed up with another private equity firm  while BP is pursuing them alone  the people said 
Multiple parties  including private equity firms such as Apollo Global Management LLC as well as energy companies  have bid separately for individual packages of shale real estate being sold by the Melbourne  Australia based commodities giant  the people said 
BHP expects to receive about  10 billion or more as bidding for the entire unit proceeds to a second round and as much as  13 billion if it sells the assets piecemeal  the people said  The company prefers to sell the unit to a single party and expects to invite second round bids as early as July  the people said 
Representatives for BHP  BP  Chevron  Shell  Blackstone and Apollo declined to comment 
BHP advanced 1 8 percent by 12 52 p m  in Sydney trading on Wednesday  outpacing a 0 3 percent gain for an index of Australia s top 100 listed companies 
A sale of the shale assets for  10 billion or more appears a realistic prospect with oil majors in competition for the unit  Peter O Connor  a Sydney based analyst at Shaw and Partners Ltd   said by phone   It s serious people that are contesting  people with the balance sheets and industry experience   he said   They won t pay too much    but they won t pay too little  because they want the assets  
BHP disclosed plans to sell its onshore U S  division last summer after activist investor Elliott Management Corp  said its foray into shale  along with other decisions  had wiped out  40 billion in shareholder value  The company  which spent  20 billion on two U S  oil and gas acquisitions in 2011  is selling 800 000 net acres in the Eagle Ford  Permian  Haynseville and Fayetteville Basins it s said to value at  10 billion or more  It s preparing to sell those assets in as many as seven packages  including three in the highly prized Permian of West Texas and New Mexico  people familiar with the matter said in April 
Potential Interest
Shell is potentially interested in BHP s Permian basin assets  Andy Brown  its upstream director  said in an interview in February  Drilling in the Permian  the main source of the current surge in U S  output  can cost explorers as little as  15 a barrel 
Reuters  citing people familiar with the matter  reported earlier that Shell had bid with Blackstone and Chevron with the private equity firm Warburg Pincus 
BP is working with  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  as it weighs an acquisition of BHP s energy assets to expand in U S  shale  people familiar with the matter said in April  London based BP held Permian properties until 2010  when it sold assets to raise cash for expenses tied to its Gulf of Mexico oil spill  It has since considered various options for the area   but it s been really hard  in the past three to four years to find deals that add to earnings  Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in April 
BHP s U S  asset sale is  progressing to plan  with bids expected by June  Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said in April  Transactions could be announced by the end of the year  though BHP continues to assess options to swap assets or to carry out an IPO or de merger  the company has said

188180,409696,BX,There s No Real Economic Growth,opinion,Quantitative easing was supposed to bring economic growth to the U S  economy  but it is failing at its job  Just look at the chart below to see how badly things have turned out  The chart shows the velocity of money in the U S  economy  For the uninitiated  velocity is a measure of how many times each dollar must be used to buy specific goods and services  It s a strong indicator of economic growth  When velocity increases  it suggests there s heightened activity in the economy  Clearly  the velocity of money shows the U S  is going through severe tumult  and at the very best  economic growth has been questionable  It is continuously plunging and currently stands at historically low levels The primary goal of quantitative easing was to print money to buy bad assets from the banks so they could start lending again  which should lead to increased consumer spending and  eventually  economic growth  But if quantitative easing was actually working  the velocity chart wouldn t look like it s taking a nosedive Don t get me wrong  I don t disagree that the first round of quantitative easing was needed  If not for QE1  the financial system would still be in great jeopardy  However  continuing it is not leading to any real economic growth But the quantitative easing goes on anyway  The Federal Reserve continues to print  85 0 billion a month  Even now that there s speculation that it will start to taper off  you need to realize that it will still be printing more money  taper  doesn t mean stop  it means to slow the rate If there was any real economic growth in this nation  then we would see a jobs market recovery  but we haven t  There are still almost 12 million Americans who are actively unemployed  and a significant number continue to leave the labor force Many Americans are working part time because they can t find any full time jobs  As a matter of fact  part time work looks like it s becoming the new norm  Since the Great Recession ended  the number of people working temporary jobs has increased 50  the most since the government started to record that statistic in 1990   Source  USA Today  July 7  2013   That doesn t look like economic growth to me But the jobs market is just one sector of the economy that shows how anemic economic growth has been in the U S  other statistics  like consumer spending  suggest the same Americans realize what really powers the U S  economy  Continuously printing money only does one thing it reduces the buying power of already struggling Americans  It certainly doesn t bring economic growth The only place quantitative easing has really shown any positive effect is in the stock market  But I continue to be cautious  because when reality strikes the market when investors realize the key stock indices are far from their real values there will be panic  and they will slide Michael s Personal Notes The mainstream media continues to report that the housing market in the U S  economy is hot again  but I don t share their optimism for a second  The fact of the matter is that the U S  housing market may be headed toward a period of decline after just a few months of glory As I have mentioned before in these pages  the housing market will only improve when real home buyers buy homes  That hasn t been happening in the U S  economy  Real home buyers those who plan to live in their homes are shying away from the housing market For the week ended June 28  the number of completed mortgage applications in the U S  economy plummeted 12  from a week earlier the biggest drop in two years  The applications filed for refinancing a home decreased 64  the lowest since May of 2011   Source  Wall Street Journal  July 3  2013   Regular Americans just can t afford to buy a house So who is actually buying homes in the U S  economy and driving the housing market higher It s the institutional investors who are buying homes  because this real estate provides them with a greater return than many other investments  It shouldn t be too surprising yields on stocks are low and the bond market is in a dangerous territory  edging toward a collapse Institutional investors have spent  17 0 billion on more than 100 000 homes in the housing market over the last two years  and they ve become the biggest buyers in some parts of the U S  economy   Source  Bloomberg  July 8  2013  Here s how institutional investors work the housing market  Say they have  10 0 million  To keep things simple  if we assume they buy each home for  100 000 and rent it for  1 500 per month  they will receive 1 5  of their capital invested every month  Over a one year period  they receive 18  of their capital  And if the housing market keeps going higher  they see capital appreciation as well  Those are high yields in any economy As we move forward  I just don t see real home buyers rushing to the housing market  We might just see more of the same institutional investors buying up residential homes in the U S  economy Consider this  The Blackstone Group L P   BX  has spent  5 0 billion to buy residential properties in the U S  housing market  It has accumulated 30 000 homes  And if that s not enough  the firm is starting a lending service that provides loans to other institutional investors who want to buy even more homes What the optimists in the mainstream media don t realize is that this sort of thing can t go on for very long  Institutional investors are constantly working to improve their bottom line  and since they currently believe the housing market is hot  they are buying houses and renting them out  But once the yields on investments like stocks and bonds start to edge higher  and rent drops due to an overabundance of rental homes  they will be in trouble shareholders will ask for higher returns  and institutional investors might be forced to sell what homes they have accumulated Certainly  without real home buyers who provide liquidity to the housing market the home prices will edge lower once institutional investors begin to sell We need real home buyers to see real recovery  Until they make a comeback  I continue to question the housing market and the optimism surrounding it  Just look at homebuilder stocks  they are in decline and that affirms my views on the housing market Disclaimer

188190,409706,BX,Private equity firm KKR to convert to a corporation after U S  tax reform,news,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK  Reuters    Private equity firm KKR   Co LP  N KKR  said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation in the wake of U S  tax reform  a move that it hopes will expand its investor base at the expense of paying higher taxes 
It is the biggest shake up in KKR s structure since the firm went public 12 years ago  KKR is now the second alternative asset manager to change its tax status following  Ares Management LP   N ARES  earlier this year 
KKR s market capitalization  at almost  18 billion  is more than three times that of Ares  Its conversion will provide a serious test case for peers Apollo Global Management  N APO    Carlyle Group  LP  O CG  and Blackstone  N BX  as to whether the higher tax burden is offset by the market s attributing a higher valuation 
 KKR s conversion from a partnership to a corporation is designed to broaden our investor base  simplify our structure and make it easier to invest in our shares   Henry Kravis and George Roberts  co chairmen and co chief executives  said in a statement for KKR s first quarter earnings 
KKR hopes the change to a so called C Corp  which is effective July 1  will attract new shareholders by enabling investors such as index funds to buy the stock  Such passive investors  which are becoming more important as they manage even more money  are restricted by their mandates from acquiring KKR stock under its partnership structure 
Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors  but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees 
Under the C Corp structure  KKR will pay corporate taxes on all revenue  However  the additional tax burden has become much less severe after the headline U S  corporate tax rate was lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent 
To illustrate the limited impact of the change to the returns of shareholders  KKR said that an average New York City based shareholder who bought its stock at  20 and sold at  25 a year later would see only a 6 cent hit to their windfall under a C Corp structure 
Analysts had earlier flagged KKR and Ares as the two private equity firms most likely to convert to C Corps early on  as the tax hit is less severe because the firms  earnings rely less on the performance fees that are affected by the C Corp change 
Apollo s CEO  Leon Black  said in March that Ares  stock performance has not made for a compelling case to follow suit  After Ares  shares initially popped on the announcement of the change on mid February  since making the switch on March 1 the stock is down 7 8 percent 
KKR said it expected to pay an annualized dividend of 50 cents per common share as a corporation for the third quarter and that it had reupped its authorization to buy back shares to  500 million 
KKR also said on Thursday that its first quarter earnings per share fell by a less than expected 35 percent year on year  the latest private equity firm to feel the brunt of turbulent financial markets 
KKR s economic net income per share came in at 42 cents in the first quarter of 2018  ahead of analysts  expectations for 11 cents  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Economic net income reflects the mark to market valuation gains or losses on KKR s portfolio 
Blackstone and Carlyle have also reported a fall in first quarter earnings  albeit less than analysts had feared 
KKR s assets under management totaled  176 billion at the end of March  up from  168 billion at the end of 2017 ",2018-05-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/private-equity-firm-kkr-to-convert-to-a-corporation-after-us-tax-reform-1428691,1428691

A period of slower economic growth in Saudi Arabia is also helping to make buyouts in the the region s largest economy more viable  as business owners accept lower valuations  bankers say 
 Saudi Arabia has always been a tough place to do transactions because of the difference between sellers and buyers  expectations   said Yaser Moustafa  senior managing director at private equity firm NBK Capital Partners   Now we are seeing people consider what I d call  fair valuations  for the first time  ",2018-04-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/banks-see-fast-pace-for-mideast-and-africa-deals-in-bumper-year-1378824,1378824

188242,409758,BX,Regulator in China seizes control of Anbang as chairman prosecuted,news,By Matthew Miller and Engen Tham BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    The Chinese government on Friday seized control of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd and said its chairman had been prosecuted  a dramatic move that highlighted Beijing s willingness to curtail big spending conglomerates as it cracks down on financial risk  Anbang had violated laws and regulations which  may seriously endanger the solvency of the company   the China Insurance Regulatory Commission  CIRC  said in a statement announcing the seizure without giving details  The CIRC also said Anbang s chairman and key shareholder  Wu Xiaohui  had been prosecuted for economic crimes  Wu was arrested in June as troubles mounted for one of China s most aggressive buyers of overseas assets  During the takeover  which will last for one year starting on Friday  Anbang Group will be managed by a working group of officials from the CIRC  the central bank and other key financial regulators and government bodies  The working group will seek to undertake an equity restructuring of the insurance giant  even as it keeps Anbang operating as usual  protecting the rights and interests of its consumers and stakeholders  the CIRC said  The government takeover of Anbang  which claims 1 97 trillion yuan   310 85 billion  in assets and ranks 139 on the Global Fortune 500 list  is a defining blow to the acquisitive conglomerate best known for acquiring New York s landmark Waldorf Astoria hotel  The unprecedented takeover of a major non state company also underscores how far the ruling Communist Party will go in its growing campaign to lower financial risks  sending a signal to risk taking private enterprises  TOO BIG It was not immediately clear what triggered the takeover  Three insurance industry insiders said they were not surprised by the move since Anbang had been in the crosshairs of the government  But they said they believed it had more to do with Anbang s behavior than systemic financial risks  A regulatory source with knowledge of the matter said the government had been effectively running the company since Wu was detained and the timing of the official takeover was linked to the months long investigation into Wu  which was nearly complete  But a Beijing based lawyer who works the CIRC and other regulators said senior officials at the insurance regulator had been watching Anbang closely since last year as its liabilities from the sale of shadow banking products grew  raising questions about the company s solvency   The group has become too big to fail in some sense   said the lawyer  who declined to be identified by name   The CIRC said on Friday that it had sent a working group to Anbang in June 2017 and that at present the company s operations are  generally stable    This appears to be an unprecedented takeover   a Chinese style hostile takeover   said Scott Kennedy  director of the Project on Chinese Business   Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington   The Chinese government doesn t want to have a company default on foreign debt and it also wants to teach a lesson to other Chinese business people that the Party is in charge   After a spate of high profile deals worth over  30 billion  Anbang began to run into roadblocks even before Wu s detention  failing to close on a handful of investments and facing criticism over its opaque shareholding structure  A spokesman for Anbang Insurance Group declined to comment and referred to the CIRC announcement  Calls to Wu Xiaohui s personal phone numbers were either disconnected or unanswered   Clearly a message is being fed back into the market and to private companies that being very innovative may not be looked on favorably in the long run   said Keith Pogson  senior partner for Asia Pacific financial services at EY   This says to the market  tread carefully    if they hadn t already got that message   TIGHTENING NOOSE The CIRC said that Anbang s debts and obligations will not be impacted by the takeover  The takeover was implemented under a broad provision in the country s insurance law allowing it to rectify violations of the law by insurance companies  it said  The noose had been tightening around Anbang as China s insurance industry came under the microscope over the past year or so for risky behavior  ranging from term mismatches on insurance products and highly leveraged overseas acquisitions  as well as corrupt practices  Anbang distributes insurance through multiple channels  with the bulk going through banks   Under Wu  Anbang was among China s most active overseas investors after the government liberalized offshore investment rules earlier this decade  In the United States  Anbang bought the Waldorf Astoria for  1 95 billion  and later agreed to pay  6 5 billion for Strategic Hotels and Resorts  purchasing both properties from Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group   It acquired life insurance companies in South Korea and in Europe  as well as the largest retirement home chain in British Columbia  Canada  But it has faced increasing pushback in its offshore deal making amid a broader decline in Chinese outbound acquisitions  Beijing has strengthened curbs over capital outflows after China s leadership vowed to curb risk in its financial

188268,409784,BX,Casino magnate Steve Wynn quits as CEO after sexual misconduct claims,news,"By Farah Master  Reuters    U S  casino mogul Steve Wynn has resigned as CEO of his company Wynn Resorts following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances  becoming one of the most prominent business leaders to quit over sexual misconduct allegations in recent months  The company said it was appointing Matt Maddox  its president since 2013  as chief executive  effective immediately  Maddox  who has been with Wynn Resorts Ltd since it was founded in 2002  is seen as a firm hand and is widely viewed as a favored protege of Wynn  As the  MeToo  movement galvanizes women to publicly air their experiences  Wynn s decision represents a rare resignation by a head of a major listed company in the wake of such accusations  It has also led to speculation that Wynn Resorts could become a takeover target  and raises the question of how much influence Wynn  its biggest shareholder  will continue to wield over the firm and how much scrutiny from authorities that will invite  Wynn  76  has denied the accusations published by the Wall Street Journal as  preposterous  and said they were instigated by his ex wife  an accusation that a representative for Elaine Wynn has denied  He also resigned as finance chairman of the U S  Republican Party s fundraising arm  the Republican National Committee  in January   In the last couple of weeks  I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity   I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles   he said in a statement  Sparking a wave of harassment and abuse allegations against dozens of powerful men  the  MeToo  movement has had its biggest impact so far in the media industry and politics  U S  Senator Al Franken resigned in December after facing a series of sexual misconduct allegations  Movie producer Harvey Weinstein  and head of animation at Walt Disney Co s Disney and Pixar  John Lasseter  are among some of the high profile men who have been singled out for sexual misconduct  FOUNDER OF MODERN LAS VEGAS Wynn  who according to Forbes has a net worth of  3 3 billion  started in Las Vegas casinos in the 1960s  creating some of Las Vegas  most iconic landmarks   the Mirage  Bellagio and Treasure Island  But he was forced to sell his multi billion dollar operation Mirage Resorts to tycoon Kirk Kerkorian in a hostile takeover in 2000  Kerkorian then created MGM Mirage and Wynn went on to create Wynn Resorts with his ex wife in 2002  Shares in Wynn Resorts  which owns the Wynn  Encore Las Vegas casinos as well as its Wynn Macau unit  have tumbled nearly 20 percent since the Journal report on Jan 26  The company is worth around  17 billion by market capitalization  Shares in Wynn Macau have slumped around 17 percent before they were put on a trading halt on Wednesday  Some analysts noted that questions remain over whether Wynn will sell or reduce his stake and how much fighting will ensue over control of the firm    Some investors might consider the resignation of Steve Wynn as the removal of an overhang on the stock  but we think that many uncertainties remain around who will be the controlling shareholders in future   said Praveen Choudhary  analyst at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in Hong Kong  Wynn owns about 11 8 percent of Wynn Resorts followed by his former wife who has 9 4 percent  WYNN MACAU GOLDMINE On Wednesday a women s advocacy group called Ultra Violet said they would fly a plane banner over the Nevada Gaming Control Board meeting to urge the regulatory body to revoke Wynn s gaming license  The banner was to read WYNN IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR  FIREWYNN  All regulators have announced probes into the allegations and even if Wynn were to sell shares  authorities could still well scrutinize his involvement with the company  said Choudhary  Wynn Resorts  which uses the founder s signature in the company s logo  said its board  reluctantly  accepted the resignation   Steve Wynn is an industry giant  He is a philanthropist and a beloved leader and visionary  He played the pivotal role in transforming Las Vegas into the entertainment destination it is today   Wynn Resorts said on Wednesday it remained committed to being an inclusive and supportive employer  adding that more than 40 percent of all Wynn Las Vegas management are women  the highest in the gaming industry  It has set up a special committee to investigate the accusations  Wynn s Macau business has been a goldmine for Wynn Resorts  generating more than 75 percent of its total revenues  It has two lavish resorts in the world s largest gambling hub where only six firms have licenses to operate casinos   Either Wynn Resorts or its businesses could become M A targets that would attract a plethora of suitors  analysts said   Not only the other 5 Macau concessionaires but you now have a dynamic where you have these gaming REITs that have been established in the States like MGM Growth Properties and GLPI  they would be interested   said Grant Govertsen  analyst at Union Gaming in Macau

188269,409785,BX,HNA Sells Hong Kong Land for  2 Billion  Disposals Speed Up,news," Bloomberg     HNA Group Co  agreed to sell two plots of land in Hong Kong to the city s second richest man for HK 16 billion   2 billion  as the cash strapped Chinese conglomerate accelerates asset disposals to repay its mounting debt 
The sites  purchased just over a year ago  were sold to billionaire Lee Shau Kee s Henderson Land Development Co   according to a statement Tuesday  HNA had spent about HK 14 2 billion on the two sites  according to records from Hong Kong s land registry 
The disposal may help ease the financial strain HNA has been under after spending tens of billions of dollars on debt fueled acquisitions to snap up assets including big stakes in  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc  The group has told creditors it could have a liquidity shortfall of at least 15 billion yuan   2 4 billion  in the first quarter and that HNA is targeting about 100 billion yuan in asset sales during the first half  people familiar with the situation have said 
HNA bought four plots at the former Kai Tak airport for a total HK 27 2 billion between November 2016 and March last year  outbidding local developers for sites that were among the most hotly contested during that period  The sale to Henderson is expected to close Feb  14  according to the statement 
Other Sales
Separately  HNA has held preliminary talks with investors including Brookfield Asset Management Inc  about selling a pair of office buildings in London s Canary Wharf district  according to people with knowledge of the matter  In the U S   the Chinese conglomerate is selling properties valued at about  4 billion    including the 245 Park Ave  skyscraper it bought less than a year ago for one of the highest prices ever paid for a building in New York    according to a marketing document seen by Bloomberg  In late January  HNA agreed to sell a Sydney office building to Blackstone  NYSE BX  for A 205 million   161 million

Still  HNA  which doesn t earn enough profits to cover its interest payments  has been facing increasing skepticism from bond investors whether asset sales and lender lifelines will be enough to help the conglomerate roll over borrowings 
The yield on HNA s yuan denominated bond due in 2019 has almost doubled this year to 14 2 percent  according to exchange data  That s about three times higher than the average yield on other notes with similar AAA local ratings  and twice that on securities with credit scores considered junk in China 
 With investor risk appetites more subdued in the wake of rising rates and widening credit spreads  it is difficult to envision HNA and its subsidiaries being able to tap either the onshore or offshore bond markets over the near future   said Todd Schubert  head of fixed income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd 
HNA  one of the most prolific Chinese buyers of foreign assets until the government started frowning on capital outflows  isn t alone in feeling the heat  Blackstone Group LP has held initial discussions about bidding for Anbang Insurance Group Co  assets    including New York s Waldorf Astoria hotel    in a sale overseen by the Chinese government  people with knowledge of the matter have said

188286,409802,BX,Wien Sees Emerging Market Stocks Undervalued After 82  Rally,news," Bloomberg     Emerging market stocks are still undervalued after their 82 percent return over the past two years  according to Byron Wien 
With faster earnings growth and lower price to earnings ratios than their more industrialized peers  developing nations are the best bet for equity investors  said Wien  the 84 year old vice chairman in the private wealth solutions group at Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group 
 When the disparity is great    as it is now    I think emerging markets are attractive   Wien said in an interview from New York  adding that inflows will also support the asset class   The U S  is getting expensive  Investors should be looking abroad  and I think they will  
Jeff Gundlach  chief investment officer at Los Angeles based DoubleLine Capital LP  made a similar case earlier this month  citing the Shiller P E Ratio  a measure of valuation based on cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio  which shows investors paying a premium for U S  stocks compared to emerging market equities 
The former  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  strategist s emerging market bullishness is heavily influenced by the global trends highlighted in his 33rd annual  Ten Surprises  list of market predictions  published earlier this year  For example  his forecast that oil prices will surge above  80 a barrel suggests a boost for major producers such as Nigeria  Iran  Iraq and Venezuela  while his expectation that the North American Free Trade Agreement will survive despite Donald Trump s threats would make Mexican assets more appealing 
 It looks like Trump wants to trash Nafta and I don t think that s going to happen   said Wien  who s gradually handing off his duties at Blackstone to successor Joe Zidle  according to the Wall Street Journal   Every day he says something negative  but he ll be forced to face the reality that tearing it up would be devastating for U S  jobs  so he will back down  
Threats that could imperil emerging markets include weaker commodity prices  Wien actually sees them rising   war with North Korea  an unlikely but potentially horrific event  or a temporary 10 to 15 percent drop in U S  stocks  which he sees as probable  
If U S  markets briefly decline  emerging markets would probably follow suit  Wien said  But any such move is likely to be just a blip  not the start of a bear market   The fundamentals of emerging markets are powerful enough to overcome many of these risks   he said ",2018-01-22,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wien-sees-emergingmarket-stocks-undervalued-after-82-rally-1134211,1134211

188288,409804,BX,Blackstone bets big on Wall St  information business with Thomson Reuters deal,news,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Jessica Toonkel LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  private equity firm Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP catapulted itself into the major leagues of Wall Street s financial information industry on Tuesday with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp  The  20 billion deal is Blackstone s biggest bet since the financial crisis and pits co founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg  Bloomberg s eponymous terminals are the market leader in providing traders  bankers and investors with news  data and analytics  Blackstone will acquire a 55 percent stake in a newly hived off F R business  a statement from both companies said  Thomson Reuters will retain a 45 percent holding and will receive approximately  17 billion  including about  3 billion in cash and  14 billion of debt and preferred equity issued by the new business  the companies said  The  deal will give Thomson Reuters  controlled by Canada s Thomson family  a formidable ally as it seeks to reinvigorate a business facing challenges from a shrinking and budget conscious customer base   Blackstone has a track record of cutting costs and  as one of the world s biggest investors  it has business relationships with most of the major banks on Wall Street that are clients for Thomson Reuters  flagship desktop product Eikon  The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore s GIC will invest alongside Blackstone  The amount they will provide was not revealed  The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board declined to comment  A spokeswoman for GIC declined to comment  Talks on a possible deal began in earnest last summer  two sources familiar with the negotiations said  The partnership will be managed by a 10 person board composed of five representatives from Blackstone and four from Thomson Reuters  The President and CEO of the new partnership will serve as a non voting member of the board following the closing of the transaction  The companies did not say who that person would be   Thomson Reuters has relied heavily on cost cutting in recent years as its core customers  including banks  brokerages and investment houses  retrench in the face of weak trading

session  while shares of Blackstone were down 0 2 percent after the bell  TRUST PRINCIPLES As talks between the two sides intensified  the biggest sticking point had been what the partnership would mean for Reuters News  the international news agency  which supplies the Eikon terminal with headlines  stories and analysis  said the two sources  who spoke on condition of anonymity  One issue centered around the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles  which commits Reuters to preserving its  independence  integrity  and freedom from bias  in supplying news   In an interview  Kim Williams  chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company  said  we are satisfied that the nature of the contract ensures that appropriate quality of editorial is sustained   In its statement  Thomson Reuters and the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Co  which has overseen Reuters  editorial independence since the company was first publicly listed in the 1980s  cited  consequential modifications  to what it described as the Trust Principles  arrangements   The changes were not spelled out  Until now  the principles have applied not just to Reuters News but to all Thomson Reuters business units  Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Jim Smith said in an interview that the partnership with Blackstone required clarifying where the Trust Principles apply  Under the deal with Blackstone   The Trust Principles apply any place where we use the Reuters brand or a third party uses the Reuters brand in a product   Smith said  Reuters News will remain part of Thomson Reuters  along with its Legal and Tax and Accounting divisions  The new F R company will make minimum annual payments of  325 million to Reuters over 30 years to secure access to its news service  equating to almost  10 billion  The payments will be adjusted for inflation  company executives said  Thomson Reuters Chief Financial Officer Stephane Bello told an investor call that the payment represented what F R used to allocate to Reuters News  plus  a tiny bit more   After the deal  Reuters News will have about  625 million in revenues  including the annual payment from F R and about  300 million in revenues from its media business  slightly higher than its cost base  Bello said   Williams said that an advantage of the deal was that Reuters will move  from being a cost center inside Thomson Reuters to being a full operating business unit with its own profit and loss accounts   Thomson Reuters expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2018  The company said on Tuesday it expected 2017 results  which it will release next month  to meet or exceed guidance  with revenues expected to rise by 1 percent  THOMSON FAMILY The proceeds of  17 billion that Thomson Reuters will glean from the deal match the amount that Thomson Corp  controlled by the Thomson family  paid for London based Reuters in 2008  That deal created the Thomson Reuters Group  The company plans to use  9 billion to  10 billion to buy back shares  and use the rest to pay down debt  invest in its Legal and Tax   Accounting units and make selective acquisitions  Woodbridge  the Thomson family s investment company  will take part in the share repurchase  maintaining its ownership in Thomson Reuters in the 50 to 60 percent range  Woodbridge  which currently owns 64 pct of Thomson Reuters  could not immediately be reached to comment on the deal  Over the past six years  the family has been making divestments  reducing the number of products within the F R segment by about 70 percent since 2012  while shrinking the division s workforce by 25 percent  according to Morningstar Equity Research  Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Smith told an investor call that there was room for more cost cuts in the new F R business

188297,409813,BX,Court reverses Dell buyout ruling that alarmed dealmakers,news,"By Tom Hals WILMINGTON  Del   Reuters    Delaware s Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that a lower court erred in finding that the 2013 buyout of computer maker Dell Inc was vastly underpriced  in an opinion that will likely restrict a hedge fund strategy aimed at wringing cash from mergers  Thursday s ruling stems from an  appraisal  lawsuit  which allowed Dell shareholders who opposed the  24 9 billion buyout to ask a judge to determine the fair value of their stock   Last year  a Delaware Court of Chancery judge ordered Dell to pay Magnetar Capital and other Dell investors  17 62 for each of their 5 5 million shares  well above the  13 75 per share deal price paid by Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners  The Supreme Court said Vice Chancellor Travis Laster abused his discretion by rejecting the deal price as a way to measure the fair value of Dell stock   Dell declined to comment  Stuart Grant  the lawyer who represented the investors seeking appraisal  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The Supreme Court opinion will likely be welcomed by corporate dealmakers who have warned that Laster s ruling would encourage hedge funds to seek a quick profit by scooping up shares just before a deal closes  then pursuing appraisal  As corporate lawyers express it  Dell was properly shopped to potential buyers such as Blackstone  NYSE BX  and the price was driven up during the process   However  there was plenty of criticism of the sale  It was approved by a slim majority of shareholders  Billionaire investor Carl Icahn encouraged dissatisfied Dell shareholders to seek appraisal  Laster said he rejected the use of deal price to determine fair value because private equity buyers and management led buyouts inherently undervalue a company   The Supreme Court said Laster should have given  heavy weight  to the deal price  given the evidence of fair play and market efficiency in the sale  The Supreme Court remanded the case to Laster and said he should follow the ruling s guidance to determine fair value  which the court suggested should be the deal price   We give the vice chancellor the discretion on remand to enter judgment at the deal price if he so chooses  with no further proceedings   said the 82 page unanimous opinion written by Justice Karen Valihura  In an August appraisal ruling  the Supreme Court said Chancellor Andre Bouchard erred in finding payday lender DFC Global Corp was sold too cheaply and criticized his finding that private equity buyers do not necessarily pay fair value   Larry Hamermesh  a professor at the Delaware Law School  said the two rulings taken together will reduce appraisal cases  continuing a recent trend of weeding out what the court sees as weaker shareholder lawsuits   The whole program here since Leo Strine became chief justice is about getting rid of the crappy lawsuits   Hamermesh said

188302,409818,BX,U S  tax curbs on debt deduction to sting buyout barons,news,"By Joshua Franklin  Reuters    As corporate America celebrates one of the biggest ever cuts to its tax bill  one corner of Wall Street is fretting over the impact the reforms will have on its ability to profitably invest in companies   Private equity firms that buy companies only to sell them a few years later at a profit face restrictions on their ability to deduct the interest these companies pay on their debt from their taxes  according to legislation approved on Wednesday by U S  lawmakers and set to be signed into law by President Donald Trump   The changes are a blow to the industry s business model of larding companies with debt to juice returns  They could make it more difficult and less profitable for buyout firms to outbid competitors for companies  industry executives said   It s a deviation from what has been allowed in the last 50 years   said David Fann  chief executive of TorreyCove Capital Partners LLC  a private equity advisory firm   This is a radical change  In fact  the buyout business would have never evolved without the benefits of leverage   The rules also show the limits of the industry s influence in Washington  despite efforts by executives such as Blackstone Group LP  N BX  Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman to cultivate Trump and his Republican party  Companies that were previously unrestricted in the amount of interest they could deduct now face a cap for the next four years of 30 percent of their 12 month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA    After 2021  the cap becomes even more constrictive by switching to 30 percent of 12 month earnings before interest and tax  EBIT   For a Reuters graphic on the sector by sector impact of the interest deductible cap  click  HEAVILY INDEBTED COMPANIES TO TAKE A HIT S P Global Ratings estimates that nearly 70 percent of companies whose debt amounts to more five times EBITDA would be negatively impacted by the interest deductibility cap  This casts a wide net  given that private equity firms  on average  saddle companies with more debt than that  according to Cambridge Associates  Around a third of all leveraged buyouts are expected to be worse off under the new tax system  according to Moody s Investors Service Inc  Using excessive borrowing as a yardstick  health publisher WebMD  software provider LANDESK and auto accessory seller Truck Hero are among those that could take a hit from the interest expense deductibility cap  All these companies are indebted at well above five times EBITDA  according to Thomson Reuters LPC data   WebMD owner KKR   Co LP  N KKR   and Truck Hero owner CCMP declined to comment on the impact of the cap on their companies and whether other aspects of the tax code overhaul could offset it  A representative for LANDESK owner Clearlake Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment   While the tax rates of private equity owned companies will decrease alongside all other U S  companies  the changes could hasten the demise of those struggling with their debt piles  Moody s said last week  This means that bankruptcies of heavily indebted private equity owned companies  such as that of U S  retailer Toys  R  Us in September  could come more quickly and become more difficult to escape   Defaults for lower rated  credit  issuers could increase in a downturn   Moody s analysts wrote in a note  That could discourage private equity firms from overburdening companies with debt  but also erode returns by pushing them to stump up more of their cash as equity to fund acquisitions  Given publicly traded companies that are not as indebted will have more cash under the new tax system to make rival offers for assets  the changes could make leveraged buyouts harder to complete on attractive terms  investment bankers said   The valuation challenge that private equity firms are facing in considering new investments may become exacerbated in 2018   said Gary Posternack  global head of M A at  Barclays  Plc  L BARC    Companies with the same P E ratio but with lower tax rates may see EBITDA multiples go up  making the economics more challenging for private equity firms   Posternack added  FLEXIBILITY To be sure  the new rules offer some flexibility  They allow companies to deduct interest payments above the 30 percent cap to the extent they did not reach that limit in the previous years   And the benefits from a tax rate cut to 21 percent from 35 percent and full upfront capital expenditure deductibility outweigh the cost of the curbs on interest deductibility for the majority of private equity owned companies  Given that private equity fund managers have also largely been spared a much feared tax hike on their performance fees  known as carried interest  the American Investment Council  AIC   the industry s lobby group  has put on a brave face    On balance  the tax bill represents a net positive for private equity and will enable the industry to continue to make long term investments that will grow the economy   AIC President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement   The impact of the new tax system will also vary across sectors   Those with high leverage and significant leveraged buyout activity  such as technology  healthcare and aerospace and

188303,409819,BX,Blackstone s Byron Wien unveils his big surprises for 2018,news,"Blackstone  NYSE BX  Vice Chairman and investing ace Byron Wien is out with his list of 10  surprises  for 2018  
These predictions  he says  have a better than 50  chance of happening  but the average investor assigns them only about a one in three chance  
The list  now in its 33rd year  includes a 10  stock market correction  populism worsening  and Republicans losing big in the midterm elections  


Blackstone vice chairman and investing stalwart Byron Wien is out with his list of surprises for 2018 
Wien defines his surprises as things that have a better than 50  chance of happening  but which the average investor anticipates a less than 30  likelihood of occurring 
2017 was not the strongest year in terms of how his forecasts played out  When Business Insider spoke to Wien in September  he acknowledged that he had been  dead wrong  on the dollar  wrong on inflation  and on the German election  Angela Merkel won a fourth term a few days later  
President Donald Trump definitely did not soften his tone  the euro didn t reach parity against the dollar  it s at a three year high   and crude oil sneaked above  60 per barrel in the final week of 2017 
But the economy did achieve 3  growth  the S P 500 zoomed past 2 500 in October  and Japan s stock market had a strong year 
Here s what Wien thinks could happen in 2018 
China gets serious about North Korea s nuclear threat   and gets results
 China finally decides that a nuclear capability in the hands of an unpredictable leader on its border is not tolerable even though North Korea is a communist buffer between itself and democratic South Korea  China cuts off all fuel and food shipments to North Korea  which agrees to suspend its nuclear development program but not give up its current weapons arsenal  
Populism spreads
 In the United Kingdom Jeremy Corbyn becomes the next Prime Minister  In spite of repressive action by the Spanish government  Catalonia remains turbulent  
The dollar turns around after a weak year
 Real growth exceeds 3  in the United States  which  coupled with the implementation of some components of the Trump pro business agenda  renews investor interest in owning dollar denominated assets  and the euro drops to 1 10 and the yen to 120 against the dollar  ",2018-01-03,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackstone039s-byron-wien-unveils-his-big-surprises-for-2018-1056949,1056949

188339,409855,BX,Exclusive  Big office building owners seek  co working  partners,news,By Herbert Lash NEW YORK  Reuters    Leading U S  office building owners  Equity Office and closely held Hines  are seeking partners to gain experience in the flexible workspace business that is changing how office space is leased  sources said  The Request for Proposals  RFP  from both firms shows landlords are heeding the increasing demand from tenants for flexible workspace  where collaboration among a mix of various workers is encouraged in what is known as  co working   The RFPs for both Equity Office  owned by the Blackstone Group  N BX   and Hines were previously unreported  The explosive growth of firms such as WeWork  the largest leaser of office space in Manhattan the past three years  has pushed landlords to offer  co working  options to tenants   These  co working  firms are increasingly grabbing business from landlords  traditional Fortune 500 corporate clients  For example  WeWork might be both the tenant of a large property owner and a competitor  subleasing space to co working members   The genesis of Equity Office s request for proposal was to explore how to make the sprawling Howard Hughes office complex in Los Angeles more attractive to tenants  said Rob Harper  head of U S  asset management at Blackstone s real estate group   We re thinking very creatively about how we deliver that service and who we might partner with to create the best possible environment for our tenants   Harper said  Responses to the Equity Office request for proposal are expected within days  Harper said  Three sources told Reuters about Hines  separate RFP  but that company declined to comment   OFFERING MORE SERVICES  Landlords are also keen to offer better services as a more mobile workforce and rising rental rates have forced offices to shrink  which has increased competition to attract tenants  In Manhattan  the biggest construction boom since the 1980s also is boosting the supply of new buildings  further increasing the pressure on landlords to offer more amenities and services   We re at an inflection point in the industry and we re all trying to figure that out   said Scott Rechler  chairman and chief executive of RXR Realty LLC  one of the largest property owners in Manhattan   But I do think there s an element of co working that s structural and is here to stay   he said   Co working space IMG     For an interactive view  click     Rechler is partnering with Convene  an on demand provider of meeting sites backed by Brookfield Property Partners  O BPY  that will soon roll out flexible workspaces at RXR s 530 Fifth Avenue  similar to a recent roll out in Los Angeles  In the Manhattan market for smaller spaces  those below 12 000 square feet  co working firm Knotel will have leased almost half of the space landlords have made available in 2017 by the end of the year  said Knotel CEO Amol Sarva  Tenants are demanding both more flexibility and more engagement from landlords  said Marcus Moufarrige  chief operating officer at Sydney based  Servcorp  Ltd  AX SRV   whose firm offers flexible workspace in 160 locations in 22 countries  Tenants are looking for alternatives to rigid five  or 10 year leases in order to better manage their space needs  said Moufarrige  who earlier this year moved to New York to better gauge the co working landscape  Manhattan is considered the epicenter of co working because jobs growth has been higher than the national average and its dense urban setting is attractive to a young workforce   The yield from flexible space is much higher than from traditional space   he said   This is driving the landlords to fear disruption and therefore try to pre empt it with the RFPs   GOLDEN GOOSE  Landlords are divided in how they view co working  said Alex Snyder  a senior analyst at real estate focused CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia  For U S  landlords  co working has mostly been a means to attract tenants and lift rents  he said  The services that flexible office providers tout do not lift revenue by much  he said    The golden goose is still rent   Snyder said  Landlords lack operational expertise because they have been slow to recognize what co working firms provide  said Jeffrey Langdon  managing director of Adaptive Office Resources  a consultancy in Rancho Santa Fe  California  A building owner s prime endeavor has been the acquisition of an asset while a tenant s needs have been secondary   Owners think about where do I deploy my capital   Langdon said   They don t have any idea how the end user is thinking and working   For Jamie Hodari  co founder and chief executive of Industrious  one of the largest co working firms with sites open or soon to open in 24 U S  cities  flexible workspace is an  outsourcing  industry on the brink of rapid growth  Landlords don t have the expertise to compete with co working firms  which will force them to either partner with a flexible workspace provider or go it alone  Hodari said   We re really at the end of the experimental era   Hodari told the  RETHINK Office of the Future  conference on Nov  30 ,2017-12-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-big-office-building-owners-seek-coworking-partners-989405,989405

188360,409876,BX,LPC  JDA  Surgery Partners add flexibility for future without Libor,news,By Kristen Haunss NEW YORK  Reuters    Companies are preparing for a future without a crucial lending benchmark  adding language to their leveraged loan documents that allow them to choose an alternative rate  sometimes without input from lenders  JDA Software  Surgery Partners and LPL Financial are among companies that have recently added such language  Some of these new provisions have come under lender scrutiny as investors are concerned some terms do not allow them to have input on a feature that could impact their payments  The US 938bn US leveraged loan market is seeking to build in flexibility following comments in July by Andrew Bailey  chief executive officer of the UK s Financial Conduct Authority  that a substitute for the London interbank offered rate  Libor  must be in place by the end of 2021  Libor lost credibility as a reference rate for trillions of dollars of investments after an investigation revealed a handful of notable banks had manipulated the rate for profit sharing as far back as 2003  Set by submissions from banks based on the rate they believe they would be charged to borrow  Libor is a mainstay in the US leveraged loan market where borrowers pay lenders a spread plus the rate  As Libor moves  so do the interest payments investors receive  making discussions about a benchmark change a focus of many   CHOICES Following Bailey s July comments  a handful of companies included language in their credit agreements that allow the agent bank and the borrower to decide on a new alternative rate to Libor   Many provisions give the majority of lenders the ability to object or consent to the change within a set timeframe if no new widely accepted alternative has been adopted by the market  One recent loan allowed required lenders to choose a new alternative that the agent bank had a right to object to  according to Jenny Warshafsky  a covenant analyst at Xtract Research  JDA  the supply chain management software company that received an equity injection last year from the Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group and New Mountain Capital  added language to its recent credit agreement for a US 1 24bn term loan that allows it to change the benchmark with just the approval of the loan s agent  JP Morgan  according to sources  The language was later tweaked to say that JDA and JP Morgan will give consideration to the  generally accepted  market standard before choosing a replacement  The new language also noted that the all in applicable rate would not change  Surgery Partners  a healthcare services provider  included a provision in its credit agreement for a US 1 29bn term loan that stipulates that if a new rate is not already in place  the administrative agent  Jefferies   from time to time  in consultation with the borrower  may select a new one  according to a regulatory filing   Broker dealer LPL Financial added language to a loan last month that says if Libor goes away  the administrative agent  JP Morgan  and the company can establish an alternative rate through an amendment  according to a regulatory filing  The amendment will become effective as long as the agent does not receive a written notice from required lenders of each class stating an objection within five business days  Some investors are concerned these terms can give the borrower too much authority to make changes that could impact interest payments without lender input  the sources said  Spokespeople for the companies and banks either declined to comment or did not return e mails and calls requesting comment  The language in US Collateralized Loan Obligations  CLOs   the largest buyers of leveraged loans  has varied  but a popular option with managers is to include a provision that stipulates the new benchmark is the one identified as the market standard by the US loan trade group  the Loan Syndications and Trading Association  according to investors  This option has yet to show up in loan agreements   Libor alternative language in credit agreements will continue to evolve as more borrowers seek flexibility  which may eventually lead to a market standard   Given that we have time to sort this out  some parties are closing deals with the same language that we have always had   said Jacob Schtevie  a partner at law firm Winston   Strawn in Chicago   Other market participants are trying to set a roadmap in their loan agreements for how to fix this issue when it actually arises  It will be interesting to see where the market ends up  ,2017-10-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lpc-jda-surgery-partners-add-flexibility-for-future-without-libor-544430,544430

188362,409878,BX,Exclusive  New Saudi mega city will be listed publicly  crown prince says,news,By Simon Robinson  Samia Nakhoul and Stephen Kalin RIYADH  Reuters    The  500 billion mega city planned by Saudi Arabia will be floated on financial markets alongside oil giant Saudi Aramco as part of the kingdom s drive to diversify away from oil  the crown prince told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also said Aramco s initial public offering is on track for next year and the national oil giant could be valued at more than  2 trillion   a sum some investors have said appears unrealistically high  His surprise announcement about the listing of NEOM  a 26 500 square km  10 230 square mile  zone that will extend into Jordan and Egypt  is the latest and most extraordinary in a slate of privatization programs led by the floating of Aramco   The futuristic high tech hub looks set to become a flagship of reforms championed by Prince Mohammed to create jobs  encourage entrepreneurs and permit new freedoms among Saudis steeped in religious puritanism and dependence on the state   The first capitalist city in the world     this is the unique thing that will be revolutionary   said Prince Mohammed  heir to the throne of the largest Arab economy  an absolute monarchy   Without a doubt  at the end of the day NEOM will be floated in the markets  The first zone floated in the public markets  It s as if you float the city of New York   The 32 year old spoke on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative conference  which has attracted nearly 4 000 delegates from around the world to Riyadh this week  On Aramco s IPO  he said   We are on track in 2018    but the listing  details  are still under discussion     It will be IPO ed in 2018   Switching between English and Arabic  sometimes in the same sentence  the prince seemed most excited discussing his plans for the new city  FOCUS ON GROWTH Adjacent to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba and near maritime trade routes that use the Suez Canal  the zone will serve as a gateway to the proposed King Salman Bridge  which will link Egypt and Saudi Arabia  NEOM will be fully owned by Saudi Arabia s sovereign Public Investment Fund  PIF  until its listing  and will attract investments from companies in renewable energy  biotechnology  advanced manufacturing and entertainment  the PIF has said   It won t be listed in the markets until the idea is mature enough   Prince Mohammed said   It might be after 2030  it might be before  but the idea and the strategy is to float it eventually   The new city will not follow the rules and regulations enforced in the rest of Saudi Arabia  which imposes sharia law based on a strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam  It will offer residents a more liberal lifestyle  allowing musical concerts and entertainment in a remote corner of the desert kingdom  Saudi Arabia has already started to relax some long standing rules  including what was an effective ban on women driving  Prince Mohammed said the city could appoint a board of directors and government  chief executive  whose only responsibility will be to stimulate economic activity   In New York  the governor is appointed to meet certain needs  including growth  but in NEOM the governor  CEO  doesn t have to deal with any of those problems  He only has growth in mind   He said the name mixed  neo   meaning new  with M  the first letter of the Arabic word for future  The new city is part of the crown prince s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy of Saudi Arabia  OPEC s largest producer  and provide jobs for an overwhelmingly young population in the face of a global oil price decline since 2014  Prince Mohammed has portrayed the reforms as a matter of economic survival  but one challenge for the ruling Al Saud family has been to secure the acquiescence of traditionalist clerics upon whose support the family relies for legitimacy  Some clergy suspect the bold initiatives conceived by the prince in leisure and tourism presage sweeping reforms in education  a bastion of conservatism where clerical control is believed by Western critics to have encouraged Islamist radicals not just in Saudi Arabia but across the Muslim and Arab worlds  But the prince has pushed ahead  confident he has the backing of most young Saudis  who make up the bulk of the population   I do think there is a desire within significant parts of Saudi society to move away from rigid  old school Wahhabi control of social behavior and the public sphere   said Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics  So I don t think the Crown Prince s statements are just for show  He genuinely wants to harness these sentiments and has undertaken very significant steps  including allowing women to drive and severely curtailing the powers of the religious police   Economic growth has slowed and the economy may shrink this year as the government introduces austerity measures   The idea is not to restructure the economy as much as to seize the opportunities available that we didn t address before  We have high capacity and we use only a little   Prince Mohammed said  He became next in line for the throne in June after the king  his father  removed a more senior prince from the succession  He has pledged to transform Saudi Arabia economically and socially   Vision 2030 is about a lot of big opportunities  so Aramco is one of them  NEOM another opportunity     We have a lot of huge projects we will announce in the next few years   He said the PIF would generate higher returns than other big investment funds  The kingdom had made a 20 percent profit in five months with the SoftBank Vision Fund  the world s largest private equity fund   That s why we established a  50 billion fund in Blackstone  NYSE BX   which is expected to make a 14 pct profit    QATAR AND YEMEN Prince Mohammed also said Saudi Arabia s dispute with neighboring Qatar had not affected investment   Qatar is a very  very  very small issue   he said  Saudi Arabia and three Arab allies cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar earlier this year over accusations that Doha supported Islamist  terrorists   Qatar denies the allegations  Prince Mohammed said the kingdom s war in Yemen would continue in order to prevent the armed Houthi movement from turning into another  Hezbollah  on Saudi Arabia s southern border   We re pursuing until we can be sure that nothing will happen there like Hezbollah again  because Yemen is more dangerous than Lebanon   he said  Hezbollah  armed and backed by Iran  has become a formidable force in Lebanon and Syria  The Houthis also reportedly receive arms and training from Iran  Riyadh s arch rival  Yemen s location is crucial  said Prince Mohammed   It s next to Bab al Mandab so if something happens there  that means 10 percent of world trade stops   he added  referring to the strait at the southern end of the Red Sea   This is the crisis

188406,409922,BX,Avaya reaches deal with creditors to exit bankruptcy,news,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON  Del  Reuters    A path has been cleared for telecommunications company Avaya Inc to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy in an agreement with its senior creditors and the government s pension insurer  Avaya said in a statement on Monday 
Avaya said that it had backing from holders of more than half of its  4 38 billion first lien debt and a settlement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp to terminate its underfunded salaried employee pension plan 
The agreements could cut more than  3 billion from the  6 3 billion in debt Avaya had when it entered bankruptcy in January 
Avaya had faced challenges in trying to transition to software and services from a business centered on hardware  and failed to sell its call center business 
Avaya also struggled with pension obligations  The PBGC has said Avaya s hourly workers plan was underfunded by  660 million and its salaried workers plan was underfunded by  1 24 billion 
The Santa Clara  California based company will pay the PBGC  300 million and give it 7 5 percent of the stock in the reorganized Avaya in return for transferring obligations for the salaried plan to the PBGC  according to court documents 
The reorganized company will maintain its pension plan for hourly employees 
Under the plan  which must be approved by Avaya s creditors and U S  Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan  debt holders will be repaid with a mix of cash  new debt and stock in the reorganized company 
A new board will be named by holders of the company s first lien debt  who will own a majority of the stock in the reorganized company  Holders of the first lien debt include funds affiliated with The Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group s GSO Capital Partners  Davidson Kempner and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   as well as dozens of other firms 
Avaya estimated in court papers its enterprise value  which includes debt and equity  at  5 721 billion 
First lien debt holders will receive about 95 percent of what they are owed  while holders of  1 44 billion in second lien notes will receive about 1 6 percent  according to court papers  Unsecured creditors will receive around 8 2 percent of the  305 million they are owed 

The company s debt stems in part from an  8 2 billion buyout in 2007 by private equity firms Silver Lake Partners LP and TPG Capital LP ",2017-08-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/avaya-reaches-deal-with-creditors-to-exit-bankruptcy-515400,515400

The biggest property sale in Spain comes amid renewed investor enthusiasm with prices gradually recovering following Spain s property and financial crash 
The property  which includes land  houses  apartments and hotels  had lost two thirds of its value  It was originally worth 30 billion euros 
The deal will involve the creation of a new company where Blackstone owns 51 percent and Banco Popular the remainder  buoying Santander s capital

Popular s rescue was unveiled in June  echoing a banking crash five years ago that cost Spain 40 billion euros

Roughly half a million newly built homes remain empty after the mania that peaked in 2007  largely on urban fringes and in more remote areas 
But demand for properties in leading cities and industrial regions is rising

188481,409997,BX,Sovereign funds  corporate acquisitions triple in second quarter of 2017,news,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON  Reuters    China Investment Corp s  CIC   13 7 billion acquisition of warehouse firm Logicor tripled the total value of sovereign wealth funds   SWFs  M A deals in the second quarter to  31 7 billion  just shy of a record set in the third quarter of 2016 
Adding to that  Qatar Investment Authority  QIA  was involved in the second biggest deal of the quarter  for an Australian utility  but it was unclear whether it would be as active overseas in coming months in light of a punishing diplomatic rift with its Gulf neighbors 
SWFs did 29 deals in the second quarter  down from 34 in the first when the total value was  9 9 billion  Thomson Reuters data showed  The bumper second quarter total was only slightly below the  32 1 billion achieved in Q3 2016 
The second quarter was boosted by a handful of megadeals  including Blackstone  NYSE BX  selling Logicor to CIC in Europe s biggest ever private equity real estate deal 
 Logistics is the jewel in the crown   it s a very trendy sub group within real estate because it is connected with e commerce   said Javier Capape  a director at the Sovereign Wealth Lab research center at the IE Business School in Madrid 
 SWFs are long term investors looking for disruption   they are looking for the new winners   he said 
CIC was also involved in the third largest deal of the quarter  a  4 5 billion recapitalization of China Everbright Bank  of which it is the ultimate parent 
In total CIC completed six deals  in high tech  healthcare and financials  while Singaporean SWF GIC  which has been on a buying spree for several quarters  did five deals  mainly in financials 
JP Morgan Asset Management s head of international institutional clients  Patrick Thomson  said Asian funds in particular were becoming more active managers

188502,410018,BX,Trump to hit the road for a jobs focused reset in tough week,news,"By Roberta Rampton
WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump will hit the road next week to ramp up his long promised plan to overhaul the nation s aging airports  roads and railways  a push that could energize his supporters and distract from political intrigue in Washington 
The infrastructure push   which will include a trip to Cincinnati  Ohio   comes as the White House seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy made by Trump last year during his campaign for office 
Those pledges have been eclipsed by the political furor over Russia s alleged meddling in the 2016 U S  election  That drama will come to a head on Thursday when former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey  who was leading the Russia probe until Trump fired him  testifies before a U S  Senate panel 
Trump   who has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign   has struggled to keep the spotlight on plans that could give him a political lift  The four events next week on infrastructure  which were in the works before Comey s hearing was scheduled  will give Trump the opportunity to provide some counterprogramming to the drumbeat of Russia news 
It is a deft messaging move  said Chris Barron  a pro Trump Republican strategist  who says the president is at his best when he is on the offensive 
 I think we need to see Trump out of D C  I think we need to see Trump out on the road  I think we need to see Trump engaging his base  firing up his base   Barron told Reuters 
BIPARTISAN APPEAL
During his campaign  Trump promised a 10 year  trillion dollar program to modernize decrepit infrastructure   a plan that holds bipartisan appeal because of its job creating potential  and that will require backing from the U S  Congress 
Legislative wins have eluded Trump thus far  He kicked off his policy push with healthcare and tax reform  initiatives that have become bogged down in process and controversy  The infrastructure push will offer some fresh ideas for the White House and lawmakers alike to discuss 
 It doesn t matter who you are   whether you re a farmer in the Midwest or a mother driving your kids to and from school  or work  or a college kid flying back and forth to school   you re affected by infrastructure   Gary Cohn  Trump s chief economic adviser  told reporters during a preview of the events 
On Monday  Trump will propose privatizing the air traffic control system  calling on lawmakers to hive it off from the Federal Aviation Administration 
Trump will make remarks in the Rose Garden and explain how the plan will save travelers time and save fuel costs for airlines  Cohn said 
On Wednesday  Trump will travel to the banks of the Ohio River to talk about improvements to the 12 000 miles  19 300 km  of inland waterways  dams  locks and ports critical for shipping farm products  and will deliver a speech about his vision for infrastructure  Cohn said 
He will huddle with a bipartisan group of governors and mayors at the White House on Thursday to discuss their needs and plans  Cohn said  Most U S  infrastructure is owned by state and local governments 
Trump will wrap up his push on Friday with a visit to the Department of Transportation to discuss regulatory reform for roads and rail  Cohn said 
BILL STILL IN WORKS
Trump last month asked Congress for  200 billion for infrastructure over 10 years  a plan that would encourage state and local governments to lease assets to the private sector to generate funding for other projects 
Some projects in rural areas may need traditional federal grants  an administration official told reporters  but most funds will be used to try to attract and leverage outside spending 
His administration has said it wants states to expand the use of tolling on interstate highways 
The White House does not plan to release its own infrastructure bill  and officials told reporters the timing for legislation is not set 
On the air traffic control overhaul  Trump plans to share the  principles  he supports  but will leave the drafting of legislation to lawmakers  officials told reporters 
Trump has said in the past that he would consider packaging infrastructure with healthcare or tax reform legislation as an incentive to obtain support from lawmakers 
The infrastructure plan has already attracted some private sector interest  Last month  U S  private equity firm Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP and Saudi Arabia s main sovereign wealth fund said they planned to create a  40 billion vehicle to invest in infrastructure projects  mainly in the United States ",2017-06-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-to-hit-the-road-for-a-jobs-focused-reset-in-tough-week-491551,491551

188527,410043,BX,Exclusive  Sinclair Broadcast nears deal for Tribune Media   sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Jessica Toonkel
 Reuters    Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc  O SBGI  is nearing a deal to acquire  Tribune Media Co   N TRCO  for close to  4 billion after prevailing in an auction for one of the largest U S  television station operators  according to people familiar with the matter 
A potential deal for Tribune comes just weeks after the U S  Federal Communications Commission voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy 
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  named by President Donald Trump in January  is planning to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U S  television households 
Sinclair s deal for Tribune Media also represents a blow to Rupert Murdoch s ambitions to expand Twenty First Century Fox Inc s  O FOXA  broadcast assets 
Fox Networks Group chairman Peter Rice confirmed at the Milken Institute Global Conference last week that Fox was looking to buy Tribune Media because  having more scale and more control of distribution is important  
Sinclair s offer values Tribune Media at around  44 per share  the sources said on Sunday  That would represent a premium of close to 30 percent of the price of Tribune Media shares on Feb  28  the day before Reuters broke the news that Sinclair had approached Tribune Media to discuss an acquisition 
Tribune Media shares ended trading on Friday at  40 29  giving it a market capitalization of  3 5 billion 
Negotiations between Sinclair and Tribune Media have not yet been finalized  and there is still a possibility the deal will not be reached  the sources cautioned 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential  Tribune Media declined to comment  Sinclair did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Tribune Media has 42 owned or operated broadcast stations  as well as cable network WGN America  Tribune Studios and WGN Radio  Sinclair  which has a market capitalization of  3 36 billion  owns  operates or provides services to 173 television stations in 81 markets 
Sinclair branched out into cable networks last year when it bought the Tennis Channel for  350 million 
Tribune Media said last year it was working with financial advisers Moelis   Co and Guggenheim Securities on a strategic review  It subsequently sold its media data unit Gracenote to Nielsen Holdings Plc for  560 million 
Twenty First Century Fox was in talks with Blackstone Group LP  N BX  last week about submitting an offer to buy Tribune Media  sources said at the time  Nexstar Media Group Inc also considered an acquisition of Tribune Media  sources have previously said 
Fox never submitted a bid  according to a source familiar with the matter ",2017-05-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-sinclair-broadcast-nears-deal-for-tribune-media---sources-480892,480892

188556,410072,BX,Mexico  Canada seek U S  soft spots to bolster NAFTA defense,news,"By Dave Graham and David Ljunggren MEXICO CITY OTTAWA  Reuters    From launching a data mining drive aiming to find supply chain pressure points to sending officials to mobilize allies in key U S  states  Mexico and Canada are bolstering their defenses of a regional trade pact President Donald Trump vows to rewrite  Trump has blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  for the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs and has threatened to tear it up if he fails to get a better deal  Fearing the massive disruptions a U S  pullout could cause  the United States  neighbors and two biggest export markets have focused on sectors most exposed to a breakdown in free trade and with the political clout to influence Washington  That encompasses many of the states that swept Trump to power in November and senior politicians such as Vice President Mike Pence  a former Indiana governor or Wisconsin representative and House Speaker Paul Ryan   Prominent CEOs on Trump s business councils are also key targets  according to people familiar with the lobbying push  Mexico  for example  has picked out the governors of Texas  Arizona and Indiana as potential allies  Decision makers in Michigan  North Carolina  Minnesota  Illinois  Tennessee  Wisconsin  Ohio  Florida  Pennsylvania  Nebraska  California and New Mexico are also on Mexico s priority list  according to people involved in talks   Mexican and U S  officials and executives have had  hundreds  of meetings since Trump took office  said Moises Kalach  foreign trade chief of the Mexican private sector team leading the defense of NAFTA   Graphic   Canada has drawn up a list of 11 U S  states  largely overlapping with Mexico s targets  that stand to lose the most if the trade pact enacted in 1994 unravels  To identify potential allies among U S  companies and industries  Mexican business lobby Consejo Coordinador Empresarial  CCE  recruited IQOM  a consultancy led by former NAFTA negotiators Herminio Blanco and Jaime Zabludovsky  In one case  the analysis found that in Indiana  one type of engine made up about a fifth of the state s  5 billion exports to Mexico  Kalach s team identified one local supplier of the product and put it touch with its main Mexican client   We said  talk to the governor  talk to the members of congress  talk to your ex governor  Vice President Pence  and explain that if this goes wrong  the company is done   Kalach said  He declined to reveal the name of the company and Reuters could not immediately verify its identity  Trump rattled the two nations last week when his administration said he was considering an executive order to withdraw from the trade pact  which has been in force since 1994  He later said he would try to renegotiate the deal first and Kalach said the lobbying effort deserved much credit for Trump s u turn   There was huge mobilization   he said   I can tell you the phone did not stop ringing in  Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross s office  It did not stop ringing in  National Economic Council Director  Gary Cohn s office  in the office of  White House Chief of Staff Reince  Priebus  The visits to the White House from pro NAFTA allies did not stop all afternoon   Among those calling the White House and other senior administration officials were U S  Chamber of Commerce chief Tom Donohue  officials from the Business Roundtable and CEOs from both lobbies  according to people familiar with the discussions  PRIME TARGET Mexico has been the prime target of NAFTA critics  who blame it for lost manufacturing jobs and widening U S  trade deficits  Canada had managed to keep a lower profile  concentrating on seeking U S  allies in case of an open conflict  That changed in late April when the Trump administration attacked Ottawa over support for dairy farmers and slapped preliminary duties on softwood lumber imports  Despite an apparently weaker position   Canada and Mexico jointly absorb about a third of U S  exports  but rely on U S  demand for three quarters of their own   the two have managed to even up the odds in the past by exploiting certain weak spots  When Washington clashed with Ottawa in 2013 over meat labeling rules  Canada retaliated by targeting exports from the states of key U S  legislators  A similar policy is again under consideration  Mexico is taking a leaf out of a 2011 trucking dispute to identify U S  interests that are most exposed  such as  2 3 billion of yellow corn exports      Mexico is also targeting members of Trump advisory bodies  the Strategic and Policy Forum and the Manufacturing Council  led by Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP s Stephen Schwarzman and  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  Co boss Andrew Liveris respectively  Senior Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers in charge of trade  agriculture and finance committees also feature among top lobbying targets  Canada has spread the task of lobbying the United States among ministries  official say  and is particularly keen to avoid disruption to the highly integrated auto industry  A core component of Mexico s strategy is to argue the three nations have a common interest in fending off Asian competition and exploring scope to source more content regionally  The defenders of NAFTA also say that it supports millions of jobs in the United States  and point out that U S  trade shortfalls with Canada and Mexico have declined over the past decade even as the deficit with China continued to climb  Part of IQOM s mission is to identify sectors where NAFTA rules of origin could be modified to increase regional content       For example  U S   Canadian and Mexican officials are debating how the NAFTA region can reduce auto parts imports from China  Japan  South Korea or Germany  Mexican officials say       The key thing is to see how we can get a win win on the products most used in our countries  and to develop common manufacturing platforms that allow us just to buy between ourselves the biggest amount of inputs we need   said Luis Aguirre  vice president of Mexican industry group Concamin

188654,410170,BX,In weekend of deliberation  Mattis favored for Trump Pentagon chief,news,"By Steve Holland BEDMINSTER  N J   Reuters    President elect Donald Trump on Sunday assessed several more contenders for top U S  posts including Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani  as blunt spoken retired Marine Corps General James Mattis emerged as a leading candidate for defense secretary  Trump held meetings at his golf resort in Bedminster  New Jersey  with candidates for senior administration jobs after he takes office on Jan  20  On Saturday  he conferred with Mattis and Mitt Romney  formerly a fierce Trump critic now under consideration for secretary of state  Summing up two days of talks as he said goodbye to retired U S  Marines Corps General John Kelly on Sunday evening  Trump said he had made decisions on a couple of appointments   We really had some great meetings  and you ll be hearing about them soon   Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said no decisions would be announced on Sunday night  Trump discussed the treasury secretary job with Jon Gray  a board member of the Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group  two sources familiar with their meeting said  A Trump transition team statement said their discussion included the U S  economy  global capital markets and the world financial situation  as well as tax reform and long term debt  The last person Trump escorted out of the clubhouse was Giuliani  the former New York mayor  Trump said earlier that Giuliani was a candidate for secretary of state  and other things   The Trump team statement said Trump and Giuliani discussed  administration priorities  as well as  restoring America s prominence in the world  ongoing national security issues and threats at various hotspots on a global basis   Christie  the Republican governor of New Jersey  advised Trump during the presidential campaign but was dismissed as the head of his transition team  Asked by reporters before the meeting whether there was a place for Christie in his administration  Trump sidestepped the question but called him  a very talented man  great guy   Trump met with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross  who he said was under consideration for commerce secretary  Asked whether he wanted the job  Ross told reporters   Well  time will tell    Trump also received Jonathan Gray  the global head of real estate at the Blackstone Group  who is being considered for Treasury secretary  according to a person briefed on the matter  The president elect has already tapped three senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams  choosing U S  Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general  U S  Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director  and retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as national security adviser  OBAMA TO DEFEND  CORE VALUES  The selections so far suggest that Trump  true to his campaign promises  intends to steer national security and foreign policy in a sharply different direction from that of Democratic President Barack Obama  whose record Trump harshly criticized during his campaign  Obama campaigned extensively for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov  8 election and warned during the campaign that Trump lacked the temperament and qualifications to be president  In Peru  as he wrapped up his last foreign trip  one that was overshadowed by Trump s surprise election  Obama encouraged Democrats on Sunday to work with the new administration but said he would weigh in as a citizen if the Trump administration challenged values he holds dear   In another sign of Trump s novel approach to politics  the New York businessman who has never held public office said he planned to live in the White House but that his wife  Melania  and their 10 year old son  Barron  would not move in immediately  He said they would move from New York to the White House  very soon  right after he finishes school    TRUE GENERAL S GENERAL   While Trump received lawmakers  politicians and business leaders behind closed doors over the weekend  he gave some hints about his thinking and possible Cabinet choices on Twitter   On Sunday  he tweeted that  General James  Mad Dog  Mattis  who is being considered for Secretary of Defense  was very impressive yesterday  A true General s General   From 2010 to 2013  Mattis headed the U S  military s Central Command  which oversees operations stretching from the Horn of Africa through the Middle East and into Central Asia including Afghanistan and Pakistan  During that time  he was at odds with the Obama administration on the need to prepare for potential threats from Iran and about resources for Afghanistan  Mattis  66  served as an American commander in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was known to be popular among the troops  Speaking on  Fox News Sunday   Vice President elect Mike Pence  who now heads Trump s transition team   said Mattis had  a legendary military career   Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said it was a  very real possibility  Mattis would get the job  telling the ABC program  This Week    I know that President elect Trump loves leaders like General Mattis   Pence said that Trump and Romney had a good meeting and  a warm and a substantive exchange    I can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States   Pence said on the CBS program  Face the Nation    Romney  the unsuccessful 2012 Republican presidential nominee  was a leader of the Republican establishment movement that tried to block Trump from becoming the nominee this year  In March  Romney called Trump  a phony    a fraud  and  a con man   A source close to Romney from his time as Massachusetts governor expressed concern he might be  frozen out  by officials whose thinking appears to be closer to Trump s  such as Flynn  Mattis  White House counselor Steve Bannon  and members of Trump s family   How much influence and latitude he will have will be up to Trump  and they don t appear to be on the same page about much   the source said

to her new government job  Alison Owen set out to buy a home this spring in the hot market of Austin  Texas   Owen s real estate agent warned the 28 year old that she would face stiff competition in the market for entry level homes   and he wasn t kidding   Owen had to offer  215 000 for a property listed at  198 000 to fend off at least nine other bidders for the 1 200 square foot home in the sought after neighborhood of Wells Branch   I definitely spent a lot more than I thought I was going to spend   Owen said  Similar scenarios are playing out across the United States  Low interest rates and an improving job market have created a wave of prospective first time home buyers  but they re being stymied by a dearth of available starter homes  Nationwide  the inventory of homes costing  250 000 or less fell more than 12 percent between June 2015 and June 2016  according to the National Association of Realtors   The shortage stems from higher labor  land and building permit costs that have caused construction companies to focus on higher end homes that bring more profit  In addition  institutional investors are snapping up affordable homes by the thousands in select markets nationwide and converting them to rentals  For a graphic showing the declining number of starter homes for sale in key markets  see   The shrinking supply of affordable homes is one economic

have been traditionally considered a trade up  Over the past four years  the number of entry level homes for sale   defined as those priced in the lower third of a local market   has fallen by 34 percent  according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by listings firm Trulia   The market is even tighter in many cities  In Salt Lake City the average number of starter homes on the market has fallen by 83  since 2012  and in San Diego by 71 5   Cambridge  Mass  and Portland Ore  have both seen drops of more than 60    THE NEW RENTING REALITY Between 2006 and 2014  the number of single family homes occupied by renters jumped by about 34 percent  according to the U S  Census Bureau  a shift that had its roots in the subprime mortgage crisis  After the housing crash  institutional investors rushed to buy undervalued and foreclosed homes and convert them to rentals  Corporations or companies now own nearly one fifth of all homes priced under  300 000 that are not occupied by

largest U S  single family home rental company  Blackstone has invested  8 7 billion in its 45 000 home portfolio since founding it in 2012  Large scale investors often make all cash offers when purchasing houses  and they can more easily outbid individual buyers  Laura Medina  25  a human resources manager who attended a recent grand opening of a starter home community in Jurupa Valley  California  said she has lost bidding wars over six months of looking for a home for herself and her son    There are a lot of investors out there   she said  The promise of a stable income from increasing rents has also turned many individuals into  accidental landlords  who rent out their homes when they move rather than sell them  according to NAR economist Lawrence Yun  The growing number of renters makes investing in rental housing attractive  Young adults aged 18 to 34 earn  2 000 less per year today than they did in 1980  after adjusting for inflation  according to the Census Bureau  and they have amassed record levels of student debt  Outstanding student loan debt totaled  1 2 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2015   trailing only mortgage debt among all consumer debt categories  according to the New York Fed  The average student loan monthly payment has jumped 50 percent in constant dollars  to  351  over the last 10 years   Both factors have contributed to young people entering the housing market later  A survey released in June by the NAR found that 71 percent of non homeowners who carry student debt said it had delayed them from buying a home  SLOW CONSTRUCTION As individual and institutional landlords have siphoned off rentals at the low end of the market  new construction has been slow to meet the demand from homebuyers  As of June  housing starts on single family homes were on track to hit 778 000 this year  far below levels of more than a million starts per year during the 1990s and early 2000s  That s in part because new home construction remains depressed coming out of the recession  when builders retreated and many construction workers found other lines of work   The resulting labor shortage continues  and is one factor slowing builders  along with higher land costs and tight construction financing  said National Association of Home Builders economist Rob Dietz  Average residential land values are up about 79 percent over the last four years  to a level last seen when the housing market peaked in 2007 and 2008  according to the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy  The cost of building a new home  including permit fees  labor and materials  meanwhile  has jumped to 61 8 percent of the cost of an average single family home  compared with 48 1 percent in 2007  Atlanta based PulteGroup Inc  N PHM   one of America s largest home construction firms  says that market forces have pushed it into building more expensive homes  First time buyers make up 32 percent of Pulte s business today  down from 40 percent just five years ago  And the company has refocused its entry level homes at a higher average price of about  350 000  targeting more affluent  urban buyers   We don t see a lot of value today in running out into the exurbs and buying a lot of lots   PulteGroup Chief Financial Officer Bob O Shaughnessy said at an investor conference in May

BOSTON  Reuters    Investor Michael Gordon has no plans to retire but when he does he wants to ensure that Angelo  Gordon  the  26 billion firm he co founded with John Angelo 28 years ago  survives without him 
To lay the groundwork for an eventual succession  Gordon said the firm created a management committee to run the business and will let senior employee partners buy out the founders  controlling interests over the next five years 
 I have been working closely for the last several months with senior leaders of the firm to develop a strategy that will best position us to transition governance and ownership of the firm to our next generation of leadership   Gordon wrote in a letter dated Friday and seen by Reuters 
The moves will ensure  our business continues to thrive long after I retire   which I have no plans to do any time soon   Gordon wrote 
Gordon will retain a significant  non controlling interest  he said in the letter 
Succession planning has become a critical issue in the  3 trillion hedge fund industry at a time many of the industry s biggest firms are still run by their founders who are edging closer to retirement age 
The changes at Angelo  Gordon come less than a year after John Angelo  its co founder  died in January of cancer at 74 
The new management committee will meet weekly and include Gordon  who is the firm s chief executive officer and chief investment officer  Deputy Chief Investment Officer Josh Baumgarten  and Adam Schwartz  who heads the U S  and European real estate business  Baumgarten joined from Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group earlier this year

188690,410206,BX,Real estate investors on U S  coasts target cheap  out of state markets,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Even with a good salary as a data scientist at a San Francisco technology firm  Yang Guo  30  knew he couldn t afford a home in the Bay Area  among the priciest U S  markets  He still wanted to own property in addition to stocks  however  and soon found a way to buy cheap rental houses in faraway cities   and to outsource the associated hassles to HomeUnion  a three year old startup in Irvine  California  The firm is among a small crop of new companies  including competitors Investability and Roofstock  that offer ways to buy  renovate and manage properties in markets that command relatively strong rents compared to their low home prices   The risks remain the same as any landlord faces  from vacancies to broken appliances to the potential for a rent  or home price downturn  And using such services places a lot of faith in young companies with short track records  But the firms  launched after the housing crisis  say they can take much of the worry and work out of owning out of state rentals  for fees that typically run from 7 percent to 10 percent for property management and 3 percent for acquisition  Their clients usually buy one or two homes to supplement their incomes and investment portfolios   The companies are pulling in money from clients in costly coastal markets that is boosting demand and home prices in the lower cost cities they target   In the last 12 months  I ve seen more cash buyers from California than I ve ever seen in my career  and I ve been doing this for 25 years   said Anne Callahan  a real estate agent in Cleveland  Ohio  where the average rent for a single family home is up 4 2 percent over the last year  according to Zillow Research  Earlier this year  Guo bought and fixed up a small home in the suburbs of Birmingham  Alabama that he found through HomeUnion  He purchased another home in the suburbs of Columbia  South Carolina   spending about  60 000 on the pair  Now  from his apartment in San Francisco s trendy South of Market neighborhood  Guo collects monthly checks from tenants he has never met in properties that he has never seen  all located more than 2 000 miles away    There s too much risk with buying property in the Bay Area   Guo said   As long as the cash flow is coming and hitting my bank account  I basically don t care about seeing them in person   Buyers like Guo are attracted to less glamorous regions where home prices and rents have risen at modest rates in the housing recovery  They re eyeing steady income rather than rapid home price appreciation  In suburban Atlanta  the average landlord of a single family home reaps a 25 8 percent gross annual yield  a measure of annual rent divided by median sales price  not including other potential costs  according to real estate data firm RealtyTrac  That compares with just a 3 4 percent yield in the San Francisco Bay Area  where the median home price was  675 000 in August  according to data provider CoreLogic   It s all people from the coasts coming to us and saying   We want to find a way to buy properties out of state    said Don Ganguly  the chief executive of HomeUnion  LEARNING TO BE A LANDLORD Most homes purchased through the firms go for between  50 000 and  150 000  the companies said  or about typical for first time home buyers in the same markets  Florida has long been the most popular state for out of state investors  in large part because of its beaches  but lower priced states such as Georgia  Tennessee  and Ohio are emerging as destinations for buyers from beyond their borders  according to RealtyTrac   For a graphic showing top markets for out of state landlords  see   While these investors have identified a real opportunity  their inexperience and lack of local market knowledge can lead to some mistakes  real estate agents said   You see these people coming from California and what I like to call  yuppie ing up a place   but they don t realize it s not in the best area because they didn t do their homework   said Tony Kazanas  a real estate agent in Cleveland   Guo  the San Francisco investor  had no experience as a landlord and is already realizing that it is not as simple as he imagined   His property near Birmingham   in a metro area whose 14 4 percent vacancy doubles the 6 9 percent average nationwide   sat empty for a few months before he landed a tenant  The high cost of property insurance  meanwhile  is making him wary of buying in areas susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters   There are signs  too  that the rental industry is cooling off  After the housing crash  hedge funds raced into beaten down markets including Las Vegas and Los Angeles  buying up large blocs of single family homes to rent out  But some institutional investors are now eyeing an exit strategy  Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP s Invitation Homes announced in July that it expects to sell about 5 percent of its about 50 000 homes to current renters  In addition  while U S  rents have risen by an average of 4 1 percent since 2010  average rents in New York  San Francisco and San Jose fell in the third quarter for the first time during that period  The decrease in expensive markets could presage broader weakness rent prices nationally   BUYING WITH RETIREMENT FUNDS Many investors still see a long term play  They are turning to self directed individual retirement accounts  which allow investors to buy property and let their rental income build tax free as long the home is kept for investment  not personal use  Some buyers use their IRAs to pay cash for rental properties  but others get mortgages from niche lenders that offer them on properties held in retirement accounts    Self directed IRAs are becoming a more critical piece of property sales as an investment   said Dennis Cisterna  chief revenue officer at Investability  Major asset management firms like  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  and TD Ameritrade do not allow account holders to buy property directly using their IRAs  Smaller firms such as Oakland based The Entrust Group  which manages about  2 2 billion in assets  say that about a third of clients use their self directed IRAs to buy real estate  with Kentucky  Alabama  and Arizona among the most popular markets for California based clients  Guo  the San Francisco investor  used cash savings and took out a mortgage on each property  The monthly notes for both houses total less than what he pays in rent in San Francisco  he said  He takes some of out every paycheck and earmarks it for real estate  hoping to build a portfolio of at least 10 rental properties for less than what it would cost to buy a single home in the Bay Area

188692,410208,BX,Blackstone in the lead to acquire Team Health  sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Carl O Donnell
 Reuters    Blackstone Group LP  N BX  is the lead bidder to acquire  Team Health Holdings Inc   N TMH   the U S  hospital staffing provider that has been the target of activist funds  including Jana Partners LLC  according to people familiar with the matter 
The deal would allow Team Health to cope with pricing pressure as a private company  amid a wave of consolidation in its industry  Rival  Amsurg Corp   O AMSG   whose  5 billion bid for Team Health was snubbed last year  agreed in June to merge with Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc  N EVHC    nL4N1974X1 
It would also be a rare occasion of a private equity firm returning for an investment in the same company  Blackstone acquired Team Health from a consortium of investors that included Madison Dearborn Partners LLC in 2005  and exited its investment following an initial public offering of Team Health in 2009 
Blackstone  a New York based private equity firm  has prevailed over other bidders in the auction for Team Health  and is in the process of negotiating final terms for an acquisition  the people said on Tuesday  cautioning that it is still possible that the talks end without a deal 
The value of Blackstone s offer could not be learned  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential  Blackstone and Team Health declined to comment 
Shares of Team Health closed up 7 2 percent at  40 25 in New York on Tuesday  giving the company a market capitalization of around  2 9 billion 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct  4  citing sources it did not identify  that Team Health was exploring a sale to a private equity firm  and that Blackstone was one of the buyout firms in discussions with the company 
Knoxville  Tennessee based Team Health is one of the largest physician services companies  offering outsourcing services  including emergency medicine  anesthesiology and ambulatory care  to hospitals and physician groups 
The physician services sector has been rapidly consolidating  as rising administrative costs due to the U S  President Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act  and the desire to offer a broader array of services to hospitals  has driven some companies to seek greater scale 
Following its rejection of Amsurg s offer  Team Health in November acquired smaller peer IPC Healthcare Inc for  1 6 billion 
In March  Team Health agreed to add three directors to its board following a deal with Jana  which had criticized its  missteps in critical areas including capital allocation  strategy and governance  
Other activist hedge funds in Team Health s stock include Sachem Head Capital Management LP and Corvex Management LP 

In September  Team Health announced Leif Murphy would be its new chief executive officer  replacing Michael Snow ",2016-10-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackstone-in-the-lead-to-acquire-team-health:-sources-433190,433190

188757,410273,BX,Citadel to launch new stock unit  taps Diamondback Capital co founder as head,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Hedge fund Citadel is launching a new stock picking unit later this year and has hired industry veteran Richard Schimel to run it  illustrating the  24 billion firm s commitment to a sector where it has expanded dramatically in the last year 
The company said Schimel will join as a senior managing director and will sit on the firm s investment committee while overseeing the still unnamed new unit 
 With Richard s hire we continue to execute our talent growth strategies  establishing teams in talent rich locations while also providing ample opportunities to promote and develop existing team members through a number of platforms   Citadel wrote to investors in a letter seen by Reuters 
Schimel said he expects to hire as many as 70 people in the first year alone  Six to eight teams with seven to nine members each will cover all key stock sectors 
Schimel previously ran Diamondback Capital Management  a prominent hedge fund that counted Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group and many pension funds as clients 
The new unit will be based in Greenwich  Connecticut  marking the first time Chicago headquartered Citadel will have a major presence in a state that is home to Steven A  Cohen s Point72 Asset Management and many other hedge funds 
A year ago Citadel launched Ravelin Capital  a new stock picking unit in San Francisco  It also has two other units  Global Equities and Surveyor Capital 
The expansion further underscores the resurgence of Kenneth Griffin s Citadel which has steadily rebuilt since losing roughly 50 percent during the 2007 09 financial crisis on the back of riskier bets  The firm s flagship Kensington and Wellington funds gained 14 percent last year  a year in which the average hedge fund lost money 
It also illustrates how Citadel is sticking with a multi manager platform at a time when funds with this type of format have experienced some troubles 
Citadel replaced Jon Venetos as head of Surveyor earlier this year and laid off more than two dozen employees in the wake of losses 
 Investors will continue to want low net  market neutral strategies and we think this is going to be a substantial opportunity for Citadel   Schimel said  He also noted that it is a good time to be hiring since many smaller firms are struggling right now 
For Schimel the move to Citadel marks a full comeback 
He was forced to shut down Diamondback when the firm he co founded with Larry Sapanski and Chad Loweth was touched by the U S  government s insider trading investigation  Neither Diamondback nor its founders were ever charged with any wrongdoing 
Former Diamondback partners earlier this year received a  3 million refund from the Securities and Exchange Commission paid years ago to settle civil charges related to the insider trading case 
At its peak  Diamondback employed 260  including 50 portfolio managers  and once had as much as  6 billion in assets 
After Diamondback  Schimel set up hedge fund Sterling Ridge but like many smaller firms  it struggled to gain traction and most recently managed only about  250 million  Investors have been told that the firm is being shut down and the portfolio is being liquidated ",2016-04-20,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citadel-to-launch-new-stock-unit,-taps-diamondback-capital-co-founder-as-head-396797",396797

188802,410318,BX,Distressed asset buyers see silver lining as miners languish,news,"By Melanie Burton and Swati Pandey
MELBOURNE SYDNEY  Reuters    After years on the sidelines  funds specializing in troubled assets are set to take center stage in the mining industry  driving deals in a sector where the top players alone plan to raise more than  30 billion through sales to cut debt 
Overall deal volume in mining and metals last year sank to its lowest level globally since 2003  according to Thomson Reuters data  as the industry s sellers  crippled by more than  1 trillion in debt  crowded a market with very few buyers 
Bankers  funds and investors  however  say that could change in 2016  as specialist buyers rethink a market where prices are languishing  mines are losing money and the traditional competition is weak 
Funds sidelined and waiting for the right deals could amount to as much as  3 billion  according to a ballpark figure from corporate finance and restructuring firm FTI Consulting 
 The longer this commodity rout continues  the greater number of restructures   David McCarthy  national leader for restructuring at Deloitte in Sydney  told Reuters 
 Some of those will be by existing financiers and existing equity holders  For others  the risk will be too great   and that s where distressed opportunities will  be   
Oaktree Capital  the world s largest investor in distressed debt  opened an office in Sydney this month  in part at least because of the strain in mining  it said  particularly iron ore  where it sees potential for deals 
Others are targeting existing mines where the geology has already been proven   and not development projects   for gold  copper  zinc and rare minerals  all exposed to the later stages of the economic cycle and renewable energy 
 I think it will be a busy year for everyone in the industry   said Michael Ryan  a senior managing director of FTI Consulting in Perth 
 I expect to see a lot of restructuring and cost cutting work  debt for equity transactions  restructuring balance sheet type transactions  sales of assets  divestiture of non key assets to further shore up  distressed miners   balance sheets  
In Australia s struggling iron ore sector for example  existing lenders to Atlas Iron  AX AGO  agreed to take a haircut on repayments in return for a larger equity stake 
But steel and iron ore group Arrium  AX ARI   with nearly  2 billion of debt  had to look outside for help  turning to GSO Capital Partners  the global credit and alternative investment arm of PE behemoth Blackstone Group  N BX  
Earlier this month  it secured  927 million in funding to help Arrium retire debt and overhaul its business 
Media reports have said Cerberus Capital Management  another major U S  investor in distressed assets  also considered a move on Arrium and remains on the sidelines  Cerberus did not respond to an emailed request for comment 
In November  global PE group Denham Capital backed Perth based Auctus Minerals and its management team of mining restructure specialists with  130 million  as it bought battered Atherton Resources  AX ATE   which holds zinc and gold copper resources in Queensland 
 If you invest equity into what makes money at current price levels  you also have the unlimited upside if  during the holding period  the market recovers   Denham Capital Managing Director Bert Koth told Reuters 
But the key question is how long these new financial investors can hold on to mining assets  given futures prices that suggest metals prices could languish for as long as another decade   the very cycles that have long kept private equity out of mining 
 People are saying we re probably at the bottom but what they don t know is how long we re going to stay at the bottom   FTI s Ryan said ",2016-03-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/distressed-asset-buyers-see-silver-lining-as-miners-languish-389884,389884

188804,410320,BX,Private equity emerges as lender of last resort for U S  energy firms,news,"By Koh Gui Qing
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  energy companies facing a likely cut in their bank loans are seeking a costly alternative   borrowing from private equity firms at hefty interest rates to stay alive for longer 
In a sign of the times  U S  oil and gas producer Clayton Williams Energy Inc said this month it was borrowing  350 million from private equity firm Ares Management LP to replace an equivalent loan from a group of banks 
The loan from Ares is the first publicly known deal of its kind  and does not come cheap 
Ares will charge interest rates more than triple that collected by banks  win the rights to buy up to 18 5 percent of outstanding Clayton shares and can appoint two directors to Clayton s board  Crucially  it could also give Ares control over Clayton s assets if it should fall into bankruptcy 
Clayton and Ares declined to comment when reached 
But like other cash strapped energy firms  Clayton does not have a choice  Tens of billions worth of loans are expected to be downsized   or  re determined    across the energy sector this spring as banks pare their exposure to the battered industry  a Reuters calculation showed 
Desperate to hang on to their sources of financing  energy companies are likely to accept stringent deal terms they may not have accepted in normal times  Indeed  some are also restructuring their debt with bondholders 
 The deal here for Ares gives them an opportunity to win in almost every situation   said John Sirico  an analyst at independent credit research firm Covenant Review 
More of such deals could be struck this spring as loans get renegotiated  he said  and private equity firms with big credit arms such as Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP  Apollo Global Management LLC and Oaktree Capital Management are likely to take the lead 
Blackstone  Apollo and Oaktree declined to comment 
The worst energy slump in 12 years that has seen oil prices tumble 65 percent since mid 2014 has cost tens of thousands of jobs and triggered dozens of bankruptcies 
With oil prices widely expected to hover around  40 this year  many analysts expect many more companies to fall into bankruptcy in coming months 
U S  banks have been increasing the amount of money they set aside to cover energy related losses and some have been looking to sell blocks of distressed energy loans to private equity firms  to remove the risk from their balance sheet 
LOAN TO OWN
Before the collapse in oil prices  banks were prepared to disburse  revolver  loans to energy companies based on the value of their energy reserves  The loans allowed borrowers to use the cash when they needed to  much like a credit card 
Often priced at a couple of percentage points above benchmark rates  revolvers were the cheapest form of financing for energy producers and were considered mostly risk free by banks 
But as oil prices plunged  banks  under pressure by regulators to shed risky business  started slashing loans to energy businesses since October  U S  oil and gas producers Energy XXI Ltd and Rex Energy Corp said on Tuesday their credit lines had been cut by banks  regulatory filings showed 
Some banks are even selling their energy revolver loans to private equity firms at deep discounts 
Indeed  Clayton s financing may have shrunk if not for Ares 
Previously  Clayton had a revolver worth  450 million from banks  It is not clear who backed Clayton s most recent credit facility but banks including JPMorgan  NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  Union Bank and Frost National Bank have done so previously  The banks declined to comment 
A senior JPMorgan banker had warned in February that lenders could cut credit lines by 15 percent to 20 percent in the upcoming negotiation season 
Under the new arrangement  Clayton would borrow  350 million from Ares for five years  and get the remaining  100 million in a revolver loan from a consortium of 16 banks that include JPMorgan  a regulatory filing showed

188808,410324,BX,Is a mandatory U S  retirement saving plan in your future ,news,"By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters    Make a list of the most toxic words in American politics  and  employer mandate  certainly would be in the top 10  Requiring employers to provide health insurance to workers is one of the most controversial features of the Affordable Care Act   along with the requirement that individuals buy insurance   But a mandatory retirement savings program might just have a shot at success in Washington as part of a broader bipartisan attempt to address the looming retirement security crisis  The idea is getting a push from a politically unlikely duo  labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci and Tony James  president of Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP  the global asset management firm  What they have in common is a mutual belief that the 401 k  system is not up to the job of building a secure retirement for average Americans  Indeed  just 23 percent of workers age 45 and higher have saved more than  250 000  according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute  Meanwhile  Social Security replaces only about 40 percent of pre retirement income on average  according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College   far short of the 70 to 80 percent most households will need to retire with security    People are coming into old age without sufficient money to maintain their lifestyles  and many of them will be poor or near poor when they were once middle class   Ghilarducci says  HOW IT WOULD WORK  Ghilarducci has long advocated replacing 401 k s with a federally managed retirement savings plan called Guaranteed Retirement Accounts  GRAs   and now she has teamed up with James to push the idea  The two recently published a white paper outlining a joint version of Ghilarducci s GRA idea  Ghilarducci also is serving on a commission on retirement security and personal saving organized by the Bipartisan Policy Center  BPC   which will report its findings in May   and is expected to reflect at least some features of the GRA   The 401 k   a tax deferred workplace based vehicle for saving and investing for retirement  requires individuals to make their own investment decisions  Some 401 k  plans have high fees   and they are not designed to provide a guaranteed lifelong income stream   Ghilarducci and James propose that every worker would own and control a GRA account  initially contributing 1 5 percent of income  which would be matched by employers  Their plan calls for a mandatory system with universal participation  but it would be cost neutral for workers below median income level  a family earning  45 000   because it would be offset by a tax credit  Account holders would choose from a list of professional money managers competing for their business in a federally run exchange  The aim is to let managers compete for business based on returns and their ability to keep costs down  At retirement  savings would be converted automatically to an annuity that guarantees a yearly payout for life  This would be accomplished through a nationwide retirement pool that shares actuarial risk and administered by the Social Security Administration  Ghilarducci and James are not the first to propose a mandatory retirement saving system  The Obama administration has long promoted auto IRAs  which would be offered to all workers who do not already have a 401 k   It took a step in that direction last year with the introduction of the MyRa  a federally sponsored voluntary starter retirement account featuring payroll deduction  no fees  conservative investments and a guaranteed rate of return  And a number of states are pushing to create their own mandatory plans   Ghilarducci and James also point to the experience of other major industrialized countries   Britain  Australia and New Zealand among them   that have moved to universal  mandatory savings plans  LOOMING DEBATE OVER SOCIAL SECURITY Despite the political toxicity of mandates  their plan could gain traction as part of a bigger legislative deal focused on both retirement saving and Social Security reforms   Congress will have to address Social Security sometime soon  The program s two key trust funds   for retirement and disability programs   are on track to be exhausted in 2034  according to the Social Security trustees  absent an injection of new revenue  benefit cuts or some combination of the two  Progressives hope not only to restore the trust fund s health  but to expand Social Security benefits as part of the reform debate  They hope to inject new revenue into the system by lifting or eliminating the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax and gradually increasing payroll tax rates  Conservatives will push for savings via higher retirement ages and possibly means testing of benefits  The BPC report will provide a useful proxy on how the debate could shape up in Congress  The commission will reflect at least some of the Ghilarducci James approach  focusing on improved access to workplace retirement accounts  plan design and automatic enrollment  The Social Security recommendations are likely to include higher revenue and benefit improvements for widows  spouses and low income beneficiaries  But higher retirement ages also have been part of the group s debate  according to Shai Akabas  BPC s associate director of economic policy  
 Many groups have looked at Social Security or 401 k s or tax preferences   he says   We are looking at how the pieces interact as a system  ",2016-03-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/is-a-mandatory-u.s.-retirement-saving-plan-in-your-future -390517,390517

in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail  but one family and the Washington  deficit hawk  community it bankrolls are unfazed  Among the capital s many activists  few names are as closely linked to one issue as the Peterson family is with attacking the deficit and the federal debt  Yet they face a growing struggle to win attention for the cause as the deficit has shrunk to less than a third of its level when President Barack Obama took office  making it a less pressing issue for politicians and the public alike  The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  said on Tuesday the deficit will likely be  426 billion in fiscal 2015 and decline further to  414 billion in fiscal 2016  That would be its lowest level since 2007  The deficit peaked at  1 4 trillion in 2009   Nevertheless  Michael A  Peterson  president of a  1 billion foundation set up in 2008 by his father Peter G  Peterson and devoted to fiscal reform  warns that the long term federal fiscal picture is still dire and vows to fight on   The budget is not front and center right now  and there s not a lot of political will in Washington to solve it right now  but I don t think that means that there s a view that this challenge isn t still a major issue   he told Reuters   We still have a very significant long term debt problem   Increased tax revenues on a strengthening economy  modest budget restraint imposed since 2011  and sharply reduced spending on foreign wars have all helped bring the deficit down  Still  the CBO projected that the public s holdings of U S  federal debt   the accumulation of years of deficits   is projected to hit  13 2 trillion this year  up from  12 8 trillion last year  and to rise above  20 trillion by 2025   Related graphics   and   PETERSONS UNDETERRED  Pete  Peterson  89  co founded The Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group  a major financial firm  in 1985 after serving in the 1970s as U S  secretary of commerce  He set up the Peter G  Peterson Foundation to address  key fiscal challenges threatening America s future and to accelerate action on them   Since 2009  the foundation has given  7 6 million to an anti deficit group called the Concord Coalition  and  6 million to another group  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  These groups were founded in the 1980s and 1990s to advocate for  responsible  fiscal policy  By issuing studies  holding conferences and offering up experts for public appearances  they campaign against deficits and the debt  They help shape a fiscal debate that still flares sometimes   Budget conflict is expected to return to Congress in the coming months when the federal debt ceiling is reached again  with conservative Republicans expected to make demands and perhaps issue shut down threats around it  The foundation will continue to fund the deficit hawk groups  said Michael  Peter s 45 year old son    There s still an enormous challenge   he said  Reuters asked to speak with Peter Peterson  but the foundation responded by offering his son for an interview  The Petersons  who advocate for a balanced budget through increased revenue and spending cuts  say the rising debt burden is a threat to the U S  standing in the world and to future generations of Americans  DEFICIT CONCERN SLIPS A Pew Research Center poll this year found that 64 percent of respondents called the deficit a top public policy priority  down eight percentage points since 2013  Resolve over the deficit and the debt has slipped in Congress  too  Earlier this year  lawmakers set aside cuts in Medicare reimbursements for doctors  though the CBO said this would add  141 billion to the U S  debt in the next decade  With big budget decisions ahead in September and October  advocates of more defense and domestic spending are clamoring to exceed budget caps imposed by a law passed in 2011  when anti deficit worry was high  under a rule known as the sequester  Steve Bell  senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center  a think tank that also has received money from the Peterson Foundation  complained of  complacency  among policymakers on the debt and deficits   It is unfortunate that of the nearly two dozen

NEW YORK  Reuters    Chevron Corp  N CVX  has been searching for up to  1 5 billion of equity investment to help develop its Duvernay shale formation assets in Canada and contacted potential investors including private equity firms  according to people familiar with the matter 
Chevron s subsidiary  Chevron Canada Limited  has exploration leases for approximately 330 000 net acres  1 335 square km  in the Duvernay shale formation  The area is located about 124 miles  200 km  northwest of Edmonton  Alberta 
The San Ramon  California based oil and gas company has sent an offering memorandum to potential investors over the summer  said the people  who asked not to be named because the discussions were private 
Because oil and gas developments take many years to generate a return for their investors  Chevron was looking for an equity investor with a long term investment horizon  the people said 
A representative for Chevron declined to comment 
Chevron announced in October that its initial exploration of the Kaybob area of the Duvernay shall formation was complete  At the time  the company said the next step was transitioning to a two rig drilling program to optimize well and completion design 
A potential equity injection would help Chevron diffuse the development risk for the next phase of the project  Chevron commenced an exploration program in the Duvernay in 2011 and  as of August 2014  had drilled 15 wells  completed 13 using multi stage hydraulic fracturing  and tied in 10 wells to existing third party processing facilities  Hydraulic fracturing is more expensive than traditional extraction methods 
Some private equity firms had looked at the opportunity to provide an equity investment into the Duvernay project  but may not ultimately partner with Chevron because of the long investment horizon  according to the people familiar with the matter 
Chevron has recently bulked up its acreage in the Duvernay by 20 percent  In August  the company purchased the interests of Alta Energy Luxembourg  which had nearly 68 000 acres  New York based private equity firm Blackstone Group LP  N BX  was an investor in Alta Energy 

Other lease owners in the Duvernay shale formation include Penn West Petroleum Ltd  TO PWT   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  L RDSa  and Athabasca Oil Corp  TO ATH

188915,410431,BX,Exclusive  SEC probing private equity performance figures   sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis  NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission is examining how private equity firms report a key metric of their past performance when they market new funds to investors  as the regulator boosts its scrutiny of the industry  according to people familiar with the matter   At issue is how private equity firms report how they calculate average net returns in past funds in their marketing materials  the sources said   Net returns  also known as the net internal rate of return  IRR  and an indicator of investors  actual profits  deduct private equity fund investors  fees and expenses from a fund s gross profits  Private equity fees are not standard and different investors in the same fund can pay different fees    Fund investors such as pension funds  insurance companies and wealthy individuals   known as limited partners   pay the fees to the private equity firm  The private equity firm and its managers  called general partners  also typically invest some of their own money into the funds  but don t pay any fees     Including the general partner s money in the average net returns can inflate the fund s average net performance figure  and the SEC is investigating whether private equity fund managers properly disclose whether they are doing that or not  the sources said    An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment    The SEC s focus on the average net IRR disclosures  which has not been previously reported  marks a new phase in the agency s efforts to regulate private equity and comes at a time when the industry is already under pressure from investors to simplify its fees and expenses structure    The emphasis on performance figures is likely to cause many buyout firms to review their regulatory compliance measures and force them to increase disclosures and make their numbers more intelligible to investors There is no standard practice for calculating average net IRRs among the roughly 3 300 private equity firms headquartered in the United States    A Reuters review of regulatory filings and interviews with people familiar with different firms  practices show the calculation varies widely even among the top private equity firms    Blackstone Group LP  Carlyle Group LP and Bain Capital LLC  for example  do not include money that comes from general partners in average net IRR calculations  while Apollo Global Management LLC does  the review shows    Fund marketing documents are not public  but the sources said all these firms disclose to investors whether they include general partner capital in the calculation or not    The SEC s review comes after the agency put together a dedicated group earlier this year to examine private equity and hedge funds that had to register with it as part of the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform law  Reuters first reported in April   Much of the SEC s focus so far had been on fees that private equity funds charge  In a May 6 speech  Andrew J  Bowden  director of the SEC s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations  said more than half of the private equity funds the agency examined had inappropriately allocated expenses and collected fees       COMPLEX CALCULATION  The average net IRR figure is crucial to investors  understanding of their actual profits from private equity funds  That s because not all investors in a fund pay the same amount of fees to the private equity firm for managing their money   Typically  fund managers charge a management fee of about 1 5 percent of committed capital and take 20 percent of the fund s profits assuming performance meets a returns hurdle agreed with investors    Investors  however  are usually offered fee breaks if  for example  they commit money early during the fundraising process or if they make a larger allocation to the fund    The SEC expects private equity firms to report average net IRRs alongside gross IRRs with equal prominence in marketing materials when they are seeking to raise a new fund    Industry sources said including general partner capital in the average net IRR calculation can make a material difference if that commitment is sizeable   
 Over the past five years  some general partners have started to invest more of their personal capital into their vehicles on a non fee basis and that obviously can create some IRR distortion   said David Fann  chief executive officer of TorreyCove Capital Partners LLC  a private equity advisory firm      Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York  Editing by Paritosh Bansal and John Pickering ",2014-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-sec-probing-private-equity-performance-figures---sources-314598,314598
188917,410433,BX,Exclusive  Blackstone chases Buffett with  core  private equity,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis NEW YORK  Reuters    Blackstone Group LP has reached out to its biggest fund investors about investing in a new investment vehicle with a longer investment horizon than the typical 10 year private equity fund  according to people familiar with the matter 
Dubbed  core  private equity  this vehicle would invest in slower growing but safer companies  use less debt in buyouts and charge investors lower fees than most private equity funds  these people said  Blackstone is seeking as much as  2 billion apiece from five to six of its biggest public pension fund and sovereign wealth fund investors for the strategy  the people said 
    Aspects of the strategy  including the exact fees and holding periods for investments  are still being worked out  these people said  They added that the idea is still at an exploratory stage and may not take off 
    A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment  The biggest investors in Blackstone s funds include the California Public Employees  Retirement System  the New Jersey State Investment Council and China Investment Corp 
    The move underscores how Blackstone is looking to boost its valuation as a publicly listed company by managing more permanent capital and further diversifying its model of buying and selling companies  Blackstone is already the world s largest alternative asset manager  with  284 4 billion in assets under management as of the end of September spanning private equity  real estate  credit and funds of hedge funds 
A higher stock valuation would benefit Blackstone shareholders  of whom the company s employees form the largest group  Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman is the biggest holder by far  owning about a fifth of the firm  In 2013  Schwarzman collected  352 5 million from dividends from his Blackstone shares 
    The new strategy also would help Blackstone address what has been a frustration for some buyout firms and a source of envy when they compare their investment vehicles with Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  In this vehicle  Blackstone would not be forced to sell successful companies too soon because the fund is running out of time 
Most private equity investors however  also known as limited partners  prefer the traditional buyouts because they deliver high annualized returns  The prospect of lower returns may not be an easy sell 
     The fact that investors will pay lower fees is positive  But the question is whether the net returns will still be high enough to justify investing in such a product as opposed to publicly listed stocks   said Steven Kaplan  a University of Chicago finance professor whose research focuses on private equity    
    In June  at Blackstone s annual shareholder meeting  President Tony James acknowledged that the core private equity model would have challenges  Limited partners in its funds would likely say no to the prospect of a 10 percent to 12 percent return for a high quality company when they can get 18 percent to 20 percent for private equity  James said  But he added that there could be ways around that 
    The  core  model approach has already been applied to some alternative asset classes  Core real estate  for example  involves investing in safer  long lease assets with less debt rather than riskier fixer upper properties 
    Blackstone  based in New York  began investing in what it calls core plus real estate this year through separately managed investor accounts before combining them into a co mingled fund 
Blackstone is embarking on its core private equity initiative also through separately managed accounts  the people said 
    A few firms such as General Atlantic LLC and Golden Gate Capital have also raised so called evergreen or perpetual funds to invest in private equity  but they target the higher returns that Blackstone s traditional private equity business does 
    FIRST PITCH
Blackstone  which does not want to abandon its established private equity business  has had to look at a differentiated  core  strategy to avoid conflicts with its traditional private equity funds  the sources said 
    The firm first made its pitch on the new strategy to investors last summer at its annual limited partner summit in a confidential presentation  a copy of which was seen by Reuters 
    Limited partners were told a 20 year core private equity fund could deliver 1 8 times the profit on capital invested in succession over the same period in three conventional private equity funds  The example assumes a 12 percent internal rate of return for a core private equity fund and 20 percent IRR for a traditional fund 
    This is because only up to two thirds of the capital committed to a traditional private equity fund is invested at any one time  limited partners were told  As against that  Blackstone would invest the entire capital raised in a core private equity in one go  The costs of buying and selling companies also add up over time  according to the presentation 
    The popularity of the strategy may come down to the fees investors are charged 
    While these have not been decided  Blackstone in its limited partner presentation offered an example of a core fund that took 15 percent of profits in the form of carried interest  a divergence from the almost universal 20 percent industry standard in private equity

Investment advisor Morningstar  Inc   Nasdaq MORN  noted that renewals on rent leases exceeded their expectations  however  Bloomberg reported Wednesday 
The bonds  the centerpiece of a  480 million offering of a new type of financial product  were marketed by Blackstone and major Wall Street banks late last year  They allow investors to capitalize on Blackstone s ownership of tens of thousands of U S  single family homes  snapped up at bargain foreclosure prices after the financial crisis 

Regulators and lawmakers have worried about the fallout if tenants fail to pay rent or if Blackstone abruptly sells back significant real estate onto the market 
A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment to Bloomberg 
Falling rental rates  as housing supply expands  may factor into the complex mechanics behind the bond  noted finance blog Naked Capitalism 
 The big test for Blackstone will be the first quarter  the peak period for rent renewals in this transaction   noted the blog 
One issue with the bonds involves the different risk levels accepted by investors  If rental income from the homes decline  investors suffer to a greater or lesser degree  depending on their risk appetite and the bond s tranche structure 
 The prices on the riskier tranches which are the first to take the hit if cash flow comes up short fell after the Morningstar news was made public   noted the blog   And that alone could prove fatal to this type of deal  
 Dealers do not want to wind up stuck with the riskiest inventory from securitizations  so the ability to sell these deals is constrained by the ability to place the more speculative tranches
